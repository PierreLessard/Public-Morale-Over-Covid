2021-05-11 21:42,"It is really depressing to see a big country like India just cannot stop virus spreading even though India is a dominant pharmaceutical manufacturing power house. Something must have gone wrong with the Indian government.

Although president Biden released the patent protections, but it doesn't help India to get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. It takes too long to deliver them.

Although China could help India with the Sinopharm vaccines which were approved by WHO last week, but China is under pressure to produce enough vaccines to support and supply other developing countries in SE Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  If WHO further approves Sinovac vaccines in the following week, it could help to reduce pressure relying on Sinopharm vaccines alone.  Maybe India will get some Sinovac vaccines."
2021-05-11 20:58,"No one should be the least bit surprised this is happening in India, or the Indian government's reaction. Typical ruling class reaction."
2021-05-11 21:10,This is just horrible. The responsibility is entirely with their leadership and most of this could have been avoided.
2021-05-11 21:21,Someone please explain to me how in this time we live in bodies are cast into the rivers of a civilized country.
2021-05-11 21:27,"The sad fact is that India has as yet exported more vaccines then the US and UK combined.

Regarding international help, the Bundeswehr has just installed an oxygen factory near New Dehli producing 400.000 litre/day. They say that currently 40 countries take part in the aid program, though looking at the size of India, it will not be near enough...

Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maledives look pretty bad, too."
2021-05-11 21:39,"This wave is very different from the first wave per first hand accounts from local doctors. First wave did not cause serious illness, only some family members tested positive and children and rural areas were untouched. The current wave affects entire families at the same time, many are presenting with oxygen requirement and many children are sick with lung findings. Prior covid in the first wave and vaccinated people are also getting sick include some deaths. Even US pfizer vaccinated people have been infected and killed by second wave. Must be the new variant. It is only a matter of time before this variant reaches USA and other vaccinated countries.  Take your vacation before this reality hits everybody!"
2021-05-11 21:31,"Its none of my business and I don't know why it makes me so angry and my heart goes out to the poor in India, but how much money does a person really need? It's not the rich persons fault and is the governments fault for not taxing the rich to fund infrastructure and healthcare etc for the vulerable and poor in India.
What am I talking about? I commented previously on this article and made a mistake when typing when I put that a wealthy Indian worth one hundred million (mistake - should read BILLION) flew most of the NZ cricket team back to New Zealand in his private jet. It was probably in their contract that the Indian Cricket Association had to do that but it does raise issues about wealth; one hundred million would still keep that rich billionaire rich, and the difference between one hundred million dollars and one hundred billion dollars could have been government tax to fund self empowerment for the poor citizens of India."
2021-05-11 21:12,"Of course Modi is responsible for this crisis. But Indians overall, especially those belonging to the upper class, are also culpable. For months, even close to a year perhaps the Indian upper class has believed  the myths it helped spread. That Indians have special immunity. That Indians have shown the world how to deal with the pandemic. How India is the largest producer of vaccines in the world and has thus saved the world. The upper class Indian, raised with all the myths about themselves, had come to believe that India is a world power, even as the bulk of the population is poor and suffers from malnutrition. The poor are invisible to the upper class. May be this disaster will finally force the upper class Indian to face reality - the successes of a few academics and IT professionals, businesspersons and cricketers, journalists and beauty pageant winners, - do not really add up to the success of an entire society."
2021-05-11 21:36,"I think people are misunderstanding the impact of Covid spreading to rural India. There, there is no medical system to glut. The people there will barely notice dying of Covid, because they're too busy dying of preventable diseases. Covid threatens us with decline to a survival rate that these people have never been allowed to reach."
2021-05-11 23:21,"Hopefully sympathy turns into action and help for the Indian people, and was glad to see the how to help link in this article so that readers obtain some ideas on how they can do something as individuals instead of just absorbing more bad news."
2021-05-11 23:57,"it seems now that the situation in the Delhi and Mumbai seems improving, the posts on twitter and facebook have also ebbed in intensity and frequency. Who will tweet about the emergency in a small village and hold the worlds attention that people still need help. 
Along with this, smaller countries with less global clout than India - Nepal is one - will they get the same response from the international community. Hardly likely, they don't have the bullhorn of a successful diaspora or the promise of a large economic opportunity at the end of all this."
2021-05-11 20:56,No words
2021-05-11 22:09,"One of the saddest things to see how this amazing country that did so well up until two months back is being ravaged by this virus. Super spreader events, religious gatherings, election rallies, no PSA’s about mask wearing and misinformation about vaccines have resulted in this epic failure. Politicians need to be made accountable. They are the ones who have failed their people."
2021-05-12 0:36,"I am doctor who has been fighting COVID for the last 14 months-an American, who has done alot of work in India. It has broken my heart to see what has happened there- we have sent several boxes of unused/expired PPE to our contacts there to, even in a small way, help alleviate the suffering. This is, in my view, far more productive that the endless critiques.

It is interesting, as always to see Americans criticize. India was vaccinating 3-4 million/day in February and March. They ran out of the raw materials (not intellectual know-how) to produce at a faster pace. Why? Because the US and Europe had export controls on many of the raw materials needed to produce vaccines. Why? Because the US pharmaceutical industry didn't want to lose out on a billion possible doses to be bought by the Indian government from US/European pharma giants rather than a far cheaper and effective alternative. 

This is the real crime here. No pass to the abysmal job of the Indian government- but lets not pass the buck as we always do."
2021-05-12 1:24,Thank you for your continued coverage of the situation in India. It’s infuriating that this disaster has grown to such proportions. And will continue for who knows how long. Please do not stop showing the world what’s happening on the ground until those responsible are held accountable.
2021-05-12 1:29,"On top of all this, I still have a friend who is Indian (living in New York) and has family in India that will not get vaccinated because they believe that their herbs and traditional medicine will keep them healthy.  Others have told me that they are worried that Australia won't let them travel to see relatives if they get the Phizer or Moderna vaccine because the rules may change in the future (but it is just an excuse to say ""no"").  I hope that they look at these images and realize how privileged they are just to be offered the vaccine, and how callus it is to turn down the opportunity.  

You would think that a global pandemic would generate more support for vaccination, but this just shows how hard it is to convince enough of a population to help get rid of a disease.  Polio was so close to eradication before COVID, now I fear it will be another 20 years and countless more children just to get back to where we were in 2019."
2021-05-12 2:55,"The photograph from above showing the burned ground where cremations took place by the river shocked me and tore at my heart. 
After what we have been through here in America, nearly 600,000 deaths and millions so ill, I still cry my eyes out over Covid 19. A dear friend who works in a hospital Covid ICU lost her mother at a rehab facility to Covid because they hid their Covid outbreak. Her mother was there recovering from surgery. 

I had Covid in November 2020 and fortunately, made it through though I’ll never be the same. My baby sister had it at the same time. 
We didn’t need hospitalization or oxygen. 

I cannot comprehend how desperate the people of India are. Who could unless you have been through it? 
Some days when I am very fatigued, I think of India and South America. And I know I am lucky to be alive at 68. And still have my sister who is 60. 
People who refuse Covid 19 vaccinations are completely selfish in not helping to extinguish this virus. 
They should see and read this article."
2021-05-11 23:45,"India is just the beginning. 

This is going to spread to SE Asia and then it will really get out of hand.

CNN International reports that the variant has already entered the Philippines, another country whose response to the virus is questionable at best and irresponsible at worst."
2021-05-12 2:05,"Andhra is not a poorer neighbor to TamilNadu. And Tirupati is not a rural area. The writers, contributor to the report Suhasini Raj doesn’t seem to have an idea about the southern states probably. Why do you even need to compare in the first place? Tamil and Telugu are completely different people. Celebrate the diversity. Chittoor is my home district. We are born and brought up there for twenty five years. We know how things work in India. India is home to many scholars and scientists and very well educated and wise people. If and if you insist to compare by population and what not standards/ statistics the “third world” India is better way better than the “ first world” America. Especially, in vaccine hesitancy too. Not just in being literate and compliant. 
Population and poverty are India’s hindrances but people are the same everywhere ..there’s a share of everything everywhere. If the so called first world America fails in governance and the system itself is totally crashing what right do we have to comment on our land of origin? By 2020 the whole world has seen how America fails too. In everything. At least India is not  a capitalist consumeristic greedy country, it’s the greatest democracy still struggling to work and creates some order in chaos. Compassion please."
2021-05-12 1:21,Heartbreaking. Doctors and nurses have been working beyond the limits of human endurance for more than a year now. Not since Partition in 1947 has India seen so much human suffering.
2021-05-12 0:30,"If we think that this is just India's problem, we need to think again.  This virus is a world problem and we need to help vaccinate the world."
2021-05-12 3:17,"Indian cities are so densely populated, I cannot begin to imagine how individuals would practice social distancing and apply protective hygiene measures in public. 

How can they protect themselves on crowded trains (a primary mode of travel).  It would be impossible."
2021-05-11 22:48,"I notice that weeks into the crisis in India, there still seems to be no significant reporting from rural India.  All we have from the best US source are copies of Indian media reports, some commentary from experts in the cities, and a few anecdotes.

Modi doesn't even have to suppress the facts.  No one cares enough to report them.

Meanwhile, legions of people are paid to pore over every blip in the stock market and every celebrity emoji on twitter, as we obsessively try track shifts in money and reputation.

I do appreciate this article -- thank you.  But it reminds me how little of what's relevant actually gets reported."
2021-05-12 0:12,"What's particularly frustrating as I, as part of the diaspora, see this disaster gather momentum are the following:
*Indian military is one of the largest in the world. Why hasn't a vaccination drive started using such personnel?
* Why aren't state-run enterprises on war-footing to produce oxygen? Give incentives to private companies.
* Cash turnovers to poor and lower-middle income people to tide over the lack of any work. Families are falling off the economic grid.
* Does the Central Vista project worth billions of rupees need to proceed in the face of the worst nationwide disaster since Partition?
* Why aren't hospitals, makeshift, being built instead of the the GOI and states like UP prosecuting those who raise the alarm?
* Indian ingenuity has managed to turn 3-wheelers into jerry-rigged ""ambulances"" to hospitals. Where's the government. 
* Lastly, but not least, where is the accounting for the international aid that is being sent to India? Where are the national coordinators of red zones, etc. Why isn't the PM meeting with the CMs as a body every few days to monitor the progress or trouble spots? If you want to act like a CEO of a well-oiled machine, act like one."
2021-05-12 1:14,"Indian government allocated $2 billion in current budget to build parliamentary building and  PM's residence and put it under essential services category, in the middle of pandemic. That shows the priorities of this administration. They lack empathy"
2021-05-12 1:15,"Comparing the 2 rising giants of Asia, India and China: One has what the other does not: Order and democracy."
2021-05-11 22:30,"Modi and his right wing hindu priority agenda have divided India in the last 7 years. He has consequently become the most powerful head of state since Indira Gandhi in the early 70s - however he has been proven to be a totally incompetent leader. A guy who was built up by marketing but has no substance behind the oratory. 

As a hindu I am sadenned by the hard right turn that the country has taken and fallen into the ditch just like those bodies found floating in the River Ganga"
2021-05-12 2:25,"Mishandling the pandemic was key to Trump’s downfall, perhaps it will be Modi’s too."
2021-05-12 1:15,"I am from India.And the condition of the country is worser than it is shown by the Indian media,as of the rural areas data are not shown properly by them."
2021-05-12 3:12,"The news from India is grim, as confirmed by personal anecdote and the statistics.  

However, there is a lot of misleading information being peddled as relevant fact, by both the Times and other news outlets. 

For example, every article about the outbreak in India mentions election rallies in 5 states and religious gatherings as superspreader events.  

However, the recent outbreaks had started in 4 states - Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab and Chattisgarh - none of whom have had any election rallies and all of whom are at least 1-2 states removed from states which had such rallies.  Karnataka, another state which has seen massive rises in the active caseload, also had no elections. 

The states that did have elections - West Bengal, Tamilnadu are, of course, seeing rising caseloads, but those are in line with the rest of the country.  The same is true for Uttarakhand, the home of the large religious gathering, the Kumbh Mela, which has been the target of many a snide reference as a superspreader event, but this is unsupported by evidence.

Coupled with Dr. Zeynep Tukefci’s article in the Times last weekend suggesting that the outdoors is actually the safest place to be in a pandemic AND the lack of evidence showing that the many Trump rallies were superspreader events, should at the very least inform the reporting on the pandemic. 

India blew it by being negligent and complacent.  But election rallies likely had little to do with it."
2021-05-12 0:51,India largely created the disaster in which it finds itself by allowing huge political rallies and religious festivals.
2021-05-12 0:25,It’s horrible to watch the world’s 5th largest economy turning into a failed state.
2021-05-11 22:50,"Thank you for continued brave reporting. 

It appears Indian Central Government has lost control and now managing message more than crisis. 

Where is this heading?
To so called herd immunity? If that is same as survival of the fittest, India is looking to lose millions of lives.

I would like scientist’s prospective on what happens if Covid continues unchecked."
2021-05-12 1:34,"For that particular country, all this was utterly predictable- for many, many reason."
2021-05-12 1:39,This is what happens when you elect populist governments.
2021-05-12 5:39,"In all the articles about the latest Covid surge, there is no India has actually had the fastest pace of vaccinations of any large country.  India has delivered 175M jabs from a standing start in Feb 2021. All of Feb’s jabs were delivered to frontline and medical workers. Seniors started on March 1, 45-60s on April 1 and 18+ from May 1.  

The US has delivered only 250M or so jabs, starting 3 months earlier than India. That hardly suggests that India’s public health infrastructure is as rickety as people would like to believe.  It can be and should be far far better, but it’s not as miserable as being portrayed. 

Two things have contributed to the chaos today.  The first was the intensity of the mutant strains that are spreading across India.  The country was prepared for a second wave, and would have managed it, albeit with some flailing.  

But the tsunami-like nature of this wave took them by surprise.  For all that, they are fighting back hard - both the Centre and State Govts - and with some success, as Delhi and Maharashthra look to have turned the corner, and several other states are seeing their caseloads plateau.

The vaccination supply strategy has however been botched, as the Govt was slow to place orders, imperiling the rollout. But that too will pass, as supplies will come on board by June. 

Unfortunately and tragically, a couple of 100,000 Indians will have been lost by then to the incompetence of the vaccine ordering plan."
2021-05-12 5:17,"Dr Fauci said, we should treat this virus like being in a war.
I agree, but like to add, we consider this to be a world war.
There should be no victory unless the virus is defeated in every single region in the world."
2021-05-12 6:32,"This is the end result of following a populist civilization called the modern which embraced dams for forests. There is enough knowledge available to show us not to follow the all eggs in one basket approach when the so called only cure- the vaccine is a mirage here and now. We must live in health here and now. Add on war warp speed efforts to treat the not so lucky people with homeopathy is scrupulously avoided because of its success as there is no money in it. ""For wilful men, the injuries they themselves procure are their schoolmasters"". For a multifaceted approach to the pandamic(deliberate spell because the root cause is dams of the world) see Ramaswami Ashok Kumar. 2021. PERFECT DESIGNS. Blogspot."
2021-05-12 8:57,"India's government clearly underestimated the virus and was more interested in looking competent and 'strong' than in actually taking effective measures to control the outbreak. A virus has one simple job: to survive. It doesn't have an ego or an agenda. It just looks for fresh hosts, day in and day out, 24 hours a day. And when given the chance, it will mutate in order to prolong its existence. In a country where people live cheek by jowl, it has perfect conditions in which to replicate itself.

India's government clearly failed to understand this or simply ignored good advice and allowed the country to think that it had escaped relatively unscathed. Now they are facing the terrible consequences. One just hopes that India's government will one day face the consequences of its arrogance and false claims."
2021-05-12 8:31,"When all is said and done, millions of Indians would have perished although the government death count will be conveniently lower, much lower.  This enormous tragedy is the confluence of top-down mismanagement of the highest order and bottom-up apathy and ignorance about the of the virus and its ways.  All I can think of is each of us should do something, however small, to alleviate the awful crisis that has befallen the Indian people."
2021-05-12 5:06,"Had always dreaded that this would happen in India - but never expected such such an arrogant, callous and careless  response from those in power. 
For those affected the suffering is going on and could worsen. Alas no health equity in life and no dignity in death."
2021-05-11 22:45,This is so terrible what is happening in India. We need to help immediate. For the good of India. For the good of world health.
2021-05-12 7:22,"""SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the pandemic, belongs to one of 6,828 named species of virus. Hundreds of thousands more species are known, with perhaps trillions waiting to be found."" -- Welcome to the Virosphere, NYT (March 24, 2020).

It looks like viruses could become a limiting factor on global civilization unless humans can find a way to fend them off collectively. I'm not optimistic..."
2021-05-11 22:50,"I'm an Indian, living in the US, and none of this surprises me. This was a disaster in the making. 

We somehow declared a premature war on COVID, believed the virus won't affect those participating in election rallies, is scared of religious places, and were cocky of having defeated the virus in its first wave (sounds familiar?)

The virus won't go away until a majority of population is immunised, people learn to maintain a social distance, wear mask and self isolate. 

Everything that happened there, and can stop covid from spreading is true for the rest of the world, including the USA! I hope people in India somehow get this under control, and people elsewhere learn from India and act responsibly.

Get that vaccine, wear a mask, wait for that road trip to happen, defer that dining in....or we'd see a similar tragedy unfold here."
2021-05-12 9:05,"Thanks to the policy of deliberate complacency since the beginning of this pandemic there have been large pockets of people who simply don’t believe the threat. Unless they were personally affected people think it’s a hoax or a severe flu.
India was extremely lucky in escaping the first wave relatively unscathed last year (we must understand why), and combined with an incompetent self-serving despot that has resulted in this disaster. But this is not only India’s disaster. 

Today’s NYT piece on the WHO’s announcement that this variant may be more infectious also allows for the possibility that there may be some vaccine escape (data pending). To me this indicates the possibility of an endless cycle of a swinging pandemic - the southern poorer hemisphere gestating new strains that would learn to escape the vaccinated north and cause new waves, until the whole thing gets attenuated over probably years and years. Hoax? Just the flu? Personal accounts from my own indian friends and family have made it amply clear that this thing gets into you - no matter how healthy, young or rich - and chokes the life out of you. Perfectly healthy people in their thirties are dropping like flies all over India. It is different from what we saw in the north. This could be us, if not in this strain then the next one.

The only way out is to vaccinate everyone at the same time. Lock down everyone at the same time to isolate the strains and stop them evolving. We humans will never manage to win."
2021-05-12 2:01,"Private hospitals for richer patients are gouging patients excessively. This has been exposed in newspapers in India.
Ambulances have been charging $500 for 7km (5miles) ride from home to hospital. The state hospitals and clinics are pathetic because of decades of corruption. Poor people are out in the cold. Rich people are competing with other rich people to get beds in the private hospitals, thus corruption and bumping patients out."
2021-05-11 22:23,India is its own worst enemy. Too many people occupying too little land. Poor health practices across the entire nation. Little or no social distancing or mask wearing. Ongoing large social gatherings such as weddings and religious ceremonies. And a federal government that is in denial and unable to respond to the crisis. A clear breakdown of responsibility from top to bottom of Indian society.
2021-05-12 1:05,"What is going on in India should not surprise anybody. It is a tragedy beyond measure that could have been avoided.   When you have a Prime Minister who is a Hindu nationalist, ￼holds massive rallies for his reelection purposes, Coupled with the world’s largest religious gathering￼, you have a country that could very well go over the precipice.  ￼
Blame serves absolutely no purpose at this point.  Lockdowns, vaccines, masks, and sound leader ship is what matters most at present.￼"
2021-05-12 6:04,"Understandably, the article paints a grim picture of the situation in India. But there are some bright spots that have gone unnoticed. Mumbai, a city of 12.5 million, has bucked the Indian trend. Since my arrival here on April 9, I have seen infection cases drop every day from 11,000+ on April 4 to 1,717 yesterday. The positivity rate has fallen to 6% to India's average of 23%. There are no alarming pictures of lack of hospital beds or oxygen or of funeral pyres burning across the city. 
Mumbai’s success are due to (i) a highly decentralized response starting at the ward level; (ii) the municipality not disbanding its covid infrastructure when the federal government was declaring premature victory over the pandemic; instead it ramped up the facilities during the second wave; (iii) the city has relatively better equipped public hospitals; and (iv) Mumbaikars, generally, have been following social protocols better than other cities. 
Yesterday, my fully-vaccinated brother woke up with high fever and an upset stomach. Out of concern for our 90-year-old mother we called for a RT-PCR test. A technician in full PPE gear came within two hours and took a nasal swab from my brother who had been isolated. In less than 24 hours, we got the result (covid negative) and we breathed a sigh of relief! I can’t imagine this level of efficiency in other parts of India.
I suggest NYT look into the “Mumbai Model” so others can learn from the city’s rich experience. I would be happy to help!"
2021-05-12 0:17,"And meanwhile, India has a homegrown covid vaccine, Covaxin, which is quite effective, and of which the government of India has given exclusive license to Bharat Biotech, an Indian company. And yet they need American intellectual property to save their country? Please."
2021-05-12 6:28,"Meanwhile a sitting MP runs a sting operation on a covid war room in the silicon valley of india bangalore, reads the muslim employees names hoping to stir the minority hate tactic  saying they allocated beds based on money and corruption , eventually the sting operation hit himself and now backed off. The UP government is in total denial of the facts (most populous) and so is the prime minister. It is this arrogance that lead the people to doom.With so many FCRA bans on donations ( Modi and his bhakts assume, NGO's are in india only for religious conversions), even NGO's cant deploy their relief materials properly. Such an authoritarian regime where the UP government was mostly concentrating on setting up banks for COWS roaming in the streets and not for improving health care for humans.All make in india proclaims cannot even get a single oxygen cylinder and oxygen concentrators and relief is pouring in from the international community."
2021-05-11 21:11,I am unable to comprehend the devastation and loss...
2021-05-12 9:52,"The biggest problem is that India's healthcare infrastructure is totally inadequate. Before the pandemic, it was struggling and now it has broken down. The staff is overworked and tired. There are shortages of all kinds. In the cities and towns, at least there are hospitals and clinics but in the far-flung villages, there is no medical support to speak of. 

What foreign countries must look into is donating mobile medical units that can go into villages, where the virus is spreading the fastest, and help the helpless villagers."
2021-05-12 10:01,"At least, see the other side. Mass environmental degradation by human activity and greed. And now nature has had enough. It has unleashed the dogs of war in the form of this virus and its variant cousin. It will keep mutating and will remain ever so elusive because it is invisible. Keep dreaming of things getting back to normal."
2021-05-12 9:26,"Modi's discourse has long been 'we're the best, we invented everything, the only reason we're not the greatest world power is because the Muslims are holding us back'. Well, though I normally have no time for the Saudi regime, I can't help but notice how it has protected its own during the Hajj this year, and contrast that with the execrable behaviour of the powerful Hindu priesthood - a major power base for Modi - sacrificing their own in order to make tens of millions off the Kumbh Mela, which wasn't even really due until 2022!  

Yes, the vaccine rollout is dependent on material from the rich world which has kept it to itself and is therefore partly responsible for the slow pace of vaccination in India. But the government of India was fully aware of this issue, and of how few Indians have been vaccinated. The complete lack of anti-Covid protection during the Kumbh Mela (which attracts millions of people from all over India) and the equally unprotected multiple electoral phases in West Bengal are entirely Modi's fault, compounded by the lack of preparation. 

The fact is, his divisive, strident Hindutva ideology is a scourge upon the great multiracial, multilingual, pluralist state that is India. I hope that at least people can see now that they are disposable in the eyes of the government that promised them so much."
2021-05-12 10:19,"Why couldn't India learn from the devastating lessons of other countries such as UK, Italy, USA, Brazil and others? Complacency and/or premature victory? Sad !"
2021-05-12 10:54,"This is what happens when you let the supposed Farmer Protest block the streets of Dehli for months with tent cities. Somehow the Left doesn't mention the Farmer Protests, which they hyped just a few months ago as the world's largest protest. It was the UK variant that broke lose in the states of Punjab and Haryana first, then to Delhi, then Mumbai started getting sick. The media however repeats lies that somehow Bengal or the Kumbh were where it began, it's like saying a NY political rally or church caused California's outbreak."
2021-05-12 13:23,I was unable to find any reference to the true covid mortality rate in India. It is difficult to evaluate the extent of the problem without that.
2021-05-12 13:35,"A truly dreadful spectacle, entirely man made and preventable tragedy. Mr. Modi is the modern day Nero with his entire country engulfed in the flames of COVID 19. He squandered away the time gained after the first shutdown and did not prepare for the inevitable 2nd wave as his medical experts had predicted. Arrogance, bravado, exceptionalism and hubris of a leader who has a cult like following. It will be interesting to see how things progress for Mr. Modi, there will be the cult worshipers who will still continue to support him, even if their family members and friends succumb to his epic mismanagement of the pandemic, but surely his image will be dented. The one thing Mr. Modi cares more than anything, is his image, evidenced by the active policing on social media for anything critical of ""dear leader"". The current fiasco is a million times worse than the previous fiasco Mr. Modi is well known for, the Gujrat pogrom of Muslims. That past episode provided ample evidence on what to expect when a ""merchant of death"" is selected to high office, you get death on a national scale and here Mr. Modi has delivered spectacularly!"
2021-05-12 16:02,"The officially declared Corona number in India for the last 21 days straight is more than 3500 but unofficially it is 10 times greater based on the cremation and burial records and bodies floating in the rivers, abandoned on the streets, farms and footpaths. Many of those have been died due to non available of oxygen, medicines, ventilators, hospital beds and transportation. Many deaths were tragic and inhumane. 
The Modi government and his deputies did not take adequate action to provide basic medical services to the patients. rather they tried their best to hide and diminish the real number of patients and deaths. More over there are several incidents; the police has jailed several volunteers who were helping the patients providing vital services only to hide their negligence and failure. Does this total failure, negligence, incompetence and laziness on the part of Modi Government warrants a high level fact finding Commission to inquire and furnish report to the President for further action or this can be considered ""Crimes Against Humanity"" for further inquiry and action by the U N Human Rights Commission?"
2021-05-12 15:34,"Humanitarian concern and aid for Indians must be accompanied by explicit and loudly expressed outrage at the Modi government. This is 100 percent on them, despite their zealous efforts to pass the buck and manage public perceptions at home and abroad. They must pay a political price, and perhaps we are already seeing signs of that in the results from West Bengal. Meanwhile, god help India."
2021-05-12 21:30,"When will the International Community of Nations condemn Modi for this Outbreak.  Modi called for Rallies and claimed he could only see people, something we know about from the Trump Rallies. He also allowed the Religious Festivals to continue. Furthermore, he deemed India a success against Covid and started exporting Vaccines.  Modi is India's Trump."
2021-05-13 1:25,"Narendra Modi. We need a letter ""U"" to anagram his name into murderer. Maybe Trump can supply one from his bankrupted university, the extra ""E"" is appreciated. 
With over a billion people sending money over there probably will do very little. You have no idea where the money ends up. 
Forget about peacekeeping, what good is the UN or the WHO is they can't even deliver oxygen to places where people are dying for the lack of it? Think about it."
2021-05-13 1:54,"Just watched a report by an Indian blogger called Manu on YouTube. He reported his uncle living in a rural village just died from covid-19. When his younger brother went to the village to participate in the funeral, he found nobody wearing a mask, and lots of people gathering to send off the dead. His uncle got the first shot of the vaccine but perhaps too late. There is no hospital in the area, and he said the local doctors have no medicine that can help the sick. Besides, the doctors themselves in these places don't know enough about covid-19. It is a very sad and helpless description of the situation. The net is more Indians will get infected and die. With such a large population living in poverty, not much can be done for all. Quite depressing. Nature has to run its course."
2021-05-13 20:26,"India’s biggest problem is self-inflicted: in February, after they were already proven safe and effective and launched in the U.S., India denied authorization for the BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.  The Indian vaccine shortage is due to their vaccine nationalism, their refusal to approve these German and US-developed vaccines."
2021-05-14 10:34,"I am in Mumbai at the moment so can speak from personal experience. 
Here is what happened pretty much across the country: 
1. Country shut down beginning of pandemic ~ 3 months. This was controversial in itself. 
2. Case count was low, which was manageable 
3. Meanwhile, makeshift beds, some infrastructure was set up in anticipation of the spread 
4. Slowly, economic activity increased - open stores, theatres, even weddings , public transport. There were still restrictions in place. 
5. Around early this year, almost everything opened , in addition major events - farmer’s activism rallies, kumbh mela, political rallies were all a go. All and any public transport was opened up. Makeshift beds, infrastructure  etc. was dismantled in a false narrative that the war against covid is won. ( it’s back up now in cities, rural I don’t know ) 
6. Meanwhile Vaccination campaign was slow and spotty at best. Now it’s extremely slow. It is about to pick up though and needs to pick up. 
7. With the mutant, this was a setting for a perfect storm. The system just about collapsed. 
Not to mention lack of meds, O2 cylinders. 
Having said that Mumbai is still much better than rest of the country. The doctors and nurses at government hospitals are giving it their best. They are able to save many patients who were able to make to the hospital on time 
A shout out to Cooper hospital, Juhu. They saved my mother’s life. She is out of Covid but recovery is a long way."

2021-05-06 19:37,"Of course families would prefer home health care, but few of us can afford it. Medicare caps home care at 28 hours/week, which isn’t much help for those of us who work full time. If you can’t supplement those 28 hours out-of-pocket, then a nursing home is the only option.  My MIL hoped that her modest savings would help pay for her grandchildren’s education, but instead we’ve exhausted it trying to keep her out of the local SNFs that look more like warehouses than homes."
2021-05-06 19:38,"For profit corporations have bought our many of the not for profit options in long term care of our elderly, whether home care, assisted living or skilled nursing. The single largest expense component of all of the above is staffing. The easiest way to cut costs and increase profits is to cut staffing and benefits. Increasing #'s of the residents are dependent on Medicaid to pay for their care and the reimbursement is not sufficient to cover costs. The results should be readily apparent to anyone with critical thinking skills. I know. I have worked in the industry for the past 2 decades. Aging in place has been my primary focus for myself since my 40's. i do not want to be old, poor and in a long term care facility."

2021-05-06 19:54,"Options?  I don't really have any because I'm poor.  I just hope I'm gone before any hard decisions need to be made.  I'd love a little ADA apartment with my daughter or a nonprofit care facility filled with plants and animals and compassionate, well-paid staff, but that's not going to happen.  This is America, after all."
2021-05-06 20:04,I spend a week each month with my mother so she can remain in her home and my sister's family does the same.  Options for stay-at-home assistance are practically nil in the less affluent exurb where my mother lives.  Our getting on a plane during Covid to take care of our mother is proof of the non-existent infrastructure for seniors to stay at home.
2021-05-06 20:08,"Notwithstanding the COVID 19 pandemic, nursing homes and yes CCRCs / assisted living facilities have become warehouses. Pre-pandemic, my mother spent 6 days in an assisted living facility. It should have been called a ""beg for assistance"" facility. For the money she was paying, in home 24/7 care was the way to go.  In home care was a bit more costly, but given the reality of her life expectancy the cumulative difference was not exorbitant. She was much happier in her condominium where there were ""young people"" (in their 60s :) who would drop in. 

No matter how old you are, you are still the child. My mother refused care from me, bathing feeding etc. as that's what she did for me as a child. But, she was always happy to have her care givers help her. We were fortunate to have kind, competent and caring people take care of my mother. 

Taking care of elderly parents is not easy. There is a demand for care givers in either model: institutional or in-home. 

Nursing homes, assisted living and CCRCs are competing with the in-home model. As we live longer and there is a baby boomer bubble to come, the strain on resources will on become greater."
2021-05-06 20:22,"Why don't we come up with a program within Medicare where caregivers for the elderly are paid a living wage?  Medicare can pay them, run a system of trained caregivers, supervisors, etc., etc. Rather than pumping Medicaid & Medicare money so quickly into profit focussed/ cost cutting nursing homes  (non-profit nursing homes are already often recognized as being superior to the for-profit ones), create some system sort of like magnet school vouchers, or some other way to give more options for families to realistically keep their elderly at home with paid, trained help.  Taxing the super rich is one way to help fund such a program.  Would create jobs and address the problem. I have learned that it takes at least 4 people to provide 1 person with moderate Alzheimer's Disease the 24 hour per day care she needs...."
2021-05-06 20:35,"I have taken care of my elderly mother for the last 4 years, which has become a ull-time job for the last two. I was forced to stop my career, sell my co-op, move into her apartment and take care of her. Needless to say this is a gargantuan hardship for both of us financially, and for me emotionally. But even with a long-term care plan, there is not enough money for full-time care at home. Biden proposes giving Medicaid a huge expansion here, but why not pay for Medicare patients to have full-time care at home as well? It seems that if you're poor the government will step in but if your middle class you're completely on your own. yes, it would be nice if I got paid something to do this full-time work, but I would forgo that if I only knew that my mother would have full-time, round the clock care. I agree that the poor should not be overlooked here, but that is exactly what his proposal does. this could easily be accomplished financially if only our countrymen would wake up to the fact that we don't have to spend nearly as much on our military to be extremely safe, and that some of that money could easily ensure that somebody's mother, grandmother, or eventually themself, would not have to worry if they will be able to stay in their home when they are old."
2021-05-06 20:44,"The linked article indicates that a single infected worker can infect dozens and kill multiple people in a nursing home.

That includes previously vaccinated elderly. As the article points out, the vaccine provides  a higher level of protection for younger workers than elderly residents.

We need to make vaccination mandatory for nursing home employees. Workers fear side effects? Residents and their families fear isolation and death."
2021-05-06 20:50,"My 89 year old father fell and broke his back last fall. The hospital wanted to send him to skilled nursing on discharge but he and my 87 year old mother were afraid of Covid. So he went home, where, without any kind of home care save for that provided by my mother, he rapidly declined. His death was caused by Covid as surely as if he'd contracted the disease but it was also caused by the lack of home care available to my parents. They had too many assets to qualify for help under Medicaid and not enough, they felt, to hire their own help. The support provided under Medicare is laughable. They were also opposed to having strangers in their home. Perfect storm. There was no way my father could have survived these factors once they'd all been tangled together. All I can say is, there has got to be a better way."
2021-05-06 20:57,"It is a false premise that Medicare pays for in home care - Medicare really only pays for Nursing Care.  What happens to our elderly that need care, but do not need skilled nursing?  My mother (who is 80, has dementia and uses a wheelchair) and my Dad (who is 81 and showing signs of dementia) really should have an in home caregiver,  full time.  Right now, we are paying out of pocket for 4 hours a day, 6 days a week.  That costs about $3740 a month.  It is not sustainable. 

My Dad doesn't want to go to Assisted Living - they have seen the quality provided there and want nothing to do with it. As Boomers get older they are going to stress the system and some reforms need to be done."

This is not bizarre, surprising, or unexpected- yet we humans seem caught off caught by it.  Why? We each - except in the thankfully rare instances of early injury/debility - can/should plan ahead for what we ALL will likely need in our later years.  Please, let’s stop pretending that old age/debility is surprising. It’s absurd and makes us sound like right- wingers who deny climate change."

Biden proposes to fix long-term care for elders and the disabled in his recent Infrastructure/Jobs bill by investing in Medicaid, giving the states responsibility to administer the funds.  But perhaps -- to ensure that all citizens are covered equably -- we should go back to President Johnson's original proposal to make long-term care a part of Medicare, and funded like Medicare by a payroll tax.   The long-term benefit to society -- all of us -- would more than make up for the tax deductions.

     My mom died two years ago in California. She had, among other problems, cognitive dementia. In the last couple of months of her life she couldn't be safely left at home for any length of time. 
      We looked all over the state and couldn't find a facility that would accept Medicaid and take my mom in. They were all holding out for private pay (13,000 dollars per month)  and short term Medicare patients.
 Medicaid allotted about 65 hours of in-home support care per month.  I had almost used up my 12 weeks of Family Medical Leave and most of my paid time off and asked her social worker what we should do. She said, ""sometimes it takes a catastrophe."""
2021-05-06 21:11,"My parent spent almost ten years in the health center of a reputable, private, in many ways posh CCRC, many of them in the dementia unit. What I saw during that time was appalling. Some highlights: 

He was active and in good health so he liked to walk around the ""memory"" unit, go in and out of other rooms, which was supposed to be acceptable. This began to annoy the aides, who decided he would now sit all day in a chair he could not rise from. So he lost his ability to walk. 

He would become angry when his clothes were removed and finally hit an aide, so he was put on Seroquel, an anti-epileptic used as crowd-control in these units. But first they called the police to the unit and threatened us with removing him to a psychiatric hospital.

No one brushed his teeth. I cannot imagine the pain he endured as they rotted and fell out. One of our enquiries about dental work was answered, ""Well, how long do you think he is going to live????"" - He lived five more years.

He only lasted so many years in care because a family member visited several times a day to feed him and keep him company. Covid of course put an end to this. When the CDC (summer' 20?)finally authorized visits by a caretaker for persons in his state, the CCRC refused to comply and we only finally gained access to him after a huge and complex quasi-legal process, and then only once every fortnight. 

Even the ""nice"", expensive places are inhumane. Please don't do this to your loved one."

I am a single breadwinner.  I make great money but even at $25/hour for 40 hours a week of care that is $50k+ per year.  So I pay, I drive a 1995 beater car, I still get no sleep, and can barely keep my job.

Move her into a facility?  Tried that.  It lasted 4 days.  Other residents were allowed to defecate in my mom's room, steal all her things, and two different men tried to climb into bed with her.  She was terrified.  At the ""best"" facility in the county with an $8k/month price tag.

We are of course concerned about our near futures in these care facilities with their exorbitant fees. But I am more concerned about our children. Those currently  35 to 50 years old, who could meet a worse fate in there old age then most of us have witnessed in the last 80 years. This age group are still paying-off college debt, working two or three jobs. The wages have been so low for the last 25 years many do not own homes or have savings accounts. Grandparents serve as day-care. Many, MANY of these families have zero saved for retirement and Republicans want to end Social Security and reduce Medicare. I am concerned a majority of our country's 35 to 50 year old population will enter into old age poor, with well below quality elder care available to them."
2021-05-06 21:49,"Skimming this article, I don't see any mention of adult day centers. These might serve as important resources for a large group of seniors who want to/ are able to stay in their homes yet require some assistance during the day, when family members are at work or otherwise occupied. There is likely a sizable group of seniors that fall into this category.  Day centers also promote socialization and decrease isolation compared to seniors cared for at home. For caregivers, they provide a welcomed respite and - even if a person needs nursing home care - may delay it. 

The overall cost of adult day care is less than that nursing homes and 8-hour personal in-home care yet currently, most gov't funding does not cover it.  People often have to pay for it out-of-pocket. Thus, there are less of them compared to nursing homes although many have long wait lists. 

Elder care is in shambles in the US. Seniors and their families don't have much help from the government. Care is only available for the very poor or for very short periods and the main option - full nursing home care - is an extreme. Why not put more funding into solutions that work for patients, families, society, and taxpayers?

(In contrast, my elderly aunt went to adult day care in Canada for years, funded by the government. Every weekday AM, my cousins would help her get dressed and the bus would pick her up. At the end of the afternoon, the bus would drop her off. My social aunt loved it. )"
2021-05-06 21:52,So many of the situations I read about in this context involve people that have children or other family available and willing to make other than nursing home arrangements. People who have no children or other family are really out of luck when the hospital discharge planner gives them a few hours to figure out where they are going next. Best to have a plan to end one’s life before even getting into this catastrophic situation. And that’s real.

People don’t realize that 1) if you need round the clock care, you can’t just “get in” to the “good” nursing facilities - they have waitlists and 2) under duress is a horrible time to make these decisions. You’re healthy and able to take care of yourself or a partner - until you’re not.
No one likes to talk about it but advance planning is so crucial to help manage the heartache and hardship that comes with the realities of adult care in the US."

2021-05-06 22:05,"My 78 year old dad fell last May and broke his neck. We could not see him for weeks due to Covid, and could not even talk with him because he was on a respirator and heavily medicated. After months of hospitalization, he was quadriplegic and had a tracheostomy but we brought him home. Financially, he had set everything up for my mom to be taken care of, but she died unexpectedly right before Covid. We had money to care for him, but the system isn’t set up for that. We hired a national company to provide daily nursing care, but the care from them was atrocious. They kept refusing to do the nursing care he needed because they were afraid of liability. They let his tubing get visibly moldy because I didn’t know enough to tell them to change it.  They no-showed, came late, left early, etc.  Then his pulmonologist dropped him after 20 years because her office wasn’t really wheelchair accessible. He did not have a urologist, and we couldn’t find one to accept him as a patient. To get a custom wheelchair takes a long time (5  months) from Medicaid, and the company that was contracted to make one gave him a lemon that he couldn’t drive. Everything about the system is set up to put people in nursing homes and keep them there. We hired a medical advocate (MD) to try to help us manage the red tape. Thank God we found a young man from Ghana to provide live in care so my dad had a few months at home before he died. Also fantastic were the visiting nurses, but terribly overextended."

My wife feeds me and is my caregiver. Without her I’d be in a nursing home. It’s a crappy situation for us but it could be worse for me if forced to go into a nursing home."
2021-05-06 22:05,"A few years ago, when my Mom started to show signs of dementia and my Dad’s hear condition worsened, my two siblings and I decided that we would help them age in place. At first that meant more frequent, scheduled visits after the classic sun downing time of 4pm. After a few years, we started getting private pay home health two hours a day, every other day.

They both got Covid at Thanksgiving. It nearly killed Dad and now he is in Hospice care at home. It exacerbated my Mom’s dementia by an order of magnitude. So we layered on 8 hours of private duty nursing a few months ago, in addition to taking turns living at their house.

OK, so where do we find ourselves today? My Mom doesn’t know she’s in her own house, and my Dad will stay in bed all day to escape her incessant nagging. This week I heard a noise in the kitchen while I was working in the back bedroom and came out to see my Mom trying to open a can by stabbing it with a knife. Also this week, she tried to turn the microwave light off by turning on the burners on the stove.

So let me tell all the folks out there that think they can keep their parents at home that a nursing home is in their future. You may not want it. You may be able to postpone it. But it is coming.

Thanks God we have plenty of money, so we could afford the private duty nurses. And we can afford a real memory care facility, and not a place that just flips them once a day with a spatula.

But folks without cash are screwed.

2021-05-06 22:10,"The long-term care insurance paid into by many CA state employees can be used for in-home care as well.

If you can care for your elderly parents at home, seriously consider doing so. Assisted living facilities very often involve significant loneliness and the care provided frequently falls short, leaving residents at risk.

Your parents cared for you when you were young and vulnerable. Consider returning the favor, if possible."
2021-05-06 22:11,"What happened to so many residents at nursing homes during the pandemic scared the heck out of me, so much so, my husband and I had and continue to have many serious discussions about if the situation ever presented itself where one or both of us may be regulated to a nursing home care facility.

We keep thinking about his mother who ended up with Parkinson.  She could not speak nor walk but was still sharper than a tack.  She was incredibly miserable and we lived 2000 miles away.  It was a rotten situation.

We continue to have discussions about the ""what if"" scenarios.  In many ways, it's one thing to make broad stroke plans for various scenarios, but in the end, it's difficult to also plan not knowing what will happen down the road.

It's a stressful and weird pressure to worry about the unknown.  The one thing my husband told me that will always melt my heart is if I should get dementia and end up in a nursing home, he would come and spend every day with me, even if I didn't know who he was.  He said ""you're my partner in life.  My existence would be empty without you in it, on any level.""

Thank you for addressing this issue NYT.  More stories like this would be most helpful and appreciated."
2021-05-06 22:12,"In my recent experience, two factors are often neglected in the decision about the elderly ""staying in their home.""  The first is loneliness and isolation.  Especially in the last year where so many seniors have been locked up in their homes.  Even without visitors, a senior facility may provide more interaction than living alone, with or without a home care worker.  Loneliness is a terrible thing and too many of our seniors live with it out of a desire to maintain autonomy.

The second factor is the hardship home care can pose for an aging spouse who is faced with caring for someone who may be ill, demented or even violent.  Home care workers typically only spend a few hours a day with the patient leaving the care-taking spouse in a very stressful situation they may be unable to handle.  

I'm not saying that nursing facilities are always the answer but staying at home can have pose difficulties as well.  Children and parents need to be sure they consider all the angles when making decisions."

2021-05-06 22:32,"There is an order of nuns called The Little Sisters of the Poor.  They own and operate nursing homes throughout the world.  Their mission is to care for the elderly poor.  If all nursing homes were run like one of theirs, this world would be a much better place.  The nuns, staff and homes - truly special.  Check one out some day...being involved with one of their homes has been the most rewarding experience of my life!"

2021-05-06 22:42,"I care for my mother who will be 89 in three weeks.  Her mobility is very shaky, and she is on oxygen.  Luckily she has no signs of dementia.  Is caring for her fun? No it is not.  Do I want to put her in a nursing home?  No, I do not.  She spent 5 weeks in one after a hip replacement at the end of 2018 and the experience was so bad I will do whatever I can to avoid returning her to a facility.  We need to really rethink how we care for the elder.  More funding and services should be directed to in home care, or small group care like the Green Homes initiative (who doesn't take Medicare because they don't pay enough).  The problem of course, is money.  Those of us who are unpaid caregivers are providing millions in care - even having someone come in for just a few days can cost well over a thousand dollars - there is not local, state or federal help to pay for care.  We do have resources, but I fear that the level of care will exceed our finances or physical ability to cope.  Unfortunately the ""for profit"" model of nursing home is a disaster - lack of staff, low pay and a revolving door of therapists and other staff.  I would love to see as an outcome of the pandemic a thorough evaluation of how we care for the elderly, but I don't think it will happen."
2021-05-06 22:45,"My father, due to the nature and extent of his illness, required total care (medical and custodial) and spent the last seven years of his life in a nursing home.  There was no way, even with help, that my mother, who was older and frail, could take care of him.  So he had to be admitted.  Eventually she aged and ran down to the point where even with my visiting twice a week and having a part time aide, she had to go in with my dad.  My home situation was not conducive to her living with me.  The facility was a good one, as they go but to keep them on their toes I would visit at odd times on no particular schedule- different days, sometimes after work, sometimes weekends, they never knew when I'd stop by. So they always kept my father cleaned up. My mother was still able to maintain herself personally- until the end she wore her street clothes. 

My daughter decided to go to nursing school.  I'm paying. The deal is she keeps me out of one of these places and she gets to keep what$ left."
2021-05-06 22:53,"Old age and death will come to all of us.  If you are aging or have aging parents, it is imperative you have a family conversation about end of life care.  When I started my career over 25 years ago, I worked in a nursing home.  Back then, there were many patients who were on an endless merry-go-round of hospitalizations to nursing home care.  I saw a lot of suffering happening because no family member was willing to let nature take its course and allow death to happen.  Now we have tools to help us plan for the end of life and make decisions before a catastrophe happens.  We all deserve a life of quality."
2021-05-06 22:55,With a decade’s experience as a Governor of a large high profile Nursing Home in the NE I’d urge exhausting all other alternatives before securing placement. Proper nursing home care is very labor intensive requiring skilled nursing staffs and quick access to physicians when problems occur. Sadly available funding is challenged to secure adequately trained staff in sufficient numbers to provide a suitable environment. The common experience across the industry is that nursing salaries are not adequate to secure required skill levels or sufficient staffing. And that families do not often visit leaving patients totally dependent on staff. From what I’ve seen over the years I’d urge exhausting all possible resources before placement in a “home”. Even in the best of circumstances nursing homes are “institutions”. Not a “home”. Sadly in all too many situations the patients needs/desires remain secondary to the economics of managing the institution.
2021-05-06 23:03,"Instead of giving taxpayer money to for-profit privatized corporate assisted living homes, we should make in-hone care the first goal. Better yet, we should give that taxpayer money to individual families to care for and house their elderly relatives. If we use taxpayer money to help children who live at home for 18-25 years, why are not willing to do the same for our elders? We should also give tax breaks to elder caregivers as we do for children. An elder caregiver who us a relative should not be limited to children, but should include nieces  nephews and other extended family."
2021-05-06 23:18,"Very timely article on a very important subject!
In-home care is definitely something which can be improved. Most of us have enough room in our homes for an elderly parent or two; we just do not know enough to be able to take on the challenge in a professional and economically sound manner.

I was hoping the article would contain links to a compendium of resources which in-home caregivers can use to do this more effectively"
2021-05-06 23:20,"Most of the nursing homes are hard pressed for staff, by low wages, limited equipment, and funding. The fedral and state governments are focused on limited funding or pushing at home care to lower their medical/eldercare expenses.
Once homecare is embeded in society the next move is just ""kick'em to the curb."""
2021-05-06 23:17,"In home care, though best, may not work for many. Even if families can afford in-home care, Olders, used to their routine and independence, have trouble accepting they need help or support,”fire”
caregivers, and resist the changes needed to keep them safe and at home. Then there are Olders with (understandably) angry, aggressive behaviors associated with life changes and/or dementia who alienate would-be helpers. Caregivers with the specialized skills and experience to handle such complex behavioral/emotional scenarios are not going to work for minimum wage, and too many families cannot afford more. Covid has only ripped away and accelerated the ongoing crash that passes for Eldercare in the U.S."

Probably have significant cognitive impairment (dementia) and can't make safe decisions, usually need trained staff to provide safe and respectful personal care.
The few folks who don't have dementia usually have serious physical restrictions - probably at least a 2 person transfer, wheelchair dependent and unstable medical concerns.

Maybe you can manage at home if you have unrestricted money and/or multiple willing family and friends.
Or, maybe, you need a nursing home to do the hard work and you can keep providing the good quality of life stuff."

We modified the house to have a second kitchen so each family could have their own level.  Part of why we were willing to do this is because I believe multigenerational living will make a comeback.  It was the norm for a long time.  There is better support for different phase of life needs, not to mention affordability and a much smaller footprint on the environment.  I don't know if we will retire in this home, but it will be perfect for someone who needs to care for a family member.  And home sharing has been wonderful."

They con the visitors with fake attention when the visitors arrive . They do not allow private cameras in your parents room or shared room so you don’t know if they are ignored or abused. They overcharge. Many of their help did not get the vaccine.
2021-05-06 23:40,"That caregiving professionals (both elder and children) are so lowly compensated and have high turnover, the industry should look at paying higher wages and offering stable employment.

2021-05-06 23:43,"It's amazing that after all the media coverage of nursing homes recently, this article doesn't talk about the underlying problem: profit-driven nursing home care. Or is that what is meant by the need for ""fundamental change"" in the last paragraph.  Let's be honest."
2021-05-06 23:46,"It would have helped if the article had explained what a nursing home is, compared  to an assisted living facility or continuous care community or senior living. Nursing homes have had a tarnished reputation as too many places failed the sniff test, smelling of urine and stale air, while charging exploitative prices. What’s more where is mention of new living arrangements for the elderly in communal homes and intentional communities? This piece was an emotional cake with an icing of current government policy handout facts and figures. Real change for the elderly is coming like it or not because there are going to millions in need of care. And they vote."
2021-05-06 23:47,"More and more of us do not have families. In a nursing home we would be abused. We need better access to assisted dying, not just assisted living. 

Caring for helpless people always attracts bullies and abusers. Without a visitor who has standing to sue, there’s little that can be done. Even with a caring family, there’s abuse. That will never change.

Apart from abuse, not everyone can handle regimented group living and loss of personal freedom and privacy. Make it easier to just say no thanks.

2021-05-06 23:49,"Nobody wants to be a burden. With the coronavirus this is now a game changer. My mother is in her late 80s, and luckily she is in what I would describe a five-star retirement facility in Washington DC.  To say that cost for her care in assisted-living is exorbitant is an understatement.   Many other seniors in this country are not so fortunate. They are warehoused in lesser facilities where CNA‘s and nurses are underpaid overworked and less trained.
I will leave it to your imagination as to how some of the seniors, many of whom have a form of dementia, are left to wither away slowly alone.  

If we did not have the financial means for my mother to be where she is, the only other choice would be to have her live with us and hire a caregiver To take care of her essential needs during the day.  

There are so many pressing issues facing this country today.  One that is on the back burner right now, as many of the baby boomers are become seniors, At the end of their careers, with meager savings, no nest egg.￼. Being able to afford to live comfortably in retirement￼￼ As well as affordable nursing care in their latter years is going to be Invincibly difficult for so many."
2021-05-07 0:03,"As heart wrenching as it was to watch Covid-19 exact such a heavy toll on the elderly, especially those in senior care facilities, it’s important to remember how senior care operators turned the tide on Covid before the second wave. While hospitals experienced a crushing surge of infections last fall, senior care facilities reported very few infections. This exemplifies their commitment to caring for residents and shows that senior care facilities continue to play an important role in providing a safe place to receive skilled nursing care for families who need it."
2021-05-07 0:03,"My sister-in-law, who has MS was in a rehab center/nursing home to regain her strength/mobility after a hospital stay.   The facility was a very attractive place, hotel-like with what looked to be plenty of staff.  My sister-in-law is younger, in her 50’s, a former nurse.   The facility - part of a chain - also had nursing home patients.   The food was awful, and while visiting I heard the constant ringing of bells.  I asked what that was and it was people ringing for assistance that went unanswered.   The staff was polite but totally inattentive.  Imagine being an older person without an advocate at the mercy of a facility like this.   No wonder so many elderly patients go downhill after being placed in a nursing home. I’m sorry that for so many people this is their only alternative."
2021-05-06 23:45,"This country needs to address the long term care situation.

My mother-in-law had dementia. Our brother-in-law family took her in, but it ended up very short term. She almost started the house on fire. She ordered pizza at 2 am when all were asleep. She called the police said they weren't feeding her. They almost ended up in jail for elder abuse, even though they were watching her 24/7. 

Many do not realize how bad it can get until they are in the thick of the process.

My husband and I have a long term care policy, but the premiums have quadrupled and the insurance company will probably go bankrupt.

We as a society need to come up with a solution soon. The baby boomers are all going to need care soon and many, like myself, have no children. 

We need to get workers in this country who are willing to do blue color labor - construction, healthcare, Home health, etc...... guess what.... we have 1000s of young people trying to get in this country.... Solution?"

Even if that means hiring live-in care and depleting their resources. It's a lot more work. It's a problem when the money really does run out, but at-home hospice care is reimbursed by Medicaid. 

Or it used to be. 

Good luck, folks. All my older relatives are, sadly, safely dead, so I'm next. I'll see if I can forestall the usual dismal end.

There's a great cliff on Monhegan Island."
2021-05-07 0:04,"I'm frankly not sure where people are getting the money to pay for nursing homes. To qualify for Medicaid, one has to be absolutely destitute. If you don't have long term care insurance, the cost can be as high as $12,000 a month (my income is less than $3000 a month). My mother died 8 years ago, but a few years before she died, we toured 3 nursing homes that cost $6000 - $8000 a month. They were all incredibly sleazy. The ""nice"" nursing home wanted to put my mother's bed in a hallway right near a door (adding her as a roommate to a small, single room ) asked me to get her insurance to pay for a hospital bed, and then charge us $8000 a month. It would have eaten up all her savings in a year (the government later did that - inheritance taxes). In many nursing homes, difficult patients, those with dementia, are either tossed out or drugged into a stupor. 

The cost of in-home care while I worked during the day was $19 an hour, more than my income, but we used my mother's savings. Then I came home from work and did my second job, caring for my mother. People with dementia can be a handful: imagine trying to control and protect a violent, psychotic, 100 pound child, after coming home from your full time job. This 2nd job is not for the weak or fainthearted."
2021-05-07 0:25,"I know that most people, during the worst early days of the COVID plague, were forced to make hard decisions and some of those turned out to be wrong.  I never understood at the time why infected people who were being discharged from hospitals were being returned to their nursing homes.  Yes, I know that bed space in hospitals was a concern, but this seemed to me even then as throwing a lighted match on a pile of dry straw.  While I am a Cuomo supporter, his role in the ""nursing home death count"" continues to trouble me.  As to nursing homes in general, I have already told my loved one that IF (heaven forbid) the time comes where I require nursing home care, I intend to advise the ambulance driver to stop midway along the Brooklyn Bridge, from which I will find the strength to throw myself over the side.  Better a quick death than the lingering pain of living in a nursing home care facility.  I've seen them (even those considered good ones) and the kindest thing I can say about them is that they are most surely ""not for me."""

I read these postings from fellow ALS patients of children and spouses who are angry and tired of taking care of their parent/spouse because of the amount of care they need. I can see my family with joy and happiness instead of feeling like a burden. In the meantime I can enjoy my new friends and our activities that have just started up again. I have aides here that do the hard work that my family would otherwise have to do. Believe me I far prefer this method of care. The big downside? This does not come cheaply. It is something though that is well worth the cost!
2021-05-07 0:35,"This option works without dementia as part of the person's life. We tried for 2 years to serve as caregiver to our mom with dementia. It just became unworkable. Having to manage meds. Dealing with incontinence. Cooking special meals for diet.  Leaving the house without our knowledge and getting lost.  Dealing with the incompetent day care company that was constantly late, changing people constantly, lack of training. 

With both of us working, it became an impossible situation. The homes are also just horrible... even the new one that we first placed her in. Won't go into the long list of issues. The best it became is when we moved her to a smaller place with more staff. Finally done semblance of order. At a cost of $9,500 monthly. 

This was 5 years ago and poor Covid. We loved our mom. Our country treats elderly like trash."
2021-05-07 0:40,"Families thinking about keeping parents/spouses at home in advanced old age need to be realistic about what's involved. It takes more than one person to look after the 24/7 needs of somebody who's very old, frail and - with people living longer these days - likely to develop some degree of dementia. Somebody with dementia cannot be left alone at any time, for safety reasons. 
This is more than one adult child/spouse can manage physically. The whole family needs to get involved, and contribute to the financial cost.  Forget the Victorian attitude that single daughters will/can alone look after aged parents. It's a recipe for carer burnout."

Last fall, I took my massively depleted savings & escaped the horrors of this institution and purchased a small home in the country.  I can assure all of you that care in even 5 star facilities is extremely lacking, it just occurs in a facility that, by all appearances, just looks better.  In our society, looks are deceiving,  too many people equate beautiful locations with stellar services.  My 5 star facility, though beautifully landscaped & decorated, was dreadfully understaffed, people frequently developed bed-sores, laid in their own filth for hours, were frequently provided inaccurate medications and really didn’t receive the care one would imagine.   After this experience,  I decided Final Exit (look them up on the internet), more extensive euthanasia laws, VSED, or a gun and a bullet made more sense than what passes for elder care in our country.   I’m now living my final days in peace & happiness, exceedingly frugally, with a plan that doesn’t include ever returning to a care facility.  And I consider myself one of the lucky ones…"

2021-05-07 1:30,"Whether you have an elderly parent, or are just being smart about your own personal aging, take a serious look at your bathroom. I have been in many hundreds of homes. Even very recent McMansions have terrible access to the toilet. Many mansions put it in a closet with a door. Big mistake. Just forget the older bathrooms. 

You may not be able to redesign for wheelchair access to the toilet (though you should!), but most homes (even new homes) do not even allow for accessing the toilet while using a walker. You need to maneuver safely! This is essential! You may break your hip tomorrow.

While you are at is, get a better to best quality ""bidet-style"" toilet. All you need is a proper electrical outlet. The best brand is the Toto (brand) ""Washlet"" series. When your mobility is limited and your balance is weakened, these seats not only improve hygiene, but reduce the likelihood of a fall in the bathroom which can lead to death or nursing home necessity.

Serious examination of bathrooms is critical. It can make or break your ability to stay in a home. It isn't about prettiness, it is about the ability to live and function"

Also, in NYS the legislature here has already passed through the house here for safe staffing levels.  They are going to do the same for hospitals here.  When I worked extra at the hospital (I worked Mon-Fri OR)then I worked extra on the weekends for 25 dollars an hour.  I did 12 hour shifts.  Once I reached the top of my scale at 20 yrs I stopped working extra since I wasn't getting extra money.  I was a single mother and needed to pay for my daughters school when she was little.  I would get eight patients to take care of; and if I didn't have an LPN working with me on my team I would have to do all of my meds and I had to take care of IV's as well..
When you first come in at seven in the morning you have to do a physical assessment of each patient.  You have to listen to their heart, lungs, take vitals, if they had surgery you have to check their incision sight; if they had prostate surgery you have to check eight urine specimens sitting in their bathroom.  
Then you have to start A.M. care.  First you make sure you empty foley catheters, record the urine output, ask about BMs, then you have to help them with breakfast.  Then you start their baths.  This is only six hours into your shift."

Each tour took half a day as we visited the residents all the while I smelled urine in the buildings.
On one visit,  there was a beseeching voice coming from a back room begging; ""Help me.  Help me please....""
The entreating request continued without a break all the while we were there.

As a young student, I was puzzled why we were led there to visit the facilities.
The buildings were beautifully decorated and looked clean; but the atmosphere was musty and dreadful.
It was not fun at all for me.  I longed for spending my time on some good sight seeing in stead of the smelly musty dreadful visit.

Then; the tour organizer answered my question;
""This visit is far better education to you than any of the college classes;"" he continued;
 ""This is to teach you not come here.  Ever.""

I was young and too inexperienced to fully appreciate the visit; but
later on, I realized how invaluable lesson they gave me.
Good self care is the top major goal in my life.

I walk, stretch, choose healthier food to avoid nursing home living.

2021-05-07 1:55,"It's time we realize how much money is wasted and how much of one's estate disappears when elderly are placed in nursing homes.  

A private duty nurse costs a heck of a lot less than a nursing home, and the family has an inheritance at the end of Mom's life.......

If you can't handle the frailties of your Mother, hire an aide to feed her, change her diapers, and bathe her.  But don't abandon her to indifferent hired hands in an institution far from home.

Be certain you understand the law before selling  Mom's home.....     And don't rely upon siblings who are ignorant of the law; be doubly careful not to let sibling rivalries and envy mess up the possibility of a future inheritance.  The nursing home took 100% of our inheritance because stupid siblings undermined/didn't believe those who knew the law. 

I wish I had had the resources and space to house  our Mother but I was 1200 miles away during the family arguments when the fools got their way.....

Beware the siblings who want to throw away your Mom and all her assets."
2021-05-07 2:38,"By expecting family to pitch in our country is ignoring a few things.  One, in most families both spouses work.  Two, as people live longer, the children may be senior citizens as well and not in such great shape themselves.  Three, not every parent was a good parent to their children which means in turn that some children do not want to have anything at all to do with their elderly, frail parent.  

The various parts of the wealth care industry spend enormous amounts of money on convincing us that this medication, this hospital, this practice, this assisted living facility will be perfect for whatever or whomever.  Why hasn't that money been spent on giving employees better pay, better pensions, hiring more staff so that patients aren't left to die alone, lie in their excrement, etc.?  Why are hospitals so understaffed?  Cut the ad campaigns, stop overpaying the CEOs and start to give people/patients and their families a real quality experience.  

As far as the United States is concerned, we are no country for old people, poor people, handicapped people, children, or anyone but the richest.  Too many of us forgo care until it's too late.  For a country that claims to have the best of everything we sure don't have the best available when it's needed unless the person needing it is rich.  We don't need Cadillacs.  We could use a few reliable Toyotas or Hondas."
2021-05-07 2:28,"The bit of news media spotlight on nursing homes has exposed the profits over care issues-well a tiny bit.    Maybe some of these things are having families think twice.  Its ok for those who have a certain level of certain abilities- that is able to initiate conversation and ask for help, get a drink on one's own-see well enough... but if not.... there noones job to provide human contact -even bare boned basic interaction."
2021-05-07 3:04,PACE programs would be excellent but need flexibility/control for the client.  They shouldn't be forced to go to a 'day center' to get the home care.  And lower level home care with say for example just 4-8 hrs a week support for someone who is more independent maybe feasible.  Also expense.  Its 0 on medicaid but skyrockets should one's income still be very low but just somewhat higher.
2021-05-07 3:23,"My in-laws started paying for long term care insurance many years ago. The perfect storm of dementia and uncooperative behavior in one and sudden blindness in the other forced us to seek out a nursing home for my in-law with dementia. To get to that point though, we tried part time in home care for a year, which the long term care insurance partially paid for. During that year we worked with an elder care attorney and a nurse who specialized in navigating the insurance and elder care system to find the best living situation for both. To have that navigational help it took a full year and cost thousands and thousands of dollars. Thankfully my in laws had the funds to pay for that help. My husband and I are educated people with I think, common sense. Nevertheless, it was still a nightmare of bureaucracy and exhaustion trying to juggle everything even with all the help we had. I can’t imagine how people do it that don’t have the resources we did. Our healthcare system is broken. There has to be a better way."
2021-05-07 4:17,"As a nurse, in the early days of my career I worked in long term care.  At the time, while I was working on my degree it paid me the most money as I was willing to run all over the place to work wherever help was needed.  It was an experience and one that taught me I would never put a loved one in LTC nor would I ever consent to placement there myself.  Given that I worked at many of the homes in Western Massachusetts through agencies, I saw first hand how awful these places are even the ones that were considered “better”.  Our system is terribly broken when we have to spend thousands and thousands of dollars a year to care for our frail elderly only to have them receive care we wouldn’t give to animals.  They are truly the last round up."
2021-05-07 4:40,"My father-in-law had advanced Alzheimer’s before we could move him from his house. He lived in a rural area (miles from neighbors) 350 miles from us and thousands of miles from his other son. 

We could not get out to see him very often or personally provide the care he needed.  We had someone care for him a few hours/day but he needed 24 hour supervision.  Even after he almost burned down the house and a bunch of other incidents it was a nightmare convincing the BIL and a nephew that the man needed more care than any of us could provide. 

We got my FIL into an assisted care facility near us (where he was fine for a year but eventually went to the memory care unit where the staff was great).  My husband had lunch with him every day.  Good days.  We got into it with the administration when, against all advice from the people who took care of him & what we observed daily, they wanted him to go to the attached nursing home (they needed to fill a bed) which was awful and more than twice the cost.  They were happy to run down his remaining assets and help us get him on Medicaid.  We refused and held our ground to maintain his best care where he was. A few months later my FIL died in his sleep. 

We are well educated and financially secure, but struggled to get through it with just one parent. The cost and stress is prohibitive. It is a disgrace what this system puts families through at a most difficult time of life."
2021-05-07 5:04,"For two decades, I have devoted nearly half my life so my parents could stay at home.   The challenge began in attaining Medicaid eligibility  by drawing down all their assets to $2,000.  

Then, the real difficulty was in finding reliable, trustworthy, capable people willing in 1999 to work for $8 an hour.  It took me 72 phone calls to find the first person who would work for us.

After that, I spent six months until I found and hired three more top flight care givers and also worked with Mass Health until I secured enough daytime hours (15) to be assured my father with the onset of dementia at 90 was adequately and safely cared for.  But it took hundreds ￼of hours to get it all done.

All of this was a few years after I got a Reverse Mortgage to pay $50,000 a year for a 24 hour live in personal aide to care for my dad￼. But eventually that money ran out and I had to enroll my patents in Medicaid.

This “journey” began when my father was put in a nursing home to “rehab” from surgery.  This nightmare￼ of his “incarceration” took me nine￼ months and the threat of a law suit against the nursing home before they released him. 

My dad lived at home until 94. My mom is still home at nearly 104 with four care givers so my efforts were not in vain. It can be done but you must devote the time and make the sacrifices necessary to insure it becomes a reality.  

No one should have to go through what I did so their parents can live at home in dignity until the end of their lives."
2021-05-07 9:32,"My husband and I live in our two-family house.  Right now, everything's fine.  But I envision a future where the house will be occupied by family and/or friends, aging like us, and all taking care of each other.  Perhaps this scenario will include a live-in healthcare worker, or two, paid by all of us.  

Since our healthcare system is in a shambles, especially for those unable to take proper care of themselves, it seems like a good time to revamp the way we take care of the most vulnerable among us.

We just might have to come up with our own creative ways of dealing with the difficulties that may be on the horizon for so many of us who do not want to burden our children with our care"
2021-05-07 9:46,"My mother died a year ago and my father lasted six months at home before his dementia and related psychosis led us to place him in a long term care facility despite the covid risk. He is actually doing relatively well there. He is eating, he has an aide, his medications are under control, and all of us can sleep at night.

The second guessing began immediately. Yes he was more isolated because of covid precautions, but we were stuck behind a rock and a hard place. We kids were bearing the brunt of incessant questions, screaming, paranoia, and personal care, which in turn was threatening our marriages and jobs and affecting our own kids. Forget aides at home; my father wouldn’t have let anyone in. Even his siblings refused to enter his house.

Even with all of this, the second guessing continues. I can hear all of the second guessing reading the article and the comments. No one knows the extent of what we were going through, and frankly what my mother was going through, too. None of this is easy for anyone and I will not second guess anyone else’s decision. My only recommendation to anyone is that they all need to discuss and plan for these possibilities. My parents did not. And looking back, my siblings and I were luckier than most because we had options."
2021-05-07 11:45,"It's been said that we demonstrate our values by how we spend our money.

2021-05-07 6:46,"I came from a nursing home out here & ask soon as COVID-19 hit we went into immediate lockdown. Every nurse entering the bldg had to have a temp. taken daily. It was recorded. They could not enter unless it was normal. We never had 1 COVID-19 case, let alone death. I think it's important to know that people need to get all the facts before they jump to the conclusion that all nursing homes are death traps. It's media spin."
2021-05-07 5:45,"The commentary below on this article shows just how abominable the state of elder care is in the United States.  It is tearing apart families (and individuals without families) and bankrupting them at the same time.  And then there is the state of the caregiving itself - lack of experienced personnel, low wages and very dependent on our broken immigration system.  We are supposedly the richest nation on earth.  Why can we not care for our citizens?  Look to greed and profit motive to find the answers."
2021-05-07 6:20,"Dealing with a parent who has dementia and very little resources is extremely challenging. Also, has made me realize that I will not place this same burden on my children. I love them too much. Alzheimer’s is a terrible disease.... I truly wish there was a way to end life in a dignified manner in this country. I’d plan a big final hurrah and then go out on my own terms."

2021-05-07 12:21,"My (widowed) mom has needed 24 hour care for the last 25 years.  I was only 28 when she was diagnosed with a very rare disease, she was only in her 50’s.  There is no easy answer.  We kept her in her home for 15 years.  It took only a few years to deplete her savings paying for caregivers.  Then I depleted my 401K.  Then I worked for 10 years to pay for her care.  She rarely had any visitors other than my sister or me while staying at home.  Not to mention we went through a constant turnover of caregivers.  And taking her out to see friends and family was very challenging because of her illness.  Yet we did it.  For 15 years.  Then we put her in a beautiful expensive home, and guess what, the care was horrible.  After 9 months we found a different home where she is loved and cared for and has lived for the last 10 years.  We are very involved with the home and it truly is the best thing to happen to my family.  It is a very rewarding place to spend your time.  But again, there are no easy answers and every situation is different.  Try not to judge."
2021-05-07 13:25,"Last year my spouse smashed an ankle and we were given only an option to go to a rehab hospital 45 mins away or a local nursing home. Luckily our insurance covered the rehab hospital as within days nursing homes began the Covid lockdown. I will never choose nursing home care for my spouse or myself. It’s no secret nursing home staff are underpaid and care is impacted by this privatized business. We have made the decision to age in place and are making the necessary legal, financial, and home renovation to accommodate that decision. Our survivors probably won’t see a penny from our estate but that would likely be the case if group care was our choice. As we have experienced long term home caregiving with other family members we believe we’re making the right choice. My heart goes out to those who cannot make that choice."
2021-05-07 14:14,"Society, cities, and developers promote all kinds of senior only housing these days.  This pandemic should make every family and senior rethink these age restricted developments from nursing homes to ""active Adult"" ."
2021-05-07 14:33,"Everyone should read the book ""Being Mortal"" by Atul Gawande.  We insist on looking at elder/end of life care through rose colored glasses.  In America  we are living way too long with horrible quality of life. 

 And where are we to find all these saintly caregivers that we want to pay peanuts to but demand first rate care from?  Most nursing homes staff the bare minimum legal required amount of RNs/LVNs most of the medical people are nurses aids, maybe a med aid or 2.  That is 6 week certification program in my state.

My husband is a Hospice Nurse and he sees what goes on in most of these facilities.  Even the ones that are for the wealthy, you quite often need to hire additional private help if you want your loved one to have quality care.  The ones that are not for the wealthy are hellholes.

It makes me want to work on my exit plan before I need it."
2021-05-07 14:58,"Clearly, the for-profit corporate model is at odds with compassionate home care.  We've found that hiring caregivers as ""household employers"" with my mother as ""employer"" gives us the ability to hire the people we want and pay them well.  We think of it as a fleet of 4 additional daughters who are devoted to her care (it may be sexist, but my Mom would not want a male caregiver).  No one works more than 20 hours a week so there's no burn-out.  They are well-compensated for their time so feel valued.  If we went with a home health care agency, we would have to take whomever they sent us,  we would pay $30 an hour for the service while the caregivers would get paid far less -- barely over minimum wage.  Better to avoid the middleman who is just in it for the profit.

Of course, this only works because I handle care from 5 PM until 8:30 the next morning, and my Mom doesn't get up at night.  If we needed to hire overnight care, her money wouldn't last long."
2021-05-07 16:25,"I have spent over 10,000 hours (no, that is not a typo) over the last four years at the nursing home where my mother resides ( a facility which is allegedly one of the best in Palm Beach County, FL).  

Based on my experience and the experience of others with whom I've discussed the state of nursing homes . . .  COVID or no COVID, the vast majority of nursing homes are nothing more than ""warehouses for the elderly and infirmed,"" and neglect is an institutionalized standard practice.  

The nursing home industry's slogan should be ""Profits over People.""  As far as I am concerned, it is a criminal enterprise taking advantage of disabled vulnerable souls.   

Stay at home.  Live in a resident owned community.   Create a virtual care community.   

No matter what:  Caveat Emptor!!"
2021-05-07 16:47,"As a 30-something year old, I find this article and all the comments highly disturbing.

Hundreds of thousands of dollars later, my mother was forced out of her home in the community and into the community's ""warehouse for the elderly"" from which there is no reasonable way to ""escape,"" and no viable replacement for her ""Life Care"" contract.

By the way, the community where my mother lives is owned primarily by part of the Pritzker (Hyatt) clan.  From my vantage point, given the years of ongoing neglect of residents in this CCRC, the owners are both impersonal and immoral."
2021-05-07 20:07,"What we need are architects and builders who have any notion or experience in caring for the elderly. But our society wants the elderly to be kept apart from everyone else, so these builders and designers have no understanding. They continue to make housing terrible for anyone who has strength and balance issues. Two steps up this way, four steps up that way, Tight corners. Staircases designed so that chair lifts are impossible. Bathrooms designed for appearance and not function. These problems persist. 

Architects may have great visualization, but they have no vision."
2021-05-07 21:46,"Not every parent HAS a child to take care of them. Sometimes children get stuck caring for elderly, demented parents they never wanted to see again. 

Two of my children were Alienated against me by an abusive ex spouse. Someday they hostile women might be responsible for my care. My third child has a personality disorder and the thought of that child having any access to money intended for my care is equally horrifying. Money slips through their fingers like water. I'm terrified that someday I might be left to the tender mercies of the irresponsible and hateful.

And then this:
Some years ago, as a volunteer for a national charity which provides tax service to low, middle-income, and the elderly, I did a return for a client. A piece of land had been sold to fund his care, and that required paying capital gains. The old man hard in the grips of dementia. He didn't know who he was, where he was, or what he was doing. His adult son who was helping with the return said he had not had contact with his father since he was about 7. The man had been horribly abusive to both him and his mother. Elder Services had notified him of the old man's condition.

When I complimented the son on his compassion, he squirmed. ""If I had a choice, I wouldn't, but I am his next of kin and he doesn't have anyone else. He's my legal responsibility. I have to.""

2021-05-03 17:05,The number of deaths per million in Australia is less than a fiftieth of what it is in the US.  Australia also runs a very tight point based immigration system. OTOH universal health coverage in Australia is beyond anything dreamt of by Senator Bernie. Someone working in a coffee shop can make $20+ per hour and enjoy a middle class life. There are trade-offs I suppose.
2021-05-03 17:08,"It's tough. During the initial panicky stages of dealing with the crisis overseas citizens of a lot of Western democracies were very clearly warned by their governments and their country's embassies and consulates abroad to ""Return home now!"" or face the possibility they would not be allowed to depending on how things unfolded. 
This is the nature of a pandemic. Hard decisions have to be made. The fact that under Modi's blustering leadership India avoided many of those same hard decisions is one of reasons India is facing this crisis. 
What everyone needs to do now is ensure flare up regions like India and Brazil are given the containment resources (vaccines, medical equipment supplies) they need to put these fires out. When your neighbors house is on fire it's in your interest to pass them a few pails of water. 
Furthermore, India's leadership needs to stop assessing the geopolitical calculus of accepting the aid offered by Beijing and just take it if it helps their people. As for the US it needs to stop dragging its feet if only out of fear the Chinese will once more (like South America) swoop in and make them look bad. 
Meanwhile the Indian private sector ignoring geopolitics is already working with Chinese firms to import oxygen tanks and PPE. SInovac vaccine won't be far behind if the US continues with its delays. I guess geopolitical competition is good for something if encourages nations and their leaders to do the right thing."
2021-05-03 17:19,"The Australian government has a long history of abandoning its own citizens when they are overseas. The Department of Foreign Affairs is well-known for paying scant if any attention to Australian citizens in foreign countries, particuarly if they are innocent of any crime but illegally detained by a foreign government. DFAT employes view their OS postings as a tax payer funded holiday rather than a job. Canberra has no desire to protect the rights of Australian citizens or even fundamental humanitarian principles. A political and/or public service career is viewed as means of gaining prestige, power and wealth at tax payers expense."

I don't have stats or anything but here's the anecdotal evidence. My parents live in a well to do neighborhood in India and there are several Indian people there who returned from US to be in India. Many of them are citizens and GC holders. A lot of them, as we speak are making plans of coming back to the US to escape covid in India. Some of them were even covid positive a few days back. How would US stop them? I believe the right thing is to stop them.

Denying entry based on color or country of origin will bring more trouble for a country. A blanket ban (except diplomats and extreme humanitarian/health issues) is the best way forward."

2021-05-03 17:20,"Australia is neurotic about anything that even sounds a bit like lots of people coming into their country in an uncontrolled fashion.  Today we discover just how deep that fear runs.  Even a citizen can be ""not Australian enough"".

Despite the low infection rates, the lockdowns there were beyond anything which would be contemplated in the US.  Armed checkpoints at state borders, blocking all movement.  License plate readers which detected people who strayed more than a short distance from their homes.  Incidents of indiscriminate mass home detention in low income housing developments.

By global standards things never got tough in Australia.  Her leaders reached for instruments of repression anyway.  How would they have behaved if things got truly hard?  Weak leaders, with weak liberal principles.  And the Chinese are noticing."

It is unfathomable, however, that a country with Australia's resources cannot think of a way of bringing its *citizens* (not foreigners, travelers, or immigrants) back in a safe way.

First Trump closed travel from Wuhan (except for US citizens returning home). Later Biden closed travel from Brazil (except for US citizens) when Brazil had a surge with a variant.  Now Biden is prohibiting travel from India except US citizens.  

I know for a fact that the virus does not care if the traveling human is a US citizen. Why is the US so weak when it comes to protecting US citizens at home, even if it means our citizens abroad must wait to come home?  Seems like letting US citizens from Wuhan come home was a big part of starting the whole pandemic. After $2 trillion lost, we still do not have the willpower to do what is necessary. Am I wrong?"

However, Australia does not have the right to restrict citizens who went abroad before the advisroy. The Gov't has an obligation to receive them and provide the same medical care free of cost.

Countries which import human-resources/skills for their economy (legal immigration/naturalization), cannot abandon their citizens based on the countries of origin. Such governments can be sued for discrimination!

Prohibiting citizens to not to come back to their own home country? I wouldn't even want to visit such a country, let alone be a citizen of it."

It doesn't care about personal relationships, culture, societal norms, etc. I think the U.S. should have shut down all borders as soon as disease was known in Wuhan. Yes, let citizens in but have them quarantine for 2 weeks first. 

Again, disease is disease. It doesn't care about the US Constitution, cultural norms, etc. Countries need to protect their citizens and if that involves shutting down the border temporarily, so be it. I have no quarrel with this attempt to save lives."

If a very much more deadly variant was identified, they just might, but at this point it just doesn't look like letting in people from India and other countries is going to make much difference here.  We have Australian friends the we met while traveling and they're thinking it may be a few years before they can travel again because this policy makes traveling more dicey for them."

When New Zealand enacted the India travel ban there were some accusations of racism against Jacinda Ardern but this paper of course didn’t cover it because she’s a patron saint to them.

2021-05-03 18:00,The world is still in the midst of COVID. If you’ve chosen to travel internationally during this time you are cognizant and accepting of the risk that something precisely like this could happen!
2021-05-03 18:11,"While it does seem punitive, if you knowingly travel to a hotbed of disease where do you draw the line?  If this was Polio, Nipah, SARS, MERS and it was as out of hand as SARS-Cov2 is, we would be far more cautious than this.  For those that scream ""my right as a citizen"" there are rules.  I also have the right to life and liberty.  We have laws for a reason.   The fact that the Island of outcast prisoners has pulled it together should be thought provoking"
2021-05-03 18:11,"The amount of people who are willing to throw civil rights to the wind the moment it no longer comfortable for them is fascinating. 

Entrance into your own country is a fundamental civil right. The whole point of civil rights is that you have them in good times and bad times. Australia has a nonnegotiable obligation to its citizens whether they are in Australia or abroad. End of story. You don’t get to just wash your hands of your own citizens in their moment of need.

I can’t help but feel that there is a double standard here. If the U.S were barring naturalized American citizens from returning home, we’d be crucified as selfish nativists. The international community would never stand for it. But because Australia is perceived as a quaint “progressive” island nation, it’s suddenly OK. Australia is a wealthy nation with a small population. They are perfectly capable of chartering planes, testing their citizens, and finding suitable quarantine settings. They aren’t doing it because they don’t want to and feel nobody can make them."
2021-05-03 18:12,"Saw an article on the morning news about an Ozzie that came to the U.S. to visit his wife's ailing mother, and since has had a a stroke, is dying, and can't get home.  Oz even cancelled his disability/retirement checks, and they couldn't afford a flight home if they could get one.

If that's the way Oz treats its citizens, I'm taking it off my travel list."
2021-05-03 18:14,"They want the Australian government to prove it wasn't discriminatory? Does the new order state that only Australians of Indian heritage are banned from re-entering the country? No, it states NO ONE is allowed. Hard to claim discrimination when there is a total ban. It's fascinating how the liberal media harangued Trump for not clamping down the US with more restrictive policies, but then when there is the slightest perception a minority is being affected, all of a sudden it's racist! Just because the restrictions apply to India doesn't mean it's a racist policy, it means India is being hard hit right now, as evident by the Time's significant coverage over the last few weeks. I remember reading an article about how the Navajo Nation was being hard hit by the Coronavirus and the article claimed it was because of racist government policies, which in part is true. But, as usual the other side of the story was buried deep in the article and was mentioned obliquely, it stated the family that was being followed in the story had to drive 5 hours to a major city to buy groceries because when they went to any of the grocery stores in the Navajo Nation no one was wearing masks. It amazes me the PC media will cry racism at the drop of a hat and refuses to criticize the Navajo Nation for their behavior - at the same time they blanket the news criticizing the exact same behavior of some of those on the right."
2021-05-03 18:02,"Our government and Australian government has been telling it's citizens to come home and that this senario would happen for over a year now. People have been warned by NZ and Australian government that if you leave the nation for whatever reason, during the pandemic there is no guarantee that we can get you out of the country.
It's almost impossible for anyone to get out of India, as there are no international flights out of the country.
People have to realise that the government is not a continuous cash machine for people who want to travel overseas during a pandemic and then get stuck in another nation.
Australia quarantine facilities wouldn't be able to cope with the influx of returnees bringing the Indian variant of the pandemic into Australia. It's not cheap to police quarantine facilities and errors happen because humans make errors. A total lockdown of Australia would ruin their economy and push businesses over the edge and into bankruptcy.
At the moment NZ, Australia, and the Cook Island are community transmission free, and enjoying a travel bubble where we can travel between nations without being quarantined."
2021-05-03 18:06,"So for once, the US is on the correct side of an issue?  COVID or not, a county should allow its citizens to return home, full stop.  And while I understand it is a natural desire to expand this discussion to health care, etc., let's stick to the point please."
2021-05-03 17:53,There seems to be an easy fix here.  This article indicates that the number of Australians who can be repatriated is limited by space in quarantine hotels and availability of flights. The Australian government could very easily contract with more hotels to serve as quarantine venues and charter repatriation flights through Qantas. Both moves would not only bring stranded Australians home but would also boost two economic sectors that have been struggling due to COVID. Seems like a no-brainer.
2021-05-03 16:53,"This makes no sense unless cruelty against Australian's of Indian descent is the goal. Why not allow them to fly to a designated airport with others from India trying to get home to Australia and quarantine until the officials are satisfied the individual is healthy?

2021-05-03 18:20,"I wish Canada adopted some of the policies Australia has put in place during the pandemic.  It took Trudeau almost a year to announce a mandatory 3-day hotel quarantine for international travelers starting in February 2021.  
Yet almost one quarter (23%) of all air travelers arriving in Canada since the federal government’s quarantine requirement were exempted from the rules.  

The result from the Federal government's lackluster response to air travel since March 2020:  every single variant of covid is in Canada.

Australia seems to have taken the lazy path - just keep people out. Very convenient! The next time Australia needs help with pharmaceuticals from India or when China is breathing down their necks, India should extract its pound of flesh. I would also like to see our country (US) put overt and covert pressure on Australia - this is a major human rights issue. Australia after all lives off our dough and needs to be brought inline."

2021-05-03 18:25,"This ban is clearly discriminatory because the government knows that the people who will mostly be affected will be people with Indian heritage. Last year, when the UK variant was raging, there was no blanket ban on arrivals from the UK. I personally know several Australian citizens who went home without any issues. This is while the UK variant was known to be more severe and contagious - there is no similar evidence about the Indian variant. Somehow the rules are always different for white people. Not surprising - Australia is governed by a far-right, climate change denying party"

Australians have been warned for over a year to get back to Australia because of this pandemic so the people who ignored that advice have no one to blame but themselves. Also, people who decided to travel internationally, and ignored government advice not to do so, because you might get stranded in that country, have only themselves to blame.
The government isn't an automatic cash machine for people who wanted to either stay in India or travel to India DURING this pandemic.
Stop blaming the government because you ignored their advice for years."

If an American tests positive for COVID in India, she is not allowed to board a US bound flight, even though she will be at great risk of dying due to lack of adequate medical care if her condition worsens.

(Remember Lebanon? Most ""Canadians"" were back home in five months after our Federal govt. flew them ""home"" at tax payer expense. This is the right move to protect those at their real ""home"". No gaming the system this time."
2021-05-03 19:22,"Australia must try harder to take care of its own citizens. It’s policy only degrades the value of its citizenship and its passport. It is shameful for the country. 

The country surely can afford to increase its capacity to quarantine beyond the current hospital capacity. Citizens returning form infected areas can be kept there until they are of no danger to others. 

Policy seemingly based on national origin of its citizens creates a horrible image for Australia."
2021-05-03 18:47,"This is so wrong.   Do Australian citizens not pay taxes to their home country?  

For those Australians who very much want to return home, but are currently 'not being allowed to',  I'd imagine they'd be only too willing to return back to Australia, but only if they are first willing to quarantine in a state-run facility that provides an initial COVID test, followed by beds to sleep in, meals, daily temperature checks, masks, etc.

Or alternatively, giving returning citizens some type of monitoring bracelet that they must wear for the first two weeks after their return to Australia.  Then, and only if a person has left their home, could they be fined.  (And even That is a bit extreme, esp if all the person is doing is going for a walk, and while masked.)  I mean, at what point should we all just end it now?  What is the point of living?

Somewhere there needs to be balance, and what Australia is currently doing is not it."
2021-05-03 19:20,There are many comments to the affect that Australia is doing it for the greater good of its people back home. I say no. Australia is really doing this for the good of its business and economy. What they really want to avoid is lockdowns. So essentially letting their own citizens die in a foreign land just so that people back home can keep making money
2021-05-03 19:23,"I understand the fear behind wanting to close borders to visitors. But I think any sovereign nation should want its citizens to be able to come home and would try to work with them towards a solution.

That said, I also understand that the Australian government told citizens not to leave the country as they could not guarantee return from places with high rates of infection. So if people voluntarily took that risk, it seems the traveling citizens must make do. Seems to hinge on when exactly Australia started recommending against foreign travel. So it seems rational to have a blanket rule across all travel to all countries (that is, if you go, the country can’t guarantee your return). As long as Australia treats all countries with high rates of infection the same and treats citizens of all colors/religions, etc. the same, it is fine. But if white Australians are allowed to return from India but Australians of Indian background are not, then I think that could fairly be called racist. I haven’t heard of any reports of that happening (?)"
2021-05-03 19:37,"As someone of Indian origin here in the US with parents in India, I can only watch with dismay as diaspora continue to think individually. While the call to respond to help family tugs on heart strings, in a pandemic it’s much more important to think of the world community. Every time a person boards an airplane to rescue family or vacation, they become involuntary spreaders of deadly variants and in doing so harm many, many strangers. I am sure the ban is Australia is not permanent and I am sure however dismal India is at this time it will slowly return to a stable condition. I respect Australia for doing what most countries would like to do but for fear of appearing politically incorrect enact half measures and hope for the best."
2021-05-03 19:38,"It's a question of quarantine capacity and effectiveness.  Note that most, if not all, recent infections in Australia stem from quarantine from overseas travelers, citizens or otherwise.  Factor this into the unknowns of whatever variants may be circulating in India and the choice to pause, for now, seems clear."
2021-05-03 19:32,"I’m an immigrant and I can’t begin to understand why anyone would have travelled outside their country of citizenship and permanent residency in the last year.

Citizenship isn’t only about privileges; there is also a long list of duties and responsibilities."
2021-05-03 19:35,"The season February to May is wedding season in India, and I think many Australians of Indian origin have travelled back for this reason (and the Mangos). India doesn’t allow dual nationality. In hindsight dare I say this wasn’t the year for either travelling back to the old country, nor for the big indian wedding. I wonder if people were deluded into a false sense of security with many news reports earlier this year saying that India had escaped the high Covid numbers found elsewhere. There are many diasporas around the world who rely on numerous cheap flights to enable them to travel back to their original homelands as often as possible. If we are to continue enjoying such privileges we need to eradicate or at least find some control over this worrying virus. This means sacrifices and a huge effort by everyone."

2021-05-03 20:05,"For over a year anyone entering Australia has had to undergo a strict two week quarantine by isolation. A family member of mine did this - it means two weeks locked inside a hotel room without even a key to the room. But the upside is that the country has been living life more or less as normal for a long time now.
The new restriction on people entering from India is harsh, but don't forget that anyone who is affected by it could have travelled to Australia at any time in the last year."
2021-05-03 20:12,"This ban is patently bigoted. When the British variant surged in November/December, Australia did not ban white Australians wanting to return home. When the virus raged in the US with thousands of deaths, flights still operated between the US and Australia. To prevent your own citizens from returning home (have whatever quarantining and testing you want) defies the laws of citizenship. Im sure Indian-Australians who pay taxes to the Australian government feel abandoned. They have not even let their own cricket team back from India (which they sanctioned to travel)."
2021-05-03 19:44,"It's clear from the fact that australia allowed its citizens & perm residents from other countries where the pandemic raged but not India that this is a racist policy.

2021-05-03 20:07,"Australian officials seem to be showing their true colors regarding  their treatment of Australian citizens of Indian descent and it is shameful.   There has never been an attempt by any country at any time in history to criminally penalize its own citizens for returning to THEIR country.  This is abominable. Australian officials never even thought about penalizing their citizens upon their return from he U.S and the U.S. has recorded almost 600,000 deaths, the majority of which occurred during and because of the ineptitude of the Trump Administration.     Let us not, however, be too surprised,  Australia has a history of maltreatment when  it comes to people of color.   We need look no further than the Aborigines."
2021-05-03 19:43,"The Australian government (and I hope not Australians) shows its true color.  Vietnam and Thailand, two poorer SE Asian countries with sizable overseas population, have been repatriating their citizens and are able to provide quarantined facilities."
2021-05-03 19:50,"“Fifty-seven percent of the positive cases in quarantine had been arrivals from India,” Foreign Minister Marise Payne said on Sunday. “It was placing a very, very significant burden on health and medical services in states and territories.”

Australia has not descended into the Covid horror show we see in India, the United States, and the UK because their government took this pandemic seriously from the get go. People who believe that ""human rights"" involves limitless travel in the middle of the worst pandemic since 1918 are not to be taken seriously."
2021-05-03 20:02,"I'm sorry but if you're a citizen of a country, you owe it to your fellow citizens not to put them in danger during a pandemic.  You should not be traveling around the globe during these times but if you insist, then you take the consequences."
2021-05-03 20:07,"It seems we've learned there are 2 national approaches to Covid:  stop by any means necessary (China, Taiwan, Australia,  New Zealand, etc.) or mitigate/live with it (everyone else, including the U.S. and Europe).

There's not much room for in between because once you have a dispersed low level outbreak you have to impose a hard lockdown to get the spread back down to 0.  And that's very costly.  

For Australia and New Zealand, the ""stop by any means necessary"" approach was possible because they are an island nation pretty geographically isolated.  Given that they already managed to get cases to 0, a strict no entry rule from Covid hot spots seems like a rational policy.  If they are committed to 0 cases they have too much to lose by making a mistake.

This contrasts with the U.S. approach on travel bans which was too little too late to halt the importation of the virus.  Even if you reduce international arrivals by 90% you ultimately aren't stopping the spread, only somewhat mitigating/slowing.  Hence the argument our protocols were a big charade.  Trump touted a China travel ban while potentially thousands of Covid positive travelers returned from elsewhere.

That said, Australia could try an approach where they are ultra-careful with quarantines.  It's too risky to leave to commercial air carriers--instead they could have citizens flown to military bases, held for more like 21 days and then released subject to monitoring."
2021-05-03 19:41,"What is deeply concerning to me as an Australian is that the most up-to-date poll shows the large majority of Australians are fully behind our government's telling Indian Australian citizens that for the good of our country they are required to stay in India and face alone the possibility of illness and death.  No other country in the world, to my knowledge, supports discarding their citizens in this way."
2021-05-03 19:45,"Well, it's unfortunate for these people, however they chose to travel via airplane, during an unpredictable once in a hundred year PanDoomic, what did they expect? Smart people lose all common sense, and then cry when they have to face the responsibility for their actions."
2021-05-03 19:55,"People should not have been traveling period. Only government officials, aid groups and medical professionals had any “urgent” need to travel. 

Had the world gotten serious from the start, it would not have spread so badly. 

New Zealand and North Korea shut it all down and as a result have had much less spread. 

An emergency is exactly that...an emergency. Special actions have to be taken and inconvenience incurred. 

Trying to manage a pandemic and keep convenience has made this situation so much worse."
2021-05-03 20:01,"Why would anyone drop a 5-year-old off in another country during a pandemic (surge or no surge)?  Yes she should be a priority for repatriation, but her situation is not the fault of the government.  The variant is dangerous and I think the US should also ban returns from India unless two weeks absolute quarantine and a negative test can be done.  Has nothing to do with color--same reasoning if Sweden had this variant."
2021-05-03 20:12,"What’s the right thing to do? Can see, even agree with, both sides.
So I asked myself what if it were Ebola? (I find Ebola even scarier than COVID.)
If I were at home and Ebola had not penetrated my country, I would want my government to protect me from exposure to those coming from countries where it had penetrated and was running rampant.
If I were trying to get back home from a country where Ebola was running rampant but my country wouldn’t let me back in, I can imagine feeling like my country’s policy might be tantamount to condemning me to suffering, maybe even death. I hope I would be able to accept my country’s need to protect as many people as possible. But easier said than done.
And if, by some miracle, a strict quarantine could adequately protect people in my home country, I hope I would be grateful for the way back in. No griping about rights.
This double-edged sword problem is part of the tragedy of a pandemic. Somebody stands to lose either way.
Meanwhile, COVID and Ebola are viruses. The only thing they do is replicate. The only way they can replicate is by hijacking the cells of a host. To a virus, a host’s rights are meaningless."
2021-05-03 19:20,Do the Australian's who are in India and have active COVID-19 cases really expect to be permitted to travel to Australia now?
2021-05-03 18:21,Inhumane and unnecessary.
2021-05-03 20:16,"When you consider that Australia went ahead and held the Australian Open tennis tournament, with 2 week isolation, it seems somewhat over the top to keep small children in a place that has so many cases.  Two weeks in isolation for a few thousand people in a country the size of Australia should not overwhelm their health system."
2021-05-03 20:33,"So during a pandemic a child is dropped of with grandma for a ""visit"" in a country known for inadequate health care faculties.  In this country many people are returning to vacation spots like Florida and Las Vegas because ""business is open"". It remains to be seen how many return home with Covid.
   I am a liberal/progressive but  I do not take issue with Australia's policy. What would be ""inhumane"" is subjecting your healthy citizens to someone returning from a Covid hotspot . When Australians were allowing their citizens back from the US a year ago we did not have nearly the knowledge base of the virus that we have today. Australia has had 29,841 cases of Covid and  901 deaths and the US has had 32,031,068  cases with 577,000 deaths which indicates to me that they are doing everything right and we have done everything wrong.  I applaud them and encourage them to not give in to the pleadings of people many of whom did not have the sense to stay home."
2021-05-03 20:38,"The only relevant question is whether the government is right that its quarantine facilities would be overwhelmed and the community spread of the virus likely result. Nothing in the article disputes this. Those of us stuck in nations that failed to establish adequate quarantine arrangements at the start of the pandemic, and that are letting new variants arrive here frequently with no government quarantine, should only admire a nation that acted more wisely and has allowed its people to live normal lives through a year that has been traumatic for most of us. It's not humane to let infected people infect others. Empathy for them is outweighed by empathy for the many more who would be endangered by their return."
2021-05-03 20:40,"The decision by Australia is not about race or color of skin. It is a sound and rational one based on potential risks to millions in their country, especially since so far the number of cases have been remarkably low in Australia. I wonder what NZ is planning . I am sure there would be many NZ citizens too  right now in India . NZ has been Covid free for a very long time.I think this should be an eye opener for many Americans eager to get on the plane to Europe and elsewhere. You can't predict the situation in other countries you're planning to visit. Many are still way down in their vaccination rates (except perhaps UK). Europe has announced that it is open for vaccinated tourists from USA but should American tourists really be hasty amid the risks posed by international travel ?"
2021-05-03 20:44,"The incorrect use of statistics by ignorant (or worse) policy makers when dealing with India is not just confined to infection rates. It spans many other areas, including carbon emissions. 

As this article says about Covid infection rates, ""Its per capita infection rate is still lower than what it was in the United States and in many parts of Europe during their recent peaks.""

In case of carbon emissions, most narrative in the US is ""India is the 3rd largest carbon emitter"". (Actual numbers: US 5.4GT, India 2.7 GT in 2018). Never mentioned in that narrative is the only real measure that matters: per-capita emissions. Where India is at 1.8 MT and we are at 17.6 MT. 

We let our policymakers set the agenda in our name based on false data all the time. As a US citizen, I do NOT feel happy that our politicians are able to divert attention, for example, away from our own egregious carbon emissions by talking aggregate numbers. It does NOT benefit me that we are emitting that much carbon and dodging real solutions. 

Similarly, all Australians need to ask their policy makers why India was singled out (first time ever its own citizens were barred from returning) when the EU and US had higher per-capita infections and they were not banned. The argument that the *number* of people returning matters doesn't wash because there always was more travel to/from Australia with EU & US than India ever had."
2021-05-03 20:45,It's worth noting that the Australian government notified its citizens before it closed its borders early last year that they might not be able to return if they didn't do so at that time. That announcement was made well in advance in anticipation of a situation like this. No Australian citizen in India 12 months later can claim that they weren't warned.
2021-05-03 20:48,"Was shocked to hear this. We are in a very good position at the moment with low case numbers, none being locally acquired. Our quarantine system is not effective at containing the virus,  which led to a lengthy lock down last year. But still, compared to many other countries we should be able to support our citizens in need."
2021-05-03 20:20,"As we might say in Australia ""this is a bit much""!  To be threatened with jail time  because you want to bring your 5 year-old, who is a citizen, back to Australia is ridiculous and excessive.  Australian quarantine practices offer a bunch of alternatives and they have worked very well.  They should be used.  And while you are about it get the vaccine program rolling."
2021-05-03 20:56,"Is not  the Australian  government conservative?
rest my case."
2021-05-03 20:51,"Its understandable..  India has an enormous outbreak of Covid, with mutating virus strains..  It's a case of looking out for the larger good of the country, at the expense of  a few.
  --Certainly if India was not having this dangerous outbreak, Australia would not be imposing such harsh measures"
2021-05-03 20:23,Are there really so very many Australians trapped in India that their government cannot quarantine and treat them safely? With only 300 cases in the entire country it seems incredible that they cannot find space to isolate returnees and treat any who are sick.  Leaving citizens to die in a country that has no hospital room or oxygen is appalling. India should not be asked to shoulder the added burden of these individuals when their own country has abundant resources.
2021-05-03 20:27,"Australia has the capacity to repatriate and quarantine its citizens currently in India. It has allowed Australians to return from other COVID-19 hotspots with mandatory quarantine - mainly in specified hotels. Contact tracing in all Australian states is excellent and recent hotel outbreaks have been contained. It is not an ideal solution in the long-term but the national government is refusing to build quarantine facilities. To declare it illegal for citizens to return is outrageous and possibly unconstitutional. We have a lazy rather incompetent right wing national government that has two main reasons for taking this action. The first is to appear 'strong' on borders with an eye to the next election. The states have been doing the heavy lifting during the epidemic and the electorate knows that. The federal government wants to get some credit. Second, they think they can get away with this because many or most of the citizens involved were born in India. They are appealing to what they believe is an innate racist tendency of Australians. This is extremely cynical and now looks like a serious mistake in the face of a growing backlash."
2021-05-03 20:43,"This pandemic has been going on for well over a year now. 
Why has Australia not expanded their quarantine facilities?
Covid is not going away. In two or three years, when everyone has finally had access to a vaccine, there will still be billions of people that refuse it. 
These countries with ‘zero-case’ policies and fully closed borders are going to need to adapt to function in a world that has covid because that’s the world we live in now and it’s not going to change. 
The fact that it has now been 14 months and Australia still doesn’t even have enough quarantine facilities for their own citizens is a disgrace."
2021-05-03 20:15,"Why were these people traveling to begin with? And there needs to be a lot of empathy for people already in Australia - they do not want to have covid. Human rights using the word ""outrage"" is inappropriate. And these people are left stranded, in their country of origin. Familiar surroundings. Every time you turn around - someone calls someone a racist - it has nothing to do with racism. Covid simply is a lot worse in some places than others - and responsible citizens who stayed home during a world wide pandemic have every right to protect themselves."
2021-05-03 20:30,"What did anyone expect of Australia, who knows her and her anti white policies that she had avidly  practiced since becoming  a dominion in 1901? 

If these were white Australians or Britons nothing of the sort would have happened except to show proof of vaccination or a negative test. 

The problem with our large neighbour to the west of us (I am a Kiwi) is that unlike us in New Zealand who have had very good relationships relations with the Maori (indeed follow many of their customs) that Australia never had a civil rights era with it’s aborigines who they still treat with disgusting contempt. Why should I be surprised now about how Australia treats its people who are not white?"
2021-05-03 20:31,Any person regardless of citizenship can carry the virus. An Indian citizen is no more likely to have the virus than an Australian citizen. If it is too dangerous to let Indian citizens fly from the subcontinent then it is too dangerous to allow Australian citizens to fly in.
2021-05-03 20:39,"Australia and New Zealand may have been the envy (for some) during the height of this pandemic. But their zero tolerance will make it very hard to open up, as the public have been primed to believe not one case of Covid can be accepted.

 This virus will be with us for ever, as the world will never reach herd immunity. Australia will keep their borders closed for a long time, with repercussions to their economy."
2021-05-03 20:35,"Indians can blame racism, tribalism, colonialism, whatever, for Australia's response. But who in their right mind travels to a country with a challenged healthcare system during a once in a millennium pandemic? 

And India the country has nobody to blame for its current predicament other than its president, Modi, and its people's willingness to disregard pandemic precautions and embrace huge religious gatherings that everybody knew were going to be a problem."
2021-05-03 20:26,Australia the country that doesn’t want its people move to America better by far.
2021-05-03 20:16,Of course this is inhumane and a violation of citizenship. If you want to protect everyone else have returning citizens isolate for two weeks. Put them in supervised rooms if you must. But telling them they aren't welcome home is unconscionable.
2021-05-03 20:18,"Many commenters must have missed this part:  ""Penalties of up to five years in prison and nearly 60,000 Australian dollars ($46,300) in fines."" The govt. has criminalized something that was not illegal when the Australian citizens went to India. And without any kind of parliamentary vote. It's unconscionable."
2021-05-03 20:33,"Australia has suspended travel from India for anyone, not just people of Indian descent, and, as such, is a public health decision and not a racist one. The decision was announced nationally and not ‘quietly’ as reported.  It is hoped that the suspension will last for about two weeks.  The reason for the suspension is the high rate of infections among people returning from India threatening to overwhelm the system.  It is the same decision made by about half a dozen other countries.

Border security penalties are not new.  The current penalties are the consequence of a small number of people who acted to bypass the restrictions.  Australia already has penalties for breaching public health directives for all citizens, as do many other countries.

$30,000 for a flight is a fabricated amount.

Australia is helping India by sending ventilators, PPE and other equipment, and probably in other ways, too.

Australia declared a medical emergency before the WHO, with border restrictions in place earlier than most other countries.  People still chose to seek permission to travel overseas despite being told that return could not be guaranteed.

Unaccompanied minors cannot be returned while quarantine requirements are in place.

During this pandemic, Australia was and is one of the safest places in the world because of the government’s efforts, both federal and state, to manage public health risk.

Damien Cave’s article is so one-sided, it is surprising it doesn’t tip off the page."
2021-05-03 20:35,"In the pandemic, there are no good solutions - we are all just looking to choose the least worst.  

I strongly oppose the Australian government preventing citizens from leaving the country - we aren't communist Russia.  I also oppose blanket bans on returns from one country - like they have done with India.  

However, I fully support them restricting the number of citizens and non-citizens who can enter the country.  By preventing the quarantine system from being overwhelmed, the government is protecting the right of Australians within the country to health and safety.  Forced to choose between two competing rights, I believe the government has made the least worst decision."
2021-05-03 20:59,"Good for Australia!

If only the US had been similarly strong about barring foreign entries and restricting internal movements, especially shutting down NYS, back last March, this country’s covid trajectory might have been very different."
2021-05-03 21:16,"Millions of Australians have sacrificed a huge amount for the greater good of the community. We heard of endless stories of people having to miss funerals and weddings of loved ones. People have died alone, and the mental health and financial impact caused to vast numbers who endured lengthy solitary lockdowns, is immeasurable.
Given the state of the crisis in India, and considering the battle Australia has endured to reach normalcy, there isn't a single justifiable reason to travel abroad and to jeopardize the health of an entire population. Additionally, there comes a point where the window of opportunity to return home, closes.
Citizenship doesn't purely afford you rights and privileges. It imposes huge responsibilities upon you."
2021-05-03 21:18,"Many of the comments below are based on false assumptions. For one, Australians are travelling overseas and back and have been for the last few months - many to the US where the virus is far worse than in India. A large percentage of Australians were born overseas - some are allowed to travel on compassionate leave to look after families who are badly off or ill. Others, like those in the IPL have travelled to play sport. These things might seem inconsistent but they have been permitted by authorities. There's an outcry over the India policy because it highlights the government's attempts to reverse previous decisions in a particularly ham-fisted fashion. We have the resources - and the legal obligation - to bring citizens home."
2021-05-03 21:25,"While Australia and New Zealand have done a commendable job of keeping COVID in check, they can't be isolated from the world forever. When they eventually open up, COVID will eventually get there. To be prepared for that day, the will need to vaccinate their populations, but so far they are lagging well behind most countries. Seems these countries were either late in ordering vaccines, or didn't order enough. Will they come to the countries like the U.S. or U.K. asking for us to donate our excess? Maybe we should only help them if they agree to help their own citizens return to their countries."
2021-05-03 21:26,"Wow, it appears from the comments that many people are assuming the Australians in India were just on vacation and could have easily returned earlier if they wanted to...
I wouldn't be too quick to make that assumption. This article is lacking enough detail to make assumptions about people's circumstances. This ban only just went into effect, yet the 5 year old mentioned hasn't been able to return for a YEAR. What's going on? Have flights to Australia completely stopped for a year? If so, how were these people supposed to get back? 
What about expats or people who travel for work, do we just abandon them? Most developed nations expect they might need to repatriate their citizens in a crisis. We Americans let our citizens come home from Italy when they were going through the worst of the outbreak. The dangers of repatriation are manageable if you're willing to set up enough facilities for quarantine, Australia apparently is not willing, and most Australians are fine with it."
2021-05-03 21:32,"New Zealand also banned anyone coming from India (including citizens) but only for 2 weeks. Now citizens (but not permanent residents) are allowed in but the airlines have stopped flights.
I don't think the response is disproportionate. The cases highlighted in our media all left NZ recently despite the risks and all have dual citizenship.
Since our borders closed last March (both Australia and NZ), lots of families have been split up. It is the price we pay to be Covid free."
2021-05-03 20:59,why they did not return earlier?  this is life and death.  Piroerities.
2021-05-03 21:16,"If Indians were whites like people in the UK or the US, they would be allowed to come home.

That's EXACTLY what happened during the height of pandemic in those two countries earlier.

By the same token, the current conservative Australian government locks up asylum seekers in remote island, out of sigh and out of mind.

If that is not institutionalized racism, what is?"
2021-05-03 21:06,"MOST reasonable, compassionate, problem-solving countries would establish secure quarantine centres and bring its citizens home.
Australia HAS military/immigration bases and needs only to fire them up.
But no. We take a sledgehammer approach. Crazy."
2021-05-03 19:27,Anyone who has lived in Australia for a bit or has family there knows fascism is alive and well. There was no similar ban on citizens returning from the US or UK during serious outbreaks there. This speaks for itself.
2021-05-03 20:33,"So the Australian government is showing leadership and common sense for the good of the country as a whole. When Biden decides to show some real leadership, not poll based leadership, he will pass a law that requires every physically able citizen in the USA to get a Covid vaccine and then he needs to deal with the push back!"
2021-05-03 21:09,"What do you expect?  Australia has very strict immigration rules.  If you arrive by boat without a VISA, they send you to some remote islands with very difficult surroundings in order to make you want to return to your country of origin.  Australia is ruthless to illegal immigrants.  Australia's COVID policy is what Spock said, ""The needs of the many outweigh the few."""
2021-05-03 21:11,I know we have to protect ourselves from the covid outbreak and India is a real mess but some empathy and compassion could be used No doubt the Government will pick up votes for this move just as they have for keeping a family of four on Christmas Island for 2 years at a cost of over 50 million dollars As a country we have to protect ourselves from this pandemic but some empathy and Christian values could be used and go a long way
2021-05-03 21:19,Global travel should have halted from India several weeks back.
2021-05-03 20:56,Not visiting Australia anytime soon. Many ways to quarantine people but not this way. Where is the common humanity in people?
2021-05-03 21:21,This is just wrong.Why not set up a hospital and isolation center and send planes for your citizens who want to come come.
2021-05-03 21:28,Australia should just announce that they have not got the Brains or know-how to run a quarantine facility for their citizens and ask for help from first world countries.
2021-05-03 20:29,is this principle applying to marriage too?
2021-05-03 21:00,Australia is huge - can’t they set up a quarantine facility away from the cities and repatriate citizens there ?
2021-05-03 21:33,"Setting up large, efficient and humane quarantine stations was an easy win - but this national government is too useless to take responsibility for managing the return of its own citizens. Very strange, considering how much they enjoy setting up concentration camps for asylum seekers."
2021-05-03 21:30,"We do know about the ban on Australians coming home from India and we are furious.
Our PM is part of a fundamentalist church who, just last week, was filmed saying he performed ‘laying on of hands’ to people without their knowledge or consent when he went to bushfire ravaged areas.
This new racist ban is par for the course.
‘ScoMo has got to go’"
2021-05-03 21:18,"My wife is Australian and cannot get home. My kids can’t see their grandparents there. Her relatives won’t recognize my kids by the time we are able to get over there. It’s pretty awful but you know what? Australia’s right! How many have died there per capita vs. the USA or anywhere else save New Zealand and a few island in the South Pacific ? If I’m Scott Morrison I’d do it again any day or the week. 
The real story over there is the sluggishness of vaccinations. 30 million or so people with all their resources and nearly no ones been offered the vaccination yet. They need to step it up and get it done - this isn’t a white vs India thing as some are suggesting here- it’s Australians right to self preservation and they clearly value life in this case over politics - 

Maybe if America had self- restraint - both in discipline during the pandemic and in weight management prior to , our country could have avoided some of the misery- 

Of course though, Austrailia has the big advantage of being able to fully control its borders and is much more in control over its own destiny by virtue of its geography"
2021-05-03 21:03,"This makes perfect sense to me, actually it's a smart move.  The reporting states that ""Fifty-seven percent of the positive cases in quarantine had been arrivals from India,”  That's a staggering number that cannot be just overlooked. 

If you really want to stop the disease from spreading stop people where the disease is at unimaginable levels from entering. The virus doesn't care what nationality you are. It's really that simple."
2021-05-03 21:20,"Everyone is free to exercise their beliefs but they (even involuntarily) want others to share in the ""benefits"" that accompany. The many COVIDeniers running amuck in the United states will not stop running to hospitals once they get sick even as they insist it is ""just bronchitis"" even as they lie dying & have caused a few others to die as well. Many had varied reasons to go to India, some urgent some not so & many (prudently) held back. No one knew anything about the seriousness of the variants earlier - not the visitors, not Australia. Vaccines are available but the virus seems to be one step ahead. Now the chips have fallen where they have & no decision made will be perfect. That's how it unfortunately will end by being in this once in a century Pandemic..."
2021-05-03 21:03,"Can we all please try to remember that rights are not absolute? Rights, in most every bill of rights, are balanced against other rights and interests. Those of you in the US, see your supreme court’s tiered system of scrutiny. In Canada and Europe, see your courts’ rights balancing tests. International legal rights also are generally not enacted as absolute protections. 

There is a right to bodily integrity and a right to life. Those are rights too, even if it is a virus, and not a government, that threatens them."
2021-05-03 21:22,"Throughout history in times of plague the rights of citizens have been curtailed for the good of the community. That is exactly what has kept Australians safe during this pandemic. 

The India ban also applies to Australian cricketers (of all colors) currently playing in India for millions of dollars."
2021-05-03 21:09,It may seem harsh but most of the people in India chose to leave Australia’s shores after it was well and truly known there was a pandemic going on. Yes I feel bad for those people but this is not a normal world right now and they have to actively understand it is a risky game to travel. Most Australians are not even travelling interstate as even our state borders have had constant closures. We have to put the safety of 25 million people above a couple of thousand. It’s nothing to do with race.   Brazil may be next.
2021-05-03 21:28,"Australia is protecting the majority from a very small minority of people who should have realised early on that borders could shut. Also Australia has historically had very tight borders, I lived and worked there from 2011 - 2016 so have some familiarity with their immigration department. Miss the land down under and wish I was still there."
2021-05-03 21:01,"People forget the Australian govt gave our citizens plenty of warning on borders closing last year. Wouldn’t you agree that there’s a hierarchy of principles the govt needs to assert, the first being to protect the general health of Australians in Australia?"
2021-05-03 21:02,The attitude of many respondents seems to be that it's the travelers' own damn fault that they left  the country and were in India.   So much for solidarity with fellow citizens.   Why was there not such a ban when the UK was in the throes of the pandemic?   We know why.   That would have been unthinkable.
2021-05-03 21:44,The policy of restricting travel from India to Australia makes sense to avoid spreading COVID. But I would have thought that Australia would have at least flown its people to a quarantine zone to get them out of the COVID war zone.
2021-05-03 21:49,"Australia doesn't have proper dedicated quarantine facilities for returning citizens.  The use of hotels for quarantine has been a failure.  The virus regularly escapes into the community.

Australia has not vaccinated enough of its people.  It now seems that great majority Australians won't be vaccinated until end 2022.

Those activists who are agitating for Australia to open its borders to citizens wanting to return from India lack common sense."
2021-05-03 21:51,"This is a dumb policy, but it’s not racist.

The author missed out an important fact, the ban was put in place because Australians in India were not listening to the governments original order to not return homw, they were flying to Doha first, and then flying onto Australia where they were overwhelming the quarantine system. Australia’s quarantine system can only handle 2% positive infection rate for returnees. During the UK 2nd wave and variant, all citizens were banned then, but there wasn’t a way around the rule… Singapore and other countries had banned people from the UK too and therefore weren’t able to return to Australia.

One other thing, we don’t know that this triple variant in India isn’t worse than anything else before it, we don’t know if the vaccines are effective against it. With the elimination policy in place in Aus, it’s too risky to take these people in, right now. 

Finally, no one yet has discussed Australia’s tight bio-security, it’s local fauna is at risk from infection if this disease spreads in Australia, we have no idea of that potential risk to these unique mammals, but we only have to look at the mass culling of minks in Europe to understand the risks."
2021-05-03 21:41,"What strikes me is the lack of compassion, we're people too.

We're all someone's daughter, we're all someone's son.

No one is saying people in Australia haven't also experienced hardship because of the Covid-19 lockdown responses, however it is important to understand that the experiences of other countries and Australian's overseas is vastly different, at time more dangerous and even deadly.

I can understand the need to maintain border control. The Australian health care system is easily over loaded, Queensland recently experienced this when it would admit any positive case into care, an outbreak in the community would be devastating. However, this has been known to doctors and officials for many years and there has been no government policy to improve this. Why hasn't the government been using these last 13 months to improve hospital facilities and quarantine availabilty and facilities? Why not make Australia covid capable rather than covid incompetent?

It also overlooked that hotel quarantine was initially introduced in part to provide financing for the hotel industry. If it was truly considered an effective and important covid control measure then why aren't Australian's who are already in Australia who test positive not transported to hotel quarantine too? Why are they allowed to quarantine at home?

We're all weathering this storm together, some of us just have better boats. Perhaps those with those boats should be doing more to helps those who are on sinking ships."
2021-05-03 21:46,Liberal ex Prime Minister Tony Abbott has travelled freely to and from covid ravaged England.  England's population is listed as 432 per square Kilometre. India's 328. Our government has a very white old boys club.
2021-05-03 21:35,"Maybe now we Americans can stop being lectured to, by Australians, about the way we treat our minorities.  They can't even be bothered to care if their own citizens live or die."
2021-05-03 21:59,"A virus doesn't care or know what race or ethnicity you are or anything about your cultural heritage. We need to be equally hardnosed and focused in our fight against it.

I commend the Australian government's decision and would suggest that Biden add this pragmatic tool to America's Covid-fighting toolkit. It's a fairly blunt tool, but when used with the others, a helpful one."
2021-05-03 22:05,"As an Australian, I'm disappointed at the Federal Government's lack of decisive and effective efforts to allow citizens back in the country. Immigration is a Federal Government responsibility as outlined in our Constitution, however our sorry excuse for a Prime Minister refuses to have a national quarantine facility to ensure our citizens can come home and isolate safely. If the Morrison Government had established national quarantine over 12 months ago and directed chartered flights there from the start of the pandemic, Australians would feel safer. Unfortunately this is not the case, States are left to coordinate, quarantine and care for infected returning Australians in major cities that hold the majority of our population.
Of course we as a nation are nervous! We are watching the pandemic get worse and worse with our neighbours. We want to stay safe. I condone the Morrison Government's decision to fine and ban our citizens from coming home. This could have been avoided if the government had a sufficient response to the pandemic initially."
2021-05-03 21:56,"No other democratic country has imposed a ban on arrivals from India in the manner Australia has. Very few countries, democratic or otherwise, have dealt with the pandemic as well as Australia has through specific actions, community compliance, and good fortune. India, the world’s biggest democracy, has set records for incompetence, cynicism and fatalism in its traitorously inept handling of the coronavirus. 

According to the Australian Commonwealth Medical Officer, due to the high proportion of positive cases arising from arrivals from India, a pause until 15 May 2021 on arrivals from India was considered to be an effective and proportionate measure to maintain the integrity of Australia's quarantine system. 

So, returnees from India were arriving infected and in such numbers to threaten the quarantine system and Australia’s COVID-free status. What’s a sensible government to do? Install a pause, or just pretend, like many other countries, India especially, that domestic politics trump biological reality?"
2021-05-03 22:01,"Absolutely amazing.

What is the purpose of citizenship if a country can keep you from returning to your home?

How does this at all construe with the social contract between the governed and the government in a democracy.

Oz has taken a number of autocratic actions during Covid, including isolating its constituent states from each other.  

It has now moved from anti-democratic actions against regions to the individual level.

How does a citizen hold allegiance to a government that doesn't hold allegiance to the citizen?"
2021-05-03 22:18,"The US has been refusing entry to Permanent Residents in some cases as well, I know of PR returning form Brazil who have been sent back - even when accompanying their citizen spouses. It's not mentioned in the wh.gov info, but it's been happening none the less."
2021-05-03 22:41,Risk potential spread/death or ask its citizens currently in India to wait it out? This is a temporary ban -- and I hope the Australians in India do not get infected and are taking necessary precautions.
2021-05-03 22:20,"What people are forgetting is the 2 week hotel quarantine only works if you are in fact uninfected or have a mild case. If you have a more severe case, you cannot be left in a hotel room for 2 weeks by yourself. You were either need to be brought to a hospital or a hospital brought to you. That means contact with doctors and nurses who may then become infected themselves. 

Also, an infected person may infect others on the flight like fellow returnees, airline staff or pilots. 

A negative test before boarding makes it less likely you would be infectious on the flight, but it doesn’t solve the problem of getting sick after landing and needing medical attention.

I don’t entirely agree with what Australia is doing but it’s not as simple as “just quarantine” because up to a quarter of the returnees may become sick and have to travel to a hospital or have healthcare workers visit them. Both of those things risk community spread."
2021-05-03 22:49,"The point that needs to be made is that travellers from overseas are the ONLY reason there is still any Covid-19 infection in Australia. Inconceivable though it may be to a US audience, Australia has successfully eliminated community transmission of the virus multiple times, i.e., community cases (meaning those outside the quarantine hotels) have been zero for extended periods on multiple occasions, only for the virus to leak out from quarantine hotels and re-infect the community. 

The typical situation in Australia is that the only people with Covid are recently arrived travellers who are still in quarantine. About once every month or two, say, a bus driver who drives people from the airport to the quarantine hotel gets infected. There is then feverish contact tracing and perhaps a short lockdown in order to stamp out the infection in the community. This succeeds and the community is Covid-free until the next outbreak from the quarantine hotels.

Long term, we need better quarantine arrangements so the virus doesn't leak out. Short term, protecting the community means maintaining tight control over international travel."
2021-05-03 22:52,As an Australian stuck overseas (I cannot afford a flight back or the quarantine fees) I am outraged that my country of citizenship has turned it’s back on us. I’m scared. I want to go home. I am vaccinated. I am an Australian. What is the use of my citizenship????
2021-05-03 22:43,"Not only will this place stranded Australians in jeopardy in India, it will fuel racist attitudes. The rationale is clear: ‘real’ Australians are ‘at home’ and anyone who made the choice to visit relatives in India during the pandemic is an outsider who deserves to be locked out.  
The country makes a good pretence of being ashamed of the likes of Pauline Hanson, but there’s a bit of Pauline lurking in the majority of White Australians."
2021-05-03 22:15,It’s a disease that they can’t control . Very tough decision .
2021-05-03 22:28,"With so few infected at home, it is absurd to suggest that Australia cannot contain and monitor its own returning citizens. India is also in no postion to look treat any Australians who become unwell. If any die, their blood will be on the Australian government's hands. The government should remember that they are there to serve and protect their citizens and not shamefully to deprive them of their rights and life."
2021-05-03 22:28,Why not just put them in quarantine?
2021-05-03 21:48,Now *that's* how you run a cordon sanitaire!
2021-05-03 22:26,"People who are coming back to their country can and should be quarantined until tested. As a basic human right, every person should have a government which is responsible for their welfare. That is what citizenship is. The reverse is also true that a person has their own responsibility towards their country. We see too often, people who are left outside a system of governance who are disowned by every country in the world. This type of depravity needs to end."
2021-05-03 22:56,"These are extraordinary times similar to wartime so they gotta do what they gotta do to protect Australia. 

Australia has no land borders so it is definitely possible to keep Covid out. 

In the US, a similar response would be a total waste because there is no effective way to keep Covid out with two long land borders even if air and sea travel were restricted to keep all air and sea travelers from India out."
2021-05-03 22:56,"Good for them. Our US travel bans are almost useless because of the large numbers of exceptions for citizens, permanent residents, other visas, and other reasons. Naturally people want to flee India, but, many will bring the plague with them. Italians fleeing their country at the beginning of the pandemic, trying to escape high case numbers and lockdowns, seeded the pandemic across the globe. Good for Australia for standing firm. In this country we foolishly elevate personal whim above the huge risks to our entire population's health."
2021-05-03 22:38,"Perhaps before everyone, especially well meaning Australians pounce on their governments, one might want to read what the new variant, difficult to detect with a PCR, is all about. The fact that it is now hidden from a rather accurate test makes it difficult to bring folks into a country that may be ill equipped to deal with an outbreak of covid. We are hearing of Indian-Americans who have had two doses of Pfizer coming down with covid quite severely. Till the research and medical establishment can be sure that these new multi-mutated sarscov2 variants behave exactly as the original strains, how on earth can folks simply expect governments and hospitals to make allowances that may prove detrimental to the populace at large?"
2021-05-03 23:03,I suppose the is a 3rd option... solitary confinement for 2 weeks upon return in hotels of Australia’s choice. As citizens of Australia they deserve some help from their country... but Australia gets to dictate the terms for the common good of all the other Australians that have rights too. These people who traveled took the risk... and by doing so they must take some responsibility.
2021-05-03 22:01,"Those of you commenting from the United States are really misinformed to be making the assumption Australian’s are just “traveling” during the pandemic. In fact the opposite is true. 

The Australian government does not (and has not) allowed Australian citizens or permanent residents to leave for the past year with out a government approved exemption and these are not granted for most requests. Those leaving are doing so for business or because of a dire family situation for the most part. You cannot leave for a vacation or because you miss your family. 

Numbers of incoming travelers are heavily restricted. All international arrivals must quarantine in a hotel for 14 days at their own expense. 

Read the article more carefully before making comments like “people shouldn’t be traveling”. You clearly have no idea what is happening here and no idea what you’re talking about."
2021-05-03 23:12,"All the citizens of Australia (other than the aborigines) are ""immigrants). 

I'm reminded of Nevil Shute's novel On the Beach where Australia is the last area of humanity to succumb to the fallout from a nuclear war, which was the existential crisis of the day (& still is in the list of possible and pending crisis's). There were some who believed that their isolation would protect them from the consequences of humanity's folly, it didn't. 

The same mindset continues in the fortress Australia mindset, that's funny (not ha ha but tragic) since climate change denial and a robust coal industry hasn't ""protected"" Australia from the consequences of climate change.

And letting their citizens sicken and die in India won't ""protect"" them from Covid either, it won't protect any of us. In a world that is linked by globalization, (globalization that Australians have had no problem taking advantage of) the same dynamic that makes their prosperity possible makes the virus and its offshoots a continuing threat. A threat that isolation will not stop. There's a consequence for such indifference, I wonder if the Australian public and their politicians are willing to pay it?"
2021-05-03 23:28,"There seem to be a lot of people from the US commenting about Australians choosing to travel overseas in the midst of the pandemic. As other Australians have tried to make clear, our international borders have been closed since March last year and we cannot leave the country without a federal government exemption. Exemptions are very hard to get and are generally only given for compassionate reasons. There are only a limited number of flights coming into the country to repatriate Australians stuck overseas, and at present there are +30,000 Australians who are still unable to get home, including 9,000 in India. It's not simply a matter of getting on a plane and coming home, which appears to be the prevailing misunderstanding in these comments. Limited flights, many flights cancelled at the last minute, and exorbitant ticket costs (thousands of dollars) mean many are trapped where they are. I have lived and worked in Asia for nearly two decades, and was lucky to get a flight back in March last year - but it was purely luck. Many thousands of others were not as fortunate. Saying that people are paying the price for their ""choice"" to stay overseas or to travel overseas during the pandemic is a misunderstanding of the context. The onus of responsibility falls on the federal government, which, despite repeated calls from state governments and medical experts, has failed to build quarantine facilities outside of major cities to enable more Australians to be brought home safely."
2021-05-03 23:08,"Living in Perth, Western Australia, we have been fortunate enough through Covid to not even need masks as it was not in the community for many months. Now for the first time, we have to wear masks when in public due to two recent breaks in the quarantine system. Everybody is doing this without protest, everybody knows if there is more community transmission we will go into lockdown again, which we just came out of due to the first recent hotel quarantine breach. I believe that when people accuse the the India travel ban of being a racist policy they are going official numbers, when most people believe the actual number of infections in India are many times this. Even though there are downsides, the government here is doing what it can to protect the majority of its residents and citizens and have earned our trust doing it. I could not have been dealt a luckier hand living in Perth during Covid."
2021-05-03 23:21,"This is a complex situation and all roads lead back to the complete failure of our conservative federal government in almost every aspect of the pandemic.  Many of our successful pandemic policies were pushed by state premiers first and then adopted at a federal level.  
 
The biggest failure of the federal government was not signing contracts for multiple vaccines when they were in development.  They bought only Astra Zeneca about 6 months after the UK and the US signed contacts for 3 different vaccines.  Now with the issue of blood clots, they are only advising AZ for those over 50.  We're 11 million doses short of the current phase target of 13.6 million doses.  Politicians and first responders get Phizer at $23/dose, over 50's get AZ at $4/dose and a roll of the blood clot roulette wheel.  If we we're on track with vaccinations, we wouldn't be as vulnerable to a country wide shutdown.

Where does compassion intersect with stupidity?  Perth, a city of 2 million people, was sent into lockdown because a person was allowed to travel to India to attend a wedding recently and returned with Covid which escaped hotel quarantine. I have compassion for those who have been stuck in India since the beginning, but those who chose to leave Australia in the last year, not so much."
2021-05-03 23:33,"f my memory serves me well, UK Matt Hancock downplayed how extremely contagious the B.1.1.7 by claiming the B.1.351 was much more contagious in addition to being more vaccine resistant.  Although the science said otherwise in terms of transmissibility, many scientists and the general Public outside of South Africa believed the UK.

It was not until much later they admitted the B.1.1.7 was 50 to 60% more transmissible than the D614G and was also more deadly.

The US did not know what variants were circulating in the country due to lack genomic surveillance and believing virus was not mutating that fast.  We found about the California and NY variants by chance and while looking for the B.1.1.7 and the B.1.351.  For a long time the US claimed not much was known about the California variants. Then the California variant was quietly classified as a VOC last month.

So I can understand why travelers from UK and US were not completely banned.  I do not necessarily agree with it."
2021-05-03 23:19,This is unbelievably harsh and unnecessary.They can be put in a strict quarantine upon return.But no government can allow itself citizens who die abroad because their government does not allow them to come back to their country.It is not like they will be  emitting deadly corona rays like a StarWars saber.

2021-05-03 23:37,It is foolish not to put a total ban on any travel from India to the US. I have a horrible premonition that the US will be dealing big time with the India variant by the end of summer. I really hope I am wrong but I don’t think we are anywhere near  done with this yet.
2021-05-04 0:13,"While there is clearly a minority/third world discrimination angle to this story, I think it would help if the story also pointed out that this affects superstar Aussie cricketers taking part in (and some who are providing TV commentary for) the Indian Premier League cricket tournament. Bizarrely, that tournament has carried on so far, but there are strong indications it might not for long. It'll be interesting to see whether Australia will throw these cricket superstars under the bus by preventing their return (and potentially endangering them), or whether that will cause a rethink on this blanket ban."

This is a man without a plan, be it climate change, bush fires, abuse of women in his government or a global pandemic.

2021-05-04 0:09,Australia is doing the right thing.  They need to protect the larger populace from those variants that are killing hundreds of thousands in India.  Why did those people even go to India in the middle of a pandemic anyway?
2021-05-03 23:15,"I am reading all sorts of comments about what the Australian government is doing is wrong etc.
There is more to the story and I believe the government is aware of this. There are many Indians here who come here, have children here and then take them back to be raised by their extended family. I have known of Indians who have done this. They do this so both the husband and wife can work full time, pay no child care here and gain other mostly financial benefits of the kid being raised in India.
So, I see nothing wrong with what the government is doing. We do not need the Indian variant of this virus here. It has already been difficult going and we do not need something else in the mix.
I find it unconscionable that there are people who are selfish on both ends, keep the family (esp kids) in India when things are a big tough here and then bring them back when the going gets tough there. 
Of course, there are others who just went there to visit and that is a bit different story. Perhaps their situation could be looked at differently, however they should consider it in the best interest of the Australian nation that they should not bring a contagious disease with them: as JFK said, “Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country"" which was originally said by Khalil Gibran!!!"
2021-05-03 23:59,"It's a tough choice. I feel for the people stuck in India. Note some are white Australians, it is not a racial choice.
The government banned direct flights from India after the current significant outbreak. Indirect flights were also effectively banned as the stopover countries also banned flights from India.
You would need some dastardly planning to still get here and that is what the penalties are about. And it's likely no court would apply the penalties, unless the sneaky traveler caused a major outbreak. The ban is only until May 15th.
Should any Australian stuck there get the virus and die, the Australian government will suffer. I suspect they're aware of the dangers and will work to lift the ban or find an alternative solution.
During Victoria's long lock down a pregnant woman was arrested in her house at breakfast, in front of her kids, for a facebook post. That's the authoritarianism some people here have had to put up with from some of our demented state premiers. Hence the caution."
2021-05-04 0:01,"$30,000 for a one-way ticket back to Australia, I think is an incorrect statement. From my understanding, it is a $3000 fee to quarantine at Hotel Corona for 14 days."
2021-05-03 23:23,"I have been continuously confused as to why anyone is engaging in travel for non emergency purposes during a dangerous pandemic. I especially do not understand why anyone would leave a country with a well resourced infrastructure and healthcare system to travel through multiple airports into a country that does not have the resources, for whatever reason, to provide complex medical care. I work as a nurse in a large high risk obstetrical unit in a large city in the United States. Day after day I meet up with pregnant women who just got off a plane from an international destination who are symptomatic and now are positive for covid. So, our unit is, once again, full of pregnant women who acquired covid infections while engaging in non essential travel to whatever place on the globe they felt like traveling to for whatever reason. They are now back home in the United States potentially exposing the entire medical staff and all the other patients and newborns to the infection that they would likely not have gotten if they stayed home and followed reasonable infection control measures. After watching the devastating effects of covid infection on pregnant women, their infants, and the rest of their family members play out for the past year and a half. ... I’ve got a suggestion. For now, just stop traveling. Just stop. Stop putting yourself and everyone around you in danger for no good reason."
2021-05-03 23:22,"I suppose they feared too many coming home too quickly. They should work out an organized, safe way to get their citizens out of India over the next several months."
2021-05-03 23:28,"Two weeks ago I read about an Australian who in early March had gone to India for a wedding and is now 'stranded' there (note: flights from India are only temporarily halted). 

Despite our international borders being ostensibly 'closed' since March last year (i.e., Australians can't travel outbound, and only Australians or permanent residents are allowed to return inbound) this fellow (like many others) had been granted 'exceptional circumstances' permission. A loophole that the Australian prime minister refused to consider closing despite it being a glaring weak link in the country's otherwise successful infectious disease strategy, or presumably making it more difficult for those out of the country since prior to the pandemic to get a seat on a plane.

My question is: How many of the 50,000 or so Australians the media routinely describe as 'stranded' overseas have actually been unable to return home since prior to the start of the pandemic, and how many left during the pandemic for business or exceptional personal reasons? (and ahem... in what world does attendance at a wedding meet an 'exceptional circumstances' threshold??)

The fact is, each and every week over the past year an average of 7,000 - 10,000 citizens and permanent residents have returned to Australia on international flights, and yet the 50,000 stranded Australians number stubbornly persists in media accounts. 

Something doesn't add up."
2021-05-03 23:20,"Did I misread the article?  Didn't Ms Dilin drop her child off with her parents in India a year ago planning to bring her back to Australia one month later?  There was no travel ban from India one year ago, nor for a whole year until now.  Why was she not able to bring the girl home in all this time?  Of course now the ban is in place, and with good reason - heartbreaking as it may be, the child is now in a dangerously toxic country, and a potential vector of Covid.  I would think that if she tested negative she should be allowed to fly home, but any flight she could get on wouldn't be allowed in, Australia obviously doesn't want to take chances even with her own citizens by relying on (possibly faulty) tests.

As we well know, US citizens indiscriminately allowed to re-enter the United States last year after being stranded in various European countries (Italy, in particular) were in great part responsible for the speed with which the virus spread in New York City and surrounding areas, just as those returning from Asia carried it to the West Coast.  We were all ignorant of the danger, back then, but now that we are fully aware all countries will take whatever measures are necessary to protect the population within their borders and avoid getting back to square one."

2021-05-04 0:32,"Yes, government officials say it is necessary. That is because their health advisors say it is necessary. As alien as the concept might sound, our government officials' policy in this global pandemic has been to follow the advice of their medical experts. This has worked out pretty well by comparison with countries that haven't. (Not by comparison with pre-covid. There has been significant hardship, it's just been less hard both in broad human and economic terms than widespread disease and death.)
Yes: Britain, Germany and the United States have exempted citizens and permanent residents, from travel restrictions. However let's face it - none of those countries are anywhere near role models for managing this global pandemic. And covid itself will not exempt people from infection based on their citizenship or permanent residency.
Some Indian-Australians are outraged. Others, prominent leaders among them,  have expressed acceptance of the necessity."
2021-05-04 0:54,"Depending on their numbers, they should have two options. Return home with MAJOR restrictions or stay in India.

I think the return option would have to be a coordinated effort from a state department and department of health.

2021-05-04 0:18,"I live in South Australia and our situation is rather similar to the rest of the country. our state and federal govts have run down the public system and pumped masses of funds into private health, they have lowered taxes consistently for the last 20 years. As a result, the Hospital system at the moment is not coping, we have ambulances waiting outside hospitals for hours as they wait for beds to free up. This is without having hardly any cases of covid in the community , but we are all on alert for outbreaks from quarantine overseas arrivals.  , we still haven't sorted out our quarantine situation properly , thus mistakes are made and we then have to lock down until all are contacted and the covid outbreak is curtailed. 
Yesterday every hospital in the state was on code white and one on code yellow.- disaster code. Quite honestly we just don't have enough spare facilities or staff to cope with a big outbreak, its nonsensical to bring people back when the system is already stressed and it isn't even winter yet , which is when we have a big influx of flu cases. this is NOT racism, its just plain common sense. ."
2021-05-04 0:47,"This is very heart aching for the citizens stuck abroad, despite having made potentially unwise travel choices, though may also be somewhat necessary for Australia to do if their country is not yet vaccinated, since their variant in India is very lethal and roaming freely there infecting & likely still mutating. 

What Australia could do is to still take care of their citizens abroad? Perhaps fly in food, oxygen and other supplies to help their citizens weather through this, until the ban can be lifted?

I understand it’s for the safety of the nation to deny citizens to return, but certainly don’t leave them high and dry if they are at risk. Must be something they can setup and provide their citizens stuck in India."
2021-05-04 1:17,"The government has done itself no favours with the turn to punishment (threat of fine and imprisonment) in order to enforce what should be a straight-forward health decision. It comes across as authoritarian and petty, rather than simply trying to look after its citizens.

The decision to close the border to India is sensible given Australia's capacity to deal with the influx of the virus. It in effect is covering up to failings:
1. The failure after a year to build suitable quarantine facilities despite repeated outbreaks with the current hotel quarantine system.
2. The failure to secure and perform vaccination on enough people - including and especially frontline workers - leaving us still at risk of an outbreak.

This is not to minimise the indifference the government is showing to our citizens and permanent residents abroad, especially those in a crisis area who need our help. Australia could have done so much more over the last year to prepare for scenarios like this. It didn't, and here we are now. A decision that makes sense not because of racial prejudice, but because of poor planning and the success /popularity of state border closures that the federal government initially opposed."
2021-05-04 1:29,The critics can shove it. Australia manage to eliminate the virus completely via effective science-based policies. And travel bans is one important element of those policies. We have been living normal lives for almost a year now while the rest of the world continues to suffer terribly. We will defend our precious normalcy at all costs. If it takes another targeted travel ban – it is totally worth it. That is the people who want to come to Australia even with the risk of bringing the virus over and starting a full-blown outbreak here who are selfish and reckless. Australian hotel quarantine only works because the infection rates among the quarantined travellers were low - historically less than 1%. Even then there were several leaks from quarantine hotels into community (because the system is not 100% fool-proof) which we fortunately were able to contain in all instances so far. Now the infection rate is up to 3% entirely due to arrivals from India - on India flights over 8% of all arriving passengers are infected. Our hotel quarantine system is not designed to safely handle such influx of infected people - it will break down and we will have an epidemics like everybody else. Is that what the “critics” want? It is easy to complain and criticise if you are not the one responsible for the country’s future health. This temporary measure was necessary for the common good. and we will not be apologising for it.
2021-05-04 1:34,"There are several comparisons to the US here based on the idea that the US had a higher per capita infection rate last year and Australian citizens traveling from there weren't completely banned. But people continue to miss the point that those are *confirmed* cases. Does anyone really think India has the same testing capacity as the US or Europe? No, they just fall back on the typical ""racism."" Some models show that the rate in India may be as high as TEN MILLION cases per day (see the site Our World in Data for several models)."
2021-05-04 1:45,"Thank you for shedding light on this. The scariest part of all this is a majority of citizens seem ok with this inhuman treatment, just as long as their normal isn’t hit. As migrants we make peace with a lot of things (including being treated differently for skin colour) because we CHOOSE to live abroad. However, this is just cruel. Yes, the measures were good and effective and nobody is saying remove quarantine.  For everything the government seems to be throwing up its hands. Burrying your head in the sand isn’t going to make this go away. You cannot have borders sealed shut forever, with zero cases. 

Surely 16 months with so called “experts” at the helm should mean that we don’t have to make a choice between livelihood and family! Fear has been promoted and encouraged instead of perspective. A government is a reflection of its people (majority anyway)"

For example, some people say people have traveled outside the country for things like weddings; other say no one has traveled outside the country other than for emergency purposes. Some say all stranded are those who were already outside the country before Mar 2020. Could the NYT comment on how people stay outside the country for over a year without work(?) (because presumably if they are working outside the country they are continuing to work and are not ‘stranded’)"

2021-05-04 5:10,"a lot of your story is overblown or just plain incorrect!. the ban is for 3 weeks - till 15 May. many of these Australians chose to go to India early this year   for weddings and other family renunions, knowing full well the restrictions on coming home. These have been in place for well over a year. i have friends that came in from Europe last December for Christmas. They all spent 2 weeks in hotel quarantine ($3k for the 14 days) before getting  on with their holiday. it took them 6 months to get in and didnot cost them $30k  to get a one way ticket!!o, so you are getting your figures from wealthy people who go first class perhaps? My friends don't have that sort of money. I might add that very few flights come into australia currently  as visitors are not encouraged ( unless they are citizens and we have strict rules about how many we bring home each week so that our quarantine systems are not overwhelmed) . the government is not flying people home. they have to make their own way home. if the carriers keep suspending flights ( which they do ) you can't blame the government.  so this whole idea of racism makes me absolutely sick. we banned flight  from various countries last year whilst we got our systems in place. we basically have no virus in our country. our economy has picked up and the jobless rate is really low. i and my fellow Australians worked and suffered last year with some of us in severe lockdown (Melbourne)"

1. Suspension of flights: this has been done by many countries since the pandemic began. The ban on direct flights from India to Australia is not materially different to, say, bans on flights into Israel. 

2. Criminalisation of Australian citizens returning from India to Australia: this is materially different to the actions of other countries, and earlier Australian responses, to citizens returning from Covid hotspots (recalling that for most of the last 14 months, the global hotspot has been the US). 

3. Quarantine: Americans don’t understand how much community support this has in Australia. It’s why we have had less than 30,000 cases in total since the pandemic began, and why our lives are pretty normal, for most part. The system has had breaches, and could certainly be improved and expanded. And a greater burden of quarantine has fallen on one state, New South Wales, which has housed a disproportionate number of quarantine places relative to its population. 

I’m not sure how Australia is made safer by criminalising citizens wishing to return, if flight suspensions and quarantine are in  place? It’s a small-minded and petty move, and comes across as being racist. It will damage our reputation internationally for years to come."

Outrage over terrible individual suffering from not being able to go home to safety disregards the potential enormity of community suffering that one person’s actions could cause.  It’s narrow, selfish thinking and only makes a bad situation worse."
2021-05-04 10:07,"Morrison is correct in closing all entries from india into australia. even within australia, people from perth are denied entry into other australian states. these indians scream racial discrimination when they should be asking, what are they doing in india with a global pandemic raging for the last 12 months. india has been exporting unemployment for many years and strains the host country's resources. modi, is now exporting globally as he refused to put india in a nation wide lockdown."
2021-05-04 11:53,"I see a lot of people supporting this ban. Most probably didn't read the article. 
No other country bans its own citizens from arriving.
No other country criminalizes it's own citizens from arriving and threatens them with jail. Yes not even China.
This is some North korea level of dictatorship. Perhaps they should change their name Democratic People's republic of Australia."
2021-05-04 11:35,Australia should rename itself to People's republic of Australia. Even China doesn't criminalize its own citizens from returning.
2021-05-04 12:30,"The morality of Australia's dilemma, this exposes one of the open secrets about the world of immigrations some of the commenters may not understand.

While most immigrants truly believe in their new countries, some are hedging their bet by having one foot in one and the foot in the other. In Canada, many have become absentee parents after depositing their children. They went back to their homeland to resume their livelihood. It was exposed during the protest a few years ago. There were 300,000 Canadians living in HKSAR. The opposite is true with some immigrants in the U.S. The immigrants came to work here but sent their children back to China to be cared for by their parents.

One would think a lot of Australian immigrants were doing this sort of bi-country existence, until upheavals like COVID happen. Then all the having-the-cake-and-eat-it-too planning is out of the window.

Again, irrespective of Australian harsh treatment's morality, it is important to understand our choices have consequences"
2021-05-04 13:12,What difference does it make what other countries do? Australia has a right to do what it wants. The travel ban is not that bad. If you went somewhere in the world and got caught up in some bad situation maybe you should have stayed HOME.
2021-05-04 14:00,"I think this is outrageous. Any AUS citizen should be allowed back in, with proper quarantine and testing. They've paid for that right."
2021-05-04 13:23,"As a sovereign nation, Australia has the right to choose how to protect its people. You might disagree even label the government racist, but the choice was made, draconian as people might think, with the health and safety of every Australian in mind."
2021-05-04 15:22,"What then is the point of citizenship, if you can be locked out? What is the point of paying taxes and contributing to your society if you can be locked out in your hour of need?"

Did Australia level such a blanket ban on the return of its own citizens from the US or the UK when those countries were in their worst stages of infection? No, it did not.

The reason? Well, the difference seems rather black and white. Sorry, brown and white."

2021-05-01 17:08,"“The bulk of the blame lies in Modi’s governance style, where top ministers are chosen for loyalty rather than expertise, where secrecy and image management is privileged over transparency,” said Asim Ali, a research scholar at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi.
This is not true. Dr Harshwardhan, the health minister, a medical doctor by profession, was instrumental in getting Polio eradicated from the country. 
I am stunned how NYT completely ignores the fact that Biden administration blocked critical exports to India necessary to make vaccine. On top of that US state dept spokesperson shamelessly declared, in a Trumpian manner, that America comes first and it's ""in the world's interest that Americans get vaccinated""!"

2021-05-01 17:26,"He is probably the most liked leader since Indira Gandhi. She gave us the National Emergency, I wonder what's in store with Modi. 

So many people are still defending him, even after a disastrous handling of the pandemic. Sometimes they lay blame at the population numbers, sometimes the foreign media, and even the Biden administration for sending the supplies late. Anyone but Modi. A point approaches where these justifications become absurd and partisan. 

Many like him just because they think he is a ""strong leader"". 
His handling of the pandemic has made some people question him, but who knows how long will that last. He has an army of twitter trolls and people spreading propaganda on Facebook, What'sApp and every social media imaginable. Meanwhile, the opposition has never been so weak. Many Indians are sick of nepotism in politics and the image of Rahul Gandhi seems to be beyond redemption at this point. A weak opposition is enabling BJP more than it otherwise would."
2021-05-01 17:43,"A tragic story of arrogance, misplaced priorities, and the blindness that comes from surrounding oneself with obsequious courtiers! Impulsive policies with all kinds of hidden motives and a nation wide propaganda network which used Social Media to great effect as well as the power of  literally overflowing coffers of the Ruling Party, all combined to wreak disaster on the Economy and now hits at the future of India!"
2021-05-01 18:04,"With the kind of image he has, it's going to be very difficult for any crisis to tarnish it. It's all about perception and approaching the Hindu nationalist sentiments in the Indian population. With the kind of propaganda machine his party has, it's going to be really difficult to counter that. And with many Indian media outlets acting like the Chinese state media, it's even more difficult. He has successfully either hijacked or weakened a lot of the institutions. 

The endless scams and the corruption in the previous administration deeply affected the Indian people. Modi tapped into this fear and portrayed himself as someone who could offer hope. Many people who aren't huge fans of him think that they have no option other than him."
2021-05-01 18:13,"""Mr. Modi surrounded himself with allies rather than experts, analysts said. Officials felt too intimidated to point out mistakes, the analysts said, or to call into doubt his claims that the pandemic was over.""

I’m sad to learn of the similar reason for their huge breakout, which compares to ours earlier on. Blow hard, know nothings do not make for good governance. The faster they can put something in place like Team Biden, the sooner they will recover."
2021-05-01 17:31,"Modi has single handedly engineered the greatest catastrophy in India's very long history. His "" charisma"" will have killed millions by the time this is over. Estimates of under counting covid cases and deaths range from 20-50%. Remember, this calamity is taking place in the country that produces vaccines for the world. His failure is complete and only the highly trained medical and scientific community in India can save it's citizens."
2021-05-01 17:27,"It's like a national disaster on a daily basis and while things were deteriorating across the country, the prime minister and home minister were campaigning and attending mass political gatherings.  Even now their major concern is about image management and suppressing factual data and criticism. I hope the people of India will remember this for a long time to come and never forget the sheer hubris, callousness and incompetence of this government led by Modi and the sycophants he surrounds himself with."

2021-05-01 17:39,"You could substitute our “former guy’s” name in many of these sentences about Modi. From declaring the pandemic contained, ignoring scientists, choosing loyalty over expertise in ministers, threatening critics. Fascinating how so many people are willing to follow “charisma” and “allure”,  instead of competence. We got rid of our guy, good luck, India, with your guy."
2021-05-01 17:44,"And if Trump was reelected here for another term, we would had ended up just like India. We had a former president who played down Covid-19, called it hoax, and held large rallies with maskless crowds that were a breeding ground for Covid-19. Combined with hformer guy's penchant of image/propaganda above else, sidelining the medical experts, and promoting voodoo miracle cures[promoting the ingestion of household cleaners].  Thank God, America came to her senses by electing President Biden. Who put his ego aside to listen to the experts, marshalled private enterprise and government to surpass his initial goal of 100 million shots in the first 100 days. But, the final hurdle will be the 40% of Americans who are still afraid to get a shot. To those who are still hesitant to get a free vaccine that might save your life, just look at India. Where 400,000 a day infection rate with the dead being  cremated in open burn pits. Truly a cautionary tale."
2021-05-01 17:53,"This is a comment I found on social media, and I quote, ""The day you become a fan of a politician, you've failed as a citizen"". So true in India's case."
2021-05-01 19:15,"The perception that India's gave and sad COVID-19 crisis shakes up prime minister Modi's image of strength is highly exaggerated by Modi's long-time critics and the opposition leaders. Yes COVID has devastated India's densely populated regions. Mumbai, India is one the most densely populated cities in the world and even with some of best doctors, nurses and hospitals in India, all healthcare infrastructure is inadequate considering the population explosion in the past 50 years. What is enigmatic is the 2nd most populated country in the world, India despite over 19 million confirmed cases has lost fewer than much less populated, USA and Brazil. India's survival rate is 99%. Partly because India's bulk of the population is below 55. Another reason could be India's healthcare although stretched to its limits has not broken down. What has broken down no fault of Modi is the supply chain of oxygen and vaccines manufactured in India.  

Modi is still the most trusted and consequential politicians in India. He is not trying to build a dynasty because he has no children of his own. He leads a simple life with a healthy lifestyle. His only luxury is he has a personal chef to fix his pure vegetarian meals. He is a nonsmoker, a teetotaler, a regular practitioner of yoga and drug-free. Is he perfect? Who is? Modi has to deal with the crisis and be humble enough to embrace whatever support friends and foes have to offer to deal with the challenges not of his own making. Focus on India 1st"
2021-05-01 19:41,"Even now, Mr. Vaishnav added, “people like Modi and they will find ways to justify it.”

And therefore, once again, he will get away with no accountability."
2021-05-01 20:02,"Mr. Modi, an expert of demagoguery might as well win the next election. He met his waterloo many times in his political career. No one gave him a chance. Yet, on every such occasion he bounced back stronger, and annihilated his adversaries. Having cleared all the decks and now seemingly confident, Mr Modi definitely underestimated the invisible enemy!

Meanwhile indisputable truth though remains that thousands invaluable lives have been needlessly lost, shattering millions of families, and pushing many more millions into terrible poverty. 

This is a momentous tragedy. 

Modern India story started in 1991 has been upended in 2021."
2021-05-01 21:49,"Here's why india is seeing this:

1: Politics over safety. *All* political parties are to share the blame for this. Who in their right mind thought it was OK to hold elections in 5 states??? This is preposterous. Why couldn't they have all decided to do the public some real good and postpone the elections. They postponed exams for students.

2: 60M doses for export. ""Charity begins at home"". People forgot that. India needs to learn from the US.

3: Per capital healthcare spending is the least amongst all nations with comparable GDP. Had India's neighborhood been peaceful, this could have been avoided. Imagine China decided to wage a mini war with India during this time and diverted national attention.

4: Personal responsibility: People have shown absolutely no personal sense of responsibility to follow the safety guidelines. India should declare emergency. Enough is enough!"
2021-05-01 22:34,"Modi's various recent missteps have not only caused a huge tragedy to Indian public, they also have made mockery of the whole India. During this pandemic nowhere in the world until now covid patients have been seen sitting in front of hospitals waiting for beds, oxygen or life-saving drugs and dying without as are being seen in some big Indian cities. Modi's response to pandemic is even worse than Trump."
2021-05-01 22:45,"Modi's event managers and propagandists  will to do and say almost any thing to protect the image of their ""beloved leader"",  blindly  ignoring the Dante's inferno, unfolding  in all major Indian cities live on TV screens before the entire world . Modi's hubris, ego, incompetence, unashamed lies, and politics of hate and division to manipulate elections, has brought India to its knees. The situation in rest of rural India is even worst and some reports say that virus infections and death toll is being vastly undercounted. Corona virus will ultimately be cured and defeated, but the poisonous virus of Hindu nationalism will continue to fertilize ruling BJP's political fortunes in harvesting a bumper crop of votes while majority of Indians unfortunately, will continue to suffer the life of extreme poverty, lack of health care, malnutrition and hunger at the hands of a corrupt and broken system."
2021-05-01 20:53,"Minority community members, regardless of any tangible issue have apparently taken the due-hard anti-Modi position. Thus most of the complaints one hears comes from, unfortunately, Muslims in India. Very few would remember, because of the pervasive syndrome of selective amnesia, that till beginning of March 2021 yes there was no noticeable surge. Even though prior to that the rich Farmer’s protests from Punjab and Haryana that seeped into New Delhi was a mass gathering for months (since late October 2020), which the All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences warned much repeatedly. The superspreader may have been incubated then and spread to various other parts of the country. When the early lockdown was becoming effective with much vigilance, the Bollywood glitterati screamed and cried because their income became stagnant. They could not fly out to Dubai for late night dances amid flight restrictions. Many unemployed committed suicide and blamed the lockdown because of their ill fate. Same complaints were heard from laborers who did not have any means to the coveted bread basket. The NDA/BJP govt, sensing extreme anger amongst people, lifted restrictions which mothballed into public complacency. The analysis of this article, shorn with baseless innuendos against Modi, does not present logical conclusions on an equitable basis. However Modi’s popularity will not diminish in India and the frustrated authors have to dig for more dirt on Modi to get him scarred."

It’s downright nauseating."
2021-05-01 17:39,"Indians are calling for the health minister to resign for this debacle but in India for the last 7 years; Modi ji is the PM, but he is not only running the Centre government but almost all the governments and all the agencies including the police and military. He is not less than any dictator. Lately by growing his beard and mustaches; he became the religious head too. And therefore he must be held responsible for this havoc, loss of lives and human suffering in India demanding his resignation and charging him for crimes against humanity."

One thing that I experienced  when growing up in Madras, our society used to show so much respect to the dead. There was a 'shrardam' ceremony to celebrate the dead. In simple terms, people were allowed to die in dignity. This was the Hindu way! Now a BJP Party comes into power, telling the rest of us that they are more Hindu than me and that the nation belongs to the Hindutva thought. Suddenly, I am an outsider in my own land! It is this BJP Government that has totally mismanaged the covid crisis and threatened anyone questioning their performance. Imagine a Hindu party in power, cannot even provide a dignified Hindu cremation to someone dead! Incompetence and mismanagement in Government is not rare. But, what is so tragic is for a party to claim 'hollier than thou' and fail so badly. Modi and his team are experts in framing a new narrative and will pedal this. the reality is that at a most basic level, Modi and the BJP have failed India and indeed the whole world!"
2021-05-02 12:57,"60 Million vaccine shots would not have made any difference to fight COVID in INDIA, As a Indian I am happy that India exported vaccines to countries that needed them more than INDIA. Even if India exported vaccines saved one life, the sacrifice is worth it. 

India is capable of producing 100s of millions of COVID vaccine doses a month, it has installed capacity to produce more than 8 billion vaccine doses a year for the world. India's output is only constrained by world medical supply chain and contracts that limit production."

2021-05-02 9:29,The nub of it is that Modi  has never been held accountable for his  actions starting with the riots in his home state twenty years ago.  Enabled by a pliant and complicit bureaucracy traces of his direct involvement were all but erased by he ensuring that the Indian army had no access to the civil infrastructure when they were sent to quell the murderous riots for 24 hours. The template is the same for all subsequent blunders from demonetization to the current crisis: proclaim a counterfactual as the truth repeatedly till a benumbed public has no ability to sift fact from faction

Arora insisted that Elections be held in spite of the risk of CoVid resurgence due to mass gatherings so Modi could grab more of the States and consolidate his autocracy for 5 more years. Allowed the Prime Minister of the country, with vastly more power and resources than his State based opponents to campaign in WB, because Modi’s party BJP had no popular leaders in the State, they were mostly Turncoats bought by Modi. Allowed Modi to hold those huge mass rallies, attracting divisiveness among the people of WB, while banning his opponent from campaigning for a day because she had asked a large group of minorities to stay united !"

2021-05-02 6:13,"This is a terrible situation brewing in India with guarded resolve in sight.  With the rate of infection at the current trajectory, it will take a herculean effort to reverse the surge, but much longer to repair the underlying determinants of the surge.  

There are a plethora of perspectives on why COVID surges happen.  In Canada, where the post Spring Break uptick in cases was blamed on variants to obfuscate and elide government's role in premature re-opening of the country.  Kind of hard for the CMO to critique the gov't when she is standing next to the premier for daily TV updates.  For much of the winter, many left-leaning news outlets cite the sharp inequities in social determinants of health as a primary reason for the American surge.  Modi's haughty and ethnocentric policies is cited as the Achille's heel in this article.   

A compelling set of determinants to explain surges evades scientists.  Can we apply the same primary causes for surges in Canada and India?  Why? Why not?  How and at what level do the determinants align ‘enough’ to mount a surge?  Why do neighboring  regions differ (Michigan vs. Ohio.  Oregon vs. Calif). We are all guessing, politicians & media pick and choose cause of the day sowing further confusion and fear. 

my guess:  Modi has failed in his policies, but the underlying factor is the sharp inequities in India, and an arcane cause for the variants - likely a complex mix of human geography + viral properties setting the 'right' conditions."
2021-05-17 14:17,"The environmental costs if these changes need to be taken into account and minimized through good design.

Conditioning outside air requires a lot more energy in hot and cold climates. Running more air through filters and lights requires more electricity. These changes should be recommended for places that more people gather in higher densities at first and compensated with measures to reduce the energy usage."
2021-05-17 15:48,"Improving the indoor air quality in all or buildings would bring such a huge health benefit to so many of us. I hope this change actually happens, one way or another. There are many buildings inaccessible to me because of poor air."
2021-05-17 16:46,"I agree with the goal of improving air quality indoors - yet the first picture made me wince.

UV light and old art is not a good combination unless you hate old art. It won't hurt the gold, but there's a lot of beautiful paint in view in that church, too."
2021-05-17 18:48,"What is often overlooked is lack of upgrades and maintenance of HVAC equipment.
In modern commercial buildings,air distribution is set up in a way where the unit usually take in and exhausts 25% of the total air circulated.In critical applications like hospital operating rooms and labs,there is no air recirculated at all.This  is costly in terms of energy usage and constant  maintenance of equipment,however a critical aspect in maintaining a healthy environment for all involved"
2021-05-17 19:03,"We have been running a great many Austin HEPA filters and others  throughout the pandemic at our large mental health clinic. We believe this has greatly reduced infection rates as our tracking shows that virtually all of the very few cases of COVID among staff were infected offsite. It is a simple fix, and the energy cost has not been noticeable in our bottom line. Hearing fresh air would be double ground: cooling hot air in summer and warming cold air in winter. These filters will be a standard part of life for the foreseeable future."
2021-05-17 20:07,"Step 1 is good design. Places like New York and Chicago do not need air conditioning. Good walls that provide some insulation from outside heat with cross ventilation and ceiling fans are enough to provide comfort. I was amazed to find that most single family homes did not have cross ventilation even though they are situated squarely in the middle of their own piece of land. It is impossible to understand what was the architect thinking. When I was traveling in Spain, I saw that rural homes often had large windows, often a balcony ( to sit outside but in shade), and always had cross ventilation. Almost always I could see the sky on the other side of the house looking through the window in front of me because at least some windows were aligned for cross ventilation. Such a simple idea but doesn’t exist in USA."
2021-05-17 22:14,"Anything that helps to improve the air quality in sealed buildings would be welcome. I've worked in several offices in buildings where the windows couldn't be opened and noticed that not only was the indoor air quality poor, but people were often sick. In addition, it seemed like many of us were sleepy to the point where heads would slowly drop during meetings in small conference rooms. 

Another problem was that the air conditioning made the offices so cold that many people, especially women, had to wear sweaters in the Summer. The men were often in suits that kept them warm, but the women in their light dresses were freezing. When offices are so cold that women have to use electric heaters under their desks, there is obviously an issue. 

The only time the air quality was not a problem was when I worked for an engineering firm that had designed the building in which we worked. The mechanical engineers had done a great job of making sure that the air exchange rate was higher than usual. They also kept the air conditioning from freezing us out and we women didn't need heaters and extra clothes. 

This kind of design is not only better for the environment, it helps to prevent the spread of illnesses like the Covid-19 virus, flu and the common cold. Building codes should be changed to reflect what we now know about the spread of these illnesses."
2021-05-17 23:22,"When I lived and worked in NYC every couple of months I came down with a cold. We were expected to be at the office every day regardless of whether we were sick, so viruses bounced from one office mate to the other all year round.

Plus, offices in the city were always overcrowded, overheated or freezing cold. Ventilation was practically non-existent. In fact, I once worked in an office that had previously been a hallway. No ventilation ducts at all. 

This was before the internet when sick employees can often stay home and work. 

I’ve been self-employed for many years and one of the many things I love about working from home is the good ventilation. I haven’t had a cold in years!

One of my clients owns lice removal salons in NYC and recently installed a small wall mounted air purification unit in her locations. She told me she can tell the difference in the air the minute she walks in. Her employees no longer complain about feeling like there is no air and her customers feel more protected from Covid. 

I hope more businesses will install air purification devices, especially in large cities where space is at a minimum. It surely will boost employee productivity and decrease absenteeism."

I'm curious why you didn't post my comment below, even though it was submitted quite a while ago.  Did it violate the comments rules in some unanticipated way?

Let’s all hope that this vaccine is as safe in children as it has been in older adults.  It’s a shame that the FDA does not appear to have utilized all of the available safety data, in particular from the two Pfizer-supported large population studies conducted in Israel and published in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet.  These studies disturbingly reported only effectiveness estimates, and not safety estimates.  In particular, the two-dose regimen allows comparison of the rates of rare adverse effects between the three weeks after the first dose and the three weeks after the second dose.  Significantly different rates would not be expected in the same people if the vaccine is not responsible.  For example, 90% of myocarditis cases reported in Israel after the Pfizer vaccine occurred after the second dose, according to a leaked report from the Israel Ministry of Health, and the cases were almost entirely in those under 30 (<a href=""https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-said-probing-link-between-pfizer-shot-and-heart-problem-in-men-under-30"" target=""_blank"">https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-said-probing-link-between-pfizer-shot-and-heart-problem-in-men-under-30</a>/).
This sort of analysis would obviate the need to estimate the VAERS reporting rates and background rates.  It’s not clear to me why the FDA didn’t require this analysis.  If anybody has a good explanation, please share it."
2021-05-13 18:31,"We are pleased that the F.D.A. authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for use in 12-15 year-olds in the U.S. and that the C.D.C. has endorsed it. This is a major milestone because the well-being of children centers on their socialization and education. Like any childhood vaccine, this one will help them lead safer day-to-day lives, returning to school, sports and organized activities. Vaccination not only keeps them from transmitting the disease in the classroom, but it also reduces the risk of them passing it on to family members, particularly those who are immunocompromised.

At The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, we are encouraging blood cancer patients and survivors to talk to their doctors about vaccination. This is especially important since many blood cancer patients have weakened immune systems because of their diagnosis and treatment, and they have worse outcomes from Covid-19 infection. Unfortunately, studies suggest that the vaccine may not work as well for some blood cancer patients, but any protection is better than no protection. Our patient registry analysis to date has shown that the side effects from Covid-19 vaccination for cancer patients mirror those within the general population. We cannot stress enough how important it is for parents of children with cancer to talk to their child's doctors and to be vaccinated themselves -- sometimes that's their child's best protection.

2021-05-11 10:44,"America remains vulnerable to COVID.

There are two major reasons:
1. Less than a majority of Americans have gotten vaccinated. This is bordering on insanity. We know the virus is deadly to those over say 65, with mortality rates averaging about 10% and higher for those older than 80. Yet in many states fewer than 75% of this group are vaccinated. So much for protecting seniors. Younger Americans are in even worse shape with vaccination rates for some southern states less than 30%.
2. The virus is running rampant in parts of the world like India, Brazil and now Southeast Asia. As long as it lives in a human host, it will mutate. It is only a matter of time before a variant arises which spreads even faster and is vaccine resistant.

Bottom line: There is still a multi-million person reservoir of unvaccinated Americans who can constitute a new wave of disease and there is still disease around to sicken them

Get vaccinated now and help get the entire globe vaccinated.

If we don't do this now, we will never return to near normality."

2021-05-11 11:30,"This headline is misleading. It is authorized only for emergency use. There is a difference. Vaccination of children has been one of sciences greatest feats. It has essentially eradicated or made it highly unlikely that any child will contract deadly and dibilating diseases such as polio, mumps and rubella. As dangerous as covid is for the elderly, obese and others with certain underlying conditions it is not dangerous for children. The FDA gave emergency use authorization based on following 700 children for 2 months. That's hardly enough science for me to be vaccinating my 3 children against a disease that statistically has essentially zero risk to them. I will wait until there is more data."

Lifting patent protection will not help - the key is getting the complex and sensitive production up swiftly - and lifting IP rights protection will not support that. So Biden is really taking a cheap approach here: unlike Europe, the US has not exported any vaccines, and even blocks exportation of  vital input materials - which maybe.g., result in the CureVac vaccine not bring able to be produced in Europe. So supporting the lift of patent protection is purely populist and has no significant positive effect short term. It only distracts from the deeply unsolidaric approach. Sounds familiar?

We stood in line in school at the Nurse's office, where the doctor administrated the vaccine using a device that he pumped with his foot.  I guess the vaccine penetrated the skin sufficiently to provide immunity.  I remember being apprehensive about being able to tolerate the injection, so I'd pinch myself in the arm to practice being stoic.  I needn't have bothered.  The waiting in line was tense.  But the vaccination was painless.  Polio was terrifying in the late 40s and early 50s when I was a kid.  They showed pictures of kids living in iron lungs.  My cousins lost their mother to polio when they were small."

The same should be done for the vaccines.  Get celebrities on board- movies, TV, athletes rock stars and politicians speaking in person, on TV, at sporting events and social media sites.  I think Republicans remaining mute for the sake of politics would stand out like a sore thumb and would succumb to participate."
2021-05-11 12:26,I think a lot us who have been vaccinated or have decided to be vaccinated really don’t care if you get vaccinated or not.

They’ve been safely attending school, in-person, all year, so there’s no need for us to get them the vaccine to feel safe to return to activities. 

Kids present less risk to others than adults, who account for the vast majority of cases. As adults get vaccinated, the risk to kids drops even further. The collective risk question has changed, anyway, now that any adult who is concerned can get their vaccine. 

I’ll wait until the vaccine is fully approved, not just under the emergency authorization."

This will at last give us the opportunity to start the enter the new normal, though we will do so in steps because of our younger daughter’s risk given that breakthroughs can occur. We hope that more adults and teens will decide to get vaccinated so that the infection rates continue to drop."
2021-05-11 12:50,"The FDA, federal government and vaccine manufacturers are falling down on the job.

If the vaccine needs full approval and authorization from the FDA before schools will require it, along with the other vaccines that schools already require, then what is the hold up?

This is a WAR against disease, that has already claimed close to 600,000 American lives, and should receive the utmost urgency and required approvals posthaste.

C’mon folks, get with the program and ramp up approvals and vaccinations; the clock is ticking."
2021-05-11 12:51,"It is essential to vaccinate everyone to stop the spread of the variants.  Unvaccinated people form a fertile breeding ground for the virus to mutate and become more virulent. The only way to stop this process is to cut off its pathways to mutation and that means universal vaccination.

Furthermore, we have 30% of adults who, so far, are refusing to get vaccinated.  Protect your children from them and protect them from your children through vaccination.

Currently, the kids are less prone to illness from Covid than adults, so far.  That doesn't mean a kid centered Covid will not emerge.

So enough with the false arguments that not vaccinating kids is better for them.  People are capable of justifying just about any decision they make.  Call your doctor and take your children to the office and get the shot.  Just do it."

As opposed to only allowing one to schedule an appointment after they turn 16. Stupid.   Probably not our problem anymore given 12-15 eligibility,  but another parent of a soon-to-be 12 y/o will be frantically trying to figure this out.   Timing is crucial so our kid can get 2nd shots before school ends and her summer camp job begins.

2021-05-11 12:09,"Yes FDA's authorization of Pfizer's COVID shot for 12- to 15 year olds is in indeed a major milestone in reducing the spread of COVID among young teens. If mass immunization has to succeed there have to be many challenges met compared to when immunization on this scale was done against polio and smallpox. 

In my humble opinion, without parental consent or participation such a vaccine cannot be administered ethically in any minor. The mortality of variola major was 30% among all humans of all ages. The mortality from COVID has been predominantly in those over 55 while mortality among minors is minuscule. So while it is important from public health stand point to eliminate the reservoir for COVID to ultimately eradicate COVID from the planet, one needs to consider the benefit in relation to possible adverse effects risk. There is a good reason why in this century there is a separate approval required for vaccines approved in adults to be separately approved for children. Centuries ago in 1796 when Sir Edward Jenner administered live cowpox virus from Sarah the milk maid to James Phipps, an 8 year old youngster to immunize him against smallpox. It was the first systematic beginning of vaccination that resulted in complete eradication of small pox from planet earth by 1978 when WHO declared smallpox dead.

2021-05-11 13:02,Why would any parent willingly allow their child to be vaccinated for a disease that they are at virtually no risk of serious illness?  I would never allow it.
2021-05-11 12:05,"My 15 year daughter (14 when she enrolled) is in the moderna trial. I never thought I would put a child of mine in any medical experiment. Then my two sport (cheerleader and dive team) 16 year old athlete got leveled by Covid in early December. Her resting heart rate exceeded 150 for a week, and she was severely ill. Had she been this sick with a “simple flu” it would have been better, but because Covid also offers the additional stress of not knowing what the long term effects would be, the entire experience was/is unnerving. Another cheerleader exposed ended up in the hospital and another still in icu with pediatric inflammation syndrome. Maybe they had a bad strain, maybe they’re unlucky, but the “small percentage affected” is meaningless when it’s your child. My daughter is Still dealing with this - A long-hauler who can’t smell six months later, and struggles daily with energy and brain fog. 

 No regrets on enrolling younger daughter in trial. None."
2021-05-11 12:09,"It’s great that tweens are eligible now, but I doubt that their vaccination will make a big impact on spread. I also expect there to be a large number of parents who hold back vaccinating their kids, because many have long understood, correctly, that covid is not an emergency for children.

Kids account for a fraction of cases, even with the new variants. The source if COVID has always been overwhelmingly adults, particularly age 20-49. We should be doing everything we can to vaccinate them, here and in other countries. We know from Israel and the UK that vaccinating adults, alone, is enough effectively to wipe out covid in kids.

This excitement about kids’ vaccines, and the suggestion that kids “need” them to return to school and activities, strikes me as a product of a year of adults overstating their risks, and getting far too comfortable heaping unscientific restrictions on them."

I am fortunate to have the means to get my teenager to the state-run vaccination facility an hour away, and fortunate to have a job where I can take substantial time out of the work day to make this happen, but the families of the majority of the students in the school where I work don't have the means to do this. This is an inexplicable and inexcusable lapse in equity.

But I can find no place on line that is tracking the incidence of infertility or pregnancy problems  after vaccination among females who were not pregnant at the time they received the covid vaccine.  (I assume it would be much harder to track sterility problems among males, but that does not mean it would be impossible.) 

There must be some data somewhere being collected on this issue.  The absence of any mention of it in this article, or any other easily accessible place on the  internet should give any parent reasonable concern."

Don't get me wrong. Some vaccines like polio and now covid (hopefully) will prove to be a miracle worker but for every one like this there are tons more and procedures, pills, operations that are  iffy, more harm than good, or totally useless to make money for big phrama. 

Be prepared, vaccinate if it is proven useful but don't start shooting kids up until then.

Yes Trumpers are wrong but so are some of the most recommended here, ie science is God and if they tell you to jump off a cliff do it.

I stopped taking the flu vaccine seven yrs. ago when I either caught the flu beforehand with coughing people in the doctors office or got a bad reaction...(Yes, yes I know science Gods, you can't get the flu from the flu shot, bait and switchers.)

He does not need disco lights. He's not going to wack the ship with champagne. I do not think he needs a vacation in a five-star beach hotel. What he needs is to clean his room, and do his homework. That champagne ship has sailed. What. In. The. World. Are. Parents. Doing. This is serious business. It is not a birthday party. You do not get a lollipop.

I said walk. You need to be in your bed by ten. Period. No negotiating. No testing. No sneaking. No porn. Give me that phone I pay for. I want confident kids. I want accomplished kids. The pressure is on. Deal with it. I want kids who ask questions. I want kids who read. I want kids whose friends have rules, too. I want kids who know how to love hard.

COVID-19 infected 18 unvaccinated students.  There were no cases among those who were vaccinated.  So based on this study less than 1% of this population was infected.  No mention is made as to the degree of the adverse outcome of those infected.  The recommendation is made that every child should be vaccinated.  What an unfair burden to place on the parents. They are almost forced to have their children vaccinated no matter how they feel.  Because if they don't vaccinate and their child is infected they will be blamed."

2021-05-11 14:29,"The media has done a disservice to the community by reporting primarily COVID-19 deaths.  These deaths disproportionately affect the elderly, leaving younger people feeling relatively safe.  

However, long haul COVID is also a major problem.  It affects a much wider population, including about 30% of COVID-19 patients of ALL ages.  Long haul COVID produces disability which might last for a lifetime.

Younger people have resisted vaccination because they're much less likely to die.  That sense of invincibility would be greatly reduced if the issue was framed as avoiding the extended (possibly lifetime) disability that results from long haul COVID which can destroy their lives, even if it doesn't kill them."
2021-05-11 14:30,"For those readers who continue to insist that every other person get the vaccine because ""it's just like all the others and people who don't get it are selfish,"" it's very different. This vaccine is not fully FDA approved. Huge difference between this one and others and some parents might not be willing to inject a vaccine that isn't FDA approved into their child's arm when the manufacturers have shielded themselves from lawsuits. It has not been researched and tested several years like the others. We don't know how long the immunity will last. Children are less likely to become ill from the virus. We will be unable to ""go back to normal"" and reach herd immunity no matter what because of the infection rates worldwide. If others wish to vaccinate their children, great. Even though the self righteous Times readers disagree, there are valid reasons for vaccine hesitancy with one's kids and each parent should have the option."

My 15 year old daughter is fully grown and the 13 year old boy is 5' 7"" and 130 pounds. I feel like they are big enough to reasonably take the same vaccine dose that their parents have received.

My 11 year old son is tiny. He weighs 59 pounds and is the smallest kid in his class. He'll be eligible for the vaccine in a couple of months but I'm hesitant to give him the same dose that the rest of us have received. Is there any scientific basis at all for this reluctance on my part? I don't know of any, but that's how I feel anyway. I can only imagine parents who have infants and toddlers. It's hard to get over the irrational thoughts that go through the heads of parents whose greatest fear is harm coming to our children."

2021-05-11 14:45,"I am a HUGE proponent of vaccines for adults, and my older teens are vaccinated.
But vaccinating children is superfluous. For young teens, the high rates of adverse effects question whether it is worth it given the very low rate of them even contracting the virus and lower rate of having any symptoms. 
I know I am not giving my 14yo the vaccine until the summer. She is taking exams right now and does not need to be dealing with fatigue and fever just to satisfy nervous adults who can't understand risk. in fact, the only reason I am giving it to her at all is because schools will continue to prevent children from having an actual education without it. It really is shameful."

The safety of this vaccine is such that Pfizer is applying for full FDA approval, but with your kid on the line it doesn’t matter. I’ve got two kids, so I understand a parent’s concern. The fact is we are never going to achieve heard immunity, and we will be fighting this virus and its various mutations for years. And with all the hesitation and doubt, we will be fighting distrust of our medical institutions for as long or longer."

If we lose that choice then we have a big problem. Choose instead to do the things that keep you out of those higher risk categories and out of the hospital. Eat well, keep your stress down, boost your immune system. Don't put your health in the hands of someone else, especially the pharmaceutical industry."

I finally learned yesterday that only about 1,100 kids were given the vaccine in Pfizer's trial and Pfizer is claiming their vaccine is ""100 percent effective."" How can this be? We know no vaccine is 100 percent effective yet they're claiming this. Were the vaccinated kids even exposed to Covid-19? Did the vaccinated kids live in communities with low transmission rates and thus weren't ever exposed? Finding antibodies in the vaccinated kids doesn't make it ""100 percent effective"". I'm amazed that the media is advertising for Pfizer the ""100 percent effective and safe"" narrative. My kid won't be getting the vaccine at least for awhile. And for the political people out there, I voted for Biden."
2021-05-11 16:02,"This is a difficult subject for me. When my now older teen was a newborn, her sibling was infected with Pertussis at school, by an unvaccinated child sent to school sick. We were all vaccinated, but she was of course not old enough. She came close to dying several times. I am sure this affects my thinking today about the COVID vaccine. I, and my adult children and older teen are fully vaccinated for COVID. I do realize that this immunity is not going to last and that we will need boosters as I get for myself and my family every year for influenza. If my child was 12? I would have to put thought into it, but I think I would get them vaccinated."

The headline, in a more perfect world, would be offensive & ridiculous by equal measure: Race against what?  Are 12 year olds racing each other?  Are the adolescents racing their grandparents for some prize? 

In absence of effective local, regional, national testing & mapping programs, polity after polity declares schools to be safe, then closes them down for a week.  something like 300 of 580 thousand US deaths were in children under the age of 15.  But would parents of any other those 300 not have advocated to have every child vaccinated if that would have saved their own?

Do we, can we really trust Pfizer? That's not really a rhetorical question.  I've pushed back against anti-vaxxer wack jobs for more than 20 yr.  I, with barely a hitch in the git-a-long vaccinated my children.  I have received two Covid 'shots' courtesy of Pfizer . . . I do not trust them to be any more honest then we can force them to be. Rich institutions doing puff pieces (but, of course, 'printing both sides' . . . tho of what?) on other financial giants fails to make me sanguine that we are rigorously holding public & private institutions accountable."

My main concern is that everyone around her got the vaccine but she didn’t, people who care for her were easing out on the restrictions and i had to have difficult conversations with them to remind them she is a high risk, and that her condition was the reason we were given priority and got the vaccine early on. 
I am still concerned about the effects of the vaccine, but I’m more worried about the effects if she ever got COVID. Being at home for over a year has been hard for her as it’s been to many other kids, the vaccine will give her the opportunity to participate in summer camps and school in the fall."

Now she's a shell of herself who can only make it through an hour of an in-person school day and can't even get through the rest of the day on Zoom. To watch her struggle is horrible and I feel so much for her and her family. It is terrifying for them, as they don't know how to help--and the medical profession doesn't either.  As a parent of two middle schoolers myself, I would never want my child to go through this, and if there is something out there that can lower their risk, then I'll be the first in line."
2021-05-11 16:46,"One day, my friends, this all will be over.

And then I'm going to find an ATM and empty it.

And then I will find a bar.

And then I will end up in the Guinness book of records as the first man to be successfully revived after having more alcohol than blood in his system :-)

Seriously, I'm pretty robust, psychologically, but month 14 of the pandemic is slowly getting to me. So, please, get vaccinated! I know we are an ocean apart, but it still would be real nice for me to see the U.S. infection numbers go down like a lift with it's cable cut. You know, that whole ""hope"" thing..."
2021-05-11 16:28,Already have a vaccine appointment before this weekend for my 12 yo daughter. Not afraid of the conspiracy theorists or the fearmongers on this one. I told her she can joke with her classmates about having great cell reception next week!
2021-05-11 16:36,"Dear sirs or ms’s. Why aren’t we vaccinating through our public schools? Back in the sixties and early seventies, children were vaccinated with a booster in school for polio virus to eradicate it. Why aren’t we doing the same now? Where is the oversight on this? We need to rid ourselves of this virus amd the only way to do it is to get mass vaccination done. Please make this mandatory to go to public school. That is the only way. Private should follow the recommendations. With only those that can’t for some unknown medical reason.  This is getting ridiculous people. Get vaccinated. So we can return to normal. Please"
2021-05-11 16:49,"Focusing on the social life aspect is the way to go, having been fully vaccinated a few weeks ago, I haven’t been so happy in weeks. I can eat at bars and restaurants again, see all my friends, and not worry about giving it to my older parents. I feel like I’m through the final hurdle. I’ll still wear my mask as asked, but I don’t worry at all anymore. It’s like meaning has returned to my life"
2021-05-11 17:04,"My entire family lived through both SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS ( Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) outbreaks in Asia. Both are severe and highly contagious viruses. We have seen first hand the damage they can do. Many in the West are privileged enough that Covid is their first taste of a pandemic. 

A new wave of variants and infections are still plummeting South East Asia at the moment. Even tightly controlled, successful countries like Singapore currently has outbreaks.

This is far from over. Vaccines work, please get them."
2021-05-11 17:05,"People who are hesitating to vaccinate their children should just understand that children have fallen sick with covid and some are suffering long term effects. Long term effects that we can’t possibly understand yet because the virus is so new. Some of the newer variants appear to be affecting children at higher rates than the original virus. So there may be small risks to vaccine, but there are major and not well understood risks with the virus. If I had to choose as a parent, I would choose the vaccine as minimizing overall risk for my child."
2021-05-11 17:12,"In the matter of incentives, if I were hesitant to get my child vaccinated (I am not--we're planning on getting the first shot this weekend), a grocery store gift card would NOT persuade me. In fact, I'd be more worried if there were parents who would cut such a deal than I am about CoViD-19."
2021-05-11 16:52,"Can we send the extra vaccines that the anti-vaxxers won’t take to India, please???"
2021-05-11 17:15,"Obviously there are legal barriers, but this is yet another situation where I wonder if teenagers should begin to have control over their bodies, instead of their parents. I have just heard enough horror stories from family who work in medicine where parents are refusing treatment for xyz reason. Perhaps there should be ages where regardless of parental consent, children should be able to begin choosing parts of their own medical care."
2021-05-11 17:28,"One hurdle to getting younger people vaccinated is getting them on the waiting lists. I just checked the top three local places where I theoretically could get our 8th grader vaccinated, and after entering her birth date all three say she is not old enough. If these sites need to update their eligibility criteria then I think that would be an easy fix. It's frustrating to read all these articles where officials are encouraging younger people to get vaccinated, but then taking even the first step necessary to do that is impossible."
2021-05-11 17:30,"Reading all the reactions against vaccinating teens here is painful. And this is the NY Times. Imagine the reactions on Fox, Facebook, etc. Funny how folks think getting the same mRNA vaccine as literally hundreds of millions of people before them who didn't have any problems is rolling the dice, when the only long term effects that are surfacing are from COVID cases previously considered asymptomatic or mild. 

I'm getting my 13-year old daughter vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine at the earliest possible available date I can get. To the anti-vaxxers, good luck. Hope you don't drown in the river that's on average 1ft deep."
2021-05-11 17:35,"Those parents who have ""parental fears about infertility"" needn't worry - the 50% reduction in sperm counts since the 1970's, caused by micro-plastics, will have a far greater effect on their children never producing grandchildren for them than the vaccines will ...."
2021-05-11 17:39,Why is there a race?  They are least affected by the virus.
2021-05-11 17:38,"My 17-year-old got the Pfizer shot. No side effects. Now the whole family is fully vaccinated except one 15-year-old, who’ll be 16 in early July. Think we’re going to wait or hesitate? No way! If we can get him vaccinated this week we will!"
2021-05-11 17:48,"My kids have gotten every other vaccine following the recommended schedule (including an annual influenza shot). However, I will likely be waiting for full approval before considering this vaccine. 

At this time, healthy children are not in a state of emergency from COVID. The rate of death is around 0.01%, and 75% of those deaths are children with an underlying condition (which mine, thankfully, do not have). Every death of a child is a tragedy, but the risk for a healthy child must be put in perspective when considering the potential risks of a vaccination. 

I also would like more data on the risks of long COVID. While it is reported that about 12-15% of pediatric cases are leading to long-COVID, the breakdown of the data leads to more questions than answers for me. Individual prevalence for long-COVID symptoms within five symptoms of a COVID diagnosis are: fatigue 3.5%; cough 4%; headache 5.3%; loss of taste/smell 2%; myalgia 1.7%. These statistics are about the same as the expected prevalence in a pediatric population. I do not doubt that some children are suffering, but I would like a more detailed data analysis so I can understand the true risks that natural infection entail.

A final argument for EUA is the virus will mutate to be more dangerous to children. However, Vincent Racaniello (respected virologist) thinks this is highly unlikely.

Given other poor vaccine outcomes (Dengvaxia & Pandemrix), I do not think it is anti-vaxx to be cautious with EUAs for children."
2021-05-11 18:11,"Right now there are, in my opinion, three groups of people when it comes to the COVID vaccine:

1.  People who have been or will be vaccinated;
2.  A small number of people who can’t be vaccinated because of illnesses and allergies and whom the rest of us ought to be protecting; and
3. Morons. 

That’s it. Pick group 1, 2, or 3. There’s no group 4. 

The overwhelming consensus of medical and scientific experts around the world is that this vaccine is safe. These are the people who know and are not relying on science rather than conjecture and anecdote. Too many people don’t know what they don’t know and therefore fail to understand things like virology that are frankly far beyond their ken. 

As to kids: rest assured our grandchildren will be the very first kids of their age in our county to get the jab(s) when the time comes, and they are excited to join our entire family in being fully vaccinated."
2021-05-11 18:23,"Teens don't need these vaccines; the rate of serious infection in teens is insignificant and mostly among the immune-deficient who won't benefit from a vaccine anyway.

This is an unconscionable waste of vaccines that could be going to India or Indonesia or other countries that are still waiting."
2021-05-11 18:42,Children get vaccinations before starting school.  It is nothing new to parents or the children themselves.  I think it was a major mistake on the part of vaccine makers not to include all age groups in their initial testing of all of the vaccines.
2021-05-11 18:49,"My two 16-year-olds received both does of the Pfizer vaccine. Aside from mild soreness at the injection site, one had no other side effects for either injection. The other had a mild fever and leg muscle aches the day after the 2nd injection. Last dose was over a month ago and they are fine."
2021-05-11 18:50,"I’d point out that in every society I ever heard of, children’s lives are valued over and above the lives of adults—and that it’s medium disgusting to see people arguing that hey, it’s only about 300 dead kids, a couple thousand in hospitals, and a few thousand more with long term illness, so what’s the problem?"
2021-05-11 19:26,"As someone who has been experiencing changes to my menstrual cycle since 5 days after receiving my first vaccine in February, it is frustrating to read comments from medical professionals that there is ""false information"" floating around about the vaccine and side effects on women's bodies.  The truth is, we don't have a clear understanding of the side effects yet. I would like to see more thoughtful comments as researchers gather data. I got my vaccine as soon as I could, and I will probably have my 12-year old daughter vaccinated this spring, but let's not brush off women's health concerns, especially when we have made this mistake countless times."
2021-05-11 19:27,"This is at best misguided. Statistics show without a doubt that children have an almost zero chance of dying from Covid. This must be because their immune systems are handling this virus with few problems. Meanwhile, this is an experimental vaccine, rushed into usage due to the virus emergency. No one really knows the consequences either short or long term. There have been a small but not negligible number of serious injuries and deaths from the vaccines here and in Europe. Any negative autoimmune events obviously would effect children more than older people. The precautionary principle should be guiding this decision but has been totally ignored. Children are going to school with almost no problems. What's the rush?"
2021-05-11 19:34,"Why is this being framed as a race? Last time I looked children were in the lowest risk group,"
2021-05-11 19:27,It is too bad there isn't a vaccine against the ignorance that make people believe in all kinds of crazy anti-vax stuff they find on the internet rather than the professional doctors in this field.
2021-05-11 20:10,"I have spent the day trying to get a vaccine appointment for my young teen.  Our local health department says they only have Moderna, which is not approved for kids.  The closest health department that has Phizer says they are only giving it to their residents.  The schools are only giving it to kids who have been attending brick and mortar school, not the virtual and homeschool kids this year.  None of the chain pharmacies are offering appointments yet for under 16.  Some pharmacies I called seemed unaware of the approval.  My kid has given up so much this year to help keep our family and community safe.  I want to get him this as soon as possible."
2021-05-11 20:54,"Within 15 minutes of the ok for 12-15 year olds, I tried to get my youngest his vaccination.  Systems hadn’t been updated. Was advised to just show up as a walk-in.  He is ready to go. Our school district decided in April to go back to normal. Full day regular schedule. We’ve gotten 4 notifications of Covid exposure in the last two weeks."
2021-05-11 15:04,Shouldn't be challenging if the teachers union gets out of the way.   That's the only thing that has been standing between the kids and the shots.
2021-05-11 22:44,"Over 15 months into the pandemic, it’s disheartening to see the continued scramble each time something anticipated comes to fruition: “ States, counties and school districts around the country are trying to figure out...”. As a contingency/disaster response planner and military veteran, it’s frustrating to see the lack of future planning repeated again and again. Engaging pediatricians, summer programs (to encourage vaccinations and/or even offering them onsite), and even educational STEM programs (not only to inform but to encourage and excite young people for future careers) can be ways to get this done quickly. That we’re afforded the option of considering whether or not to vaccinate is a luxury while much of the rest of the world clamors for it."
2021-05-11 22:52,"I never really thought about vaccines until about 20 years ago, when in my early 40s I contacted varicella (chickenpox) as an adult. It was a horrible two weeks. For those who don't know, adult varicella is nothing like it is in children. It can be fatal. Needless to say, I survived. But I later got a case of shingles, which is also not pleasant.

How did I get varicella? My family and I attended a religious retreat in upstate NY, where there was an outbreak, a result of unvaccinated children. The varicella vaccine became available in the late 1990s and was added to the schedule of recommended vaccines. Some parents, I would surmise, thought it was not necessary. (Had I known then about the vaccine, I would have got it.)

I am a strong advocate of vaccines. All my children are vaccinated in accordance to pediatric and government guidelines. My adult son and my younger teenager will get a Covid-19 vaccine. In fact, my adult son has an appointment this weekend for the shot. Next is his younger brother. I can't wait to make an appointment for him, as soon as it becomes available."
2021-05-11 19:55,"Labeling people with legitimate concerns and questions as ""anti-vacc"" or any other similar label serves to shut down any open dialogue on the vaccine topic. And it's not going to help convince anyone who's on the fence to accept the vaccine. Start listening to the concerns rather than jumping to conclusions and labeling people. Like anything there are gray areas to consider so stop pretending like your opinion is the only expert opinion out there."
2021-05-11 20:05,"I actually hope the masking continues in the fall.  Besides the obvious covid protection over the past year, there has been no flu or other colds for us. And just the fact that parents can no longer dump sick kids at school has been wonderful."
2021-05-11 21:34,Daughter is ready to go as soon as NY approves the vaccine. Anxiously awaiting information from the city and state but we are planning to be one of the first in line.
2021-05-11 20:29,"My 13 YO is signed up for tomorrow. The covidiots not getting vaccinated means it is easy to get an appointment for good people

Her older 3 siblings already fully vaccinated. 

Very, very happy"
2021-05-12 14:42,"My wife is a manager in a hospital and has been working in healthcare her whole life. She was in the first group of people vaccinated in the US. I was in the third group vaccinated because of my age. My wife tells me she is not getting our 13 year old vaccinated until she is comfortable that children are not going to experience unanticipated side effects. Let's also remember children are in the lowest risk group for serious illness. We are hardly against vaccination, we are just being cautious with our child."
2021-05-12 16:04,"While it would be nice to have several years worth of data about the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine, the clinical testing that has been done along with the outcome for the millions of people 16 and up who have received the vaccine, as well as the recommendations of our health officials and doctors, provide enough evidence for me that it is safe for my teenager to take. I'd rather not risk her getting long Covid or transmitting the disease to others at greater risk or promoting further variants. I see the risk of not getting the vaccine as far greater than any risk from the vaccine. I'm taking her to be vaccinated tomorrow if we can get in."
2021-05-12 18:10,"My 16 year old got the second shot last Sunday

Sitting with my 13 year old now after her first shot

My adult age kids are both fully vaccinated

Do it. It is easy. It is nearly painless. There is enough vaccine and sites that getting an appointment is super easy, and many places now allow walk ups. 

Get the country back to normal. Do it for yourself if doing it for others is not enough motivation. But do it"
2021-05-12 19:44,"See the Israeli experience (regarding coronavirus, not the deadly mess going on now). The covid-19 rates faded to almost nothing by high percentage of adults being vaccinated and WITHOUT vaccinating the kids. There is a large group of MDs here who oppose kids vaccination, because of the small benefit (kids here almost didnt get seriously ill) and the possibility of high risk (mainly inflammation of heart muscle which was found to be a side effect especially in younger patients)"
2021-05-12 19:44,"For admission in September, all schools should require COVID vaccination for all students age 12 and above.  That includes Junior High Schools, High Schools, and Colleges.
If this is done uniformly across the country, we will have herd immunity, and we can defeat COVID.
This is a national emergency, and everyone needs to do their part."
2021-05-13 13:06,"Schools offer a logical way to address prolonged isolation.  But they are hardly the only way. 

They’re also not the safest or most effective way since “in-person” sessions don’t resolve isolation when social distancing protocols are still required.

Small social encounters as a complement to school would be more effective."
2021-05-13 13:15,"My child is too young to be vaccinated. He observes his peers who are in the classroom having ongoing frequent challenges in maintaining social distancing.  He’s thriving under distance learning, and rightfully nervous about returning.  He’s worried about staying safe when it’s clear that many children can’t follow instructions in his classroom.  Parents have a right to minimize risk. There should be a choice. With virus variants that are more virulent floating around, and without full vaccination, distance-learning should be continued as an option throughout the next year.   This should not interfere with the plans of those children and their parents who do want to return.  Maybe there should be some way to demonstrate that a child is falling behind? I’m tired of a one size fits all policy that seems to be pervasive throughout the public educational systems in the country."
2021-05-13 13:18,"I wonder if next year everyone can start in the same grade as they are in now?  Does it really matter if they graduate at 19 instead of 18? Should everyone catch up, through in some extras. 

I can hear teachers complaining about the extra work. I know teachers who teach everything the same way forever. The give the same tests each year.  Teachers are supposed to love imparting knowledge and teaching how to learn.  They should practice what they preach."
2021-05-13 14:25,"Yes, we need to get kids back in schools, even though our grandchildren are doing much better academically while being homeschooled. We also need to finish the paperwork for final FDA approval and then give strong consideration to requiring a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of enrollment in schools, just as we do with other immunizations."
2021-05-13 14:27,I believe that all teachers as well as school staff should be required to be vaccinated before returning to school. That will be an important level of protection for children and their families and may encourage more families to feel positive about a return to school.
2021-05-13 13:05,"I don’t think we’re out of the woods on COVID yet, and we’re throwing open the doors way too soon on schools, colleges, restaurants, travel and everything. There are too few vaccinated, too many variants and too much suffering elsewhere in the world for us to drop our guard now."
2021-05-13 12:56,"Weingarten and her supporters have earned their criticism. From the moment Trump foolishly bellowed ""open all the schools"" last summer, the teachers' unions decided that ""opposing Trump"" was more important than ""following the science"". Public health experts told us many months ago that schools were reasonably safe and the societal cost of keeping schools closed outweighed the benefit. Despite this public health consensus, the union and many influential media outlets clung to the ""schools aren't safe"" mantra with a near religious fervor. In our town, many teachers who have been vaccinated still oppose in person learning until all district children are also vaccinated. By demanding a zero risk/zero covid solution, the teachers' union has undermined the credibility of it's many hard working members while also inflicting  great harm to schoolchildren.  There are no winners."
2021-05-13 13:19,"Yes!!!  

Right now I’m really anxious that keeping kids home will still seem like a “reasonable choice” to our district in the Fall. In our school district negotiations with the teachers’ union for Fall return are still “ongoing” and the union president’s public comments indicate that she thinks zoom school is working for high schoolers (despite all the imperial evidence to the contrary) 

My kids have been receiving nothing near what they need in terms of education and socialization in well over a year.  It’s painful to not be able to provide for them. My husband and I are working harder than ever at our full time jobs while our kids aren’t getting what they need during the day. I’m heartbroken and feeling like I’m failing them everyday despite my best efforts to provide them with outdoor sports opportunities, wonderful books, positive experiences with family and neighbors, and everything else I can dream up.  

It’s hard for me to accept that in person school has proven safe in  California at private schools but not public schools."
2021-05-13 13:22,"Weingarten calls for smaller class sizes, additional teachers, more classroom space... Yes! To all of this! However, I’m worried that districts will not be able to provide these accommodations, leaving the teachers union again with a reason to insist that a full return to school is not achievable."
2021-05-13 14:53,"Our outstanding school in Seattle reopened in October, with the littlest learners in the building. Split into cohorts, windows open, masks on, and a mission for hygiene made it possible to cautiously bring back the older kids in late winter. We’ve been fully reopen since February with one confirmed case in a student. 

Our reopening boiled down to these things:

1. Physical space
2. Belief in science
3. Community buy-in
4. Money 
5. Money

Physical space and ventilation were the number one sticking points to getting people safely into the building. Every room, from the library to the gym to the science lab has been creatively co-opted into a full-time classroom. Windows are open, fans are on, and the entire faculty and staff are vaccinated. Most importantly, our community is small enough that we got near total buy-in: people stayed within their pods and were cautious in their interactions with others. Traveling families complied with the required quarantine periods. The administration was transparent and forthcoming. There was a can-do attitude from pre-schoolers to principal. This is what privilege looks like.

The physical constraints alone in the two neighborhood public elementary schools made this impossible. Lack of funding. Questions about equity. Defensive and scared parents and teachers. And it goes on. It is heartbreaking to watch. This is the haves and have nots in America."
2021-05-13 13:55,"It’s a relief that the teachers’ union is going on the record as supporting live in-person instruction next fall. However, this statement gave me pause: “Even with a vaccine approved for adolescents 12 and over, she foresees the need to continue to distance students three feet apart, which she said would require some school systems to find additional space outside their buildings.”

There is no scientific reason for students to maintain social distancing after they have been vaccinated. For many schools—including the NYC public schools my children attend—there is no way to accommodate 3 feet of distancing in our facilities. Insisting on that is essentially insisting that the schools stay closed. I’d be happy for there to be smaller class sizes, but the idea of widespread school expansion into vacant stores and offices is a pipe dream. We can’t let demands for unnecessary social distancing become an excuse for continuing to deprive kids of in-person instruction."
2021-05-13 13:42,"Articles like this are infuriating because some of US have been teaching all year. I teach at a high school in a very red area and it's been overall fine. The biggest issue have been kids having to quarantine due to exposure but very few cases, do major issues and in-person instruction has continued unabated. It has been a normal school year all things considered.

It's not a mystery what will happen when schools open. There is data to show that it can be done safely and normally without a major change in how classes are conducted."
2021-05-13 14:25,"Assuming that all teachers (and all support staff) will be vaccinated and that variants don't pop up that make this vaccine useless, the only risk to opening the schools is to the children and those adults at home who might catch covid from their children.
School should be used as a place to vaccinate children and those children who refuse vaccination should still be allowed to attend as the risk is theirs.
If a teacher refuses vaccination, they should be placed on unpaid leave, without benefits, until they decide to come back and if there is still a job waiting for them."
2021-05-13 12:49,"I'd want them open too.

If, that is, kids were actually learning something, and school (at every level), was something other than glorified daycare."
2021-05-13 15:32,"As a parent of a special needs child, I lost all faith in our school system to adapt to the challenge of providing any effective services during the pandemic. The schools were unwilling to meet union demands for (what sounded like legitimate) modifications to buildings and never returned to in-person learning, and the union was unwilling to bend. We were caught in the middle of their squabbling. I have no idea how the school system is going to rebuild any faith from the special needs community - when we faced perhaps the greatest challenge of our lifetime, our education system failed spectacularly."
2021-05-13 15:20,I realize that politics doesn't always make sense - especially at the national level - but I predict that if schools aren't back to normal in the fall there is going to be a huge electoral backlash in 2022.
2021-05-13 13:25,"This article mentions educators who will have to support children processing the drastic academic, mental health (SEL), and economic issues which arose from the events in the past year (and earlier) - as well as ""a national reckoning on racism"". Then it slips in what I consider a dog whistle with Weingarten's plan to propose ""enriching curriculum with subjects like science and civics"" (what about social justice?) Science? What do you think science teachers have been up to all these years? The need for teaching ""civics"" [read: ""patriotism""], though, is a Republican political talking point, and the idea that the US ""is not fully back"" until everyone is back in open schools also smells to me like an echo of the capitalists' interests, not necessarily the people's. We are not ""her"" union, we are a union, and for the record, neither Weingarten nor the aft ever asked this dues-paying member whether or not I'm ""all in."" Besides, other language in the article indicating some local unions are pushing for improved remote learning contradicts this idea of ""all-in."" What the optimistic Ms. Noonan (as well as the media, and many politicians) misunderstands is union membership does NOT equal ""teachers unions."" I'm not an equal stakeholder if no one asks me what I think or feel, when I am the one in the rooms and on the ground. The aft did not ask me in 2016 when they went ahead and endorsed Hillary Clinton. Big Education involves Big Money and Big Politics. #AskATeacher."
2021-05-13 15:58,"For the record, I am *for* opening schools for in-person instructions.

Having said that, it is interesting to me that many amongst the ""open-the-schools"" crowd insist (rightly) that we should ""follow the science,"" but the same folks seem to have grave problems following the science on masks and vaccination."
2021-05-13 14:25,"Teacher here! Pleading for:
-Full return to in person instruction with safety protocols in place.
-No option for remote instruction concurrent with in person. Teaching in this manner is untenable and unfair for students and teachers alike. 
-Students who want remote learning can choose an online only school option.
-Based on my experience and data from my own instruction this year, student performance increases dramatically in person. 
-I conducted all of my courses that I taught online in real time—students were to stay online for the duration of each class period. Even this did not begin to replace in person instruction in terms of student performance and participation. Online, students can choose to check out. In person, that’s not an option. 
-I plead with school districts to use stimulus monies to increase current staff and teacher pay, not hire more staff. There is a teacher shortage for a reason: low pay. This nation needs to choose to pay its teachers what they, and the students they teach, deserve. By choosing to increase teacher compensation, teacher retention will increase. Simple formula.
-Invest in teachers, school staff, and children—->our nation’s future should not be second fiddle.
-Get vaccinated, America. We require myriad vaccines for children to enter our buildings already. The efficacy of the covid vaccine is proven. This alone will help us to return to full in person learning—what our kids deserve, and what they sorely crave and need in order to thrive!"
2021-05-13 14:00,"After over a year of her and her local unions throwing up every roadblock to full school reopening, now she’s a champion of school reopenings? No one paying attention believes that attempted re-write of history. NYC is still closed to full time in person learning and aside from the calendar, there is no plan for fall 2021 full time in person learning. 4 months away, 2 of which summer."
2021-05-13 14:06,"No one should get praised for attempting to fix problems they created. This is not only long overdue but also appears to be largely self-serving, not necessarily in the service of students, but in the service of unions. I also noticed she plans to say nothing about “how long” students should attend each day. I’m sure five days a week translates to a paltry two hours each day. No wonder parents have lost all faith and those with means are engaged in all out war to secure coveted spots at long-open private schools."
2021-05-13 13:24,"If I could only believe her - after a year of playing George Wallace, standing in the schoolhouse door, she's taking a new tack.  Those who could have moved (by hook or crook) to school districts that are open, switched to private, or homeschool.  Folks like myself, without the means, were just trapped.  Never thought I'd look at DeSantis as one who got it right - it's just bizarre to me (and a little scary) - but her union, and her fellow-travelers in my own school board, did real damage to my kids, and countless others.  If I could afford to leave the local schools, I would, and she's nothing but a self-serving charlatan."
2021-05-13 13:27,"Fewer children have died of covid than die of the flu in many years. An adult who is vaccinated against covid has a lower risk of dying of covid than an adult who is vaccinated against the flu has of dying of the flu in many years. 
Why does this discussion still sound like we have last year's lack of knowledge about the risk to children and lack of vaccines for adults?"
2021-05-13 14:13,At long last there is a reconsideration of the necessity of schooling in our country.  For the majority of students education past the 10th grade is unnecessary.  There is no value added.  Most people learn nothing in college.  Stop the credentialism and stop making people waste collosal amounts of time and money on an education they do not need.
2021-05-13 14:59,"The reality is that there will still be a HUGE number of parents, students, and teachers who will prefer to remain remote in the fall for a variety of justifiable reasons — one size does not fit all. Give parents, teachers, AND students a CHOICE between remote or in-person (over the summer to allow for effective, early programming) and rent out the empty Manhattan office buildings for remote teachers to work out of. Students and teachers should not be forced into schools at full capacity (which they will be — just give the CDC a few more weeks to take that 3-6 feet of social distancing down to zero!) when the virus and its variants still pose a threat and not everyone is vaccinated."
2021-05-13 14:59,"When all of the safety studies have been completed in the fall and assuming they show the vaccine is safe for ages two years and older, Covid vaccinations should be mandatory for all students who wish to return to school for in-person instruction, just as the measles vaccine  and other vaccines are mandatory.  I would not want to send my child to school if only 40% of the school population is vaccinated against measles.  The vaccine should also be mandatory for teachers who are teaching in-person. The virus is still very active in other parts of the world and it can certainly travel here again as it did one year ago.  The only way to achieve some reasonable degree of safety is vaccination for all. Period."
2021-05-13 13:53,"As a teacher in a school that has been open since August, I agree that an ideal goal is to reopen. For that to happen, ALL teachers and ALL students  who can safely be vaccinated * MUST be vaccinated. No exceptions. 

So that's the wall we'll run into. The very people complaining about wearing masks and refusing to socially distance, are the ones most apt to refuse vaccination (go figure). They can't have it both ways and they can no longer be allowed to hold the entire country hostage to their obtuse, obdurate, cultivated ignorance. 

And enough of the whining and outrage. My DOG has to be vaccinated to go to his vacation kennel. When my mother was a nurse, she HAD to be vaccinated for a host of diseases to step on the floor. My siblings and I could not attend school--literally could not walk through the front door--unless we were vaccinated. I'm sick of the hysteria and self-serving, deadly lies about this issue.

This special interest-pleading and American exceptionalism have to stop. Being part of a society means doing things for the greater good of your community at large. It's time to get a spine, insist on protocols, and uphold them. Lives depend on that. 

I'll add this caveat: schools can only open if we aren't in a surge akin to the one in India. We have to be responsive and adaptive to what's happening.

*The number of those who can't is small. Only those with confirmed allergies and conditions (cancer) that make it dangerous should be exempt."
2021-05-13 13:53,"I can't even believe there is a suggestion of doing remote school again next fall.  It's a completely subpar experience. My child has been in school all year (albeit in ""hybrid"" mode)  in NYC with very few cases of COVID even before vaccines were widely available. Unless things change and there is some severe new ""variant"" circulating, it should be 100% in person."
2021-05-13 13:40,"Public schools have been neglected for so long that the changes needed to get kids back into the buildings five days a week are complicated. 
Many structures were built sixty-five years ago. There have been virtually no improvements since then, especially in the elementary school buildings. 
What does that look and feel like? Windows that do not open, or if they do, they see-saw back and forth and shatter in a gusty wind. Ventilation systems that are so filthy and dysfunctional that they are a health hazard.
If other buildings are used for in-person learning, will there be adequate bathroom facilities? And what happens if an emergency occurs while the teacher is working “off-campus""?
If you haven’t actually worked in America’s dilapidated schools, you have no idea how deteriorated they were before the pandemic. Wary teachers have every right to be apprehensive. They will carry the burden while administrators and politicians brag about their buildings opening again."
2021-05-13 14:12,"Weingarten and her supporters have earned their criticism. From the moment Trump foolishly bellowed ""open all the schools"" last summer, the teachers' unions decided that ""opposing Trump"" was more important than ""following the science"". Public health experts told us many months ago that schools were reasonably safe and the societal cost of keeping schools closed outweighed the benefit. Despite this public health consensus, the union and many influential media outlets clung to the ""schools aren't safe"" mantra with a near religious fervor. In our town, many teachers who have been vaccinated still oppose in person learning until all district children are also vaccinated.  By demanding a zero risk/zero covid solution, the teachers' union has undermined the credibility of it's many hard working members while also inflicting  great harm to schoolchildren, especially the neediest children in large cities.  There are no winners."
2021-05-13 14:09,"Thank you to Ms. Weingarten for being cautious, for students, and for the teachers who also deserve protection.  This issue is about keeping everyone safe first.  It is not the fault of the teachers that we have a pandemic or that they also need protection.  Because teachers tend to be quiet doesn't mean they should be pandemic punching bags for everyone's frustration with the virus.  They've done a tremendous job in the face of a crisis.  This is a case for putting everyone's safety first.  This school year is about to end now.  Let's move on."
2021-05-13 14:25,"As a teacher I want all of the kids back in class. But I have some advice from Louisiana that has been face to face all this last year. 
1: Students are awful with complying with Covid precautions. I’m constantly saying “The mask goes above your nose. 
2: My class escaped the worst of quarantine this year, until this last month of school. They were quarantined for ten days, back for two, then back out on quarantine again. I teach teenagers and I have no idea what they do when they leave my class. 
3: Open a window and use a fan…… I have no windows to open on my interior classroom. Many public school buildings are lucky not to be condemned. 

I’ve been vaccinated and that helps me feel a bit safer, I wear a mask religiously to protect others. Sadly my community will neither mask or vaccinate. 

There are a lot of community factors that will make opening safer or less so.
Private schools get to choose their students and have much smaller class sizes. Comparing public schools to small private schools is unfair, that would be like comparing a small technical school to Yale. These two institutions have nothing in common."
2021-05-13 14:13,"At this point, I’m ready to put my seven year old back in school in September. I kept him out along with his older brother (14) because his brother has an illness. I opted to homeschool them due to limiting screen time. Oh my.  It was probably once of the most difficult things I’ve ever done.  They are both starved for outside contact and I am in desperate need of a break.  Now that my medically vulnerable child will be vaccinated in the next few weeks, I am SO relieved at the prospect of sending my little one back into the real world and allowing him to socialize and learn with someone other than his mom.  I am not worried about him.  If a new and odd variant that threatens the vaccinated pops up, I’ll pull him out again (to protect his brother).  BUT man, I’m ready for some help.  Thank you, teachers."
2021-05-13 13:19,"The fact of the matter is most teachers enjoy their profession but are burned out working in antiquated schools with minimal resources. Throw in a viral pandemic and the incentive to work decreases even more. I went to a school function for my child and used the restroom [pre-pandemic] and it was appalling. I've seen cleaner, open trench bathrooms in rural India. The only thing that seems to keep them going is their ""light at the end of the tunnel"" pension. Our public schools should be new, modern, clean and safe. Why can't our public schools have the same quality standards as a Ritz Carlton Hotel? A place where faculty and students would want to attend and take pride. Leave the teachers alone and just provide them the proper facilities they need to educate. Run up the country credit card and let's start rebuilding our schools, our communities and create a bright, vibrant future for our children. It will pay off in spades!"
2021-05-13 14:27,"Keeping schools closed for the 2021-2022 school year would be a disaster. Kids have suffered enough because of the pandemic and the academic fallout from the pandemic will affect children for many years.

Randi Weingarten is on the right track for the next school year."
2021-05-13 13:53,"US teachers unions are an industry that is highly decentralized and always shouting about ""local control"". While it's great that Ms. Weingarten wants schools open fully 5 days a week, it hardly matters when the thousands of individual teacher unions simply do what they want. Good luck, Ms. Weingarten! There likely will be a significant number of public schools - particularly in very liberal regions - that don't fully open until long after the pandemic ends."
2021-05-13 13:40,"Schools have been open.  LAUSD, the second largest District in the country, has been open for a month.  

Nevertheless, bring on the anti-teacher parade of bitter, uninformed, petty opinions.  Despite the fact that even with unions, teachers' working conditions are slightly better than Amazon warehouse workers; most teachers don't make enough to support a single-income household; and they don't make the decisions for schools or districts.  They negotiate.  ""For themselves"" would be an unpardonable sin.

A few years ago, LAUSD's superintendent was asked, ""What's the goal of the District?""  His response, ""To survive.""  No one asked the obvious: ""Shouldn't it be to educate?"" There was no public outcry.  Imagine if teachers came out and said, ""We work to make a living.""  The shaming and condemnation would be overwhelming."
2021-05-13 14:19,"Admittedly we know more about the Coronavirus now, than we did when Trump (yes, that guy) first suggested that schools stay open. If, at that time, the unions had devoted as much time working to remove roadblocks to in-person teaching as they did to marching in the anti-Trump parade, or taking the pulpit to focus on other demands, we might not be into this problem to the extent we are. And, unions might have polished their image, too. Just saying."
2021-05-13 14:23,"I was very optimistic when I read this headline and I appreciate her efforts to move things in the right direction. But this also seems to be a case of ""never let a good crisis go to waste."" She is using this as an opportunity to push through much of her long term agenda. I philosophically agree with a lot of what she wants, but a lot of it is just not realistic to fully achieve and I don't want pushing for it to stand in the way of re-opening.

There is no excuse not to re-open fully this fall. Extremely limited resources should not be diverted to those who want to be remote - if Weingarten wants smaller classes, don't waste teachers on those who insist on being remote. With all teachers and students middle school and up vaccinated by the fall, all of the strict limitations are not necessary.

I still think we should be extremely cautious and I am not opposed to continued mask use - lots of people like to whine about masks, but the vast majority of the kids at our elementary school have no problem with it.

And hopefully the vaccines will go from EUA to full authorization and schools can require vaccination for all eligible teachers and students, like they require other vaccinations.

It really should not be this hard. And we have the whole summer to make it happen."
2021-05-13 15:06,"Too little, too late. The unions has lost a generation of support from parents- even and especially otherwise progressive, democratic parents in blue areas. I, and basically everyone I know in my parent community, will never vote for a local political candidate that makes decisions about education that is supported by the unions.  We need school boards and city councils that have the interests and safety of all workers and children at the top of their mind, not the narrow priorities of a special interest group that fundraised for them.  Healthcare and a safety net for all, kids in school now."
2021-05-13 14:57,"Emblematic of teachers' unions approach all along, Weingarten is again advocating for ""safety"" rules that are unnecessary and reduce children's access to education such as 3 feet physical distance. With vaccinated teachers (and many vaccinated students), this is an anti-scientific proposition and should be recognized for what it is -- another negotiating tactic to push for retaining distance learning for frightened families. Engagement and education and leading by example are needed for hesitant families, not options for inferior education."
2021-05-13 14:44,Finally. Teachers are among the most essential workers—and they deserve our utmost appreciation and respect. But there was no excuse for entire school systems in major urban areas to stay remote so long when there were so many creative ways concerns could have been addressed and given the proven limited transmission of Covid in schools.
2021-05-13 14:06,"I am one of those skeptical parents. While this is good news, fully reopening schools is still contingent on full adoption of AFT guidance by local unions, as stated in the article, along with endorsement and support of local government entities. Here in Philadelphia, Mayor Jim Kenney has not yet issued a statement in support of full time in person school reopening in the Fall; rather, he announced just 2 days ago that the city will fully reopen on the last day of school, 6/11, which is too much of a coincidence. Currently, K-9 are still in hybrid, and 10 - 12th graders will have no chance to see a classroom this school year.

The local union, the PFT, has been using building conditions as a way to delay reopening. Understand there are environmental issues that need to be addressed, and no one wants teachers and students to be exposed to lead and asbestos in schools. But that should not be a reason to take away in person education for everyone. I hope they will work with the school district and our city in good faith, especially since union contract will expire in August. Parents are watching.

In the meantime, for those areas where schools aren't fully open, parents should continue to apply pressure to their local government and teachers union for a Fall reopening plan. They need to hear from parents, and they need to know parents are watching closely."
2021-05-13 13:54,"There should probably be much opportunity for (tech) disruption in public education.  I expect that remote technology will inevitably become a much ingrained and bigger part of public education which we can see even in NYC public schools switching to remote learning for exigencies like snowstorms.  I can imagine that some parents feel that their kids thrive under remote learning and there could be remote only schools for these kids - kind of like homeschooling as a service with much more choice and access to expertise, great for families that don't like their local system, don't feel the need for social contact outside their circles, or are doing something unconventional like traveling around the world or living on a sailboat for 2 years.  
Maybe additional enrichment subjects can be done remotely in a classroom where it's hard to find local in person talent to teach such subjects.  There'll be winners and losers amongst the education industry as a result of these changes but it could lead to a lot of innovation choice and less one size fits all."
2021-05-13 15:33,"If Ms. Weingarten were truly serious about a full reopening of in-person education, she would support mandatory vaccination for all teachers and other school personnel and for all age-eligible students, permitting only medical exemptions. That would provide a safe environment for high schools now and for other schools later this year as work continues on a vaccine for children  under 12.

Vaccines for measles and other childhood diseases are already required to attend school in most places. Let's do the same for COVID-19."
2021-05-13 16:33,"Schools need to open, full stop. The risk of infection was always about the adults, not the children, for whom the risk is minuscule. Vaccination = in person learning."
2021-05-13 14:49,"""ambitious ventilation system overhauls instead of simpler solutions, such as fans and open windows""

Fans and open windows work great if, say, you live a place where the climate is mild during the school year and you actually have windows that open. I live in New England. School buildings are built to be energy efficient in the cold months when schools are in session. No school buildings in our districts have air conditioning, they only have heat, since air conditioning was viewed as an unnecessary expense when they were constructed. If they have windows that open, they are very small. Some rooms have no windows at all.

One of the lessons we could take from the pandemic is that indoor air quality does really matter in our workplaces and schools, and investments in improving the air handling could pay dividends in terms not only for COVID, but also reducing the spread of flu and the common cold, and lead to refinement of HVAC code and recommendations."
2021-05-13 13:53,"There are safe and effective ways to open schools with minimal risk to society.  There have been numerous examples of how to accomplish this task, unfortunately they cost money.  It is essentially only wealthy private schools which have achieved safe reopening early in the pandemic and touted their success without acknowledging the cost.  Underfunding of the public school system chronically has exacerbated this difference.  Conservative states and federal governments have removed money from public education and in many cases transferred public funds into private schools.  This trend must be reversed for the sake of the children.  Many private schools are tax exempt and yet receive public funds, that is wrong.  Private education is a choice, not a right or need."
2021-05-13 16:22,"In regards to the hesitancy of families to send their students back to school, it's just time to get over it.  I am a public school teacher  and the learning loss for my students over distance has been staggering. I suspect that entire grade levels are now effectively off track for graduation and college readiness because of our districts insistence on remaining mostly closed.  

We have near magical vaccines that offer almost complete protection against the virus and as high school teachers, we work with a population that now is eligible to be fully vaccinated. The governor and state superintendent need  to take a hard line with districts.  Mandate that schools are open fully in the fall, deny funding and teacher pay for teachers who refuse to come back, including those with pre-existing conditions (I have a co-worker who has a preexisting condition but ALSO refused to get vaccinated and has been given permission to not return this year, ridiculous), and communicate clearly to parents that there will simply be no option for distance learning for your child in the fall.  We have been blessed by the miracles of science and pharmaceutical companies (not a sentence I though I would ever write) with a vaccine that is a near panacea for this crisis.  It's effectives  changes the conversation.  IN reality, people have become used to and comfortable with our lock down existence because there are aspects of it that are great.  That time is ending."
2021-05-13 15:31,"I’m a teacher in Montreal, Canada. Since September 2020 in spite of a second and third wave, we have taught all year.

It took the government till late October to realize that the children needed masks and till April that we needed to be deemed essential, vaccine.

In spite, we soldiered on, many of us and our students got sick putting ourselves and families at risk. Most of the second and third waves were driven by schools.

In my 28 years as an educator never been so exhausted. Oh did I mention that our poor students suffered along with us during this social experiment. Hope everyone recovers during the summer.

It needed to be done, online teaching was not the full proof answer."
2021-05-13 16:39,"With only 18 months until the midterm elections, this is a timely call on the part of a key player responsible for keeping in-person learning off-limits for the past year or more."
2021-05-13 16:07,"The issue to me is the continued uncertainty.  This is really hard on kids, I think.  Make a decision and do the best you can.  But if it will be remote then say that - no more back and forth."
2021-05-13 16:52,"It is mind-boggling to me that people are proceeding under any working assumption other than that schools will reopen full time in the fall. The case for a full reopening is clear, given: (1) exponential decay of the virus because of mass vaccinations (for every 20-point increase in vaccination among adults, the risk of transmission to children halves); (2) for children, the mortality risk is comparable to that from seasonal influenza, and hospitalizations occur in only 0.008 percent of diagnosed infectionsong-term COVID-19; (3) long term COVID-19 and post-COVID heart problems in children and young adults are rare; (4) studies show that the cost to children's learning and social development and psychological well-being from distance learnimg is becoming prohibitive; and (5) 9 out of 10 teachers are or will be fully vaccinated by the fall. 

If you let science guide decisions, they become less complicated."
2021-05-13 14:29,Teachers unions are harmful for children. They should come under the state’s control. Pathetic.No accountability.
2021-05-13 13:31,"If so many people didnt have a helicopter mentality,the kids would be ok,let the pros do their jobs"
2021-05-13 14:50,"Good luck with procuring extra space. The class sizes in the poorer school districts I’ve seen were atrocious.

Is there a long-standing policy failure in this country that COVID hasn’t made painfully obvious?"
2021-05-13 17:03,There was no rational reason they weren't opened two months ago.  At least k-8 was a no brainer.
2021-05-13 15:07,"The Times is allowing itself to be used here as part of a very shrewd rebranding by the teachers union. A non-partisan observer over these last months would surely see the obvious: teachers unions have opposed school openings at every turn, sometimes with reason, often without.  But they've come to see that even liberal parents now have had enough--and, since many of those parents are Times readers, they now are trying to rewrite a pretty clear history starring themselves as the heroes. It's a complex issue; I just wish this were a more skeptical story, as the facts deserve."
2021-05-13 16:50,Randi talking about the importance of opening schools is about as convincing as Trump talking about the importance of truth and justice.
2021-05-13 16:59,"The teachers have every right to be afraid.  The Schools are notorious germ factories even under ideal circumstance.  
No one can be guaranteed that a parent will keep a kid home if they are sick or if a member of their family has Covid.
If I were a teacher I would be very leery of teaching in person, especially with the large number of people who don't get their shots.  

If they vaccinate everyone in the building, parents, teachers, administrators, janitors, lunch ladies, cafeteria workers and librarians, then yes, by all means re-open the schools.  If not, then continue virtual instruction."
2021-05-13 15:22,"Key to this happening is to have all schools require all students to have been vaccinated against Covid. Just as with polio, rubella and other diseases, this is the only way to safely get kids back in their much needed structured learning."
2021-05-13 17:06,"Lots of fancy private schools never closed. It’s not like they had vaccines back in 2020, they simply didn’t cave to fear and scaremongering and they have not had significant Covid problems."
2021-05-13 17:00,"The article seems a little twisted. This is the same person who fought hard until very recently to keep teachers out of the classrooms. With donations from this same organization going to political candidates no one challenged her logic. Keep in mind the teachers were receiving full pay, benefits and accruing time on their pensions staying out."
2021-05-13 14:58,"Randi Weingarten should be ashamed of herself.  She and Michael Mulgrew are responsible for creating the horrible situation in New York City.  Now she is stating schools should be opened in the Fall.   She should have stated this already.  We know that transmission of COVID19 is extremely low in schools based on studies which have been conducted specifically looking at this.  It is the teachers and staff who are the bigger concern.  The vaccine has been available since December 2020.  Teachers should have been given priority and I am certain if Ms. Weingarten lobbied for this it would have occurred.  
It is essential that teachers be vaccinated.  Students should be encouraged to be vaccinated if they are eligible for the vaccine.  Once the vaccines are officially FDA approved the vaccine can be mandated.  Those of us in healthcare are required to get the flu shot annually or provide a reason as to why we are not.  The same should apply to the COVID19 vaccine.  
Schools must be opened and children should return to a relatively normal school environment.  Perhaps masks will be required for the near future.
Ms. Weingarten and the UFT needs to stop being an obstacle.  
And for those parents who believe that distance learning is comparable to being in the classroom, it simply is not for children.  Socialization is a big part of being in school and it does not occur when at home."
2021-05-13 14:00,"Sadly the teachers unions continue to try and leverage the pandemic to achieve their regular aims. It is nothing more than an pandemic-excused “sick out” at this point.

The nation cannot contort itself permanently to accommodate one selfish and self absorbed monopoly.

Makes unions look really bad and highlights their extreme downside.  Time to order the teachers back and fire those who refuse."
2021-05-13 17:03,"I think (and I’ve said this before as a former lifelong New Yorker) and architect, that we (NYC) must change how schools are designed and maintained. They are just a step above your average prison (coincidence?) Poor natural light, ventilation, green space and overall expandability. This pandemic I’m afraid will have a permanent detrimental effect on our young people and future workforce for decades to come."
2021-05-13 16:03,"Seems like people are realizing that police unions and teachers' unions are not in the public interest.  There are lots of good police officers and lots of good teachers, but they are ill served by their unions.  FDR was right in opposing public employee unions.

Ms. Weingarten is doing damage control after her efforts to keep schools closed while teachers still received full pay backfired on her."
2021-05-13 15:04,"AFT has no medical expertise and should be bound to complying with CDC policy. 

After bullying their way to the front of the vaccine line, why teachers are still given the choice to not conduct in-person learning is beyond me."
2021-05-13 16:04,"I hope that all of those who want full-time, in-person learning this fall have chosen to vaccinate themselves to make it possible. My kids are back in person 5 days/week in public schools, and I agree that it can be done safely. But I resent the assumption that kids, teachers, staff, bus drivers, etc. will just keep wearing masks and social distancing when adults in the community have decided they don't have to do it. Why does the burden of safety fall on students and teachers? If people are truly committed to getting kids back in school, they'll do their part and get vaccinated. The selfishness of a certain subset of Americans is beyond the pale."
2021-05-13 15:19,"Schools have been open since day 1. It’s disrespectful to teachers and our kids who’ve been attending online to say otherwise. That narrative casts the last year’s efforts as a waste. Every time you say “reopen,” it should be followed with, “to in-person schooling.”

The problem, yet again, with any debate over education in the US is the the knee jerk reaction that teachers are the problem — and the solution. Let’s remember that schools are underfunded and under staffed with terrible infrastructure. These aren’t slick office buildings w new ventilation.
Schools didn’t get any major funding until this spring. 
So parents and lawmakers can rail all they want against schools and teachers but there is absolutely no understanding of what it takes to run a school safely. 
At the end of the day, they are approaching school like they always have — a place for the kids to go. If we actually cared about the learning, the community, the child, we would’ve provided schools and teachers and children with what they needed to be successful."
2021-05-13 15:30,"Anyone who’s been half awake for the past 9 months knows that powerful metro and national teachers unions are the reason for our protracted closures.

I wish them well in their campaign to reassure families, but it feels like too little too late. They allowed fear narratives to fester too long in a manner that was nakedly self-serving and unsubstantiated, and in the process undermined the very idea of public and in-person school. It will be difficult to pick up the pieces."
2021-05-13 14:24,"Our district has returned to five days in person since Late January. Any inkling of a sick student or teacher sends them home to quarantine. We have had ""zero"" (I cannot say this with 100% certainty) cases of reported transmission in our schools because of this policy. This has ensured all students, staff, and parents feel comfortable with their students being back in-person. You can bring a negative test back after a few days to return instead of waiting the full quarantined time. It has worked for our district of 12,000. I don't know how well it would work for larger districts, but they do need to give families a comprehensive plan on what they will do to give everyone confidence they can stay open consistently.

We also offer full online for those still worried. It works for the time being. We're not done with this yet and we have to give families the right to choose either next year."
2021-05-13 14:57,"The union will fight hard for the best money and benefits for it's members. That's its purpose. That's been its history..The Union may take students and their education into account in their efforts, but it's mostly lip service and used cleverly as a PR ploy to  benefit teachers in negotiations. Smaller class size means more teachers etc. All Unions do this. That is their purpose. But don't be mislead by their rhetoric. Their history during Corona, as always, has been about teachers not students. As it should be!"
2021-05-13 15:59,"Weingarten must know that even people who are pro teacher are fed up with teachers not wanting to go back.  I get it some teachers make very little but overall teaching and administrator jobs pay a decent salary with benefits that have long since ceased to exist in the private sector.  Teachers can retire after 35 years with 70 percent of final salary and retiree healthcare.  No one gets that anymore.  Just this week the NY Times profiled how teachers in PA get 75 percent of their salary for 30 years worked.  In my town the administrator who oversees the bus routes and buildings, makes 196K with another 10K to a side annuity.  People are upset these salaries are very generous for the duties involved.  Do we need to pay a former music teacher 196K to hire an outside bus company to plan the routes?"
2021-05-13 16:47,"In other news, Donald Trump says he is favor of free and fair elections. Seriously, how can you take Ms. Weingarten's statement at face value when teachers unions have been the biggest obstacle to in-person re-opening of schools. Right now my local elementary school is open 5 hours per week. The words sound good but let's examine the actions behind them."
2021-05-13 14:53,"Follow the money...

Across the country, public school enrollment has declined and will continue to decline as parents can no longer put their careers on the line because teachers are rejecting “the” science and refusing in person teaching.  

Since funding is tied to enrollment and the pandemic has emboldened school choice initiatives, Randi and pals are realizing they have overplayed their hand."
2021-05-13 15:47,A national embarrassment and disgrace...
2021-05-13 13:49,"Well this is quite an about face from someone who, in an April 9 interview with the Times of Israel, criticized Texas for having fully face to face schooling, and who in the same interview blamed those who want to reopen schools as ""part of the ownership class.""

But public opinion is clear, and she is now waving the white flag.  Obama's State Department called this sort of capitulation to pressure ""leading from behind."""
2021-05-13 16:09,This person is by far the most responsible for the horrors families have experienced since the awful mismanagement of education during this pandemic began. The greed and stupidity exposed by the teachers union leadership betrayed families and even the dedicated teachers yearning to teach and help the children. Kids will be behind for years because of Weingarten and her cronies.
2021-05-13 16:14,"I did not waste my time reading this article beyond the headline. The head of the teachers union is forging a path to open by next year and that is going to be viewed as an accomplishment!? Her and her union mafia buddies have thrown up one road block after another, it's obvious their intention from day one was to not go back to work for this school year, now there going to act like they are heroes because schools will be opened by the fall, their money to the Democratic Party served them well with great grandpa Joe and the phonies leading our country right now. They got to sit home and not work and get full pay because of their huge donations to the Democratic Party it's as simple as that they are fooling nobody."
2021-05-13 15:56,"I have a very new disrespect for public school teachers. What children they are, whining and moaning the last year. Not all but many.  I use to think they were underpaid, not any more - overpaid privileged brats. Cut their pay, increase charter school spending/vouchers, and let’s move on!"
2021-05-13 15:30,"Guess Randy and not Joe is in charge.

It must be a joke, where was she last summer?"
2021-05-13 14:22,"Hilarious. That same person who had been fighting tooth and nail to not have full schools reopening despite the science and the evidence showing barely any transmission in class vs outside world. Shown to be one of the most selfish organizations in the country with no care for the children. Extremely frustrating for our relatives with children in the city.

And now she is pretending to be the champion of the children and of trying to reopen schools. Only the people with their heads in the sand over the last year would believe this liar."
2021-05-13 13:25,"Union teachers are the cowards of the pandemic, they have done more harm to our children by refusing to open the schools then COVID 19 could  have possibly done.  Study after study show schools safer then any other environment yet teachers still refuse, staying home while collecting their paychecks.  Contrast them to the real hero's of the pandemic, our medical community and lets not forget those who could not to say home but had to juggle their jobs and their home bound children.  Union teachers: cowards of the pandemic."
2021-05-13 16:17,"I am a teacher of 26 years who ought to have another 5-10 years left in my career.  The United States' complete bungling of this pandemic (courtesy of trump and his cult) has created a situation where 40% of us will never get vaccinated, don't believe it exists, etc.  With that in mind, and imagining the full classrooms next year with ""optional"" masks, and lots of ignorant cynicism from the parents who will send their kids to school unvaccinated, I have submitted my resignation and will retire next week.  So, good luck to you all!"
2021-05-13 13:02,Why ‘must’ they ‘open in the fall’? We will certainly be revving up to a new variant spread.
2021-05-13 13:21,"Second largest teachers union? Back to school won't happen, for many reasons. Parents. Students. People who won't get vaccinated. People who won't get vaccinated. It's not rocket science. Just ask Dr. Fauci."
2021-05-13 12:52,"The “kids and families have opted out of the vaccines, so we must improve remote learning” is a complete and utter dodge. 

As pro-Union as I am, it’s way past time the teachers stopped stalling and got back to the classroom. As I tell my family who are educators and administrator’s at all levels in the public school system. ..... “figure it out and get back in there, you’re supposed to be the smart ones”. 

Earn the money for the job you signed up for or resign for the next person who wants the job."
2021-05-13 13:08,I was never for school choice or school vouchers till COVID started.  All the essential workers showed up to work except the teachers.  I will never forgive them.
2021-05-13 14:03,"This reeks of damage control after the UFTs influence over CDC policy was revealed.  Wish she would drop the pretense of concern and protection of students.  Be honest and focus your concern on your members.  
Private schools remained open without a surge of cases.  Those left behind by the UFT's intransigence were those who could least afford it."
2021-05-13 17:04,I’m guessing that kids whose education was devastated by school closures are not gonna be very supportive of teachers unions when they reach voting age.
2021-05-13 12:57,"What? The person who was largely responsible for keeping schools shuttered is now acting like a martyr in the cause for reopening them??  My kids just started school back 3 hours a day for 2 days a week after 15 months off, and even then it was after a near revolt by parents against our union-driven school board here in Ann Arbor.   Seeing this headline felt like a slap in the face."
2021-05-13 15:11,Why the three foot distance rule when the virus is airborne? Better just to open the window and get a fan.
2021-05-13 15:26,"This is incredibly disingenuous; the teachers’ unions are the only thing standing between the country’s children and in-person school. If Randi Weingarten really wanted kids in classrooms, she could have them there next week.

The American labor movement has been in decline consistently over the last 50 years; now it’s down to a hardened nub of intransigent goons. You’d think unions would want to do something constructive for the nation to regain some relevance during a period when many people are more open to union involvement in areas like gig work and green manufacturing. Unfortunately, the teachers’ unions have used the COVID crisis to advance their parochial interests in the worst possible way, at the direct expense of children. I’m a left-wing Democrat, but count me out of the union movement."
2021-05-13 15:04,"I'm a teacher.

I long to have schools reopened.

I long to have my students in my classrooms.

But then I see folks like Dana Goldstein suggesting that all we need to do is open windows and run fans instead of overhauling ventilation systems.

Uhhhhh. . . hold on.

My room has windows that do not open.  Roughly 1/3 of my colleagues on my campus have rooms that do not have windows at all.  Such things have been standard in school construction for the last 30 years or more, especially in warmer parts of the country.  Unless we are going to retrofit schools over the summer, opening windows isn't even on the radar as an answer.

Besides, that isn't what is needed. Vaccines are. Until and unless we mandate the COVID vaccines for all teachers, all staff, and all students old enough to be vaccinated, we will see continued resistance to reopening as normal.  Any parent who refuses to vaccinate their child can keep their kids ant home and online, or enroll them at their own expense in a private school.  Any employees refusing the vaccine must be terminated for cause or placed in a position in which they teach exclusively online."
2021-05-13 16:07,"There is an easy answer to this and that is mandated vaccinations for teachers and students. What about personal choice you say? Simply say, vaccinate or home-school your kids, its you choice.."
2021-05-13 14:43,"This is so disingenuous. The AFT got a headline that it wants full reopening but then attached a bunch of conditions that would make that impossible. With all willing adults and teenagers vaccinated by fall, and with kids' low spread and the mild course of disease they experience, the rationale for school restrictions will fall apart. If we follow the trajectory of the UK and Israel, we will have turned covid into a manageable virus circulating at a very low level with drastically reduced lethality. And so there should be no  reason to ask kids to sacrifice a third school year."
2021-05-13 16:05,"It's damage control.  When I started seeing left leaning/pro labor friends with kids venting about the teacher's union, I knew the horse was out of the barn.

There will also be those who vilify teachers no matter what.  But when the people who would normally support you are getting fed up, it's an strong indicator that you've completely misread the room."
2021-05-13 16:58,"Ms Weingarten has already lost her battle to save the reputations of teachers, let alone teacher’s unions. Low paid Grocery workers and home health aids stepped up the front page. Teachers did not and their refusal was supported by the unions. Their ‘it’s all about the children’ battlecry when striking for more money at the children’s expense always rang hollow. Now we know why."
2021-05-13 15:55,"The teachers union President is in no position to advise when it is safe for our children to return to school. It is extremely disheartening to see this pandemic politicized. Public health must rule the day when it comes to reopening our jobs, businesses and schools. Let's allow the doctors and scientist to do their jobs and advise when it is safe to return to normalcy."
2021-05-13 16:06,"Now that she sees reopening is inevitable, she wants to go on record as favoring it."
2021-05-13 13:08,"Last week, Los Angeles Unified School District administered 125,000 tests and had 15 positive cases among students and 2 among staff. That’s what zero looks like in epidemiology. In the past year, students have been set back immeasurably both academically and psychologically. Why are we even contemplating anything short of full on-campus instruction? There are no other priorities for educators at this point but to educate our kids in person in the way they do best."
2021-05-13 16:20,"One high visibility silver lining of the pandemic is the questioning of the value and relevance of public education.  By way of example, in an era of digital access and high-speed learning, why does it take 16 years to get an eighth grade education.  The inefficiency and  of public education is raising alarm and parent activism at the grass roots level.  The winds of change are picking up and may well overcome the remaining verve of teachers unions who have failed to keep pace while disregarding the children"
2021-05-04 10:41,I don’t know if this is a good idea. Let the companies make money. Just because the government is giving money away should not mean they can give private property away. That would be wrong. Fooey!
2021-05-04 10:45,"There is no question that lifing the patent protections on vaccines that will save tens of millions of lives worldwide is the right thing to do.  The real question is, will the U.S. do the right thing?  

it's quite sad, really, that this is even a debatable topic.  The term ""no brainer"" comes to mind.  The depth of American greed is truly grotesque."
2021-05-04 11:05,"Perhaps there is some middle ground here.   The companies that developed the vaccines so quickly deserve to make money for their innovation.  The world (and the USA) needs those vaccines to scale up quickly.  Perhaps use the Defense Production Act to buy and scale up vaccines world wide, to cover the 7.8B people, as quickly as is feasible, but also insure profits at the companies involved.  Work through the UN and UK/EU to help share the costs/burdens, get the vaccines distributed as quickly as possible.   We need the companies focused on variants, this is not a one and done deal, the virus will evolve to beat the current vaccines.  The quicker the world gets covered, the quicker that evolution will cycle down, become more manageable.   But we need the companies incentivized to continue to develop and evolve vaccines."
2021-05-04 11:03,"My country cannot afford vaccines and we are the wealthiest country in Africa.   We have about 50k healthcare workers vaccinated which is about 0.1 percent of the population.    Pharmaceutical company greed will not only kill millions of non wealthy people, but it also allows the virus to continue to mutate into more lethal strains.  Those more deadly versions will wind up back in the wealthy half of the world and wreak havoc all over again.  Maybe this is exactly what capitalism desires.  Keep more deadly viruses going and charge exorbitant prices.   Any person with basic morality would allow scientists in less wealthy counties to produce a vaccine.   We have expensive medical equipment too, we don’t all live in grass huts."
2021-05-04 11:03,Our money sickness affects everything we do.
2021-05-04 11:10,"Why does it take halfway through the article for you to mention that US Taxpayers paid for vaccine development?  The US spent BILLIONS on the vaccine.  Agree or disagree with giving the vaccine away, but protecting pharma and investment banks should not be a consideration, at least when it comes to US taxpayer dollars.  That decision should be up to the government."
2021-05-04 11:12,"The argument from pharmaceutical companies is incoherent. They say that waiving IP rights will harm innovation and not increase supply. But if waiving IP rights does not increase supply by allowing more competitors to manufacture vaccines, then pharmaceutical companies will not be hurt financially, and therefore the waiver will not reduce their incentives. This makes obvious that they are just using with whatever excuse they can come up with."
2021-05-04 11:08,"Then there was Jonas Salk, who discovered the polio vaccine and gave it away. He applied for no patents. A mensch."
2021-05-04 11:23,Of course they are going to hold on to their patents. They would be throwing away their money instead of helping world health. They are not in the public service sector. And once the vaccine sales dwindle they will magically come up with a pill to treat the illness - thank you Pfizer.
2021-05-04 11:23,"Two months after full vaccination, I am grateful every day. The year of living in isolation and terror is past.  Cautiously, with mask and distance, my life is back. And every day, when I read about the horror of the pandemic in India, in Latin America, my heart breaks. It's an obscenity that people are refusing vaccination here, while hundreds of thousands of people are dying of this plague in India and around the world. Somehow they must be given access to the vaccine, whether by donations or information sharing."
2021-05-04 11:16,Lifting patent is not the right answer. Greed is bad but stupidity is terrible. Lifting patent helps no one primarily the US scientists and workers at these companies as they have to earn their livelihoods and research cures for diseases.  Therefore selling the vaccines at a reasonable amount unique to each country's situation would be best.
2021-05-04 11:13,"Business as usual in a global pandemic is absurd. Everything else for the rollout of these vaccines was accelerated and subsidized, the same should happen for the rest of the world. 

If the profit motive condemning waiving patent protection stands, the US will shoot itself in the foot. The longer the pandemic sloshes around the globe the more variants we will get--one may be much worse--influenza level resistant to vaccines.

Coddling pharma profits is idiotic. At least Moderna has already done the right thing. (Moderna was also subsidized.)

The precedent they are setting is that when it was life and death for everyone they shared, so they will need all their other profits. And the specific precedent is that when the next pandemic hits they should share again."
2021-05-04 11:26,"Just giving away the patents isn't likely to solve the problem.  There's a lot of expertise needed as well to produce working vaccines.  I'm more in favor of the wealthy counties banding together to buy enough vaccine for everyone, and giving it away, or at low cost, like they do for their own populations.  We all won't be safe until everyone is vaccinated.  In the meantime, the unvaccinated population will serve as incubators for variants.  Buying vaccine for the world population would be a good use of my tax dollars.  And it's probably not that much."
2021-05-04 11:30,"Didn’t the tech underpinning the RNA messenger vaccines come from government funding? Couldn’t the international community (governments, NGOs, corporations, you/me/all of us) raise fund and purchase the vaccines or buy out the patent? Pharma needs to be big, but health care is a social good so big in this case means government. This can be innovative and profitable but there should be a better way to structure the funding to make the result serve the social need more equitably."
2021-05-04 11:38,"""innovation"" and ""entrepreneurship"" weighed against human lives. the idea that there is even a debate here is monstrous. 

i get that there are more barriers to vaccine production then just the IP. but if we make the recipe available we will foster innovation in that people will find ways to overcome those barriers."
2021-05-04 11:39,"The waiver would be a mistake creating long-term problems. It would also be simply unfair to require anyone or any entity to surrender their intellectual property rights. The companies should expand production as fast as possible and sell at cost or donate to poorer countries. I would not be opposed to taxpayer dollars being used to subsidize vaccination programs in poor countries, if necessary. But taking away intellectual property rights, even from pharmaceutical companies, would create more problems than it solves -- and it probably would not solve the problem at hand."
2021-05-04 11:53,"What about the fact that US tax dollars were used to fund some of the research. If our tax dollars are used, and big pharma cries poverty, then you and I should own some of that patent, and we as a human rights forward nation should be able to donate our share of patents. With the massive gop tax giveback to rich pharma only a tiny bit was used for R&D, they cared more about stock buybacks."
2021-05-04 12:00,"There is a simple solution. Compensate the drug companies for the vaccine patents. 

Keep in mind that Pfizer didn’t accept US government money. Furthermore, when the money was given to the pharma companies, the US government did not write up contracts at that time demanding rights to the patents. 

It is not the responsibility of private enterprise to fund social spending. That’s the job of government. 

The wealthy governments and the UN should raise the funds to by out the patents. 

Furthermore, the pharma companies are going to be asked to come up with follow on booster vaccines and also deal with variants. They will need to be paid to conduct that work. 

Perhaps the government or a non-profit should form their own pharmaceutical company."
2021-05-04 12:08,"And when the next pandemic occurs, will the pharmaceutical industry be willing to put their time, effort & technology on the line to develop a drug the patent for which can be taken away?
The WHO & the UN should negotiate a price that allows broad use. There’s a difference between making profits & losing patents."
2021-05-04 11:46,"American manufacturers providing the vaccine ""at cost"" is misleading when one considers that their costs after paying their executives and employees in USD can be orders of magnitude higher than an Indian manufacturer providing the same vaccine ""at cost"", as is demonstrated by the example of the Hepatitis B vaccine in the article ($23 v/s $1)."
2021-05-04 11:56,"Wealth over Health - every single time. If there ever was a good example of this, this is it. Now I’m wondering if this is what Bill and Melinda Gates broke up over…I need to cut down on my news feeds."
2021-05-04 11:28,"It is disappointing to see comments supporting the existence of a company and its profits/IP as opposed to helping save the lives of their fellow human beings. Sure, this may not be a fool proof solution but we live in unprecedented times. What then is your solution to the problem ? Sadly, the pandemic does not end when the rich countries have vaccinated."
2021-05-04 11:46,"I can’t believe you are making me defend big pharma.

While we’re at it, the NY Times will let everyone read its content for free, instead of being subsidized, Tesla will give 1 of 4 cars it makes to a poor person or poor country, and there is no charge for baseball tickets. 

And the employers of the supporting commenters will do the same."
2021-05-04 11:55,"Lifting patent restrictions will do nothing to COVID vaccine situation. India has been allowed to produce vaccines and therapeutics like Remdesivir. 

Take a look at Emergent Biosolutions situation and you know the delicacy of vaccine production to insure the trust.

Any do-gooders who thought this might be a good excuse to liberalize the patent world are really doing the world a disservice by giving people like Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi an excuse to damage their respective country with poor governance"
2021-05-04 11:32,"The days of Jonas Salk are gone, but the longer this incubates in India and Brazil, the more of a risk it presents to us, especially since we aren’t totally shutting them out like China or Australia. So selfishly, I think Mr. Biden needs to stop short of essentially nationalizing this ingenious IP and ￼press pharma to grant licenses that suspend license payments until such time the surges in those countries are tamed. Thereafter, license payments must resume to maintain the profit motive. Ironically, we have to appeal to man’s sins (greed) to assist in his own survival and perhaps that’s a commentary on how lacking of virtue there is in today’s world."
2021-05-04 12:45,"If there is ANY involvement of public money - even just the use of student labor at a university - much less actual research at such facilities, then ""we the people"" should be the ones owning the product, at least in part."
2021-05-04 12:44,"Patents are not extraterritorial. You have to get a patent in every country. 

Why would you give away this know how and trade secrets to ship more jobs overseas?

It would not help the pandemic since we are making vaccines as fast as we can. 

The naivety of the authors is apparent. 

The US will subsidize the rest of the world again and give them vaccines if they have the capability to store them in special freezers and administer them. This is the only way to accomplish this."
2021-05-04 13:00,However this shakes out America has already created a horrible pr problem globally by appearing to dither and wilt under pressure from Bill Gates and pharma—is anyone reading the global reporting on this?
2021-05-04 12:59,"In general, the fact that we give pharmaceutical companies legal monopolies and then fail to negotiate with them about price accounts for the fact that US consumers often pay a multiple of what other countries in the world pay for drugs. An easy plan to rectify this for Medicare and Medicaid at least would be for the US to pay an average of what five or six other countries pay for the same drugs."
2021-05-04 13:43,"The pharma companies have already made immense profits and benefitted greatly from the publicly-funded research on mRNA vaccines. They are not able to produce vaccines as quickly as are needed. There are manufacturers around the world waiting who have the resources to make more vaccines, they just don't have the recipe. 

To keep the patents in place is to value profits over human life. Not only is it heartless, but it also stretches out the length of the pandemic, allowing the virus to mutate - a worse outcome for everyone on Earth."
2021-05-04 13:43,"Why is this issue being framed in all-or-nothing terms? Pure dichotemizing of either A or B, with no middle ground.

There are solutions to the world's not having enough anti-COVID vaccines at the moment that do not involve the innovators giving up patent rights.  Surely there are calm, sane people out there who can develop ways to do this."

2021-05-04 14:56,"I have really mixed feelings about this. Intellectual property should be protected, but in some instances (like the health and well-being of humanity - and that's NOT hyperbole), it seems that these companies could do as the old Mercedes commercials used to say:
Q. Why aren't you taking patents out on your safety innovations?
A. Because everyone should be able to benefit from safety."
2021-05-04 16:02,"One basic distinction between liberals and conservatives  centers on incentives (and disincentives) as effective factors in influencing mass behavior.  Liberals typically focus on first-order effects of policy, ignoring second-order effects that emerge as populations and markets adjust to such policy.

Breaking patents on life-saving innovations today disincentivizes biotech and pharmaceutical firms from making the highly risky investments required to develop the life-saving technologies of tomorrow.  

After J&J, Pfizer and Biontech have been chased out of the vaccines market (as many have been in the past), how will you source a vaccine for the inevitable next pandemic?"
2021-05-04 16:33,"While I would favor the companies providing these vaccines with a fair profit or allowing other companies to produce them under license and providing a fair return for the inventors, the fact is that making these drugs is very difficult and requires a huge investment to tool up. This can’t be done in mom and pop labs in the bush somewhere. It’s much more difficult, say, than making methamphetamine. And it needs to be supervised."
2021-05-04 16:24,"Give those patents away. The fact that its being debated when India is imploding is shameful. Have we learned, what effects the world, effect the U.S. I guess not."
2021-05-04 16:23,"As easily as they stole our top secret atomic research intellectual properties and have hacked into our security servers with ease, Russia, Chinna, India, North Korea, Iran, Israel, and Pakistan will also steal these.

Will they offer them freely to the needy countries in the name of humanity or hold them hostage to make political and territorial concessions?!?

Then there looms the very large concern if that these countries have the quality control to safely manufacture these highly complex vaccines or just throw something out there for political expediency which will do much more harm than good to their populace."
2021-05-04 16:24,"""In a letter to Ms. Tai last month, the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a trade group, warned against giving “license to other countries — some of them our economic competitors — to hollow out our world-leading biotechnology base, export jobs abroad and undermine incentives to invest in such technologies in the future.”

IMO, saving lives - including our own - is a higher value than making it easier for the pharmaceutical industry to make exorbitant profits."

2021-05-04 17:42,"Why this single-minded focus on companies entirely *giving up* their patents?  Wouldn’t the objectives be reached, perhaps more easily, if companies *licensed* their patents to competent firms, for *specific* uses, and for limited periods of time?"

2021-05-04 17:44,"The biggest point to make to Uncle Joe is that proliferation of vaccines--however it's done, and the more facility to produce them, the merrier--is key to US public health.  We'll never be fully safe from a flareup, esp from variants created by overseas epidemics, until as many as possible are vaccinated.  That can't happen soon enuf, and without new vaccine capacity in spades, it won't."
2021-05-04 17:47,I believe this could be an unconstitutional taking. Without compensation to give away process and manufacturing patents will not immediately increase the supply but will hurt our industry. The manufacturing plants will not be ready to produce this immediately. The next time we call on this industry to solve our problems will they put their efforts into solving baldness or drop everything to come to our rescue?  I’m sure the Russian and Chinese who are putting out vaccine with significantly less potency would love our technology.
2021-05-04 18:20,"Foreign direct investment is the solution ---- PFE open the vaccine manufacturing plants in India, using its own team, which would significantly decrease the cost and therefore making the final product affordable for India. However, PFE or any other drug Co. manufacturer, should NOT under any circumstances  give up their intellectual property rights."
2021-05-04 19:28,"It would be wonderful if the vaccine manufacturers themselves decided that their own long-term situation would benefit if they shared their patents. I don't know if they would think that true or not. I do know that pressuring them to do so, and even worse, abrogating their legal rights to what they've made, would likely *not* be in *our* long-term best interests either.

What happens when the next disease comes around ... and it will ... that is also considered a global ""disaster?"" Will the same companies be willing to sink so much into the race to get theirs made ASAP? 

There are dozens of companies that spent a lot of money trying to come up with a safe, effective vaccine for COVID and lost the races and their money. Only a half dozen or so, around the world, have made it into people's arms. How many fewer will there be the next time we need them and which ones will be sitting on what might have been the big breakthrough simply because they have seen their fellow companies be forcibly robbed of their accomplishment?"
2021-05-04 23:26,"We funded the development of the vaccines through government.  And we paid on top after the fact without taking an ownership share for the risk.

We paid twice yet I hear a bunch of people whining about incentives.

Where is the incentive for the average worker?  Can we start patenting labor?  Funny how capital has a union protecting their ownership of things.  But labor is told the free market and competition is good for them."
2021-05-04 23:40,"Let the manufacturers retain their intellectual property rights, because mRNA based vaccines could potentially be developed to fight other diseases, not only the virus-borne ones.  They do need an incentive to increase R&D spending above the minimal levels we have seen for the last few decades.  Research funding has gotten scarce and Biden is trying to correct that.

But there should be a price for this.  The federal government can demand that the manufacturers deliver a minimum number of Covid-19 doses (e.g. a billion) within a time frame (e.g. 3 months) for a maximum price per dose.  That way we do the humane thing in the near term and still motivate corporations to put effort into finding new drugs in the long term."
2021-05-04 22:15,This is a public good. Millions CANNOT be allowed to die just to protect Big Pharma profits.
2021-05-04 23:10,"Ady Barkan and Biden had a conversation before the election.  Biden said clearly he would waive the patents.  It's the right thing to do.

Tax payers paid for every vaccine to be developed even the ones that failed.

National security is at stake as the rest of the world suffers.

The southern border will be flooded with more people if we don't open up the patents.

World stability is also at stake as greater suffering will push more migration in mass.

The US government should have owned those patents.  We took the risks and paid for the development.  

Waive the patents."
2021-05-04 22:33,I wonder who is going to have the last laugh when the variants come home to roost.
2021-05-04 20:06,"We did this take away stunt with the AIDS drugs. Pfizer has in development an anti virus pill that in 5 days people were virus free. We call on big Pharma when we are in serious trouble, but there is a segment of our political spectrum that seems to feel that private investment is somehow free to take when it’s convenient."
2021-05-04 21:54,So when the earth is invaded by a hostile alien life form from a distant galaxy we will not share defense technologies to combat the threat?  How absurd.  The pandemic is a global crisis requiring a global response.  Instead we are arguing about business models?  C’mon man.
2021-05-04 20:17,"read the code breaker.
immensely informative book about the scientists along way that led to this mRNA tech, who they are and how some do not and some do want to leave university labs to go into profit business.  Its the natural course; but its a necessary read IMO for all of us to understand the technology that has brought this to us over the years, and that ""the recipe"" is the end of years and years of research done in university labs."
2021-05-04 23:18,"Polio has been nearly eradicated since I was a child, due in no small part to Dr. Jonas Salk making the formulation for the vaccine universally available at no cost.  
If our profit-driven health care system had been in place then, we would still be dealing with polio today."
2021-05-04 23:23,"There will always be opportunists trying to capitalize during trying times, and this is no exception. Giving away our intellectual capital and patents for the vaccines will not help anybody -- the vaccines are way too complex for other countries to replicate them anytime soon. Rather, other countries are trying to use the pandemic as an excuse to pilfer our conpanies' research and development.  No thanks."
2021-05-04 10:51,"This is the most absurd idea in the world. First of all, the only reason we have vaccines right now is because of intellectual property protections. Companies developed these vaccines to sell them. Period. Second, these vaccines aren’t made in a vacuum. These vaccines aren’t one-offs. Novavax, for example, uses its adjuvant in all of their products. It’s essential to all of them and it is proprietary technology. Now you want them to give it away? Insane. It would be the end of the company. Third, the reason we don’t have more widespread production right now is because of a shortage of raw materials. Now you want to make that worse by opening up the entire world to a raw materialsrace? Releasing the patents won’t make one iota of a difference in production levels. If anything that would make it worse. 

And just when I thought I couldn’t despise the left wing of my party any more, they come through for me. Every lefty idea sounds great in a vacuum until you rub two brain cells together thinking about it."
2021-05-03 11:39,"They need a campaign emphasizing Americans duty to protect their friends and neighbors, as if it were a great wartime effort.  If you get vaccinated, you’re one of the good guys. I remember being young and naive and skipping the flu shot because I was heathy and never got sick.  A friend who studied infectious diseases at the CDC (what a great friend to have!) explained to me that I wasn’t getting my flu shot for myself, but I was doing it for my pregnant coworker, and the guy in chemo from cancer, and for my grandparents. As obvious as that sounds now, “public health” was just something that hadn’t occurred to me yet."
2021-05-03 11:40,"Letting people remain unvaccinated and eventually needing to lock down is a much greater restriction on freedom than requiring people to get the vaccine would be. I live in Spain where the case numbers required us to not leave our houses for four months. Don’t tell me that it’s because you value freedom that you won’t get the vaccine. Freedom for a small number of people to not get a shot one or two days vs freedom of everyone to see friends, not wear a mask, live their lives? No contest."
2021-05-03 11:43,"The question becomes if insurance should cover hospitalization for people who refuse to get vaccinated, after everyone had the opportunity to do so."
2021-05-03 11:43,"Are there no county level data for Wyoming and North Dakota, or are those states just uniformly unwilling to be vaccinated? 

It’s of interest because my county borders Wyoming and lots of people come down here to shop, eat out, and use other services."
2021-05-03 11:44,I bet that more people would be interested in getting the vaccine if vaccination were required to attend mass gatherings and use all forms of public transportation.
2021-05-03 11:46,"What would happen if the whole Trump family and Tucker Carlson made public service announcements to encourage everyone to get the vaccine? Would make sense given that their actions are largely responsible for mismanaging the pandemic. I doubt they would do it for the public good, but maybe if you paid them a lot of money...."
2021-05-03 11:46,"“But daily vaccination rates are slipping, and there is widespread consensus among scientists and public health experts that the herd immunity threshold is not attainable — at least not in the foreseeable future, and perhaps not ever.“

I think we’ll get to herd immunity, but it will probably be a mix of the old fashioned way, along with those who chose to be vaccinated. Of course, the herd will be culled a bit with that “old fashioned” part, but the global population was admittedly in need of a trim. These things do happen."
2021-05-03 11:46,"An earlier version of myself would care about all the suffering and death that will happen because of all the vaccine ignorance.  

The last year has hardened me, I’m afraid, and all that matters to me now is that my family is safe, for now."
2021-05-03 11:47,"I was surprised that there was not that much talk about mutations a year ago. You don't have to be a scientist or a doctor to know that viruses mutate quickly. So what's being painted here is kind of what I expected. With the virus running wild in India and South America, it seems inevitable that new and possibly more deadly variants will appear, and that new vaccines will have to be developed. Hopefully we can manage whatever comes along at least as well as we manage influenza."
2021-05-03 11:47,"Sad news to wake up to, but not at all surprising, alas.

My small new England town is in some ways a microcosm of Covid America:

Some of us, cognizant of medical science and respectful of one another's well-being, have been wearing masks and practicing social distancing for over a year now.  And most of us have now gotten two doses of a coronavirus vaccine.  

Some of us, dismissive of ""experts"" and Gadsden-proud of their right to do whatever they want to, regardless of the health and well-being of others, think everything's just fine.  Their idea of a vaccine -- and I've heard this said many times, and posted repeatedly on our local electronic ""board"" -- is Vitamin D (from sunlight!) and a good ""American"" breakfast.

You can't reach herd immunity anywhere when the herd is so starkly divided.  Into smart sheep and not-so-smart sheep, if you will.  And I don't care who the shepherd is.  Some of the flock wouldn't listen even if God himself were head of the C.D.C."
2021-05-03 11:48,"“If the herd immunity threshold is not attainable, what matters most is the rate of hospitalizations and deaths after pandemic restrictions are relaxed.” Yes. This is exactly what we were told we were striving for since day one. I hope that the media is able to finally begin to amplify this message. PCR positive tests that result in mild infections should not result in sensationalized headlines telling us that the virus is surging. COVID-zero was always an unattainable goal, and the sooner we understand how to manage an endemic virus in our society, the better off we will all be."
2021-05-03 11:50,"The news media on TV across the party lines need to emphasize that if not enough people are vaccinated, the US can suffer what India is suffering -- where the virus is spreading like a wildfire. People are still dying in the US. More people have to get vaccinated to cut the potential of serious infection to their own lives and stop the spread to others. We have to be sensible and the media needs to be responsible and do its part."
2021-05-03 11:50,"Is it just my imagination or does the map of people hesitant to get the vaccine look a lot like the map of Republicans - considerably more hesitant and and science denying, and Democrats - embracing science and staying safe and healthy."
2021-05-03 11:51,"I realize this is being cynical but watching the decline in vaccination rates, the acceptance of not getting to ""herd immunity, and accepting as the reality that we cannot work together to suppress this virus is an example of our misguided sense of what ""freedom"" and ""liberty"" actually mean.  Setting ourselves up for future infections and deaths is inexcusable but clearly what is likely to happen.  More variants, more outbreaks, more vaccines, etc.  We had a chance to deal with this effect but the entire World has failed and appears to be determined to accept a chronic disease pattern as the final outcome. Maybe our concerns about climate change will become moot as we blindly head down the rabbit hole."
2021-05-03 11:53,"One of the foundations of vaccine hesitancy is that the vaccine has not been fully tested and is still under emergency use authorization.  At what point will the FDA give this final approval?   Would studies showing that almost all the current infections are among the unvaccinated, help persuade?"
2021-05-03 11:53,"For the commenters here who write that any sensible person would’ve known all along that we would never reach herd immunity, I would ask: what about measles?  Very highly contagious, yet nearly fully eradicated.  I never worry about catching measles in my everyday life.  The difference is simply in vaccination rates.  

The main reason a wealthy country like ours won’t reach her immunity is that too many of our citizens will refuse to do the intelligent and patriotic thing, helping themselves and their community, by getting the vaccine."
2021-05-03 11:54,"Saying that not getting vaccinated is a ""just a personal choice"" is like saying that driving 120 mph on the highway is a ""just a personal choice."" No, it's not. But more to the point, we need to stop indulging the anti-vaccine crowd. If you work in the health field, law enforcement, or any other job where you are in contact with the public and you refuse to get vaccinated, you should be fired, period."
2021-05-03 11:54,"Looking at that map, it seems like someone in Minnesota has created an effective marketing campaign to explain why the vaccines are important. And people are both understanding and believing it. It would be one thing to have urban counties being pro-vaccine, but basically the entire state with many rural and conservative areas is impressive. Those in similar positions in other states - please study up on whatever the Land o' Lakes is doing!"
2021-05-03 11:54,"The semantics of herd immunity here amounts to academic claptrap. Herd immunity is mathematically defined in simplified models as the point of cumulative incidence & immunity beyond which the expected number of secondary infections is less than 1 and the prevalence is expected to decline. All models are wrong, some are useful.

The usefulness of herd immunity is typically as a target vaccination rate. For ongoing epidemics with evolving pathogens and a continuous influx of new susceptibles through migration & birth, this coronavirus will reach a seasonally-driven, oscillating abundance like influenza. No one anywhere said herd immunity means zero COVID - for endemic pathogens in an ongoing pandemic, herd immunity, for the purpose of analysis of dynamical epidemiological systems, is the point at which prevalence declines, i.e. the peak of the epidemic.

This silly debate over semantics is now being used to motivate policies of hyper vigilance - testing all travelers - when natural mechanisms already ensure that COVID epidemics of the future are bounded in their speed and burden because of the scope of natural immunity. The more appropriate way to discuss COVID for debate is by discussion of expected epidemic size & speed, the risk of overwhelming hospitals (which is near zero now for the US), and competing health & well-being risks from hypervigilant policies and infringement of human rights."
2021-05-03 11:54,"The vaccines work so well that I'm done worrying about the ignorant and/or disinformed ""herd."" The people I love are vaccinated and have no other conditions making them high risk. I am about two weeks out from being fully vaccinated. Let me know when/if I need a booster.

There is large overlap between people not interested in getting the shot and those who don't think the pandemic is a big deal to begin with. They couldn't wear a mask for a ten minute trip in Home Depot. They couldn't skip getting together for Christmas to help minimize spread in their community. The only thing that's going to get them to do anything is have it affect them personally: No flying without a shot, no concerts, no sporting events. Whether Corporate America can step up and bring on these requirements remains to be seen, but hopefully it will come for the good of the country."
2021-05-03 11:55,"I can foresee a scenario where certain pockets of the country achieve herd immunity or close to it, then face the dilemma of whether to keep out the unvaccinated or to continue to require tests for entry in order maintain very low virus numbers. At writing, four New England states, for example, are doing quite well at getting their citizens vaccinated. Why would they want to risk losing a return to normalcy and a re-opening of their economies to accommodate those who refuse to get vaccinated? The irony is, they will be restoring the ""freedoms"" the anti-maskers and vaccine deniers claim to want back."
2021-05-03 11:57,"No science background here, but this seems to focus on just the herd immunity via vaccinations. What impact does all the people who have had been previously infected have on herd immunity? Obviously there’s still some risk of reinfection, but this more makes it sound like infections will just ricochet around unvaccinated communities forever. Is there at least some (lesser) benefit to “natural” herd immunity, or whatever it should be called?"
2021-05-03 11:57,"A person well known in our community, I suspect in her mid-to-late forties, who has been eligible to get the vaccine because of her essential worker position, was just released from the hospital after being in the ICU with COVID. She has posted about this publicly. She indicated they were trying to keep her off a vent, and that when she finally was able to go home, she did so on oxygen and with a walker. I hope she has a full recovery. I wonder though, did she have a breakthrough case? Did she not take advantage of the free and safe vaccine? I wish she would have reported about those things too. If she hadn’t had the vaccine, it may have been enough that her still unvaccinated friends may have been motivated to get the vaccine. If she was a breakthrough case, I suspect the opposite would be true. My understanding is that breakthrough cases are rare, and rarely result in hospitalization."
2021-05-03 11:58,"Why isn't the federal government distributing the vaccine (particularly J&J) to trusted primary care physicians who have better access to patients and/or who may be able to persuade the hesitant, then administer it quickly and on-site?  What is the hold up for FDA approval of the Pfizer vaccine for 12-15 year olds?  They've been sitting on the data for weeks now.   Where are the ""carrots"" to vaccination that may persuade hesitant people other than self-interest or pure community altruism (which should be good enough, but we know it's not)?   There are so many things the federal government can do to increase vaccination numbers that we are simply NOT doing.  Close the mass sites, approve the vaccine for kids, and make vaccination mandatory for air travel, concerts, Broadway shows, college, etc.  Yes, it will take effort, but just do it."
2021-05-03 11:59,"At this point, if you choose not to get vaccinated - so be it. But I’m getting back to my life and I don’t want my insurance premiums to increase to pay for care for those who choose not to get vaccinated.  

And we just focus on hospitalizations and deaths at this point.  Focusing on positive tests is a disservice."
2021-05-03 11:59,There need to be penalties for those who refuse to get vaccinated.  This is a matter of national security.
2021-05-03 12:00,"My two sisters and I received the vaccine as soon as we could.  Our 74-year-old brother, a born again Christian with very odd ideas about medicine and health, sent emails to family and friends telling us the vaccine was dangerous and had been created by the Pope, George Soros and others.  I had to threaten to block his emails to stop them.  My sadness is for his wife who goes along with his beliefs."
2021-05-03 12:01,"I don't understand how not achieving herd immunity would be a reason for an individual -not- to get vaccinated.

It seems to me that ""the virus will keep circulating, especially in areas with a lot of vaccine-hesitant people"" is an even better reason to get vaccinated, especially for people in vaccine-hesitant districts.  If my neighbors aren't getting vaccinated, I need to, because the disease will stick around in my district and I need the protection."
2021-05-03 12:01,"I suspect that the anti-vaccine crowd has believed that the rest of us would shoulder the ""burden"" in bringing the virus down to a manageable level. They're okay with playing Russian roulette because the rest of us would do the responsible thing. The problem is, there are enough science deniers out there that it's now making even this aim difficult."
2021-05-03 12:01,"I wonder if the young and healthy, who see no need to get the vaccine, know anything about the 1918-1919 flu epidemic. In the second wave, because of a mutation, it was the young and healthy who died. Their strong immune systems turned against them, and they literally drowned in the fluids in their lungs. When a significant number of people refuse to be vaccinated, for whatever reason, we can expect more mutations. The virus has one goal—to infect as many people as possible. It doesn’t care how young you are."
2021-05-03 12:01,"Health insurance companies should require it, otherwise people should pay a higher premium given the risks involved. That would take care of a non-trivial part of the problem. Other incentives work too - give people some small gift or amount of cash for being vaccinated - it's a lot cheaper than the burden placed on the health care system and economy if large numbers don't get vaccinated."
2021-05-03 12:01,"The main problem is not vaccine resistance in rural American but rather vaccine reluctance in crowded households. A small family who lives at the end of a long gravel road in Oklahoma are much less likely to catch and spread the virus than the average person in Providence, RI who lives with his extended family in a small apartment. Vaccination efforts need to target the latter."
2021-05-03 12:01,"""Unnerving"" as an adjective to describe the gist of this article is too tame.  At 81, fully vaccinated, I must accept that once I leave what's been a year and a half of lockdown I'll be ""high-risk"" for the rest of my life.  Close friends and a paid helper, all younger, all fully vaccinated, are now joyously enjoying a modest return to living, out there where the variants are circulating and coming back to me.  Of course I'll continue masking, etc., but short of a major move to New Zealand, not much I can do."
2021-05-03 12:02,"We have been using a ‘carrot’ approach in order together people vaccinated.  It is time to take out the ‘stick’.
First, if one is traveling internationally then, unless you have proof of recent vaccination, you must quarantine at you arrival point at your own expense for 1 week.
Second, your child cannot go to public school or participate in events with public school attendees unless recently vaccinated.
Finally, health insurers including Medicare and Medicaid, need to adopt a risk stratification approach to insurance premiums.  If you are not vaccinated then you are a greater financial liability to the insurer and you should pay higher premiums.  
We need to let people know that their decisions have consequences and that they are responsible for those consequences."
2021-05-03 12:02,"It seems to me that, currently, those doing the right thing and getting vaccinated are subsidizing those choosing not to take the shot. Why not require proof of vaccination or a recent negative test for all indoor activities (social gatherings, concerts, dining,etc) and make unvaccinated people pay for their tests. Also, if you chose to go unvaccinated, you should be required to pay for your healthcare if you get sick. At a certain point, the vast majority of those getting ill will be people who refused to take an inexpensive vaccine, and their expensive medical treatment will be paid for and subsidized by those who did the right thing and are themselves unlikely to ever need treatment for the virus (because they got vaccinated). This will properly incentive people to get vaccinated. You still won't be required to take the vaccine, but you (not others) will pay for your costly decision.

Lastly, we need to start immediately sending unused doses out of the country to medical workers and vulnerable people in neighboring countries. Every shot can literally save a life, so its completely immoral and insane to have millions of shots sitting in freezers in this country going bad and getting wasted. Maybe, if people see shots leaving the country, they will feel more urgency to take one."
2021-05-03 12:02,"By July, every American over 16 who wants to get vaccinated will be vaccinated and the vaccine will remain readily available to those who have chosen not to get it, if they change their minds 

If the virus continues to spread among the unvaccinated, that will be the result of their own choices."
2021-05-03 12:02,"This is why we need policy, local and federal, to reward those that are vaccinated.

Most “vaccine hesitant” people aren’t anti-vaxxers. They’re a combination of misinformed, unreasonably scared and flat selfish. Most would likely change behavior based on proper incentives. 

Open up restaurants, bars and social activities to full capacity with proof of vaccination. Don’t have a vaccine? No problem you can get takeout and watch the game on tv. But you can’t dine in or sit in the ballpark.

Rewarding good behavior with every day and easy to appreciate returns on vaccination.

Let’s see how many “vaccine hesitant” people will remain after that?"
2021-05-03 12:03,"Covid will likely become a regularly occurring contagion like influenza.

And the smart people who now get the annual ""flu shot"" for protection against that ever-evolving disease will dutifully add a ""Covid shot"" as well as each ""variant"" emerges.

I'm one of those ""smart"" people.

As to the others - I refer you to the immortal words of Rhett Butler."
2021-05-03 12:04,"A big question is who is that trusted person who could make a difference.  Here in New York City, I only know one person who is a fervent Republican and Trump supporter.  She is refusing to get vaccinated, and before this she refused to get a flu shot.  There is no way anyone she knows will change her mind.
This is a sample of one, but just imagine living in a state, a city, or a small town where everyone you know is dubious or hostile about getting vaccinated.  Sadly, I have to believe ""herd immunity"" is never going to be achieved.  My best hope is that like the flu shot, we will need a booster every year to combat new variants"
2021-05-03 12:04,"While one can debate whether herd immunity will come soon, the greatest chance for getting there is the success of the current vaccines.

If we see continue drop in death rates that can be directly attributed to the vaccine you are gonna see the doubters line up for the shot.

Nothing works like success.

Also, freedom must be coupled with responsibility. While we should not force people to get the shot, we should mandate that in close quarters  like planes, trains, stadiums etc., entry will only be allowed with a Covid shot proof."
2021-05-03 12:06,"It would be easy to stress out at abandoning herd immunity as a national goal and despair over the political divide that is driving much of the vaccine hesitancy. But that is only one angle of this pandemic, and the article sums it up well. We are learning much, each in our own way, about moving forward with courage when facing a daunting challenge. We may never be fully united as a nation because we are diverse in so many ways. Will we learn to respect each other's differences so those who are vaccine hesitant won't feel pressured but can choose without feeling coerced? Perhaps nature, itself, is the teacher here. If you don't get vaccinated, you'll probably be okay, or not. Does your experience of yourself, friends or family getting infected tell you that this is no more than a bad  flu, or was someone you know killed by the virus? When widespread experiences more closely matches the scientific consensus, people may stop resisting that viewpoint. Globalization is now a reality, whether we're talking about human-created climate change, famines, wars, the assault on democracies. None of these problems will go away. Our challenge is to deal with them well enough that we can live with hope and see that none of us is alone on planet Earth."
2021-05-03 12:06,"A study published in March 2021 found that of 532 people who reported a prior COVID-19 illness, only 366 were confirmed by an antigen test and/or PCR. Extrapolating that observation to the larger population, we can estimate that the true number of Covid-19 cases is roughly 45% higher than the official tallies, which only report test-confirmed instances. That also means that the Covid-19 death rate is at least 45% lower than the official estimates, though the true rate is even lower than that, since many of the people categorized as having died OF Covid-19 merely died WITH or AFTER recovery from Covid-19.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) said that the vast majority of people develop a lasting immune response to COVID-19, protecting them against the disease and reducing disease severity. As of May 2, the U.S. has had 32,393,310 confirmed cases of Covid-19, which equates to approximately 47,085,358 total cases, including those that haven't been confirmed. On that same day, over 100 million Americans, or approximately 55% of the adult population, had received at least one dose of vaccine against Covid-19. Between infections and vaccinations, the majority of Americans are now immune to Covid-19. A large portion of the remaining Americans are children, for whom Covid-19 poses very little risk.

This article places more importance on the vaccination rate than it deserves. The virus will eventually infect the the non-vaccinated, and herd immunity will be achieved. Relax."
2021-05-03 12:07,"Okay no problem. When are  we going to stop with the masks,  social  distancing and all the  other restrictions?  Or am I going to be punished for the the rest of my life because Maga wants to follow different rules."
2021-05-03 12:07,"This article seems to be falsely equating herd immunity with vaccination. Vaccination is not the only way to achieve herd immunity. The other way, the hard way, is to actually get infected and either survive or be removed from the community. It seems that these people have opted for the hard way. It's not a choice that I would make, but I would think of reopening without vaccination as akin to a controlled burn: the virus takes it's course in their communities and reduces the fuel for the next outbreak. It can be expensive and dangerous to deal with such things, though, so I would only suggest that people should be given a choice of either getting vaccinated or relinquishing any claims to medical care or other assistance when they become infected. We could perhaps just like them into a single state--ideally one with a border wall on all sides--and wait for nature to take it's course."
2021-05-03 12:08,"As the vaccine becomes available to all ages make it a requirement to attend school and as a logical extension businesses should make it a requirement to work( avoid infecting customers)

)."
2021-05-03 12:08,"What a tragedy!

It is painful to read that the nation’s epidemiologists and infectious disease experts, including Dr.  Fauci,  are already conceding that herd immunity may not be attainable in the U.S.  This concession is likely to become a self fulfilling prophecy, adding as the article mentions, another reason to the ‘Why Bother’ list.

The concept of herd immunity is the “jewel in the crown” of epidemic models, an important achievement in the theory.  I can only conclude that our National infectious disease leadership has access to data that indicates vaccination efforts are stalling and unused vaccine is aging on the shelves.  Otherwise, why would they be conceding now when just months ago,  they were talking about the end being in sight?

Fortunately,  the experts quoted in this article have other, more achievable targets to focus on and there is still hope.  But in the long term,  research will need to continue on how to communicate the safety and efficacy of vaccines to vaccine hesitant populations that would respond to well designed, informative, and respectful information programs.   
Economics and human belief and behavior must be integrated into the study of epidemics as well.

In an era of climate change and a world without walls, new infectious diseases are inevitable, and in the future may be more visibly virulent than COVID 19, striking down working age populations before our eyes.

Then conceding herd immunity will not be a choice."
2021-05-03 12:09,"The fight against the virus has been correctly defined as a war. When every infected person, symptomatic or not, is actually a weapons factory for deadly new virus variants, how is it allowed that the non vaccinated are exempt from the fight?"
2021-05-03 12:09,"It is unacceptable that we not beat this virus as soon as possible. 

Employers should require their employees to get vaccinations, with a religious or medical exemption. I am an employer who has instituted that policy and 136 out of 145 who have gotten vaccines. If those numbers were replicated across the across the country, this thing would be over by now.  

Every employer, starting with the federal, state and local governments, should tell their employees to get the vaccine or look for another job. 

We need a better carrot or a bigger stick —and probably just a bigger stick￼￼ is more effective."
2021-05-03 12:10,"If people think that vaccine hesitancy is high now with adults, just wait until the vaccine is available or kids. It seems we have grossly overestimated the extent to which America wants the vaccine, and I believe that will become much clearer when it’s the turn of a group for whom the threat of the virus is serious."
2021-05-03 12:11,"I suspect that a significant percentage of the antivaxxers will ""see the light"" when they realize that they will no longer be able to travel internationally, go on cruises, and who knows what else without the vaccine.  As for the hardliners....in Europe we certainly won't miss them (we have enough of our own!)."
2021-05-03 12:12,"I suspect the CDC and other health care agencies always knew that COVID, like the flu and the common cold, would never be eliminated. These agencies have kept quiet on the subject because it is not motivational or empathetic to make such proclamations during a pandemic.
I think the question now is: what will be the annual U.S. mortality rate? I believe 40,000–50,000 U.S. citizens die annually from the flu."
2021-05-03 12:13,We seem to have nearly 100 percent of our population vaccinated against a lot of things.  Because the government requires it.  It does not seem so difficult to do the same thing for this vaccine.  We are making this harder than it has to be.
2021-05-03 12:13,"What is the rate of infection of people who decline the vaccine? We have a decent idea of the number of covid cases, and we know how many were vaccinated. This is the herd. It would be useful to discuss the fate of the unvaccinated, if not for their sake, then for the rest of us. Surely someone has modeled when this group will experience covid without a vaccine. You quote many experts but I don't see this question asked or answered. Same for the rest of the news articles on herd immunity."
2021-05-03 12:13,"Even if the USA could reach a high level of immunity, this will not be achieved in the rest of the world. We need to focus on a vaccine for the elderly and susceptible. 
Lack of early treatment has been the most overlooked step for the USA. Our statistics are near the worst for the world. 
Early home treatments are available that work and are inexpensive, but are suppressed by our media and health authorities.
We will learn to live with-- and treat this virus early."
2021-05-03 12:14,It's too early to give up on getting everyone vaccinated.  And there are two paths to herd immunity - vaccination and getting sick.  People need to choose; we need to help them choose wisely.
2021-05-03 12:14,"""A better approach would be for a trusted figure to address the root cause of the hesitancy...""  What world is this public health official living in?  I wish the story had addressed the question whether the future death and serious illnesses will likely be focused on members of the anti-vax community, and if so how that may lead to ever-increasing differences in state-by-state toll of deaths and serious illnesses."

2021-05-03 12:15,People need to realize that there is a subtle but significant difference between objecting to the government requiring or even just encouraging masks and vaccination and the issue of whether or not vaccinations and masks are actually a good idea or not.
2021-05-03 12:15,"We are quickly approaching the point in the United States where if you aren't vaccinated yet, you are actively choosing not to be. If you choose not to get vaccinated, you are choosing to take on this risk and it is not my responsibility to re-arrange *my* life to mitigate *your* risk."
2021-05-03 12:15,"This is a war.  The vaccine is merely one battle. We have to hang in there and keep trying to improve acceptance of the vaccine as well as safety for the public.  

We can get there, but it is going to take some time."
2021-05-03 12:16,"People who refuse to vaccinate will not be allowed in my home or near my family in whatever capacity we can control. If they refuse to do their part - and their stubbornness can be traced directly back to their right wing politics, for the most part - they will be ostracized. We, too, will exercise our freedom of choice."
2021-05-03 12:16,"There are going to have to be many more vaccines, especially single-dose vaccines, and there are also going to have to be vaccines for children, and maybe even toddlers.  And then as more of the population gets vaccinated, there are also going to have to be vaccine passports acting as enticements for those still hesitant.  I believe the United States is going to reach herd immunity, but it will take single-dose vaccines for everyone above age 2 to pull this off."
2021-05-03 12:17,I and every member of my family and social circle are vaccinated.  I’m going to get back to my life and begin to do things like return to restaurants that have suffered so much economically.  I refuse to let those who refuse to follow medical pleas to get vaccinated keep me Inside for ANOTHER year.  While they continue to “live their lives”.
2021-05-03 12:18,"Well this was was an upsetting to way to wake up this am. Is there a reason the government can't force people to get the vaccine (provided they have no underlying health risks), like they do with measles/mumps for students entering elementary school?"
2021-05-03 12:18,The anti vaxxers are succeeding in ensuring the pandemic will not end and even those of us who are vaccinated will continue to be at risk from new variants.  They don't care about their communities or their neighbors.
2021-05-03 12:19,My choice is not to get vaccinated against a disease that poses no threat to me statistically. Those that want to protect themselves for whatever reason are free to do so. But I grow more certain that I’ve made the right choice every time a vaccinated person tells me that getting vaccinated has not changed their behavior or lowered their fear and anxiety.
2021-05-03 12:20,"We need new signs:
- No Shirt
- No Shoes
- No Vaccine
- No Service

and

Renewal of auto registrations and driver's licenses should be tied to proof of vaccination, to limit the mobility of virus factories. At the same time, free vaccine available at the DMV. You’re already required to prove you can see well enough to drive - this is just proving you can think well enough to drive."
2021-05-03 12:20,"One of the reasons cited for vaccine hesitancy is the vaccine’s short track record.  Over longer timeframes, if no significant long-term side effects arise, that reason should go away or at least diminish, which should help boost vaccination rates."
2021-05-03 12:20,"One of the hardest lessons in life is that you just can't help some people.  This is one of those lessons.

Due to the outsize effect of political influence, the most powerful and effective disease preventers of all time, vaccines, have been turned into a political football.  This has become a game that can't be won.

So be it.  Life is full of risks.  Bad things happen to people all the time.  We try to mitigate them, but they still happen to a degree.

We have about 30% the population that will not get vaccinated.  They will form a breeding ground for future variants.  The virus will continue to circulate and infect them.

Personally, I have done everything I could to protect myself.  Now, I'm fully vaccinated.  As soon as the local mask mandate is lifted, I will stop wearing one.  I'm done.

I'm done trying to protect people that refuse to protect themselves.  If the virus passes from me to a vaccine refuser, that's on them.

I'm done with ultra conservative protocols that put children at the end of the line with vaccine testing.  Vaccine trials for kids should have been run in parallel.  We should be getting shots into their arms now.  This is an unusual circumstance that requires different tactics.  There is such a thing as too much caution.  This blood clot scare is good example.  

So let's open up the country by June 1.  We have the capability to administer over another 100 million shots by then.  That's all we can do."
2021-05-03 12:21,"I guess we always had to hold nuanced realities in mind. The push to encourage vaccination (rightly so) was based on the premise that if more are vaccinated we are all safer. It was a public health issue and in part, a moral, ethical message right?. But the reality was always that mutations could be a gamechanger and that realistically, poor leadership meant no tracking, a late start in getting a handle on it, and as time has shown, a reluctance of large swaths of people to believe in the science. The early Atlantic article called it from the beginning. It is here to stay, some of us will be safer than others, but none will be as safe as before it arrived. It's sobering."
2021-05-03 12:21,"Vaccinating the most vulnerable is not always an option, though. For example, people who require regular B-cell depleting therapies, such as rituximab, cannot be effectively vaccinated if it has been less than 6 months since their last infusion; recent studies imply it is more like 9 months post-infusion to achieve adequate immunity from the vaccination. Such people often appear completely healthy because their conditions are well-managed on these treatments, and you would never know they're vulnerable."
2021-05-03 12:22,"The resistance to vaccinations is political and, once again, Republicans and their hard-right followers, have won the day. 

Responsibility and generosity to others by mask-wearing? No; the Republican Party has told its adherents that none of it is necessary. So these folks go on their merry way, ignoring the pleas of others to bond in a theory of citizenship that is quite beyond their narrow view of “freedom.”

We’re now going to have to accept the fact that this virus—and its uncounted, unknown variants—will become a permanent fixture in our debate about public health. Too many Americans seem to be of the (ideologically-inspired) opinion that the virus is benign and to become concerned about protecting the larger public by masking and getting the vaccine would be to yield a sharply divisive weapon in their enjoyable culture war with Democrats and “the left.”

They cannot and will not see beyond their resentment."
2021-05-03 12:24,"i can't help thinking about how prior to entering WW II, almost  every adult American did their part without question. Men to the battle field, women to the factories. Our response to the pandemic should have been similar, but sadly it wasn't."
2021-05-03 12:25,"This issue of vaccination reminds me of the following story, which I heard years ago:  150 years ago, when Otto von Bismarck was Minister President of Prussia, Bismarck's goal was to unite Germany under the rule of the Prussian King.  However, he had a problem.  The King of Prussia would only accept the imperial crown if it was voluntarily offered to him by all of the German princes and, understandably, the German princes did not want to give up their sovereignty.  Bismarck was asked how he was going to get the German princes to make that offer, which seemed to be against their own interests and, in answer, he spat out three words: ""I'll pay them"".

Bismarck's three little words are the key to attaining herd immunity.  Almost all of the anti-vaxxers will change their minds if they are paid enough.  Then herd immunity can be reached."
2021-05-03 12:25,"Given the fact that we keep on moving the goal posts on what our aim is... at what point then are we allowed to go back to normal? The idea that this will be more like a common cold has been floated around already and doesn't bother me, so much as how people will interpret there being ""no end in sight"" to the virus. Inevitably some people will take this to mean we should be wearing masks in public in perpetuity and will be paranoid to go to concerts and the like"
2021-05-03 11:41,"The same people who said the virus was a hoax, a cold, didn't wear masks or practice any other measures, went to super spreader events all exponentially making cases higher and killing their own family and friends now are afraid if a shot that millions of people have gotten showing the safety? Put a tax on whites being unvaccinated. Lower taxes is about the only thing they think about. People of color have long standing fears of white medicine and for good cause. This is a situation ripe for influencers if color to help with."
2021-05-03 11:44,Looks like another triumph for the Right.
2021-05-03 11:53,"When it comes to vaccinations, it seems we have a nation divided between patriots and cowards. Patriots do their duty to the rest of the population by getting vaccinated. They support their fellow citizens and the nation. They seek to have the economy reopen and prosper. They are willing to accept a minuscule risk for the good of all.

Then there are the cowards. Perhaps they are just afraid of needles?"
2021-05-03 12:14,"Wow.  Thanks for this report.

Here's to getting vaccinated, everybody."
2021-05-03 11:58,"The idea that a single country can read herd immunity was always farfetched, unless the plan is to ban international travel completely, and to build a wall.  How is it that the NYT is only now coming to this conclusion that was widely discussed a year ago?"
2021-05-03 12:00,"This is nonsense. Herd immunity is achieved through a combination of vaccination and past infection. 
This who refuse the vaccine will get infected and those who survive will  contribute to herd immunity anyway. It has in fact been their argument all along."
2021-05-03 12:02,"Thanks to half the country being selfish and refusing lockdowns and masks, the pandemic was prolonged and hundreds of thousands more people died than would have occurred otherwise.  Same to these same selfish people we now won't reach herd immunity.

Funny enough, these are the same people who are holding back the country in terms of everything from gun control to healthcare expansion to the true separation of church and state.

I, for one, am sick of it."
2021-05-03 12:08,"Wait- what?! This is the most despair inducing story I’ve read in a year- and there has been plenty of bad news during that time.

While the information is rational and logical, and is described in such a way that it makes the goal of herd immunity seem like folly from the start, there was always a little teeny tiny optimist in me that believed it could happen. That next year, or even sooner I might feel safe and comfortable getting on a plane and traveling to some location where I wasn’t afraid to be on a hotel elevator with 20 massless people, but this story dashes that hope.

Three things about this story are most alarming-
1) it’s coming from the NYT and not the Administration and CDC. If this is real and accurate (and I don’t doubt it is), then I’d really like to hear the long term plan, cause we’re re sure gonna need one.

2) “over the long term- the next generation or two” we might get this virus down to something like the seasonal flu. Uh....and until then? The current generations are Going to be living from vaccine to booster to masks and rolling lockdowns?

3) “protecting those over 60 is most important for not overwhelming the health care system”. As someone who will reach that threshold in the not too distant future I’d say we better get our act together in short order on improving the health system infrastructure."

2021-05-03 11:44,Thank you evil forces who are using your platforms to spread anti vax propaganda to increase ratings and monetize this crisis.  The USA really has gone off the deep end in allowing these forces to dictate to the undereducated conspiracy theory driven masses.  So glad I moved overseas where more sanity prevails.
2021-05-03 12:04,"Sadly we have become so selfish as a society that we only think about ourselves.
One might think that it’s only the uneducated unwilling to get this vaccine but we now know that’s not true.
I’d love to see more public service messages with athletes and Republicans and Democrats and Rockstars getting the vaccine.
We need to unite as a country to be back this virus, and that means getting vaccinated!￼￼￼￼￼"
2021-05-03 12:18,"How did the world eliminate Small Pox? Why is Polio less of a scourge today? 

Yet we see a resurgence of Measles. And now we have this virus that some people still don't seem to take that seriously.

I cannot give an answer, but those who do not help fight these diseases through the simple act of getting vaccinated create a danger to all of us.  Maybe, people were not so arrogant and self centered, when the battle was engaged against Small Pox."
2021-05-03 11:35,"It’s time to start paying for the vaccine hesitant people to be vaccinated.  That might help reach another 15% of the population, getting us closer to the goal."
2021-05-03 11:36,"America is going to fail if it doesn’t arrest the high level of ignorance and lack of education in the population. 

There is not much that can be done.  Everyone has the information now. If people choose to put gems elves and their families at risk, they can suffer the consequences. We will need to continually invest in vaccine development to deal with it. 

The Biden administration should reallocate the vaccines destined for the 30 percent denier and send them overseas. 

Health insurance companies should be allowed to raise the premiums on those who don’t get the vaccine and treat it as a behavioral issue akin to smoking."
2021-05-03 11:50,"Sadly and tragically, most “conservatives” (is that word really accurate anymore?) that read this piece will reject it as more MSM thought-control, rather than take a critical look at their behavior. And with Fox’s talking heads constantly reenforcing the notion that the vaccines are bad (even as they themselves are vaccinated), these conspiratorial notions are likely to make us weak and vulnerable. America’s number one enemy is it’s own citizens, corrupting freedom to mean selfishness."
2021-05-03 11:59,"I just think the use of the word “easily” in this quote below ought to be replaced with, “can spread spread into protected areas, albeit more slowly.”

“Given the degree of movement among regions, a small virus wave in a region with a low vaccination level can easily spill over into an area where a majority of the population is protected.”"
2021-05-03 12:08,"I’m vaccinated, and so is every non-child I know personally.  Given the remarkable effectiveness of vaccines, I no longer care about herd immunity.  I’ll be fine. So will those I care about.  If the hospitals won’t be overrun, then the unvaccinated people who get serious cases or die are not causing me any trouble.  Soon they’ll all have had a chance to be 2 weeks past their final dose, and after that their own suffering is on them.  Just like morbidly obese people wandering around like heart attacks waiting to happen, the unvaccinated have nobody but themselves to blame."
2021-05-03 12:11,"On March 25th, India was placed under a national lockdown. Despite the lockdown, India continues to suffer record numbers of infections and deaths. Pres. Biden waited until May 4th to impose an end to international flights to the US from India. The ban does not extend to travelers who started travel in India and entered through a third country. The result is introduction of the Indian variant into the US. 

Unless we want to suffer another spike in Covid 19 infections, people in the US must get vaccinated now. 

The silly and lethal Covid 19 politics must stop."
2021-05-03 11:49,"Why will herd immunity be unachievable in the US? 

Because we have competing subcultures of people either too fearful of the science (but not, apparently of the threat of COVID to themselves and their friends and family) or too in thrall to our grifter and ex-president Trump (who has received the vaccines though not trying to let it be well known to his minion army).  

Most everyone will pay for this (health wise and money wise) but those two subcultures will pay a lot more.  The statistics will be dramatic."
2021-05-03 11:52,"The article contains a key idea - focusing on continuing vaccinations as opposed to herd immunity - that is not effectively reflected in the title. Please reconsider the title of this piece because on its own it gives ammunition to the ‘so-what’ contingent that is resistant to receiving the vaccine. When pressed for time, some folks may only use the title as the news... thus contributing to the problem."
2021-05-03 12:04,"I was a toddler when polio ravaged the world in the 1950's and the pain, suffering, paralysis, deaths, and disfigurement of the patients seemed far worse than COVID....some people going into iron lungs that looked like a casket with only the patient's head in view.

It was circa 1955 that Dr. Salk introduced his vaccine and parents around the world raced their kids to the doctor saying ""Give him/her the injection"". And so it was with mine. We rolled up our sleeves gladly.

I just read that with the exception of an obscure village in Pakistan where some people didn't get vaccinated, polio has been eradicated from the face of the earth.

Herd immunity is an achievable goal. Get your vaccination and do it now."
2021-05-03 12:07,The premise that a national goal is attainable for a virus that affects humans is taking us in the wrong direction. Herd immunity only works for the entire herd.
2021-05-03 12:11,"Well, I guess the “freedoms” of the unwilling to get vaccinated trumps the health of the country.  Why this acquiescence to the anti vaxxer?   

I guess, as with gun violence, we all need to live in some amount of fear because of other folks exercising their “freedoms”.

Then there’s this— an almost throwaway line. “In the long term, the public health system will also need to account for babies, and for children and adults who age into a group with higher risk.”

I mean, that’s the nutshell right? This great nation of the United States will once again leave the most vulnerable behind.  I mean it is not as if our “public health system” serves the vulnerable very much if  at all.... the asthma, the lead poisoning, the obesity....  

The United States has been given a very good chance during this pandemic to really look at public health systems. Yet, not even seeing hundreds of thousands die has not moved the needle much."
2021-05-03 12:15,"Vaccine opponents argued that eschewing the vaccine would lead to herd immunity. Instead, that stance has had the opposite effect, providing ideal conditions for variants to thrive and ensuring we never reach herd immunity. Consequently Covid will be with us forever. Nice job vaccine opponents. See what happens when you disregard science?"
2021-05-03 12:17,There is such a thing as “unhealthy skepticism.”  The person who routinely rejects ideas without educating themselves and thinking critically about their own biases is no smarter or independent minded than the person who believes everything their told.

I can't imagine I needed a special permission slip from my parents. We eradicated the horrible  polio virus with this national effort. The last four years revealed a lot of division in this country fed and perpetuated by the former president. That message of skepticim from the early days of the virus will continue to haunt us.
2021-05-03 11:54,"The people who long to return to the supposedly halcyon days of the 1950s where everyone watched out for their neighbors, focused on their families, and all got their polio shots are generally the same people who refuse the vaccine now. MAGA means me and mine."

But if you keep moving the goalposts on herd immunity (from 60% - 70% which we are near to attaining with vaccines and, as they rarely mention, the millions with anti-bodies from the virus - which have been proven to last for many many months), you take away people's hope.  So if they are a skeptic, then they ask themselves... ""why should I take the risk if it's pointless and we're never getting out of this anyway?""  Also... let's not forget that the coverage of the J&J vaccine was really irresponsible and scared millions from getting vaccinated.   Headlines such as this one are part of our problem.  We need science and common sense, not fear mongering."

We saw the death rates from COVID climb and climb, funerals put off til who knows when.

Instead of whining that the left wasn't giving him enough credit he should have been out there TAKING credit.  He could have made it MAGA woke to take the vaccine, instead its MAGA woke to refuse it.  

We did not need this expensive public health disaster.  But Trump was all worried that he would look ""weak"" if he took the vaccine.

I cannot imagine that the US would, for example, acquiesce to the fact of regular small scale murdering raids from somewhere, systematically leaving dead US citizens in the wake. I do not see a reaction ""we can manage, we can live with it, no worry, no need to act"".  

Yet, somehow, active efforts of foreign parties to convince the US citizens that vaccines kill and plague is a fake disease, are not considered and met in a military context.

I do not see the logic here."
2021-05-03 12:26,"Manageable, until some variant makes it unmanaged again.  That's the risk when too many people refuse to get vaccinated, and for political reasons in this country (EVERYTHING is political these days) too many are refusing.  I've been making my own masks and wearing them, even now outside when I run into someone I don't know and even though I've been vaccinated.  Really, what is it with people who believe they have a right to inflict public damage?  What is it with politicians and a Supreme Court who will apparently endure a damaged populace for a ""conservative"" principle that really isn't very conservative?"
2021-05-03 12:26,"It is so dismaying that the same group of people that refuses to get vaccinated tends to overlap with the group of people balking at wearing masks in public. They act as if their right to act like Typhoid Marys trumps the rights of the rest of us to return to some degree of normalcy. They look at what’s going on in India, shrug their shoulders, and board their cruise ships.

After 9/11, we all accepted certain restrictions on our behavior because we wanted to get back to normal while also being safe and caring about our fellow man. The order of magnitude of this pandemic is so much greater than 9/11 and has impacted every country around the globe. However, a large chunk of our population, who won’t question removing their shoes or getting full body scans at the airport, will scream loudly about the “injustice” of being asked to wear a mask when they are around other people in public. Sigh."
2021-05-03 12:27,"We run a small business in the Atlanta area. I observe that those who are better educated are vastly more likely to get vaccinated. My entire family has been vaccinated, including my mother, my siblings, and their families. The majority of my husband’s family is vaccinated. It’s a different story among our employees. We have several African-American workers; they are young people, so have not been eligible for long, but only one is making assertive efforts to schedule a vaccine. She is a respiratory therapy student and has witnessed the effects of covid first-hand. Among our other and mostly older employees, several have lost relatives to covid; those people got vaccinated as soon as they were eligible. As for the rest, several have told me they have never had any vaccinations, which I have a hard time believing, since they all went to public school. This group seems to think if this disease has not killed someone they personally know, it won’t kill them either. I tell them the sooner they get vaccinated, the sooner we can quit wearing masks; I hope the discomfort argument will eventually get through to them where the public-health argument has not. I have found flyers left in rooms urging Black people not to get vaccinated and claiming that all three of the vaccines will infect people with covid. Combined with the Jesus-will-protect-me stuff coming out of fundamentalist republican-dominated churches, this does not bode well for public-health efforts."

2021-05-03 12:28,"The scenario you describe is ideal for the pharmaceutical industry, which makes the lion's share of its profits from treatments rather than cures. Ongoing COVID represents a brand new revenue stream for them. If memory serves me, the NYT ran a below-the-fold story about efforts underway to develop a universal coronavirus vaccine. The article cited how research was stymied by a lack of funding dedicated to the effort. Of course, from a business standpoint, it would not be in phama's best interests to allocate funding to something that might kill off the stream of revenue. But a universal vaccine that can work across mutations might be the answer to for society. Please continue to report on this effort and give the issue greater prominence."
2021-05-03 12:29,"The US may reach herd immunity but not through the vaccine.  Those who contract the virus and survive will have some immunity but this path leads through more suffering than is necessary.

We will do it as we have done it throughout human history.  Those people who do not accept the vaccine must accept the fact that the virus may claim them.  It is hard to feel sorry for people who choose non vaccination, and yes some with medical conditions and those who do mot have access are worthy of help.  But begging people to choose the vaccine to do so is heart breaking and ridiculous."
2021-05-03 12:30,"I've been saying for some time that our assessments of this infection should now pivot from case loads to mortality and hospitalization. Everywhere where cases are as low as in the US currently, Rt, for example becomes an unreliable indicator, because of the uneven distribution of cases.

I'd also suggest that herd immunity or not, we are making the transition from pandemicity to endemicity in most countries as their level of vaccination gets to and above ours."
2021-05-03 12:30,"""Herd immunity"" for all Americans (and the rest of the world's population) is a worthwhile goal. 

The more non-immune people in a population the more chronic and endemic the pandemic will be. The more people who are infected with the coronavirus, the greater the number of variants that will develop.

Along the path to ""herd immunity"" for all who are immunized is another path that leads to the coronavirus slaughterhouse for some.

Unfortunately, this is further proof that Charles Darwin was right."

I've spent the past year isolating indoors and maintaining my distance outdoors when in the company of strangers.  COVID is a horrendous disease, and the three immediate family members who are physicians have shared their horror stories throughout.  

However....We've found the solution.  It is a vaccine.  It is phenomenally effective.  It is absolutely and positively working.  Articles like this are, in fact, pure click bait.  Yes, you are getting accurate information from scientists.  Scientists whose job is to model out the worst case scenarios and reccomend everything they can so that those don't occur.  There is no discussion of risk management whatsoever.  

As a vaccinated individual, literally every single reputable study tells me I'm not going to be a carrier.  Is there a minute chance I'm a breakthrough case and carry it?  Sure.  But it's not hyperbole to say that I might go crash my car tomorrow- in fact, there's a better chance of that happening than me passing you the virus.  I am disgusted that the CDC and other folks continue with their theater of making me wear that mask when I am in absolutely no reasonable danger to anyone else.  

Everyone realizes what this is, correct?  It is the medical community not trusting the population and providing misleading information in order to drive human behavior in their direction."
2021-05-03 12:31,"We are still along for the ride.

While we can launch 60 satellites on a single rocket every other week and sequence each molecule that encode human DNA, our science isn't nearly as good as we think it is. We have not mastered nature - whether it is the weather, earthquakes, pandemics, or death.

A quick recap of the major errors of science just one year ago (both the CDC and WHO):
- ""Covid is not airborne, it is primarily transmitted by droplets or touching surfaces.""
- Only sick people spread Covid - ""No evidence of asymptomatic transfer"". (Wow were we wrong!)
- Remember when ""Bending the curve"" was a thing? Still waiting for the bendy part.
- And now herd immunity moved from 70% to 90%, to maybe not possible.

I did get the Moderna shot - I do believe the benefit outweighs the risk, but every vaccine has risks, including (rarely) death. I am an engineer that does believe in science, but we don't know how long immunity will last, or how quickly the virus will mutate to achieve vaccine escape. 

I do expect that a large part of the population being vaccinated while COVID is still in wide community spread creates an ideal petri dish to select mutations that can escape the vaccine - the virus seeks only to reproduce - and it will find a way.

After 100 years of studying influenza, we still don't have solid theories about the seasonality of the illness.

We are along for the ride."

2021-05-03 12:32,"From a public health perspective, the primary goal is always “control”, that is reduction of the quantitative impact of disease to some “small” level.  Measles vaccine is used for this purpose.

“Eradication” of an infectious entity is not often possible, because of reservoirs that cannot be reached.  Smallpox is a rare example.

Our public health campaigns (including vaccination programs) against COVID-19 should be “judged” not by the attainment of the “perfect”, but by their level of success against what is possible.

Beyond that, it becomes a matter of being able to manage individual illnesses with effective medicine and care.  That is the province of personal disease care not public health.  It is possible that advances in that area will reduce COVID-19 infections to a generally minor issue."
2021-05-03 12:33,"A simple way to slyly coerce vaccination is for private businesses to require it for access to their public events. 

When admittance to concerts, sporting events, theater, festivals, cruises, travel can only be granted with vaccination proof, and the anti-vaxers see their friends/family attending events that they are barred from, watch what happens.

It would all be for non-essential leisure activities that people can freely choose to attend, and which already had requirements for admittance.

2021-05-03 12:33,There really are some things we need to do for our country and getting vaccinated is one of them.

I just got back from Florida to see my mom. I was happily surprised to see that most people in PBC wear masks inside stores but not much else. You need to wear one when you enter a restaurant but from there, the bars and tables are packed. There is no mask mandate in the county just north. 

I have many friends and family members who live there and many of them were sick with the virus and know someone close who died.  I visited one such friend. We visited her new grand baby were the great grandmother was baby sitting. They were happy to have me inside and though I am double vaccinated, I was extremely uncomfortable for them and stayed my distance. I learned that the great grandmother was not even vaccinated! Its just so hard to fathom.

2021-05-03 12:34,"It does seem that if we continue to make sure the most vulnerable get vaccinated, probably on an annual basis, COVID 19 will end up like a more aggressive virus, but controllable in the same way that ""normal"" flu viruses are.

If I didn’t want the vaccine I’d consider relocating to an area with the least amount of COVID statistically with a decent hospital system. I would wear a mask in a crowd. 

But realize too, Kate, that none of us is getting any younger. Eventually we’ll all end up in a group that is more likely to get COVID just from aging, if not other morbidities."
2021-05-03 12:35,"If vaccine hesitancy and hard to reach populations are part of the problem, then let’s get serious - marketing and advertising campaigns keyed for hesitant populations, vaccine passports with benefits, bonuses for getting a vaccine, a real attempt to reach the homeless (and address homelessness while we’re at it), full FDA authorization with job requirements for vaccinations, and a school vaccination campaign like the one for H1N1.  At least have free doughnuts and coffee at the vaccination clinics!"

This means remaining in my state and community, so as to be with people I can trust - thankfully one of the better ones for vaccinations, tho still not as high as I wish.  I will keep on wearing masks - plus they’ve kept me flu-free this past winter. I am not sure when I will be willing to eat indoors or go to movies, concerts ... much as I would like to support those businesses. It really is a matter of other people’s behavior and being able to trust them.

Unfortunately it also means limiting my travels, which had been my passion - the J & J vaccine isn’t quite as effective as the other two, and though it does keep me from hospitalisation, I have no desire to get sick in the first place.

Flying exposes me to a much wider range of potentially infected passengers - not to mention variants - and unless it’s a very short flight, I will have to eat and drink aboard. And depending on the destination, the situation may be worse than at home - or quarantine may continue to be required, even with vaccinations, not great when you only have 2 weeks’ vacation."

She also prescribed antibiotics to prevent 'secondary' infection - why aren't physicians equipped to treat COVID in patients the same way? It seems to me if COVID is here to stay that physicians should have appropriate medicines to reduce symptoms and reduce risk of secondary infection in an effort to keep hospitals from become too full."

Of course, everyone will adapt their lifestyle to the level of risk they feel is manageable.  But among family and friends, cases will persist and people will die.  The elderly are likely to remain out of trouble as long as they protect themselves with annual vaccinations and a modified lifestyle--masks in crowded places, careful consideration on where and how to travel, and which people are safe to socialize with."

I am not arguing against the vaccine, but this position seems foolishly short-sighted to me. While vaccination may be one key, why wouldn't developing effective treatments for the virus also be an equally significant key, especially if there are many people who do not want to take the vaccine? There's been an understandably strong push to develop a vaccine, but I wonder if there's been an equally strong push to figure out how to treat the illness. If we had both, we'd have the virus licked."

It is an act of Patriotism and should be required for working, for going shopping, for attending restaurants and theaters, and for traveling. Children should be required to be vaccinated to attend school as soon as possible and after the pharmaceutical testing is completed.

I wish the drug companies would stop saying only a minority get serious side effects or that COVID is worse and instead offer sensible medical advice on what to do if you have an uncommon or scary reaction. That would put my mind more at ease before taking the vax. The fact that a life-changing symptom like tinnitus (ringing in the ears, which can drive you crazy) is being dismissed or ignored as a serious side effect of the vaccines is disheartening and I'm not taking the vax until such side effects are taken more seriously. Yes, I know COVID is worse, but the more the drug companies are minimizing or poo-poo frightening side effects, the more I'm hesitant to take the vax. Give us scared people guidance and less propaganda."

They are important because less people are dying or getting sick, the two important stats. But what about what we don't know that is more important: after taking the vaccine, can we transmit it to others, we don't know. Variants today cause more disease and infection than the original virus we started with last year. And they keep mutating. What are the drug companies doing, now? Their concern is profits, mine is I want my children to survive, stay out of the hospital. Taking a vaccination doesn't eradicate Covid, just keeps us hopefully not seriously ill. Maybe not taking the shot is better and to have natural immunity than a man made serum that must be tweaked every, how many years, we don't know. Maybe the risk is better. My point is well after a year we know little enough to have an intelligent conversation on the subject of us staying well. Our minds are being torn ever which way about the virus. And how about the rest of our lives: keeping a job, paying bills, getting kids to school? And wearing a mask for years because we still don't who isn't transmitting the virus. And smiling Joe says just send people money, pay the schooling costs, pay the baby sitters, give them child credits (more money), and raise taxes to pay for it all. That will take care of it all. Pitiful !!!"
2021-05-03 12:37,"I have tried to use my professional case management and counseling skills to help others schedule vaccination appointment or decide to get the vaccine. 

In the above process, I am deeply worried for our country’ future. Among vaccine refusers, there is a deep mistrust of science, medical professionals, public health experts, and science reporters. Underlying this mistrust is a lack of social cohesiveness and love & compassion for others outside of their narrow defined community combined with a moral or religious smugness. A religious fervor of personal rights supersede social responsibility. Somehow among Christian conservatives, Jesus Christ threw the poor out of the temple and praised the moneylenders & corrupt clergy. 

How do you combat decades of misinformation and disinformation spread by political & economic opportunists, religious propagandists posing as pastors & religious scholars and grifters feeding off of greed, prejudice, fear and ignorance? 

How do you respond to people, who believe the vaccine is dangerous because it contains chemicals while using recreational drugs, smoking tobacco and/or eating processed foods?

The above is not an aberration. The radicalization of a large segment of the US has occurred at the possible expense of democracy. The pandemic has been a great opportunity to solidify a five decade coup by autocratic libertarians."
2021-05-03 12:38,"If there was ever a time to unite toward a common goal, you'd think defeating this virus would be it. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, people insist on being divisive."
2021-05-03 12:22,"The response sounds similar to our experience with pneumonia.  Young people get sick (occasionally very sick) but almost always recover. Older people die (it’s the proverbial “old man’s friend”).

Pneumonia vaccines are available, but few people middle aged or younger seem to bother. 

Perhaps the only true motivation is seeing your cohorts really suffer or die."
2021-05-03 12:42,"Sounds like a cop out to me...was America this hesitant when the Polio and Smallpox vaccine was made available?
By not getting enough people vaccinated ,America will be cutting off its nose to spite the face and rendering the protective group power that a vaccine creates a mute point.

I know it's not an easy sell to the hesitant and brain-washed.But it is a worthy and important goal that deserves every person's efforts and all the energy that can be brought to bear to bring people together and in agreement that getting vaccinated helps each and every person as it also helps Everybody ultimately by giving the virus no place to go and nowhere to grow.
It is why Smallpox is virtually extinct in the wild and why nobody in America ( and most of the World ) has contracted Polio. 

The Vaccines wiped them out because Everybody got vaccinated and they had nowhere left to go.

Now...it's Covid 19 that must go...or be rendered harmless and we have the means to make it happen.  
Please consider that getting vaccinated will help yourself and all of us together get out of this deadly pandemic that has already caused so much loss and grief. 
Please."
2021-05-03 12:42,"Well, if I were locating a business this map would be a major input in choosing where to go.  The low acceptance of vaccines is a definite predictor of the quality of the workforce and the ability to attract the best to come work for you.   It helps explains the rising growth of California, Washington and Minnesota. 

Trump and the Republican party's vile and unprincipled propaganda against vaccines politicized public health to where decision making is corrupted beyond repair in too many people.  The willingness of Trump and Republicans to watch people die by the tens of thousands is one of the greatest crimes ever perpetrated on the people of the United States.  A crime perpetrated solely to get votes and exacerbate division."
2021-05-03 12:45,"This situation perfectly encapsulates the state of the US, and the world for that matter - the tools for change at our fingertips yet the people are so misinformed and fearful that they are willing to act against their own interest and put others at risk as well. Selfish. Unnecessary. Sad."
2021-05-03 12:31,"I have a family member, an anti vaxxer who did in fact get the covid shot--but only after she learned that not doing so may restrict her access to international air travel.  If we can't get people to do the right thing out of altruism and a concern for others we might try motivating them with their selfishness."
2021-05-03 12:37,"Employers, venues, and government need to make vaccines a mandatory condition of employment, and for school. If we are going to get back to normal, not have continual disruptions of our economy and lives, vaccines are a must.

I am tired of having to wear a mask. People believing rubbish on facebook about ""scary wizard magic"" in vaccines should not be the reason the rest of us have to continue living with this disease in our midst."
2021-05-03 12:22,"“Vaccine mandates would only make that stance worse, some experts believe.”

Mandate vaccines. Enough is enough. People are dying. Some anti-vaxxer in his parents’ basement who believes that Bill Gates is injecting microchips into us isn’t really qualified to be making public health decisions that will have a ripple effect of negative health outcomes across the globe."
2021-05-03 12:30,"Believe the reason for the failing is /was the whole OWS program and the way it was rolled out and it's attempted selling of a product we knew nothing about, in order to re-open the economy first and foremost.

Have been vaccinated(if Pfizer/Bio-n-tec shot is in fact a vaccine) but the after shot 'What to Expect After'... is from January 21, and in the end still we do not know if we all will need booster shot or how long it will last; also many are getting severe reactions to the 2nd shot (many not also). And the FDA still at 'emergency' use only stage, not an approval yet? Why not? December's rollout is 5 months out. Data released yet? FDA works for people's protection(s)?

Children? Toddlers? Infants? Pregnancy? Variant strains/vaccines? Just trust us.(?)

Today we can re-open fully, but tomorrow we might be in India. (and why has the worlds most populated country China have only 103,667 confirmed cases and 4,858 deaths? US 32,000,000 + confirmed and 570,537 deaths)
( also means 300,000,000 million have not the covid-19 virus in the US).

Makes sense (?) to want to believe in your program being sold to the populous.

""Believe us when we say 'We Just Don't Really Know Yet'. "" 

Thinking for perhaps the first time since Jan '20 we are finally being a little more open/honest about this program."
2021-05-03 12:19,"I don't know what people expected here. This is a country where people prize some abstract notion of ""personal freedom"" that doesn't really exist, over their own life and the lives of those around them. Pretending as if they have any control over a reality that is exclusively dominated by the board rooms of a few major corporations. It's the same country that supposedly grants this ""freedom"" that also crushes the windpipes of everyone else in the pursuit of profit. Who tosses scraps to desperate countries in the name of ""IP protection"". Who for decades has worked tirelessly to immiserate dozens of countries, mostly former European colonies, in some sort of pretend empire that it wished it had.

Yeah, unsurprisingly, this is going to drive citizens of this country insane. As people internalize this evil, it will darken their souls to their fellow humans. And a good chunk of them are going to care only about themselves, especially in a world staring down the barrel of a climate disaster."
2021-05-03 12:23,Everything in this article is speculation. A year ago scientists and newspapers were saying it would be years until we had a vaccine. Nothing is certain until it is.
2021-05-03 12:47,"""Some unknown proportion of people with mild cases may go on to experience debilitating symptoms for weeks or months — a syndrome called “long Covid” — but they are unlikely to overwhelm the health care system.""

They may be unlikely to overwhelm the healthcare system, but they certainly are likely to overwhelm the financial systems of the individuals affected. Many of those who end up with ""long Covid"" are so impacted that they are unable to work. What are these folks supposed to do?  There's movement among our political leaders to overhaul the unemployment system -  how about overhauling Social Security Disability as well to provide a real safety net for those put out of work by illness?"
2021-05-03 12:47,"This is lunacy to admit defeat in the middle of a battle. If people understand we could go through another year like this one, unless everyone in the US gets vaccinated, or 90%, then surprise, nearly everyone will get vaccinated. Want to travel into the US? Prove that you've been vaccinated. In an age of computers, this should not be that difficult. Employers will require workers to be vaccinated, so limited job opportunities without. Want to work for any government entity or contractor? Get vaccinated.
I saw more publicity for the Oscars and Superbowl than for getting vaccinated. If the US wants herd immunity, they can get it. Maybe big pharma wants a continued need for vaccine? Talk about conspiracy theories, that's a bit of a stretch. But why is the CDC and the New York Times saying something so simple is unachievable? Covid is not the flu. The consequences of yearly covid outbreaks are more serious. Plus the flu would be harder to halt. So both reasons mean the objective for covid herd immunity is necessary, and obtainable.
How is this not common sense? No different than vaccinations required for school."
2021-05-03 11:53,"Without herd immunity, the unvaccinated population will be a breeding ground for new variants that could ultimately threaten vaccinated people as well.  And around and around we go for many more years.  Who knew there were so many ignorant and selfish Americans."
2021-05-03 11:57,another unforced error. It's as if a certain segment of the population WANT the US to fail.

They literally have blood on their hands. In the meantime, we have tamped down measles, polio et al. By requiring all/most students to be vaccinated to attend school.  No mention of that requirement in this article but that is how we deal with COVID in years to come."
2021-05-03 11:55,This is sad. Don't people want the pandemic to end? Or would they rather be free to catch the virus? People are very selfish. Vaccination is for the greater good. I blame the country's political situation for this. Trump should have been vaccinated on TV. That would have solved the problem.
2021-05-03 11:59,"This is very sad and depressing news. I have to wonder if we’d have so many vaccination resistant people had we never had a virus denier and trafficker of conspiracy theories as our POTUS. We’ll never know but I see it as part of of the problem we face now. So where do we go from here? It sounds like we are looking at new variants spawned by these anti vaccine people and always trying to stay on top of things with new shots who knows how often. Do we just return to whatever normal life is now and hope our own vaccination continues to protect us or is constant concern going to always be with us? I’m confused what we do as a society, but even more than that I’m furious with these people who claim they care so much about freedom and yet will be curtailing all of ours because of their selfish stupidity."
2021-05-03 12:03,"I received my second shot Saturday.  Thank you USA  (no parties intended...just the good ole USA)!  That being said, many of my well educated, affluent friends will NOT be getting the vaccine.  They say it proudly.  Not sure how to handle them.  I will not be telling them that I spent Sunday in bed, feeling absolutely wretched.  It was worth it if it helps curb Covid.  But how do I curb the ignorance???"

What level of death will convince you that even if you can’t imagine saving your own life, that you care to save others’ ?  What is the acceptable level if collateral damage for your self-satisfaction?  

This was once a country where we pulled together. Depression. War. Even the oil crisis. Now ego is our greatest internal enemy.  Christian deniers, you *are* your brother’s keeper. We are in this crisis distinguished by selfishness, dying at a rate 4x the world at large. It does not, never had to, be that way. Listen to the leaders that want to keep you alive, not the ones who have a personal, egotistical point to prove. They have convinced you that it’s ok to dance in the middle of the interstate, that the whole speeding truck idea is a bunch of liberal nonsense. 

India’s current condition is what happens if your feelings prevail. They are begging the rest of the world for vaccine and people are dying faster than they can bury or cremate them. 

Those are not figures of speech. They are the reality and logical conclusion of denying this pandemic. We are better than this. You are better than this. Remember what this country is capable of at its best. And help get us there."

We need to start vaccination passports and we need to start them this summer."
2021-05-03 12:25,"Vaccine passports should be developed in every state with functioning legislatures, or by the federal government if necessary, and strictly enforced.  It’s a public health measure to keep people safe.  Sometimes you can’t fix stupid.  But that doesn’t mean organized society can’t protect itself."
2021-05-03 12:29,"A little over a year ago, the “former guy” asked Bob Woodward with apparent incredulity if he thought the pandemic superseded the economy. Yes, and as this article, and infinite other examples of scientific evidence, suggests, obstinate resistance to mask-wearing, social distancing, Covid-19 protocols and vaccinations supersedes putting the virus, once and for all, behind us. Indeed, herd stupidity supersedes herd immunity—the former of which this nation sadly possesses in over abundance. Unfortunately, because those who have been ignoring CDC guidelines—spitting in the faces of those of us who have been following them, as Dr. Scott Morrow has put it—the latter’s efforts over the last year and a half will have been largely for naught."
2021-05-03 12:32,The war against the virus is similar to the war against terrorism. You can control them but not eliminate them. The people that do not want to get the vaccine are as the people that sustain terrorism
2021-05-03 12:32,"This has been a PR problem from the beginning.  People should have been told that in order to protect themselves they needed to wear masks, social distance and keep washing their hands.  Also 
avoid crowds.
Instead the message was in order to protect others we should do all of the above.
What we have learned is that people are much more self involved than was thought.  We have become a country of selfishness and ignorance.

But the real start to the problem was the fact that the Trump and his Administration kept  this death threat from the country's citizens.  Lying every chance that he got, blaming it on the Democrats, then China.  Giving false information about how to avoid it, like injecting bleach into our bodies.

If the former Leader of our Government won't rally the country, what hope was there of of all of us taking this deadly threat seriously.

As Truman has said ""The buck stops here"". And that buck stopped right at Trump's feet.  Donald Trump is the reason that there have been so many threats to our health and sanity.
Unfortunately the cult that follows him is going to continue to suffer because of Trump's  lack of actions and his lies.
And consequently we will too."
2021-05-03 12:19,"TV news today says we have around 100 million fully vaccinated, and 140 million who've had just the first shot.  Surely some of the 300-something million Americans are kids under 16.  How are we not already close to herd immunity with numbers like this?"
2021-05-03 12:45,"Blue staters should avoid traveling through red states. That is where the unvaccinated and science haters are concentrated. Don't spend a penny there, not for gas, not for a cup of coffee. Research blue islands inside red zones when you must pass through them. I would even consider sending the governor, mayor, or whatever of the area that I unfortunately had to drive through his/her mentally undeveloped area and that I did not spend a penny.

2021-05-03 12:48,We are now at the point where our leadership needs to step up and tell the people that we don't want to become another India. It may seem rather harsh but if we fail to vaccinate everybody there will be a price to pay.
2021-05-03 12:48,"If you choose not to get the vaccine and put those who have at risk, there must be a price. There must be a price, if not in the public sector, then in the private sector. Ban them from supermarkets, Wal-mart, airline travel, cruises, schools."
2021-05-03 12:49,"I don't know if its excess caution or an attempt to make up for past missteps, but I think the CDC and the expert community has undersold the effectiveness of the vaccine and the safety of vaccinated people to return to normal living habits.

While there are risks of the vaccinated by asymptomatic carriers and breakthrough infections in the vaccinated, the odds of the former causing the latter are pretty small based on vaccine effectiveness.

Insisting on a high level of caution, mask wearing and social distancing in the fully vaccinated population only encourages the vaccine hesitant to say ""why bother?""  I got fully vaccinated as soon as I could but even I can't help but wonder what the point of it was if I still have to go through the motions of masking, distance and so on.

I get it, the experts are erring on the side of caution, but at the same time I think the damage from letting 30% or whatever large number of people evade the vaccine because it doesn't deliver freedom is worse.

I think if the experts had erred on the side of the vaccine being a green light to normal behavior we would have been able to get more vaccine compliance, including more coercive compliance measures being accepted."
2021-05-03 12:50,"I have to disagree with this article and here's why.

When 60-70% of the population is vaccinated, that is considered herd immunity. Currently, 44.3% of the total population of the United States has been vaccinated. 

I have been closely watching these figures over the last 30-45 days and on average, we have been vaccinating the population at an approximate rate of 6% per week. If that rate continues, America will reach herd immunity within the next 4-6 weeks. 

If I want to be pessimistic, let's stretch that out and say 8-10 weeks. This would bring us to herd immunity sometime in July, just as Biden stated about 30 days ago. If America continues acting responsibly by wearing masks, washing our hands, and maintain social distancing in small crowds and in indoor areas, we should be able to be positioned to be in great shape come the Fall."
2021-05-03 12:51,Sadly this map mimics the level of education in our country and it hasn’t changed in decades. How do we convince an uneducated public that they need to be vaccinated when 1/2 our leaders tell them that government isn’t to be trusted? At least when we had the great public health campaigns in the 50’s and 60’s people trusted the government even if they couldn’t understand the science.
2021-05-03 12:52,"I was hired by a large hospital in 2019 and not only did I have to get a flu shot for the first time (only avoided by a doctor's note/allergy proof) but because it had been decades, I also had to get my MMR (measles/mumps/rubella) again.    I was not allowed clearance to start my (admin) job until I fulfilled these requirements.  I was not bothered by any of it, and began to think maybe it was good, since there have been measles outbreaks.   My entire local family has been vaccinated and we finally had dinner together this past weekend after almost 1 1/2 years.   Meanwhile, my friend has been having family dinners w hers, for months, and none of them have gotten the vaccine."
2021-05-03 12:52,"Two strategies could pick up the pace of vaccination and reduce hesitancy: 1) Businesses and institutions like airlines, concert and sports venues, schools and universities, can and should require their employees, customers and students to be vaccinated. People would do it it they couldn't go anywhere. 2) The government could pay people to get vaccinated. These steps would not get the hardcore anti-vaxers, but would probably get a lot of the merely hesitant."
2021-05-03 12:52,"There is a breathtaking lack of ambition to address the real long-term threat: The rise of variants that could do away with all of the immunity that vaccination gives us. We are all threatened by the 90% of the world that has not been vaccinated. The only way to address that is a massive vaccination campaign, far beyond the current scope, addressing immunity throughout the world. I've never seen any meaningful discussion about this, however, so I see it as a dream, far more than even a possibility."
2021-05-03 12:53,"just as  running water and electricity follow the path of least resistance viruses will do so also.  And the way we're mucking with nature and the food chain I expect more viruses to emerge  as time goes by.

The biggest mistakes with the vaccines were requiring two shots, and the side effects with J & J. Why?  ""Warp Speed"".  Rush it into production and see what you get.  If we shut everything down the way we were supposed to the drug manufacturers would have had the time to produce something that would work right the first time.  Confidence would have been established and far fewer people would refuse to be vaccinated."
2021-05-03 12:53,"I was never under any illusions that covid-19 would go away. I always thought that it would be like influenza and receiving a flu shot yearly. Unfortunately, being realistic about covid-19 and doing my part to protect my community by wearing my mask properly (over my mouth AND NOSE), getting completely vaccinated, and social-distancing has made me a ""bad guy.""

When I try to explain to others that the vaccine does not give you covid-19, that it does not change your DNA, that those who have had adverse reactions to parts that make up the vaccine are incredibly rare or they had underlying conditions that contributed to the adverse reaction, or even that someone who died after receiving the vaccine did not actually die from the vaccine, they just double-down on their initial standpoint of ""vaccines are bad."" And some get so hostile that it's almost like it's a core belief I seem to be attacking when I'm just trying to counter irrationality with logic."
2021-05-03 12:53,"Viewing the vaccine through a partisan land divisive lens, as so many are doing here, is not only misguided but also counterproductive.  The risks have already dropped dramatically."

Do they get the irony of their position? Why does it have to take the death of a loved one to shake someone up enough to see the light?"
2021-05-03 12:54,Have the anti-vaxxer types who have evolved out of the alt health industries ever considered that the a vaccine is simply homeopathy? Something they practice and prescribe all the time?
2021-05-03 12:54,"As usual, this story is burying the good news: vaccines are so effective that herd immunity doesn't really matter. The coronavirus is likely to become mostly an inconvenience for most people, like the flu or cold viruses."
2021-05-03 12:54,Local agencies are working very hard to give homeless populations access to the vaccine. It won’t be the homeless who keep us from herd immunity. It will be the false politicization of a public health emergency and of life saving vaccines that cause the harm.
2021-05-03 12:55,"I predict a new type of segregation. The vaccinated will congregate only with those who are vaccinated, but not with those who are unvaccinated. Promoting further political, social and cultural polarization.  Not a good prognosis."
2021-05-03 12:56,"Over time I suspect that many of us for whom vaccination is very important may end up planning travel based on parts of the country where vaccination is highest and avoiding those places where lower vaccination rates may lead to continuing outbreaks.

I know I at age 76, while otherwise very healthy, will prioritize any travel accordingly.  Why should I risk my health at my age?  I’ll get booster shots as soon as and as often as available.  I’ll mask if need be.  

To what extent is the GOP going to doom itself further, simply because so many red states may end up with a sicker population going forward, simply due to a refusal to consider the consequences of avoiding vaccination or masking or large groups?

We are facing a human experiment going forward.  I likely won’t live to see the results, but at least I’ll do my part to try and tip them to do the most good for the most people."

2021-05-03 12:57,"So many comments about ""conservatives"" and ""trumpers"" who are against this vaccine. 

I work for a large healthcare company. Just over half of our nurses have been vaccinated, even though we were at the front of the line for the shot. 90%+ of those who are not getting vaccinated are people of color - not exactly Trump's target market. You can't blame the former guy for this issue - it's one the community has to own up to and address on its own. 

Oh, and the union that represents the nurses refuses to require even the flu vaccine for them, much less the COVID vaccine. Talk about poor representation..."
2021-05-03 12:57,"""Vaccine mandates would only make [skepticism] worse."" I don't understand this position. If employers require vaccination, air travel is impossible without proof, attending college is contingent on inoculation, wouldn't those and other measures push numbers much higher? Why should all of society be at risk because of the willful ignorance of the few?"
2021-05-03 12:57,"So here's the thing. At the beginning of the pandemic, everything was shut down and masks were put in place because anyone could be an asymptomatic carrier, and you could spread it to others unknowingly.  Now however we are getting to a point where, if you are not vaccinated, it's because you have chosen not to (in the US at least).  So if you test positive for COVID, that is because you have chosen that you would rather risk catching it than getting the vaccine.  The vaccine has allowed us to pick the level of risk want to accept.  If you don't want to get the vaccine, fine, but society is not going to completely shutdown because you don't want to get a vaccination that is widely available."
2021-05-03 12:58,"Our fragmented media landscape, much of it given to spreading disinformation based on religious or political grounds, is likely contributing to the resistance of so many people to getting the vaccines. I remember how different it was in the 1950s during the polio epidemic when the Salk vaccine  came out. Virtually everyone clamored for the vaccine and Dr. Jonas Salk became a household name, celebrated on the covers of Time, Newsweek, Life, etc. and interviewed extensively on the networks. Today, the public is largely unaware of the heroes who developed the Covid vaccines and the media coverage tends to concentrate on numbers rather than tell stories of people whose quality of life has dramatically improved thanks to the vaccinations. The responsible media, along with the advertising industry, can do much more to persuade the naysayers to come aboard."

2021-05-03 12:54,"Here’s the deal.  For me, the pandemic ended after my second shot.  I still wear a mask in stores but even that’s performative.

The only reason it’s uncommon is that ticks carry it, limiting exposure risk to forests or brushy areas in the Midwest and Upper South.

The four coronaviruses associated with common colds have all circulated in human populations for hundreds of years. SARS CoV-2 is new. Though it may eventually evolve to resemble the others, that’s not guaranteed, and may require a long time if it does. Unlike CoV-OC43, which probably originated from cattle, and CoV-HKU1, which may be from rodents, the new Covid has a recent ancestry in bats. Accessory proteins and certain features of the coat proteins, including the Spike, therefore differ and experience with this virus may differ as well.

I am optimistic about vaccination; both Pfizer and Moderna can easily be updated to keep pace with SARS CoV-2 as strains emerge. Let’s encourage people of all eligible ages to get these vaccines, and to consider them more important than the flu shots have been."

We are extremely lucky that the mRNA vaccines are so effective and can be adapted relatively easily to accommodate variants that prove to be resistant to the current version of the mRNA vaccines. It appears that the most likely long-term outcome is that we will have essentially a COVID shot in the fall, like we do with the flu shot. Those who take it will likely be fine.

I see statements like this all the time, but I can’t help but think how similar it is to the expert opinion (same experts, I think) in the early days that said, first, that travel and border restrictions would only make matters worse, and then that general masking would only make matters worse.

That is to say, it sounds very strongly like something people are motivated to believe because the measure sounds distasteful rather than because there is solid evidence it is counterproductive.  Indeed , a casual review of the history of epidemics and social responses —or of the impact of public mandates—would suggest that requirements and coercive “tough love” steps (whether blanket or piecemeal, like requirements for proof of vaccination to attend school, work in certain jobs, travel, etc.) are likely to be very productive in quickly increasing the vaccination rate.  

That such policies might also provoke a lot of social and political discontent and anger is a separate issue and requires political judgments that are outside the sphere of competency of public health professionals."

I think our population may possibly be more protected than we think because of all the people who have already had covid. But we need more research on this.

Covid is a baseball game being played in each nation. It is a set of innings; some on the offense and some on the defense. Deaths were winning early, prevention played immediate defense and then came up to bat to stave off a worsening rate of transmission and death toll. However, Covid is not a sport on a clock. It is a revolving offense and defense on a longer haul which can include extra innings in the nations which do not ultimately highly vaccinate while concurrently maintaining transmission control measures. Each new strain comes up like the top of the batting order an inning or two later after some decent public health defense and offense. New strains will be countered by the bullpen of more supply, shots administered and booster shots on the required intervals to stem the effects and the spread of future new strains. Family doctors and proof of medicine impact will coax more hesitant Americans eventually to accept a vaccination. Certain ballparks may restrict attendance to vaccinated fans only in some cases. Yet one must step back and consider globally the World Series. The cricket match in India and futbol match in Brazil are equally or greater pandemic concerns now which can bounce back to our league here with new strains which our current solution may not fully fight.

1. Need to understand the points of resistance.  Why are certain groups/individuals less likely to embrace and how do we address this?
2. These vaccines are a new technology:mRNA.  And we really do not understand the long term impact.  I would guess there is a segment that is reluctant to adapt a new technology - sort of the old if God had intended us to fly, he would have given us wings.
3. The legacy of our society being so  divided, that nothing can be seen as truth (sort of what Kelly Ann Conway said about alternate facts).
3. And most important.  There are countries - India and Brazil come to mind - where things are raging totally out of control. And until we get a handle on these, the pandemic is here to stay.

What if government stopped caring for them, you know, kind of like the conservative argument against welfare? Suppose further that the cost of health insurance was tied to vaccination, especially employer plans, such that the premiums paid by employers rose based upon the number of uninsured employees.

I figure the ones who refuse to get vaccinated are the ones who hate wearing masks, so this seems like a perfect punishment for not reaching herd immunity due to their trying to get a free ride off the rest of us. Also, I think now is the time to make the vaccines these people don't want available to other countries. And to start charging those who want one and refused to get it when they were free.

2021-05-03 13:25,"This article could be improved by changing the headline,and starting with the definitions of ""personal immunity"", ""herd immunity"" and ""eradication"", and ""R0"".  

""Personal immunity"" is the immunity a single person gains to a disease through infection or vaccination.  Depending on the disease, personal immunity may wear off, or may be ineffective against variants. Also, immunity varies by person.

""Herd immunity"" is the statistical extent to which disease transmission is decreased as a function of ""personal immunity"".  It is not a binary yes/no - therefore the headline of this article ""Reaching ‘Herd Immunity’ Is Unlikely in the U.S."" doesn't make sense.  (Below I will qualify this statement).

""Eradication"" is when a disease has disappeared from the world, as it seems to have been the case with smallpox.  Influenza apparently cannot be eliminated, because it changes quickly (variants) and because it exists in large reservoirs outside of the human species.

Going back to ""herd immunity"" - it is a function of decreasing transmission with increasing numbers of personal immunity.  That statistical transmission rate has a number R0 which is the average number of new cases (over a select population) spawned by one case, before that case dies or itself becomes immune.   As the number of immune people goes up, R0 goes down, but the relationship is not a straight line.  There should be a critical steep drop where R0 equals 1 - although select subpopulations will still have RO>1."

Unfortunately, there will also be a contribution from the fact that current vaccines have significantly reduced efficacy against mutant strains such as B1351 and possibly P1. This may be true for B1617 as well, who knows. Of the variants, P1 frequency is growing very rapidly across the US, which is not reassuring. 

Yet despite the clear indication that we will not achieve herd immunity, and lack of knowledge about vaccine efficacy against mutant strains, we are not just opening while maintaining some reasonable precautions, we appear to be throwing caution to the winds. Going to 100% capacity inside restaurants when people could be eating outdoors? Drinking while standing around in packed bars? That is not a good idea.

There does not seem to be any way to avoid the conclusion that we will eventually have a third surge, and no one knows just how protective the vaccines will be against hospitalization and death for infections from some of these variants. I guess we'll find out the hard way, let's hope it's not too bad."
2021-05-03 13:27,"The arithmetic in this article is questionable due to its leaving out the proportion of the population that has and is acquiring some degree of immunity via surviving a case of Covid-19.

Given the availability of vaccines that offer an assured non-fatal alternative, it is hard to see a rational or ethical basis for refusing them, but the obstinate 30% will gradually get their immunity as well - those who survive. A primitive and immoral way of going about it, but it will eventually be effective as well.

This is gradually ceasing to be the novel coronavirus it was last year. Transmission may be ongoing, but in a population that increasingly has already been exposed."
2021-05-03 13:27,"Before vaccines, herd immunity was achieved by infection, recovery, and antibodies. We should be giving people not vaccine cards, but antibody cards, and paying non-vaxxed to be antibody tested. Failure to antibody test ensures gaps in our understanding of where we are."
2021-05-03 13:27,"Insurance companies should be allowed to deny coverage for anyone who needs hospitalization if they refuse the vaccine. Sort of a, preemptive, pre-existing condition. Let’s see if monetary worries replace the, imaginary, political ones."
2021-05-03 13:28,"Herd immunity has always been a chimera. But we have vaccines that seem to be good enough to reduce the risk to the level of other risks that we are willing to take. In a short period of time, everybody in this country who wants a vaccine will have been vaccinated.  Beyond that, I don’t see why there should be a lot of public agonizing about people who refuse to be vaccinated, particularly when there are other important things that need to be accomplished."
2021-05-03 13:29,"Consequences.  Not much happens to the non vaxers without consequences.  We need to start judging.  If you ""choose"" to not get a vaccine and put the whole planet at risk for decades to come, thats fine, but you dont get to fly, you dont get to go to professional sports, or see a doctor for outpatient visits.  That would change behavior real quick!  There needs to be consequences for this political behavior that is harming the public health."
2021-05-03 13:29,"How about lowering income taxes by a percent for those who have been vaccinated? Those who have been vaccinated are less likely to rely as heavily on public infrastructure, which is supported by tax dollars."
2021-05-03 12:57,"Two things that the author does not mention.  Possibly at the risk of offending people.  Massive ignorance and stupidity are surely underlying reasons people will not vaccinate.  Another thing to contemplate is ""bribery"".  Companies willing to pay bucks for people who vaccinate.  It is an any company's best interest to have a healthy workforce that is not ""coming down with Covid""."

2021-05-03 12:47,"Another non-article by the NYTimes. Variants do not decrease herd immunity unless they have mutated enough to reinfect vaccinated or previously infected people. 

Herd immunity does not mean that every single member of the herd is immune. It means the herd as a whole is immune. Europeans had herd immunity to smallpox, but there was still enough small pox around to infect the Native Americans. 

We don’t really have herd immunity to the flu- but we live it. The goal was never to eliminate or destroy COVID-19, that’s not going to happen. We are just trying to get to a point where it’s manageable. There will never be zero cases of this, but their doesn’t have to be."
2021-05-03 12:50,"Got my 2nd dose of the vaccine on Friday. There is so much fear over the vaccine that it’s almost comical. I had a sore arm and very mild symptoms - I had a worse reaction to a tetanus shot. I can understand why people were hesitant in the first few weeks - no one wants to be first in line. But now? If you are making up in your head excuses and using fear based rationale for not taking the vaccine its just immature. You’re gambling on not getting Covid. Best to look at it like this. Do you want the covid vaccine or do you want covid. And make the decision like that. 
Now as far as variants? What is happening in India is real and there is a serious variant there and we are still letting flights in from India! In Australia if you fly in from India (including if you are an Australian citizen) you can go to jail. They have full restrictions on travel to India. Not ‘warnings’ like US which are doing no good. In US? Even with restrictions going into effect tomorrow, US citizens can still fly home from India. What are we doing here?? To me this is frightening and shows, once again, bad choices by our federal government."

2021-05-03 13:06,"Where is the leadership from Biden on people needing to be vaccinated? He need to propose a law requiring vaccination for driver's licenses, air travel, gun permits, federal benefits and require all military as well as government employees to get vaccinated. Then move onto government contractors employees. We right now require drug free truck drivers, just add the vaccination. 
    And if you want Medicare/SS/food stamps/unemployment you need to be vaccinated. It's that simple. Biden needs to lead in vaccination policy and really compete with the Chinese on getting us out of this tragedy."
2021-05-03 12:47,"I read this headline and I feel sick. There are so many challenges facing this nation, the world, and to fail to get vaccinated against a killer disease is, well, not only just plain stupid, but worse, a kind of withdrawal from the whole project of humanity. Refusing to come together to meet the pandemic and end it suggests to me that we will not be coming together on any of the other challenges--most notably, climate change. 

Here in Texas the grocery parking lots are filled with gigantic gas guzzling cars and trucks. I frequently lose my tiny Honda Fit amid them. Are these people going to cooperate with the need to end our oil guzzling habits? I don't think so. They can't even abide simple road rules like not passing on the right side, not riding my bumper, etc, etc. 

These 2 examples are small, yes, but look at the resistance to help much less change. I fear for the planet as never before."
2021-05-03 12:51,"I applaud President Biden and his administration for the success they've had in the herculean effort of vaccinating over 200 million Americans in less than 100 days. Their actions have, and continue, to save lives. 

The Trump administration's ""response"" to COVID-19 was the greatest failure of leadership in American history. As a result, over half a million Americans are dead. Had they been remotely competent, and listened to scientific experts, not only could the severity of the COVID crisis been curtailed, we could be well on our way to true herd immunity. Further at fault are the stubbornly ignorant Americans who followed Trump's lies and conspiracies and still refuse to wear masks, social distance, or get vaccinated. I find their behavior utterly contemptable. 

Finally, if we will require additional COVID booster vaccines in the future, they should remain free as they are today. These vaccines were developed with taxpayer-funded research. Booster vaccines shouldn't be another avenue for the American people to get fleeced by big pharma and the insurance companies."
2021-05-03 12:55,"Coronavirus truly reflects if a person is selfish or not. If you are perfectly healthy, and refuse vaccines, you put others at risk. It applies to masks as well. People who had immune deficiency unfortunately can’t develop enough antibody after receiving vaccines. They are the vulnerable group that rely on vaccinated people to not pass virus to them. Ideally, unvaccinated people should always wear masks as a last result to protect other people. Of course, most of them will not continue wearing masks. It is just pure selfishness and ignorance."
2021-05-03 12:57,"This news is terrible. I am trying to practice tolerance, but I am feeling deep anger for people who refuse vaccines. We are all scared of having something so new injected into our bodies. I have chronic serious health conditions and when my doctors said I should get it, I did, despite fear and misgivings. No problems at all. It’s Ike first grade, you just have to hold yourself up and go. Do it for the sake of your family, your friends, your neighbors, your community, your country. If you aren’t vaccinated, you are part of the problem. No one who is not vaccinated will be coming into my house now or ever!"
2021-05-03 13:04,"Herd immunity is not based on the percentage of the population vaccinated.  It is based on the percentage of the population vaccinated plus the percentage who have recovered from the disease.  In other words, immune people are those who have recovered plus those vaccinated.   If you look at the historical record, all earlier pandemics have ended due to a large enough percentage of the population contracting the illness to the point of herd immunity.   
As is usual for this newspaper's editorial content, the article takes a pessimistic stance when an optimistic one is warranted: In the USA, the number of known cases should be multiplied by about 4.5 (CDC data) to get the actual number of cases.  Known cases - 33 million x 4.5 comes to 150 million who have had the disease and recovered.  So the 100+ million of vaccine recipients and 150 million who have recovered from Covid means we are real close to herd immunity even today.  A quick look at the falling numbers of cases confirm this point.  There is no evidence that ""the USA will never get to herd immunity""."

Interesting how before Trump hardly anyone questioned getting a flu shot, and if they did, it wasn’t a political statement. The last president killed national empathy."
2021-05-03 12:53,"The infuriating fact is that we will not reach herd immunity in the U.S. because our civil society has been poisoned by  Reagan's disparagement of government culminating in the mindless conspiratorialism Trump's followers. Government of the governed for the benefit of all, proposed in Declaration of Independence, codified in the Constitution, and eloquently summarized by Lincoln has, indeed, perished from the Earth, the victim of ignorance and greed."

So this is what GREATNESS looks like: SOME can decide to carry on with their selfish narcissistic all about me lives, a threat to others.  While most care about self and also a commitment to others, a balance that has served us well in war, depressions, and disasters, our modern threats won't be met due to the fact that a SOME among us us aren't with America anymore.  Their rights, freedoms, and self choices no longer possess a commitment to others.  Ironic that these SOME among us are likely of a political party, ""religious"" faith, and proudly ignorant peoples, but then demand control over which race and gender succeeds and limiting the choices others make.  This lack of patriotism, citizenship, and common sense doesn't bode well for other challenges the United States and the World face: Climate, Equality, Safety, Justice, . . ."
2021-05-03 13:04,"The rapid antigen tests that Dr Michael Mina has been promoting for a year now are an easy and cost effective solution. 

It works like a home pregnancy. It uses saliva and inexpensive strips anyone can self administer quickly. 

It is recommended for home use in the morning, but could be administered on-site at schools, places of business, restaurants, shopping malls, theaters, etc. 

The importance of the self-screening is that determines if a person is asymtomatic and highly contagious. If so, then a regular COVID test would be in order and self-quarantine. 

If you look up Dr Michael Mina at Harvard’s Chan school, he can explain it better than I can."
2021-05-03 13:07,"If a baker is allowed to refuse service to a gay client due to his religious beliefs, than an employer is allowed to refuse employment to anyone who refuses vaccination; other private entities such as gyms, movie theaters, restaurants, and other enclosed spaces for crowds of people should be allowed to refuse entry to unvaccinated patrons. This is the only way to increase vaccination rates towards herd immunity. 

If you are legally required to wear a seat belt and stop at a red light, then you should be legally required to get vaccinated. This is a public health imperative because refusal to vaccinate hurts others, not just the individual."
2021-05-03 12:48,"If only we had media that Americans trusted and was trustworthy. And if only we had a health industry whose job was health and not making obscene profits. When a large segment of the population believes that big pharma or The NY Times or Fox is worse than a pandemic then we have a societal problem that needs to be addressed.
Instead we keep painting this as a republican problem —that is denialism just like those who resist the vaccine. It’s objectively everyone’s problem and those who are most to blame for the death toll are barley mentioned. We need to split up media monopolies and we need to get massive profit out of healthcare system otherwise we can expect the same results or worse for decades to come."
2021-05-03 12:49,"I like to look at this way. If the flu last year was basically non existent because Americans on average did a good job social distancing and hand washing then how can you explain 600,000 deaths from covid? I’d say it’s a little more then a little contagious."

2021-05-03 13:30,"I think the moment everyone who wants to get vaccinated has had the opportunity to get vaccinated is the moment we drop masks and all other measures, indoors and out, and go back to normal. 

Those of us who choose to get vaccinated shouldn’t be hostage to those who don’t.

The risk of getting seriously ill if you are fully vaccinated is extremely low. Nothing in life is entirely risk free.

We should also set a “lose it or use it” deadline after which we start to send those unused doses in anti-vaccine areas to other countries that are in crisis — where people are desperate to get vaccinated and cannot obtain doses."

This, in turn, ensures Covid will continue to produce more virulent strains that will eventually leap past current vaccines. This pandemic also points out the futility of  thinking we are not a global community with global spread. We are only as immunized as the least immunized country, truly a test of international interdependece."

2021-05-03 13:31,"First there was shaming of people not wearing masks outdoors despite no evidence of outdoor transmission.   Now, it's time to shame people to get vaccines.   Not only am I aware of the lengthy process for the FDA to approve vaccines and drugs, I recall the children of thalidomide during the 60's when thalidomide was hyped as a miracle drug.   

Six months is not enough time to determine if there are risks for pregnant women and their children.   Furthermore, the PREP Act gives blanket immunity to the healthcare industry from any tort liability related to the emergency use if these vaccines.  I'm not an anti-vaxxer, I am a reasonable person who sees indoor mask usage as the best prevention of covid.  Even the CDC doubts the vaccines because it still touts mask usage for the vaccinated.   Once the vaccinated stop wearing masks 100% of the time, we'll know if these vaccines are effective."

2021-05-03 13:33,"I know the media loves fear and doom, but the fact that we may never reach true herd immunity in the US is not as big a deal as this article makes it seem. The benefit of herd immunity is to protect non-immune individuals (i.e., those who are not vaccinated and have never been infected.)  If you have been vaccinated, and you have a functional immune system, then it doesn't matter to you if the population does not reach herd immunity.  You are still protected.  Also, while the US as a whole may not have reached the correct immunity threshold, your region or community may have, which is the more important factor.  

A comparable situation may be pertussis.  Like covid, pertussis is a respiratory illness that spreads easily and mutates readily.  Outbreaks still regularly appear in the US despite widespread vaccination for many years.  Pertussis is not usually dangerous for much of the population, but for some segments of the population (especially infants) it is extremely dangerous.  Adults with mild symptoms can easily spread it to unvaccinated infants, for whom it can be fatal.  But no one structures their life around a fear of pertussis. 
 Generally people get their babies vaccinated then don't worry about it.  This is how it should be for covid.  Get vaccinated, and then don't worry about it."
2021-05-03 13:35,"A year ago; six months ago, I was tolerating the disruptions in my life and willing to do what it takes to keep the infection rate.  Prevention via masks and social distancing was all we had.

But now, I'm rapidly losing patience with our patience with those who refuse to do their part and our unwillingness to use ""sticks.""

At least three times a week my daughter's principal sends notices to parents and students about vaccine clinics in our area.  Yet - there is absolutely no movement in getting vaccinated kids back to school full time.  No talk of requiring the vaccine in the fall for attendance.  Why not? No talk of requiring it school athletics, yet for years my daughter needed a doctor's physical to participate.

 My daughter is on her way to college next year.  Student body: 2000. No talk of requiring vaccine for the fall. I think I might lose my mind if they close down for some outbreak when it would take a day to vaccinate all those students who aren't already vaccinated.

NYS has a phone app for those of us who are vaccinated but I've never been asked about it by any business and I don't think there is any movement by businesses (e.g., gyms, restaurants, movie theaters) to require it.  

IT seems to me with the increased availability of vaccines, it's time to start requiring them in certain high-risk environments like colleges (dorms), gyms etc.  I'm waiting for some enterprising restaurants to start having Vaccinated Happy Hours."
2021-05-03 13:35,"The most realistic article I've read so far about herd immunity.   We aren't immune from any danger anyway.   Self-agency based on data is our best bet if not total protection.   Yesterday I took my daily mid-afternoon walk in Central Park.  Huge crowd, about 60 percent without  masks,  almost no social distancing in picnic areas.  Having experienced over thirty anti-Asian attacks in Manhattan (three physical, the rest verbal) over the last year, I still feel safer in the park with a lot of masked or maskless people around.  My N95 on at all times, that is.  I only walk on the streets within a five block radius from my home to do short errands.  No more subways for me, only buses.  (Can't afford taxis.)  Each one of us has priorities for personal safety that vary. I have yet to test positive for COVID, am completely vaccinated, am mindful about long-haul consequences even so - but am more fearful of being beaten up or killed.   I fight that fear every day, am trying not to let it dominate, but at age 58, I'm not unnecessarily reckless about it."

It doesn't help to have Tucker Carlson suggesting to his 4M viewers that COVID vaccines aren’t safe or don't work and that the big bad government is concealing the 'truth'. It's also not helpful to have GOP officials like California's Don Wagner spreading vaccine conspiracy theories in a public meeting, as happened just a few days ago."

2021-05-03 13:40,"Do you remember who advocated for herd immunity when the virus started? Yes, the Republicans. 

But  their idea of herd immunity was a little different. Basic, survival of the fittest, every man for himself.  They figured that some would have to be sacrificed to the virus as it spread (that would be you), to leave the strong to survive (that was going to be them, of course).

Before it was all about head immunity. Now it is why bother? Leaving us once again to understand that expediency is the only constant in Republican Land."

And let's stop comparing it to influenza; it will be worse.  We'll resign ourselves to reduced average life expectancy, with 50,000 to 300,000 Americans dying annually (depending on the prevailing strains).  

I don't know if there's anything we could have done to prevent this virus from establishing itself globally, and it's really just been a matter of time before this sort of coronavirus emerged.  But it's done something no virus in memory has accomplished.  It's shown us who we really are as a society, and that despicable genie will never go back in the bottle."
2021-05-03 13:43,"The flu does not result in long haulers or wreck lungs. What is the current expert knowledge/judgment of the long term health effects of getting Covid 19 or a variant? How well understood is the disease model at this point?

It appears that the vaccine reluctant folks are just setting things up to get worse (e.g., deaths, hospitalizations,  more people with long term health effects) and to last longer. Not to mention making things worse for those of us that take public health seriously (anyone remember polio?)."
2021-05-03 13:45,"Meanwhile, the higher education institution I work for is hesitant to make vaccinations mandatory (for students AND staff) for an in person return.

2021-05-03 13:46,"It’s unclear to me why herd immunity was ever possible, given that consensus now is that even vaccinated people can spread the virus.  

Herd immunity was originally described as concept that virus would die off when there weren’t enough viable hosts. But if vaccinated people can carry the disease, vaccination reduces the impact of the disease ( which is good - I am glad I am vaccinated) but not the spread- hence no herd immunity."
2021-05-03 13:46,"Let us finally put to rest the hope for herd immunity. There are too many people unwilling to get vaccinated, the global population is too large, domestic and international travel returns, and variants may develop which are resistant to current vaccines. Covid-19 is with us for the long haul, as are many other diseases including the seasonal flue. We know from this last year that proper public health behavior can minimize the seasonal flu and should be equally effective for covid-19. Hopefully we will not need lockdowns in the future; however, face masks should become more common for those with ""flu"" symptoms and during the peak ""flu"" season. Improved ventilation of public spaces as well as private homes should become more of a priority. School ventilation particularly needed considerable work. Most importantly, get vaccinated."
2021-05-03 13:47,"Headlines like this make it seem as though there’s no hope. People on the fence for getting a vaccine will not see the point of getting an emergency use vaccine that may not even reap the benefits of getting back to normal. We must show that vaccines are working and that starts with media inspiring people rather than continuing the nihilistic view that COVID has, and will continue to, ruin everything."
2021-05-03 13:47,"It's time for those of us who are vaccinated to insist that we  travel safely by having the federal government mandate vaccinations for all those engaged in interstate travel and commerce. To just give up on herd immunity not only allows the virus to continue to spread, but also to  mutate perhaps into a more virulent form that current vaccines do not protect against. Let those who don't want to be vaccinated stay home, but at 81 I want to make all those trips I deferred to celebrate my 80th birthday with as much peace of mind as possible. I have good friends, all of whom are vaccinated, that I plan to visit this summer."
2021-05-03 13:49,"One aspect that needs more emphasis is that every person who gets infected with the virus is a walking factory for new variants.

Variants occur due to mutations in the virus, and each time it reproduces, there is a small chance of a mutation.  Many are irrelevant, some make the virus less harmful or harder to spread, and those will tend to naturally die out.  But the ones that increase transmissabily or virulence will tend to be preserved as they make it easier for the virus to reproduce.

So the more people get infected by the virus, the more dangerous variants will get created.  

India and South America are not only a terrible human tragedy right now, but they are a seething variant machine, and many of those variants will arrive here.

Immunization helps not only individuals, but worldwide society as a whole."

Or a trusted professor who didn't lure students into lifelong debt? Or a trusted law enforcement official who doesn't profit off the prison industrial complex? Or a trusted journalist not engaged in manufacturing consent for a seven figure salary? Or a trusted CEO who's not a polluting, tax-dodging, slave-driving, spying monopolist? Or a trusted banker whose chronic gambling is setting the economy up for another crash? Or a trusteed celebrity broadcasting from the safety of their doomsday bunker? Or a trusted billionaire adept at buying elections?

2021-05-03 13:07,It’s ridiculous not to believe  in vaccinations. They have saved millions of lives. A yellow international vaccination card was once necessary wherever you went outside of your own country. This kept mortal diseases to a minimum.
2021-05-03 13:11,"China in just a few short years will surpass America economically and become the world's premier ""superpower.""  When that happens, we are all doomed!

2021-05-03 13:24,"thanks, trumpies. 

Contrariness is more important to them, along with their sense of exalted entitlement.

These anti-vacc, anti-maskers put shame to the memory of their 'greatest generation' forebears who took polio seriously. They also forget the concept of WWII war bonds drives and recycling for the common goal. Today, they'd be howling that those who buy war bonds are sheeple. It's just too sad.

republicans, why is an unhealthy, unvaccinated and anti-science population considered making this nation great?

How strong is a pandemic-weakened, opioid addicted, fragmented nation? Your constitution seems to mean nothing except four words alone in one part of one amendment now! 

Whites-for-whites policy making is not America's future. We can see how upset this has made the entitled white 'conservatives' who will NOT accept being told no. They are the only ones entitled to tell others 'no', in their minds.

Thanks, republicans, for giving yourselves the freedom to tell us ""No Lives Matter""."

Please. Someone get Trumps ear and tell him what a hero he would be for doing this. He would be in the news. Isn’t that what he wants more than anything??"
2021-05-03 13:28,"Get vaccinated, get any recommended boosters as variants warrant.   So far from real world data there doesn't appear to be a significant risk from the current variants in those fully vaccinated.   If you are vaccinated, go live your life - the real world data is substantially better than the ~ 95% efficacy of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.   The rest will shake itself out over time.   Dark humor exists for a purpose Ex: "" I'm not for getting rid of stupid people, but lets just pull the warning labels and let the issue sort itself out""   People are going to do what they do - then come the consequences."
2021-05-03 13:10,"Such a tragedy that we couldn't pull this off.

Even greater is that so much of the vaccine hesitancy and refusal is based on political nonsense.

Let’s not think there will not be further viral pandemics. As long as animal agriculture, illicit exotic animal trade, and deforestation (bringing people more in contact with fleeing wild animals), there will be more pandemics. 

At minimum, there must be a Federal pandemic preparation panel—which the Trump administration terminated a few years ago. 

As you reap, you will sow. Simple law."
2021-05-03 13:18,"There are many who cannot get vaccinated for medical reasons and depend on herd immunity for protection. Others who have been vaccinated worry that without herd immunity the virus will continue to spread and possibly mutate into a variant that renders their vaccine worthless. Many of us cannot survive COVID.

To those of you who have the opportunity to get vaccinated and have not done so, I say this: if you have any love for your fellow man, do it!"
2021-05-03 13:21,"“the herd immunity threshold is not attainable — at least not in the foreseeable future, and perhaps not ever.” As the virus goes, so goes the nation. This is a bellwether for who we are as a nation. We are not a united states."

2021-05-03 13:22,"I work in a company with a lot of evangelical Christians. Over the past year, as I've been vigilant about masking and distancing, I've had to watch these people repeatedly act irresponsible. 

They post videos of huge, maskless gatherings at their mega church, and photos from numerous parties and weddings they've attended. They even chose to have a large company banquet at a restaurant. So no surprise, nearly every one of them has had covid. And now, nearly every one of them has refused the vaccine.

I will never understand how transmitting a potentially fatal virus is the ""pro-life"" or ""Christian"" thing to do. Frankly, I think these are some of the most selfish, hypocritical people I've ever met. And as a bonus, they also believe the election was stolen.  

Thank goodness for remote work or I would need to find a new company."
2021-05-03 13:22,"This article feels like 1980s redux. Back then we had a heartless shell of a man as president who, because of ignorance and homophobia refused to utter the word AIDS for the first seven years of his presidency. 
The result: our collective lack of leadership at the crucial early stages made a new virus into a pandemic we still live with. 
I know this current pandemic doesn't rest solely on our shoulders in the United States. There are plenty of heartless leaders that contributed and contribute still to all this suffering. 
I am grateful for our current administration and the humanity and wealth of experience our president brings to the table. At the same time, I feel tremendous anger at the needless suffering that resulted from the US inability to act as a leader at a crucial time for the world."

2021-05-03 13:03,"people aren’t getting vaccinated because of major failures in public health messaging. blame is being placed on individuals for choosing not to get vaxed, when it should be placed on incompetent and conflicted interest messaging. here’s an example: all of my close neighbors have had high fevers and horrific reactions to their vax shots (fortunately i had none). none of us were warned to expect this, and we received no advice about how to treat these symptoms. High fevers are no joke, they can kill you. When my family member was shaking uncontrollably in bed with fever after her shot, i was left scrambling trying to find out what i could do, but all the ‘reputable’ sources  like the CDC and new york times downplay the very existence of vaccine symptoms and advise doing nothing to treat them. I, for one, would get vaccinated all over again, but after this experience (and seeing it occur with friends and neighbors), i lay the blame for anti vax with garbage public health messaging. By warping the truth in order not to encourage vaccine hesitancy (‘symptoms of the shot are rare and mild’), the cdc and public health messengers are burning through their credibility and poisoning the trust of those (like myself), who actually DO trust them."
2021-05-03 13:51,"I resigned myself to accepting no herd immunity months ago.  

Each individual must take responsibility for doing what they think is best for protecting themselves and family members.

The states can open up everything, but I will decide what level of risk I am willing to take.  And indoor dining, gyms, bars, elevators, air travel and cruises don't make the cut.

And wearing masks and social distancing will continue to be things I do.  

Think and act for yourself.  The country lacks the resolve for getting to herd immunity."
2021-05-03 13:51,"This statement about herd immunity should not cause any sense of freedom or opening of the borders with current hotspots. Allowing people with newer variants into the country will not help.
The government needs to go back to their history books and figure out how to motivate people to get vaccines using as many resources as possible. The mass vaccine drives for Spanish Flu and polio were able to reach a much higher percentage than we have now."
2021-05-03 13:52,"Vaccination must be the ticket to rejoining society. If you want to go to school, work, attend public events, and ESPECIALLY if you want to travel and use public transportation, it needs to be required. There is no other way than to disallow the unvaccinated (with rare medical exceptions) to participate."
2021-05-03 13:53,"This is an important analysis of the longer term prospects for controlling this virus.  I'm with the commenters who view vaccine hesitancy/opposition as a distorted assertion of freedom in light of the many 'publics' that practically every person takes part in, and derives benefit from.  I'll favor requirements, where they can withstand legal challenges, by health care systems for both patients and staff.  I'll favor requirements for children and youth to be vaccinated in order to attend school and take part in sports.  I'll favor surcharges for health insurance; I'll favor employer requirements, or restrictions, for the unvaccinated.  Same for air travel; same for concerts; same for mass events that are publicly sponsored.  Does anyone else remember the scourge that polio was, and its virtual eradication?  How about measles?  The swelling anti-vax phenomenon is a sign of civic moral decay, and in some cases outright sabotage."
2021-05-03 13:53,"They had an answer months ago and that was get your vaccine and get your stimulus check, you'd have much higher rates of vaccinated individuals. On top of that vaccine passports for travel and events.

There's still a chance to recover from this and the level of vaccination where we're at is remarkable.

On the other hand the 'experts' moving the goal posts constantly doesn't help, if someone basically has the same restrictions as before, there isn't much incentive to get vaccinated."
2021-05-03 13:53,"As I recall, herd immunity became a buzzword of the past administration as a justification for sitting on its hands.
It was poorly understood, and poorly reported on, and soon became the way of predicting the end of the pandemic.

Historically, herd immunity works on static populations. Non resistant people succumb to a given pathogen, leaving a remaining population that is resistant. A highly resistant population dramatically reduces the spread of a disease, helping to protect vulnerable members of a population. But the number of cases and transmissions doesn't go to 0 in most cases, although over time it can get very close.

The real source of ambiguity is how we define a population. Is it a town? A state? A nation? A continent?

In era of international travel, we really do live in a global village. At this point in the pandemic the size of that village is the global population. Some pockets will do better than others, but that can quickly change as resistant members of a population leave, and non-resistant members join different communities.

Vaccinations help lower the rate of transmissions. The lower the transmission rates, the less disease.

The good news is that over time, the strains of the virus may become less virulent. More dead hosts= less chances for the virus to replicate. Time will tell."
2021-05-03 13:54,"""At the same time, the connectivity between countries, particularly as travel restrictions ease, emphasizes the urgency of protecting not just Americans but everyone in the world, said Natalie E. Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Any variants that arise in the world will eventually reach the United States, she noted.""

Any variants that arise in the world will immediately reach the United States.  There, fixed it."
2021-05-03 13:54,You don’t have to be a vaccine skeptic to not want to take an experimental drug developed in under a year and released under emergency authorization. And especially an experimental drug where the drug companies have been granted immunity from tort liability. A lot of people would be wary of any drug released under those circumstances.
2021-05-03 13:55,I wonder if compliance would be greater if the vaccine was in a pill form rather than a needle.
2021-05-03 13:55,"The reason why herd immunity will be elusive is because covid 19 was made into a political issue just as much as it is a public health crisis. It is no coincidence that the countries with the wackiest leaderships have suffered the most by the propensity to deny covid’s seriousness or failure to appropriately act when required both taking a heavy toll. Because of this dissembling, dubious latitude has opened cracks in the societal response where a significant percentile of people lack trust in lockdowns, masks, and vaccines.  

It appears for dodgy doctrines to rise, two things are, at least, required: popular support and a healthy economy. The latter nurtures the former, Trump’s fortunate inheritance of Obama’s economy boosting his support while the US, in its lasciviousness, ignored a proper pandemic response until it was too late for hundreds of thousands of people. Much the same can be said for Britain, Brazil, Russia, and India where ill disciplined leadership, bordering on criminal irresponsibility, plunged these nations into a toxic crisis. This failure has made us aware that a significant swathe of our society is unhinged because it actually still supports these loony methods, distrust in government being a mainstay of demagoguery.

We need to return reason to our politics where people actually care enough about democratic institutions to become actively involved in their maintenance. Top down dereliction must be supplanted by bottom up responsibility."
2021-05-03 13:55,"A few brief observations:

In a circuitous way, redirecting some vaccines to countries like India may - in addition to being a humanitarian effort - ultimately pay off in fewer transmissions and/or fewer variants here and elsewhere. The less the virus travels, the better. 

Also, the differences in potential vaccine participation in some states compared to others is stunning. It's concerning to see so many fellow citizens potentially still in harms' way. And unfortunately, that kind of difference in vaccinations and response will likely lead to well-meaning but worrisome warnings about traveling to areas of the country that may still have unchecked virus transmission. Those kind of warnings are likely to drive a bigger wedge into our existing divide. 

Based on the comments of friends and family in rural and rust belt areas, they aren't resistant to the vaccine per se, but they don't want to go to some temporary place where someone trained only to stick needles in arms adminsters the shot. They want their trusted health care professionals to administer the shots, in their office(s), after discussing the risks and rewards with them based on their own individual health history. That sounds like a reasonable approach to me. 

But still, if I were a conservative person or a conservative politician (I am neither) and looked at that map, I would be seeking ways to encourage participation. If my consituents get severely ill or die, who will vote for me or support my policies?"
2021-05-03 13:56,"Why aren’t all schools, police, public service, restaurants, manufacturing and offices requiring vaccination?

Seems like our fate is in our hands but yet someone’s personal choice trumps (pun intended) everyone else."
2021-05-03 13:58,"Discouraging news. Although, I was surprised that manageable contact tracing was not mentioned as a benefit as more and more of us are vaccinated. As a higher percentage of a local population is vaccinated the ability to trace the contacts of those unvaccinated and infected should be expedited."
2021-05-03 13:58,"If what is happening in India is a new mutation that is more infectious and also if the new mutation affects younger age groups (which is the initial spin), then our current vaccinations will need a booster urgently and what is happening in India will happen here.  Time is ticking and I hope the CDC and Biden is on it."
2021-05-03 13:59,"I find myself wondering if part of the problem is the term ""herd immunity."" I have no problem with it but I can see how some people might. It might be too late but I cannot hep thinking that if it had been called ""community immunity,"" some of those refusing to be vaccinated folks might be more receptive."
2021-05-03 13:59,There should be a campaign stating that Trump was vaccinated. This fact needs to be made known to those who are declining.
2021-05-03 13:59,"The kicker is the risk of a mutation that enables the virus to evade vaccine-induced immune response.  That alone makes the failure of reaching herd immunity a public health menace.  It’s not a question of “individual liberty” like wearing motorcycle helmets, where the only person at risk is the participant.  The choice to skip a vaccine puts all of us at risk.  Why not use that messaging instead of trying to persuade doubters that the vaccine is good for them or their families?"
2021-05-03 14:00,"Herd immunity or not, we must remain alert (pay attention) to what's going on....and deny complacency in our hearts....as long as we are not directly affected by the Covid-19 'plague. Whosoever thinks that the current Pandemia is a once in a lifetime event, think again. We ought to demand we be kept informed by Public Health expertise with updates, and how best to exercise prudence in our lives, be it in the privacy of our homes or at work or out there 'vacationing'...with the potential of picking up a disease...and, unwittingly, spreading it to others. Much to learn, if only we could stay attuned...and exercise a bit of humility for the little we know!"
2021-05-03 14:00,Herd immunity cannot be achieved by allowing increasing infection because this virus mutates. It was irresponsible of people to posit the idea of herd immunity by mass infection like Trump and many Republican governors. There was no science at the time to support their claim. Now what has become increasingly clear is that allowing rampant infection leads to mutations of this virus. Some of the mutations are more virulent and therefore more contagious and deadly. The only way out is the vaccine.
2021-05-03 14:00,"Disinformation is the overarching crisis driving this crisis and many others. But the sources we usually decry – Q'Anon, Anti-vaxers, Trump, etc. -- are the result rather than the cause. The cause is that disinformation drives our information ecosystems.

We're bombarded with propaganda from the time we attain cognition. From advertisements for products we don't need to the patriotic mythologies taught in school, we're molded into compliant laborers and consumers. Officials lie to us with impunity and hide behind walls of classification and executive privilege. Corporations fund biased research and buy politicians, creating a government that serves their bottom lines.

Is it unreasonable to be skeptical about new vaccines? We saw the FDA and the CDC cave to political pressure. We have an addiction crisis caused by opioids approved by regulators and fraudulently marketed as non-addictive. Ads tell us to ask our doctors for this or that drug, and then a few years later ads tell us to contact a law firm if we or a loved one suffered illness or death because of it. 

Now we're told to trust the science. But most of us aren't scientists and so must decide whether to trust what we are being told about it. The science is complicated, conclusions keep changing, and the messengers have been shown to be untrustworthy. 

I've decided to trust this time. But given the information ecosystem, I don't blame the people who decide differently. Blaming the victims will not fix the problem."
2021-05-03 14:04,"Why are there no longer ""iron lungs"" and why are most people unfamiliar with the term?  The polio vaccines taken almost universally  around the world eliminated the polio virus infection which necessitated the existence of iron lungs. The same could happen with Covid-19 if everyone would accept the vaccines."
2021-05-03 14:04,"If we have learned anything about this virus, it’s that what is true about today will not be true in the near future. People who regard themselves as not being at risk because of their age may well discover that they are the target of a mutation. We know that—so far—vaccination protects against variations. Will those under 65 be able to say the same about age? I fear that we will find out soon."
2021-05-03 14:05,"Hundreds of thousands of Americans have already died due to COVID-19 because a significant portion of Americans wouldn't wear masks, social distance, cooperate with testing & tracing.

Now many of these same people refuse to be vaccinated. Their refusal to protect those they come in contact with will result in more unnecessary deaths.  Unvaccinated people will also ensure that the virus will have many more opportunities to mutate into a version that the vaccines will not control.

Americans who refuse vaccination due to sincere concerns about vaccine safety should seek out credible information.  The four vaccines in use in the U.S. have been tested sufficiently to support full FDA approval (the FDA is only waiting to find out how long the vaccines remain fully effective).  All of the side effects, except very rare ones, have been discovered.  Now that millions of people have received these vaccines even rare adverse events, such as platelet clotting has been found to affect 3 thousandths of one percent of adults under age 58.

Americans who refuse vaccination due to political affiliations should spend time thinking about what it means to be an American citizen."
2021-05-03 14:05,"Time to move on.  
 
We should stop crying about herd immunity being unachievable in a country as deeply divided as this one.

We should continue trying to drive vaccination rates as high as possible.  Those who insist on being left behind - let's not focus on those; they get too much attention and drain energy as is. 

Personally, I'm vaccinated.  I'll continue wearing my mask in crowded environments.  I know it won't fully protect me, but any droplet/aerosol particle that gets stopped getting into my lungs is a good one.  I don't want your SARS-CoV-2, I don't want any of your other viruses, either, like the ~200 others associated with human respiratory illness.

mRNA vaccines are the cleanest vaccines ever, and I'm hoping I'll be able to get regular booster shots targeted toward the variant sequences of the day. 

And I sincerely hope that one day soon, the CDC - as an institution - will earn back its scientific credibility.  Leave the foolishness to the WHO."
2021-05-03 14:05,"Since getting vaccinated is a personal choice, it seems only fair that people bear the cost of their decision. If they are offered a vaccination and choose not to accept it then they should be personally responsible for their medical expenses associated with an infection. Why should I pay higher insurance premiums because of their personal choices?"
2021-05-03 14:06,"Herd immunity was never going to be achieved, for the simple reason that as a medical statistic it only applies to non-circulating (i.e., penned ) herds of animals.

Herd immunity was always nothing more than a meme or a metaphor, with no clear meaning, which allowed ""experts"" to guess that it would be achieved at anywhere between 40% and 90%."
2021-05-03 14:06,"I was surprised to read elsewhere that the military was not requiring the vaccine, based on my prior experience. My squadron was part of a world wide mobility team. We had a ""go bag"" packed and ready to go at a moments notice and had to be vaccinated for every  disease including ones that were not present in the US. They were scheduled on a rotating basis based on how long they were effective and were recorded on our yellow shot record booklets.  One day the alert sounded and there was a vaccination station on the flight line. You were promptly given any shot that was not recorded. Imagine the chagrin of the airmen who had purposely ignored the notifications, realizing they were about to get every one. Knowing the side effects of many of the shots I could only imagine how badly these airmen were going to feel. Fortunately this was a drill so they didn't have to ride it out in an uncomfortable C130."
2021-05-03 14:06,"In an era of polarization, we're moving quickly into a new division: those who have been vaccinated (or shortly will be, without objection) and those who haven't/won't.  The haven't/won't crowd is only making things more difficult for all of us.  It wouldn't be as bad if only the anti-vaxers got Cocid-19 and suffered the consequences, but it doesn't work that way.

I believe there needs to be consequences for naysayers.  I'm all for a government-issued vaccination card, just like the one I got from the clinic.  It shows date vaccinated for each jab and the vaccine type.  That vax card should be a passport for ANY activity which involves a number of people, including all public transit.   If TSA can keep me off a plane because I don't have a little star on my driver's license, why not a vax card? 

It may be that the tendency of the Covid virus to mutate means it will be with us forever.  C'est le vie.  But I'm not willing to have my life further threatened by those unwilling to consider the common good."
2021-05-03 14:06,"This should not be a surprise to anyone who has been following the numbers and the science.   As each day goes by the ""experts"" know more about this coronavirus and its variants and it looks like a race that will likely never be won.  Having gotten off to a slow start, the refusal of many to accept  the seriousness of the situation, and now those who  refuse the vaccine will and  has put the nation at a disadvantage from the get go.   

 So the ""normal"" life style folks are seeking is not something we will likely ever see again. There will be a new normal, and that may not be all bad!   Time will tell."
2021-05-03 14:07,"Readers still don't understand ""vaccine hesitancy."" Carrots are better than sticks. But money isn't it. Americans aren't that shallow when it comes to their bodies. Several employers here tried financial incentives, even ""Get it or else."" That strategy failed. Why? Because the reason employees didn't want it wasn't financial and they were offended at the suggestion. It's unlikely we can change minds now. Availability usually isn't an issue. Shaming and money didn't work. Mandates won't happen. Education won't work because a lot still isn't known about it (hence all the ""We don't know yets"") and many people who don't want it actually understand what is known about it."
2021-05-03 14:08,A lot of commentary about how we can deny certain products from anti-vaxxers but why not just make the vaccine legally required? Surely that’d be the first logical step.
2021-05-03 14:08,"People who refuse the vaccine should be refused access to airplanes, airports, bars and other communal spaces. We need vaccine passports as a matter of urgency."
2021-05-03 14:08,"Perhaps a carrot/stick approach would be somewhat  helpful!

Businesses would have to agree to limitations for non vaccinated persons . It will be difficult. Separate times of access for the  non vaccinated.

The carrot could be greater access  and discounts  on goods and services.  Money reward for vaccination.

Hope the Administration and health experts are brainstorming this.  As it is, we are going to have continual ups and downs as the virus mutates .  Never even approach herd immunity. Not different that for the flu but much more virulent!.

We do have many restrictions/fines that could work as models.  Permits, licenses, etc. for protections of the general population. We are not free to do anything we want if it damages others as an example."
2021-05-03 14:09,"Schools and universities need to require the vaccine, period. That will be a substantial portion of the population. This ""freedom"" that the far right insists on infringes on MY freedom.

Incentives are also worth considering, especially for the working poor who can't afford time off work. Pay them (cheaper than paying the medical bills) and pay for time off to be vaccinated and recover."
2021-05-03 14:09,"Enough is enough. In America, there needs to be a hard-core push to immunize by all reasonable parties. For starters, all Republican leaders who believe in the value of immunization need to do whatever it takes to get the vaccine hesitant to change their minds.
I prefer carrots rather than sticks. However, sometimes nothing other than a stick will work. 
Sane Republican leaders everywhere please take heed! 

And the U.N. needs to convene a worldwide emergency session- virtually of course- to come up with an urgent mass immunization plan for everyone on the planet. In addition to being a great service to humanity, it’s an opportunity for the US to demonstrate  its goodness."
2021-05-03 14:14,"I remain baffled by the general willingness to accept, with little more than a shrug, that some people will make the ""personal choice"" not be vaccinated, therefore achieving herd immunity will be impossible.

For starters, how is this a ""personal choice"" when it impacts so many others? There are things a person chooses to do that have absolutely no impact on the lives of others, but this is not one of them.

Beyond that, I remain baffled by the unwillingness to put public restrictions in place for those who decline vaccinations. We do this now, restricting or limiting public accommodation for a wide array of behaviors or ""personal choices"" recognized to be harmful to the general welfare. The simplest example is if you refuse to be screened at the airport you're not allowed on the plane.

We absolutely cannot and should not make it mandatory that everyone be vaccinated, but there is no reason that we cannot limit and restrict the public accommodation for those who refuse. You can't rent a car without showing a driver's license; similarly you should not be permitted to enter any public accommodation without showing a vaccine card.

My personal choice is as important as yours. But so is my health and safety. I chose to vaccinated, you chose not to be. Both choices should be respected, but they are not the same in how they impact the general welfare, and should not be treated as such."
2021-05-03 14:14,"“Maybe the general public can go back to not worrying about it so much, but we will have to.”

We just won't go to the towns and areas that have low uptake of the vaccine. If the absence of tourists is fine with them, they'll be happy. Me? I'll be sorry about missing out on a visit, but I'm sure there will be many other safe places I'd like to go."

My adult son says he doesn’t trust the government, but may get it later, will not get vaccinated right now. Thankfully they both live quite a distance from me. One in CA, one in FL. I will not be seeing either of them any time soon. I think they feel if everyone else gets vaccine, they won’t have to because there will be herd immunity. I have said all I can say to both of them, and now neither of them is speaking to me. My daughter sees all the conspiracy theories on YouTube, and this is why she will not get the vaccine. They want everyone else to be responsible. There’s just no talking to some folks."

2021-05-03 14:17,"Many are hesitant to get the vaccine because of perceived rapid development. However, the research on rapid vaccine development has been ongoing for over a decade through DARPA. The RNA delivery model plus the antibody identification process have both been researched and tested over time.  The Washington Post and 60 Minutes reported on this. I would think more public reporting on exactly how the vaccines were safely developed might help overcome hesitancy. If the vaccines are safe for our groups, they are safe for me."
2021-05-03 14:17,"I just don't understand the willful resistance to getting a vaccine. How on earth do people think we've been able to contain such former deadly diseases as polio and measles?  Here in the U.S., science is not the enemy--it's partly Fox News, mistrust, and ignorance. Additionally, I never thought the concept of herd immunity made any sense with 7 billion people in the world. Access to vaccinations is critical, and we can clearly see that access is uneven globally and here in the U.S for people who do want the vaccine."
2021-05-03 14:17,"I haven't yet read the article, but will after I share my immediate thoughts. The only way to combat this hesitancy is to make employment incumbent on being vaccinated.  

No doubt that would be challenged in court, but this mandate should be instituted.  Many colleges already require it of their students before they return to the campus and classes.  

I live in a college town, the U. of Michigan, and have a cousin who works in one of the university gyms.  The students must be vaccinated, but he does not.  I hope this gap is closed shortly."

It is essential that the US vaccinates as many people as possible, as quickly as possible.  Otherwise, the rapid spread that has been occurring in Michigan will spread across the country.

The next step is to ensure that the rest of the world is vaccinated, as soon as possible.  Otherwise, a mutated strain will come back next year to reinfect the US.

The final step is to work with WHO and other countries to make sure that new pandemics are detected and squelched before they spread across the world.  Otherwise, our globalized world will give rise to similarly nasty pandemics once every decade, not once per century.

Pandemic disease, not global warming, is the most immediate threat facing America and the world."

Now they have exported a majority of their vaccine supply to other countries and live their lives normally. America has a billion fewer people in it, and has had over half a million deaths... have exported practically zero vaccine... and now we are talking about living with the virus forever because people are going to refuse to be vaccinated. This country is a joke. We had over half a million of our people die in this country and the media/democratic party still act like medicare for all is a radical/toxic idea.

People do NOT have a right to recklessly put other people's lives at risk.  If you drive recklessly or start shooting your gun off in public, you go to prison.  This should be treated the same way. 

Also, areas with high vaccination rates, like California, need to close their borders with the more disease ridden areas and require vaccinations to enter.

My parents refuse to get a vaccine and their refusal is at a religious-level of belief and they are the opposite of anti-vaxers, they just don't believe the risk is severe enough to warrant interrupting their daily schedule. Their refusal to participate is a badge of honor with their friends. The only thing that could push them to get vaccinated would be if I threatened to withhold their grandchildren (which I would never do).

This pandemic came about from people encroaching on the natural world because of their diets. It may not be the last pandemic caused this way unless policy sharply curtails this. It would be great if we all went vegetarian, but in the meantime we should be exporting whatever people want to eat if it will help preserve what little undisturbed nature we have left.

There is a significant cohort of people who will be anti-anything just for sport or attention or to make others fearful. One cannot either give in to them or be certain that they will ever prefer admitting they were wrong to waiting it out until their depart this realm.

Shared transportation will continue to fall out of favor as people video conference and avoid being crammed into crowds. People should be encouraged to own cars or motorbikes or ebikes while arranging their lives so that they do not have to use them so much. As gasoline costs more than electricity, the time to focus on driving less is now. Electrified cars will be better and cheaper in the future, at which point we can worry more about what we drive than how much we drive near our homes.

The biggest lesson is for voters.  The 3 worst outbreaks seem to have been in the USA, Brazil and India. Is it a coincidence that these are all countries that were run by populist fools who avoided science, risked lives and only cared about their own image and polling? The world is too complex to run a country from newscast to newscast."

It's allowed millions to perpetuate ignorance through denial of evolution, the still-existent pernicious effects of slavery and racism, and fear of anything perceived as not ""traditionally American.""

This puts the risk, for those vaccinated, lower than many other activities we do every day. On the flip side, the cost to our kids' educations and mental health of the continued distancing measures is huge and gets far less press.

 For that last 30% to get the fog of disinformation out of their mind and see what a wondrous thing it would be if we could help one another through this is daunting.

Get as many countries as possible to coordinate and stop all global travel. That’s the only way out of this. Really tough to do, but tons easier than this dragging out indefinitely.

If we continue to give the virus a platform it will continue to thrive. It will continue to evolve into more resistant forms. We have to extinguish it. There is no alternative."
2021-05-03 14:33,"Surveys and research shows that ""educating"" people who are vaccine hesitant does not work.  As comments have pointed out, many skeptics are equally educated as the people who have embraced vaccination.  What does work is asking folks what it is they want -- often the same as every one.  Good health. Accompanying this response is an intense embrace of choice. Meeting skeptics where they are at and endavoring to engage them within these frameworks increases the chance for changing behavior. Regarding lockdowns, the one-size-fits-all approach provokes reaction.  Selective lockdowns of hot spots free of unnecessary lockdowns in areas with low infection rates is both fair and good tactics.  Punitive measures against skeptics will only intensify people into coalescing into hard core resisters."

There is a glaring problem with the data going into these maps, this one in particular. There are huge biases for each state's sampling and polling methodology. Two neighboring states tend to have widely varying ""calibration factors"".

Within a state, the relative shading of the counties is useful to highlight county-to-county differences within a state. For example, in Maine it is well known that the coastal counties- particularly south coastal -are culturally much more liberal than the interior counties. This seems to be correctly correlated with likelihood of getting vaccinated, in the map. 

But between states, there is a huge disconnect in the calibration factor. Look at Minnesota, which statewide has a much higher shading than the neighboring ND, SD, IA, WI states. And the shading undergoes an abrupt discontinuity at the state boundary. This cannot be correct. Rather, it must reflect a different sampling methodology between states. Over a few miles on the remote ND/MN border, people on either side of this rural boundary are basically similar in their culture and media exposure. But the map shows a vivid change in their intent to get vaccinated. 

This state-to-state discontinuity must be incorrect."

Children's immune systems should be given first shot at dealing with the SARS Cov2 without the intervention of an experimental vaccine. Let the current trial run its course; scheduled for completion sometime in 2023.

Meanwhile, since not everyone will be taking the jab, and since with the variants, it is inevitable some who have been vaccinated will get an infection, it is still necessary for doctors to have a treatment protocol for Covid 19.

The FDA approved Ivermectin only for clinical trials in treating Covid 19 infections. The off the shelf anti-parasitic is anecdotally reported by some front line doctors to be efficacious. Then there is the value of maintaining a robust immune system, which requires nourishing food and exercise. Ivermectin should be given the same emergency use that the vaccines have been given."
2021-05-03 14:42,"It is about time that a new statistic should be prominently displayed in newspapers across the country on a daily basis:  the percent of new cases of COVID-19 occurring in people who have been fully vaccinated.

That number would demonstrate to those still skeptical about the benefits of receiving the vaccine that far less than 10% of new cases are occurring in those who have been fully vaccinated (while over 90% are occurring in those who have not been vaccinated)."
2021-05-03 14:42,"I do not understand why corporate America is not doing more to ensure a healthy and vaccinated workforce as the country endeavors to get back to work.  Do they not have the authority to mandate vaccinations for all of their employees, regardless of their position in their organization?  Same goes for the military.  How can our troops effectively serve our country if every soldier is not vaccinated.  And the US Government.  Why is it not mandated that all Federal and State government employees be vaccinated.  This is a public health crisis and it is long from over if we do not reach herd immunity."
2021-05-03 14:43,"What happened to the idea that if the rate of transmission dropped below 1 it would go away?

It started at 2.3 over a year ago (the do nothing predictions were 2-4 m deaths)
Shutdowns and distancing brought it to 1 for the last year (go on for years--till everyone infected)
But don't viruses die off if Rt (avg number infected by each infected person) is <1?"
2021-05-03 14:43,Can insurer's refuse to cover covid treatment for policy holders who refuse to take the vaccine?  Can there be a tangible cost for vaccine refusal?  It may go a long way to convince people if their life savings are in jeopardy if they contract the virus and wind up in the ICU at many thousands per day.
2021-05-03 14:44,"I am perplexed by the folks who don't want to get vaccinated.  

That being said, if India and South Africa and I am sure dozens of other nations have only vaccinated 1%-2% of their population variants will continue to enter the US.

Overall the US is well ahead in its efforts to vaccinate its population."
2021-05-03 14:44,"The map gives a clear indication of places that tourists and businesses should avoid.  Clearly those places are a clear and present danger to tourists and the families and friends to whom they return when the get home.  

For employers, particularly major employers, the prevalence of the various Covid viruses and the refusal or reluctance of residents to get vaccinated, is a forewarning of an unreliable workforce, high health care costs, and inflated employer provided insurance as well lost productivity.  

Any major employer considers first and foremost whether a locality has a workforce on which it can depend and which will not subject the company to avoidable costs.  The failure vaccinate is not only a disincentive to locate, but an incentive to leave.

I cannot conceive of visiting a state with low vaccination rates nor investing in a company with a substantial workforce located in such a state."
2021-05-03 14:45,"If you don't want the vaccine that's your own choice, but society won't shut down, or mask up, to protect you. 

It is unethical to require people to take extraordinary measures to protect other people who have made a conscious decision not to protect themselves."
2021-05-03 14:46,"The idea that we can vaccinate the whole world in order to eradicate the virus and outrun variants is patently absurd and never should have been considered in the first place. Experts have been in fantasy land for a number of months now. It's nice to see the majority of them coming back to Planet Earth, so people can change their expectations of the future and plan accordingly. 
That is to say, once people get their vaccine, some can decide to further entrench themselves in their bunkers while others decide it's fine to live normally again with a slightly elevated risk. The truth really does set people free, even if it causes a storm of emotions at first, a storm that is clearly seen in the comments for this article."
2021-05-03 14:47,"Running that purple map on a weekly basis will help the vaccinated know the data.
When I finally return to traveling out-of-state and consider where to vacation - think that would be a useful map to have as I make plans
Sort of like the health alerts and warnings published by the US Gov't for countries around the world.
It's just that now it is local as well as global."
2021-05-03 14:48,"The words ""vaccine sceptics"" and ""vaccine hesitancy"" do not describe the determined refusal of some Americans to be vaccinated.  Even if they don't have to pay a cent, they are adamant that they will never be vaccinated--I asked one if religion motivated her, and she ""no""!  She has a lot of company.  These individuals are willing to take salaries for working closely with the frail elderly, but refuse to even consider the consequences of their decision.  Rather than ""hesitancy"" describing these ""anti-vaccers"" they could as easily be called extremists."
2021-05-03 14:49,"I’m all for requiring vaccinations and vaccine passports. But I had an allergic reaction to my first shot, and allergic reactions, unlike normal side effects, can be life-threatening. 

So I hope there will be some understanding and accommodation for people like me who can’t get their second shot or even their first if it’s medically contraindicated, as long as we take proper precautions (masking and social distancing) while in public."
2021-05-03 13:27,"My thought on the virus.

Yes...it will always be with us. The flu is still with us and has been for hundreds of years in one form or the other. The Black Plague is still with us since the Middle Ages...& a few thousand still get it each year of they are not vaccinated.

It has been a Year & a half now since the COVID hit us (probably around even longer unrecognized) and now we have a vaccine. Those that take proper precautions & get vaccinated are probably very safe. The majority of people that get the COVID now are those that don't want the vaccine...also those that don't take proper precautions, gather in huge groups without masks & are just plain idiots.

Those that refuse the vaccine, those that refuse to take proper precautions...& get the COVID...SHUT UP & DON'T COME WHINING TO THE REST OF US."
2021-05-03 14:55,"The US should impose a surcharge on health insurance premiums for the unvaccinated (waived for those unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons). Those who get health insurance at work would have the extra deducted from their pay. If insurance companies can charge smokers more, it makes sense to charge extra for those who refuse to get vaccinated. They, as a group, have higher expenses and cause the rest of us to pay more as well.  It is only fair."
2021-05-03 14:56,"The concept to ""Herd immunity"" is either you will get the illness or a vaccine to prevent it and if you reach a certain threshold, you will see dramatic decrease in new cases and eventually stop spreading the infection. It is too soon to conclude we will not reach Herd Immunity. One thing that seems likely, is that the unvaccinated anti- mask people will likely catch Covid 19 at some point in the next 6months and if enough of them get infected and enough people are vaccinated we could still reach Herd immunity. I would prefer to be in the vaccinated group, since many of the infected will die or suffer long term consequences of this deadly infection. Get vaccinated and prove these doom sayers wrong."
2021-05-03 14:56,"Old saying: a mosquito’s liberty ends where my flesh begins. If we can’t have laws forcing people to get vaccinated, I want laws making sure I don’t have to sit next to an unvaxxed rugged individualist on a plane or in a movie theater. Unfortunately, the Usual Suspects will doubtlessly fight tooth and nail for the same “freedom” that allows the epidemic of firearm slaughter to rage on unchecked. What could possibly go wrong?"
2021-05-03 14:56,"Sying that COVID-19 has the potential to be just another seasonal virus ignores one extremely important difference between COVID and the flu: long haulers. People who get over garden variety flu don’t have the horrible ongoing health problems, the cause of which doctors do not understand. We still don’t know the economic cost of this problem to society as a whole. The emotional and economic consequences to the people who are afflicted is in some cases devastating. COVID will never be “just another flu” until they get a hold of what causes these problems and cures them."
2021-05-03 14:57,What happens to our children who don’t have a vaccine yet? Would be great if adults who can vaccinated actually do to protect the young. We do so much to protect the very old and in every way make the young pay for it all.
2021-05-03 13:48,Get your vax and wear a mask forever. Let sane people live their lives.
2021-05-03 13:04,And now we have a private school in Miami that will fire teachers who ha e been vaccinated.  This craziness will not end as long as we have wild imaginationists.
2021-05-03 15:00,"One of the problems with the public perception of the Covid-19 threat was that the government health experts and the politicians keep on moving the goalposts for what's considered to be final success.  The possibility of herd immunity is a good example, first, it's our goal, then it's not possible, now it is ""nebulous"".  Although nothing can be done with politicians once they start wagging their mouths, the public health experts hopefully will learn something from the last year, and be more conditional about anything and everything they say."
2021-05-03 15:00,"It appears to be we are, at root, in the midst of a conflict over morality and ethics.  There are those who seem to believe that their freedom is absolute.  I, on the other hand, ascribe to the harm principle, as first articulated by John Stuart Mill.  My freedom can be limited when the exercise of it may cause harm to others.  People generally acknowledge that they don't have a right to drive around drunk and blow through stop lights.  Where then do they get the notion that they can take (or refuse to take) actions where the consequence is likely harm to other people?  It seems to me to be an entirely justified use of government force to  limit the freedom of those who refuse to take necessary precautions to avoid harm to other people, such as by wearing a mask or getting a vaccine.   I am not suggesting sending them to jail, but make it difficult for them to engage in activities that are likely to impact other people, like going to a movie, sending their kid to public school, or getting on an airplane."
2021-05-03 13:43,"Go get vaccinated people. Your hesitancy is selfish and egotistical.
Let’s clear this thing up and get back to normalcy."
2021-05-03 15:01,"About the time that the vaccines were beginning to roll out to the general public I was scrolling through my news apps and social media. I saw headlines like ""Masks and social distancing will last years"" and ""Vaccinated? Why you may still not be protected."" These were not from far-right media- it was from news organizations like BBC, CNN, and similar (Not so much NYTimes, I think this paper has does a better job of messaging). 
Of course the conspiracy stuff floating around social media and YouTube, has responsibility for fueling anti-vaccination sentiment but I think that mainstream media has done a poor job of providing positivity and incentive. Instead of emphasizing the benefits of herd immunity -that it's our chance of getting back to normal- there's too much hand-wringing and ""well, actually..."" and gloom and doom.  No, I'm not saying to completely sugarcoat it, but the media needs to be aware of the overall narrative it's pushing. I think there are people who aren't necessarily 100% anti-vaccination, but perhaps they are worried about the newness of them. Then they see headlines like ""Well, actually we'll never stop wearing masks ever and the pandemic won't end ever"" and they think ""what's the point of me getting a vaccination if this will never end anyways?"""
2021-05-03 13:10,I hear that the Neanderthals have petitioned the World Board of Evolutionary Science to offer proof that they are not the dumbest offshoot of the Australopithecines.
2021-05-03 15:02,"I live in a pretty blue state in a densely populated area that has been hit hard by the virus. People are getting vaccinated and My family and most of my close friends have gotten vaccinated, but my closest friend, somebody who works in healthcare, refuses to get the vaccine. I'm torn between what to do. I don't want to annihilate her and our friendship but I believe she is been so irresponsible and to an extent selfish. I don't want to risk getting sick so seeing her has been limited and will continue to be limited. We are way passed the point when concerns about the safety of the vaccine is an issue. Millions of people have taken it and it has been highly successful. Aside from those who have medical execptions, I believe the rest that still refuses is just doing so out of ignorance and selfishness. Unfortunately l, my dear friend is in that group."
2021-05-03 15:03,"If you get vaccinated, doesn't that make you safe even if others around you are not vaccinated? I'm reading some of the comments here about forcing people to get vaccinated and I'm not sure I follow."
2021-05-03 15:03,"There are multiple reasons why some are resistant to getting the vaccine.  But, advising the American people to get a vaccine only to mandate that even the vaccinated must remain masked and isolated is certainly acting as a disincentive."
2021-05-03 15:03,"I'm a Democrat and Biden supporter, but I don't think he's doing any favors by staying masked up outside and among other vaccinated people.  The message should be, once you're vaccinated, it's safe to unmask amongst other vaccinated people and hangout outside without a mask on.  If people see a vaccinated person still using the same precautions as last year, then what incentive is there to get the shot?"
2021-05-03 15:04,"The one fact about the pandemic is the prolific number of experts, and the lack of expertise. As the article implies ""herd immunity"" is likely one of the most misunderstood concepts and most misapplied. The public is understandably confused. Why? Because of the conflicting, garbled messaging by the medical community, Big Pharma and government agencies. There is a different ""expert"" on TV everyday. Consistent, accurate messaging is essential to crisis management. We have succeeded in the past, we have failed in the pandemic. It starts with Trump's blundering, but goes further into institutional/bureaucratic intransigence in our excessively for-profit medical delivery (it's not really a ""health care"") system. Bottom line: We've had the technology and capability to manage the pandemic, but we don't have the social structure to utilize it."
2021-05-03 15:06,"I still think that DJT and his administration need to be held accountable for their response to the pandemic and the continued politicization of preventative measures and now of getting the vaccine. Is there some way to calculate how many deaths could have been prevented that occurred because of denial, lies, and politics? 

Someone commented that selfishness is not illegal. This is true, but selfishness leads people to act in ways that harm others. In this case selfishness has led to the unnecessary deaths of a lot of people."
2021-05-03 14:49,"Other countries are literally dying as they wait for a vaccine while here in the US, some people are willingly not getting vaccinated so that they can stick it to the Libs.

Proof that the USA has long ago achieved herd stupidity."
2021-05-03 15:08,"Hopefully the FDA will soon be able to give full approval to the vaccines, which will allow them to be made mandatory for military, schools, hospital workers and first responders.  I’m glad to see that some colleges are already requiring them for attendance in the fall. Once COVID vaccination becomes part of a typical vaccination panel required in various jobs and educational settings, it will hopefully become less controversial and politicized."
2021-05-03 15:09,"There are those who may be vaccine hesitant not because of political reasons or fears of short term side effects, but because of the long term unknown risks of these unproven vaccines. Antibody dependent enhancement, vaccine induced enhancement or vaccine associated hypersensitivity are among the possible scenarios down the road. Look it up. These affects can cause someone to have a worse outcome from the disease if they get infected after vaccination by a variant or related virus with cross reactivity. This may or may not happen. Researchers will admit that although they hope the current vaccines will not lead to these outcomes, they cannot fully know until time has passed. From studies I have read, this is usually in most cases at least two years (after neutralizing antibody levels have decreased). If this ends up being the case, down the road the path of this pandemic could turn in an even nastier direction.  If one looks at the mRNA vaccines information, not what is handed out to vaccine recipients but what went to the FDA, these possibilities are stated as being currently unknown.  Again, you can look it up.

When the federal experts approved the vaccines for emergency use and said the benefits outweighed the risks, these are some of the risks that they didn't say out loud to the public.  To continually say that the vaccines are safe is misleading the public until they know for sure what these long term outcomes actually end up being."
2021-05-03 15:10,"Who are ""the vulnerable""? I read more and more news of younger people, under the age of 50, either dying from Covid complications or getting really ill. The new variants seem not to distinguish their victims by age or immune system health.

As an older individual who has been vaccinated do I still have to worry that someone unvaccinated and younger than I am will transmit some new variant to me? The stress and anxiety of this uncertainty is awful.

It is appalling to realize that we are not going to reach herd immunity in the US. The CDC and state-run health departments must do a better job at vaccination PR."
2021-05-03 14:04,"Who knows if it will totally go away but with those idiots out there who fight vaccination, there is a good chance it wont.  Even with the anti- vaccinators of children, we still have achieved herd immunity in the US."
2021-05-03 14:03,"At a certain point the problem can no longer be attributed to disinformation or politics but just gross, vulgar stupidity.  God help us."
2021-05-03 15:10,"Given how contagious the variants seem to be, herd immunity will most likely be reached at some point.  It will be a combination of immunity from vaccinations and immunity from infections.  Smart people will choose the former."
2021-05-03 15:10,"My company will require evidence of vaccination in order for employees to return to their jobs. Full stop. We are not willing to risk the health of our employees and their families because of a few. I expect many companies in this country will do the same. For those who refuse to be vaccinated, job prospects will be more limited."
2021-05-03 15:11,"I think we know where we are now. Given the reality-challenged thinking across large swaths of our society, it was always unlikely that we were going to reach herd immunity via vaccine. It is unfortunate, but true, that vaccine hesitancy and the pseudoscience from which it stems could only be snuffed out by a far more virulent disease than COVID-19.

All of that said, I think we can take comfort in the fact that we do now have about a third of the adult population fully vaccinated, and I believe we have many more that have antibodies from contracting the disease with their knowledge or symptoms. If we can simply get to a place where outbreaks can be isolated and contained without crashing the health care system, we can likely return to some version of ""normal"" life.

The hard part is, of course, to learn and actually mitigate against future outbreaks in a way that is immune to political winds and focused strictly on the science. As long as there are humans and animals living in proximity to one another, there will be more novel cross-over viruses. We need to be funding the teams of scientists that monitor the caves, wet markets, and swamps across the world to find the next virus before it makes the jump to humans. This is a case where an ounce of prevention is worth infinitely more than a pound of cure."
2021-05-03 15:11,"There's an old saying: ""Think globally, act locally.""  A permutation of that - ""think locally, change globally"" -  will drive vaccination in the future in the U.S.

Once the current nationwide chaos is sorted out, Covid outbreaks will be traced to specific sporting events, amusement parks, individual restaurants, warehouses for Internet retailers, etc.   The tracing will be reported on the net and on the news.  The owners and managers of those businesses will feel significant personal injury, and they'll deploy messaging from Lebron James, Taylor Swift, Black Panther, and the Appleby's mascot (if such a thing exists), to get vaccinated.

Consider for example the owners of NFL franchises, one of the most easily identifiable named groups of conservative thinkers in America, by their collective nature and their prior financial interests among most likely to toady up to the anti-vaxxers.  But trace an outbreak to an NFL game, and they will adjust their thinking.  Money trumps everything, including Trump."
2021-05-03 15:12,"To avoid the use of a vaccine, when the affect upon society is so bad, is just unacceptable. 
I am in favor of vaccine passports and those who will not take this vital precaution should not come around others and if that means they are refused services, business opportunities or employment, then so be it. The public really does not need these kind of people."
2021-05-03 15:13,"I still do not understand why we can’t mandate Covid vaccination, which would benefit everyone.   We already mandate all sorts of things:  driver licenses, speed limits, stop signs, traffic lights, work safety rules, and of course mandatory vaccinations before kids start school."
2021-05-03 15:13,"This article is misleading because herd immunity does not necessarily mean that a given contageous pathogen must have become extinct, resulting in a zero infection rate in a population. What it does mean is that the infection rate would have at least become extremely low (like measles) and therefore manageable in controlling its spread. And, where the infection rate is indeed extremely low, the replication rate and, therefore, the mutation rate would be so low that the chance of the pathogen mutating into a problematic variant is virtually zero."
2021-05-03 15:14,"This article raises many valid points, but it should still be noted we  still are vaccinating over 2 million daily and over 3 million just two days ago.   We have obviously  not seen the full effect of these recent vaccines in the metrics yet, already we seem to have turned the corner with case load that the UK and Israel and smaller countries have  reached when coverage got to around 40%.    

There won't be a single moment we can declare victory, but setting restriction relaxation targets based on specific metrics would be helpful.  We have enough information now to do that.  That would perhaps encourage more hesitant people to get vaccinated.

The California governor has not yet set a measure for lifting masking, event though California has the lowest positivity in the country.  Yet Dr. Fauci, when pressed, stated that 10,000 daily cases would be a reasonable goal for relaxing CDC recommendations.   That's a step in the right direction."

The segment is ""The Elephant in the Zoom"", scroll down to Act Two."
2021-05-03 15:17,Start attaching economic sanctions for refusing the vaccine. Higher costs on insurance premiums and no coverage provided if you are hospitalized with COVID. Barriers to employment and to college campuses.
2021-05-03 15:18,"COVID-19 is an early warning sign for humanity. In the new world order, the survival of one depends on the survival of all. Like it or not, we are interconnected, and public policy and science are more important than ever. 

Fake news and alternate facts threaten humanity; we need to push back and eliminate this scourge for public safety."
2021-05-03 15:19,"Covid is a dangerous disease, perhaps more dangerous than we realize.  It hurts public health and, as a result, reduces economic growth.  That a minority don't want to get vaccinated because of a thousand and one excuses is irrelevant.  We shouldn't allow this minority to stop the return to a preCovid normal.  It is common sense that vaccinations should be mandatory.  Proof of vaccination must be required by schools, employers, health insurance providers, airlines and hotels.   No vaccination, no participation."
2021-05-03 15:20,"I would love to get a vaccination. However, due to my medical conditions and the myriad of allergies to medications I have, my doctors have recommended that having the vaccine is very risky for me . I have Lupus and I and am already sensitive to the flu vaccine- so much that I end up hospitalized if I get the flu vaccine. I do think it is important to remember people like me. 
Also- I tried really hard not to have Covid, but I did get Covid anyway. Does anyone know the current consensus as to how long immunity will lash from natural infection?"
2021-05-03 15:20,I'd love to know what it is about even the deeply conservative rural parts of Minnesota which accounts for the high levels of willingness to get vaccinated. Maybe something to be learned there that can help us understand how to get others to get to yes. It really was the only bright spot in what I found to be a deeply depressing article and made me proud of my adopted state.
2021-05-03 15:21,"A year ago, the simple ask to wear a mask was like pulling teeth. It didn't hurt, it didn't cause side effects. People STILL refused to wear one or wear one properly.

Why on earth would anyone expect folks to adhere to getting vaccinated if getting them to wear a mask was nearly impossible?

I remember reading from the start of this pandemic last year, many experts in the field of contagious viruses stated that this coronavirus would mutant before long.  And this was before a vaccine was fully developed.

Every year the influenza virus mutates and changes which results in the flu shot getting altered as well.

I was a big non-believer in the flu shot until I got a very bad case of it a few years ago.  Now I'm the first one in line when the shot becomes available in the fall.

The flu never goes away and I fear neither will this coronavirus or its variants.  But I also cannot help but believe that the more people become vaccinated against it, the stronger social in general will become because of it.

Even now, after my husband and I have both been fulled vaccinated, we will always wear our mask and keep a safe distance from folks we don't know or when we go shopping.  We will continue to do what we feel the safest about when it comes to our own personal health and safety.

Every day I look at the ""Exposure Risk In Your Area"" section of the NYT and for many weeks, Chicago continues to remain at the ""very high risk"" level.  

And here I thought we were ahead of the curve . . ."
2021-05-03 15:24,We will miss herd immunity if and only if re-infection after some period of time is anywhere from possible to likely.  That will cause it to stick around like the common cold.
2021-05-03 15:24,"This is not an issue that will be resolved by encouragement, tolerance PSAs, or awareness. Past pandemics prove that about half of a population must be forced to be immunized. 

As a nation, we have a right to require and enforce vaccinations for highly contagious deadly diseases. We should not allow religious or personal exemptions. We should also restrict medical exemptions to a very narrow, limited scope of issues. Where would we be if our government had allowed people to remain unvaccinated for polio or measles or smallpox?"
2021-05-03 15:25,Why would anyone hesitate? It's beyond my imagination. I couldn't live with putting someone at risk. There's no reason good enough for me.
2021-05-03 15:25,"The largest employer in my community has decreed that, absent a proven, documented allergy or a preexisting condition, all its employees must be fully vaccinated. No shot, no job. Full stop. Other employers and business need to start doing the same."
2021-05-03 15:25,"The big unknown is how many people have HAD covid-19 and therefore won't need to be vaccinated to have some protection and what subset of those people are not going to be vaccinated.  With 33m confirmed cases, we can estimate that there are likely some 120m actual cases in the US, that's about 40% of the population. Assuming cases are evenly distributed, that's 30m children (40% of 75m) + 30m anti-vaxxers (30% * 250m adults *40%), so that's 60m with immunity via infection and not vaccine or 20% of the population.  So with 60% vaccinated and 20% immune only from infection, that 80% and we're getting to population level immunity."
2021-05-03 15:25,Not being vaccinated is selfish at best and can be fatal at worst.  Too many American fail to appreciate that two other viral diseases smallpox and polio were conquered by mass vaccination.  Our scientific illiteracy and distrust of science will be our undoing.
2021-05-03 15:26,"At what point does the vaccination transition to simply ""having authorization"" versus ""emergency authorization""? Are we talking 6 months, one year, three years? At the point where it is no longer ""emergency,"" this vaccine should simply be required for school, work, etc., with the exception of certain medical or religious reasons."
2021-05-03 14:05,"Time to start making vaccination mandatory to participate in work, school or any place where people congregate. Enough catering to idiots, the lazy, the on the fence. Those who don't get vaccinated can stay home."
2021-05-03 15:27,"I have a great deal of anger towards those who won't get  vaccinated.  Patriotism is what we need.  Yet the same people too unpatriotic to take the vaccine are often the same ones who festoon their cars and homes and golf cars with American flags and call themselves ""patriots.""   They don't know what patriotism means."
2021-05-03 15:28,"The article does not state when the various Covid-19 vaccines will be approved for use on children under 16 years old. That would seem to be an important piece of information necessary to calculate the point at which herd immunity would be reached. Children under 16 represent about 20 percent of the total population of the United States, so until the vaccines are approved for those under 16 herd immunity can't be attained."

Get vaccinated

In clear and unambiguous language.

If you are not doing these things you are a public menace.
Fully half the nation does not get it — tell them!"
2021-05-03 15:29,"“The virus is unlikely to go away” 
""Vaccination is still the key""
I believe vaccination should be mandatory but it's a non-starter. In the '50s when I was in elementary school we all got vaccinations for polio and everything else available: we had to have them to go to school. I'm still alive and kicking at soon-to-be 72.

Vaccine-refusers inflict serious health risks and large economic costs on America. My proposal: Vaccine-refusers will soon be the primary vector and victims of infection. Many more people will become infected, need often very expensive medical care, and a large part of that financial burden will fall on taxpayers. Vaccine-refusers, and the workplaces that choose to permit them to make that choice should, as a matter of equity, bear the economic cost of those choices.  Every vaccine-refuser in a workplace that permits vaccine refusal will pay $100/month into a federal fund specific and limited to offset costs of providing medical care to the virus-infected. That $100 will be matched dollar-for-dollar by the no-vaccine-OK workplace. This will rapidly produce a very large pool to offset at least the immediate economic cost vaccine-refusers inflict on America. With 5 Million vaccine-refusers contributing, this will raise $1 Billion/month. It will not only save taxpayers a lot of money but 1) will provide incentive for employers to hire non-refusers as we go back to work and 2) force a lot of vaccine-refusers and vaccine-hesitant to re-evaluate."
2021-05-03 15:30,"The article says: ""Over time, if not enough people are protected, highly contagious variants may develop that can break through vaccine protection, land people in the hospital and put them at risk of death.""

That is a completely unacceptable scenario. We must do better, and get more people vaccinated."
2021-05-03 15:31,"Surely, the concept of herd immunity ultimately depends on how you define the herd. 

If you consider the entire human species the herd, then, well, achieving herd immunity seems pretty darn unlikely at this point. But in some nations, some states, some cities, some regions ... the more localized populations will more easily reach levels of immunization that result in that herd achieving immunity, as long as the different herds don't mix too dramatically. Consider New Zealand's future ...

Here in the US, I suspect things will get quite interesting when Blue states start reaching the 70 plus percent fully vaccinated mark, and Red states do not. The data is going to be good enough for epidemiologists to be able to show where the 70 percent threshold is surpassed with far finer granularity than that. 

Communities with herd immunity will of course remain vulnerable to influxes of people from outside, if those people come in with the virus and in large enough numbers to dilute the level of immunization within the groups they mix with, as at family dinners, bars, restaurants, sporting events, theaters, and concerts.

If we had vaccine passports, a bar or nightclub or theater or arena could in theory help protect its customers by making sure that, say, its level of fully vaccinated patrons never goes below 75 or 80 percent. I would also recommend charging the people who choose to not get vaccinated a higher cover charge where such things apply."
2021-05-03 15:31,I find it totally unacceptable for our society as a whole if so many people refuse to vaccinated basically at the expense of everybody’s safety but while also still benefitting from those who did vaccinated. We surely have to do better than that. Together we stand but divided we will fall.
2021-05-03 15:30,We need vaccine passports. Want to do anything fun? Show proof that you’ve been jabbed.
2021-05-03 15:32,My takeaway from this is:  Hang onto your mask.  Those of us who are educated and informed will probably wear one for years to come.  I don't know if I will ever be comfortable with indoor dining.  Vaccine passports are the only way to handle this.  There must be some pressure on people to conform.  I know I will be very careful about selecting my friends.
2021-05-03 13:56,"“To say the goal will not be attained adds another “why bother” to the list of reasons that vaccine skeptics use to avoid being inoculated.”   Say What?  If YOU get vaccinated then the chances improve, and if YOU don’t then herd immunity can’t be reached...that’s ‘why bother’ ! Do these people spend their entire lives look through the wrong end of the telescope or what?"
2021-05-03 14:10,"we were exposed to risks of serious illness,hospitalization and death for days and weeks in march 2020.colleagues made wildly optimistic comments about covid, and managers called 5 and 10 employees into small offices for meetings. nobody knew what was going on and nobody wanted to sound like a pessimist. then everybody locked down suddenly 25000 died in days in new york city.the streets were empty for weeks. 
now the danger is one of coming in contact with a vaccine hesitant individual who may be infected, possibly severely.the other danger is the emergence of a more contagious and deadly variant.

republicans are to blame or this.they are full of lies,delusions and conspiracy theories,and they wont take the vaccine, they resist masks,distancing, and lockdowns, and otherwise make us all unsafe,and prevent us from reaching herd immunity and normalcy. a deadly or more contagious variant can always emerge, wreaking havoc all over again,even if everybody or most got vaccinated. researchers have to be vigilant and try to stay ahead,and shorten the development time for a vaccine to counter such variants.the virus keeps mutatimg.most variants are harmless, but one or some deadly ones can emerge."
2021-05-03 14:14,"The ignorance and stubbornness of a huge portion of the  U.S. citizenry is astonishing. Yet in looking back at the last four plus years it is becoming very clear what ultimate destruction Trump has wrought. The difference now with President Biden at the helm is like night and day but he can only do so much, along with the sage expertise of Dr. Fauci, to convince so many Americans that getting vaccinated is the way to go. As with other readers here, I agree that reading this article is most depressing. A mass benign acceptance of a future where the virus still exists is tragic, and to think that the possibility of a more normal existence with the virus tamped down to extremely low numbers is not in the offing is truly sad."
2021-05-03 14:26,"I seriously don't get it.  Literally millions of people have been fully vaccinated with a negligible number of serious side effects.  The conspiracy mongers are threatening the lives of Americans, as if the virus itself wasn't bad enough.

2021-05-03 13:59,"This country has become unrecognizable in the level of ignorance supported by politicization. Take a look at that map.

The reason why China will surpass the U.S. in very measure of success in this century has nothing to do with cheap labor, intelligence nor fiscal policy. It has everything to do with willful ignorance. Some misguided notion of what ""freedom"" is.

Americans seem to need someone to hate. If the virus was a person or country, maybe we'd have a chance to stop shooting ourselves in the head. 

For now, it remains my solid belief that all of our best years are behind us."
2021-05-03 14:06,"We're never going to get rid of this virus, and we likely never were, no matter how tempting blaming the ""other guy's"" missteps and misdeeds may be. The endgame described in this article — one in which COVID becomes a manageable, endemic disease — was probably inevitable and, frankly, doesn't sound so bad, insofar as a novel disease can be not so bad. 

Regardless of what lies ahead, I would strongly advise everyone who isn't vaccinated to get vaccinated, and I would  also advise those who are vaccinated to refrain from categorizing those who aren't as stupid and selfish or unworthy of participation in society, because that doesn't help anything and only serves to make yourself feel better.

And I would advise all of us to go about our lives again. We now have the tools to do so, thankfully."
2021-05-03 14:25,As predicted by me (and I'm sure many of you.)
2021-05-03 14:31,"""Once the novel coronavirus began to spread across the globe in early 2020, it became increasingly clear that the only way out of the pandemic would be for so many people to gain immunity - whether through natural infection or vaccination - that the virus would run out of people to infect.""
Thanks for at last mentioning those of us who don't need vaccination because we were inoculated the hard way: by getting ill. 
It is bizarre, to say the least, how ignorant people are concerning their own body's workings; assuming that the only way immunity works is through the presence of antibodies. They get panicked when they learn that antibodies fade; panicked because they know nothing of B Cells and Memory B cells and all the rest of the remarkable components of the human immune system. I have spoken with people who don't even know how a vaccine works - thinking it is a medicine that stays in the body and fights infection instead of an agent that spurs us into what they deride as ""natural immunity.""
We who had the disease, or who picked up the virus without ever getting sick and have been discovered to be immune, have thus far been left out of the equation. I have no more need of Novel Coronavirus vaccine than I have for a measles vaccine after having had that illness as a child.
Americans are addicted to fear, from witches to the fear of ""commies"" there is always something to be afraid of. At present, this disease is it. And many, sadly, love the fear.

2021-05-03 14:22,"I hope all these antivaxxers have health insurance. Some US citizens are leaving hospitals with bills between $1,000 and $5,000, and that's what they're expected to pay with insurance. Without insurance, that bill can shoot up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. If your life and the lives of others are no concern, at least think about your pocket book. Hospital stays in the US are well-known to bankrupt families, but vaccines are cheap."
2021-05-03 14:24,"Those who choose against the vaccine, if infected, will become incubators for mutated strains / variants of the virus, and thus can infect all of us that are vaccinated. Humanity please."
2021-05-03 14:28,"After having covid-19 I couldn't wait to get vaccinated.  I never want to go through that ever again.  I can understand someone having questions and concerns about the vaccine.  But to outright refuse to get it because of political or religious beliefs is ignorant and selfish IMHO.
Just think if this attitude was commonplace in the time of the Salk vaccine for polio.  Children would still be suffering from that horrible disease. This current situation just highlights how divided the Nation truly is.  And I lay that at Trump's feet."
2021-05-03 13:59,"If you want better coverage, look at the map and note Minnesota.  With the extremely high-credibility medical institution, Mayo Clinic, it's no accident.  Get the vaccine campaign out of the hands of PR machines, celebrities, and politicians and go to the professionals."
2021-05-03 14:04,"This public health prediction is based on magical thinking. There is no selective pressure for the virus to reduce the severity of symptoms. The symptoms come after transmission. With only a partial population vaccinated, there is high selective pressure for the virus to mutate in order to transmit to the vaccinated. The more transmissible variants also cause more severe disease. The only way forward is vaccine mandates, just like we have for measles, rubella, chicken pox, etc. 

Last year there were a bunch of similar one-sided Pollyanna articles telling us the virus would become less transmissible and less deadly. The opposite happened. New variants are more transmissible and more deadly. The NYT needs to stop only presenting opinions on what the best case scenario might be as factual articles. 

It is time to give the public a realistic assessment of what the evolutionary options are for this virus. The most likely outcome from incomplete vaccination are even more infectious and more deadly virus variants that overcome the vaccine, because that is what we are selecting for. 

If you consider the most likely evolutionary outcome, it is clear we need vaccination mandates throughout the world to achieve herd immunity as quickly as possible. We have the resources. We just need the political will."
2021-05-03 14:21,"Funny how all the anti-lockdown people were complaining about limited freedom and the depressed economy, but now it's their refusal to take the vaccine that's limiting freedoms and keeping the economy down. My own sister-in-law, who's a medical professional, was genuinely confused when I gently confronted her about her refusal to get the vaccine; she did not understand how her actions are prolonging the pandemic and harming the economy, as she's been programed to believe it's all the fault of ""liberals."" I'm so tired of all the childish ignorance. Enough already; if you don't know anything about anything, stay home on election day."
2021-05-03 14:27,Herd immunity will come eventually. Either you get immune from vaccination or infection. It’s up to you and your brain to decide which method is preferable.

Logical, simple info is desperately needed in this pit of misinformation we now live in. Why would we ever assume otherwise?! Transparency and clear relatable dialog is crucial, for many reasons. People are allowing themselves to believe they live in a country with a totally untrustworthy government. Prove them wrong!"

This takes care of liberal states and conservative states alike.  Same for the military. Require the vaccines and give a less than honorable discharge for those who refuse. Most importantly, change the law at the federal level, with many states following, to make termination for refusing the vaccine a termination for cause, not eligible for unemployment. And for Heavens sake, end the endless stimulus payments that encourage the lazy, selfish behavior. Stop worrying about freedoms and philosophies. Money talks, and lack of money talks loudest  We who have been vaccinated, whether older people, health care and first line workers, or just plain smart about things don’t expect to have our lives forever interrupted by the stupid.

    But that is not my real comment.  What I am wondering about is the scientific conviction that all of the variants are going to be worse than the original strain.
    In John Barry's book, ""The Great Influenza,"" he writes about ""reversion to the mean.""  He notes that the 1918 flu pandemic, (which killed my great aunt, by the way), was so extreme that subsequent ""mutations"" were less lethal. They were less lethal because they followed the mathematical probability called reversion to the mean, or the probability that an extreme event will be followed by a less extreme event.
      Scientists today do not use the term mutations;
they use the term variations.  Yet they believe the variations will go against reversion to the mean and come out stronger, not weaker.  This confuses me.  It probably confuses anyone who reads this, too. Why are the variations of Coronavirus supposedly stronger, not weaker?
     No reporter on television or in print or amateur journalist in social media has picked up on this discrepancy between today and 1918.  I think it is important. I hope that the algorithm or what-not that scans readers' comments will cast a casual glance at this particular question and answer it.  Why does Coronavirus have to grow stronger, not weaker?  It didn't in 1918."

Not because she was worried about herself getting sick or dying, but because of the trauma she and her coworkers would go through.  She said it’s not as bad as the people that have to dispose of all the dead bodies though.  Those are the people she really feels sorry for.  She is now an older woman who worked mostly remotely doing case management through Covid and thankfully got vaccinated soon into it. But she is sad she had to live to see all this happen.

It can also mutate in that it becomes so different that a vaccin or past infection is much less of a protection than now. Even though some protection will persist.

Mutation can mean something else too: dead and very ill people on an ic-unit do not spread the virus. Mutations that do not kill and create a much lower level of sickness could become more succesful compared to other variants.

So my question is:  How do these new variants stack up in the level of sickness a carrier developes? Are there studies concerning this? When variants become more infectious, does this also mean that it matters less for a variant what the severity of sickness is?"

There is no evidence that any of the current variants of concern are any more likely to evade vaccine immunity or to reinfect those who have already had COVID than prior strains and the percent of reinfection and breakthroughs is quite low. 

Most Americans will get vaccinated with incredibly effective vaccines and many already have immunity from infection. That will be more than sufficient without hyperventilating about the final X%.

Not true in places like ND, SD, WI, IA, which all have populations similar to Minnesota (in terms of history of civic engagement, volunteerism, altruism), but all of which were governed by people who downplayed the seriousness of the virus.

That's the reality we're living with. We need a better plan than ""lock downs"" which were never a good plan to begin with. There needs to be an end to this isolation.

Now 100 years later, many  get flu shots every year because of the changing nature of influenza strains each year and to avoid serious infection. I imagine years from now, we will be getting covid shots that are tweaked to match yearly/geographical variants in the same vein. Perhaps the flu and covid shots will be given as one? As an educator, I signed up in February for my Pfizer vaccine when it became available and will get a booster if they tell me I need one. It's just common sense, good citizenry, and public health hygiene. The same applies to masks. If we would have had strong leadership based on science when this pandemic began, I imagine the conversation and state of the pandemic in this country would be completely different. Messaging starts from the top, and hopefully minds can be changed now with consistency. I hardly no anyone who argues that flu shots take away personal freedoms."
2021-05-03 15:42,"Vaccination should be required at schools, within police departments, and for all government jobs.  At businesses vaccination policy for all public facing jobs should be clearly posted. I want to know if the restaurant I'm eating at welcomes infectious employees.  Unless through medical necessity those who refuse to be vaccinated are likely to be thought of as ""enemies of the people"", and rightly so."
2021-05-03 14:39,This article makes the case for a vaccine passport. You want to travel abroad? Fine: show proof that you are fully vaccinated. I've travelled to countries that required me to get vaccinated against certain diseases. Let's do the same for Covid-19.
2021-05-03 14:52,"Hopefully, the most important scientists and world leaders will learn from this pandemic. They must, because the masses behave like Sisyphus."
2021-05-03 15:08,"There were several inflection points at which eradication and ultimate control of this virus failed:
1. The Chinese government’s failure to communicate what it knew when it knew it.
2. The utter incompetency and hubris of the CDC regarding pandemic preparation and early testing.
3. The mask debacle and messaging over wearing a mask and why one should wear them. (Don’t wear a mask, wear a mask to save your neighbors, wear a mask to save yourself).
4. The demonstrations late last May that were not condemned as potential super-spreader events for political reasons.
5. And the final nail in the coffin, the continued politicalization of the virus by the most incompetent administration ever to rule this country. 
6. It didn’t help that unless your relative died, no one cared about the dead, particularly the elderly dead."
2021-05-03 15:18,"Where are all the experts, who, at the beginning of this pandemic advocated for letting the virus run its course to achieve “herd immunity” as the the best means of ending the pandemic? Some of these experts, as I recall, were from prestigious universities.  The Times should check back with a few of them, do they admit they wrong? Or just more interested in taking a convenient stand that aligned with their partisan beliefs?

Obviously, if with vaccinations at the level today - we are still unlikely to get to the “herd” it would be a long and deadly wait to do it “naturally”."
2021-05-03 14:42,President Biden needs to sit down with the health insurance companies.  No vaccine - then charge these people higher rates.  Enough with the carrot approach.

2021-05-03 14:53,The other unsettling fact is that Florida and Texas do not test nearly as much as California and New York -- about 50%. They follow Trump's don't test credo.
2021-05-03 15:21,"If/when states with wide vaccine acceptance get to zero new cases; and the US realizes sitting on millions of doses of vaccine that will not get used is a waste and starts shipping it overseas because Americans don’t want it …

…. then we’ll see how hesitant some folks really are. The prospect of “missing out” sometimes motivates more than the public good or helping their fellow person. 

Heck, start charging for the vaccine in September, unless you have an excuse."
2021-05-03 14:42,Herd Immunity requires at least an 80 to 85% participation rate. Forty five percent or more Americans still believe Donald Trump's lies. Nope. We definitely not gonna get there. Honest truth.
2021-05-03 15:20,I'll learn to deal with the reality that we will never reach herd immunity.  Accepting that American exceptionalism is a complete myth is a bit harder.......................................
2021-05-03 15:21,"Maybe all of us who have been vaccinated should wear a shirt that says ""hey antivaxxer, I am your guinea pig."" In all seriousness, when they argue that we can't know that the vaccine is safe, do they not realize that millions upon millions of us have gotten the vaccine to no ill effect? And that rates of infections are dropping dramatically in areas of high vaccine compliance? What more proof is needed? I would also recommend there be more video footage nationwide of people suffering in the hospital with Covid-19. And not just old people - the young, the middle aged as well. I think too many people just don't know what this virus can do to them. Death by suffocation is brutal. Living life with compromised lungs is pretty terrible too."
2021-05-03 14:47,"Just think if you were a doc or nurse treating and watching COVID patients die in droves around you, your heart breaking. Just think if you were one of the teams of researchers frantically working through the night to save the world with a miracle vaccine...and, miraculously, multiple vaccines were developed. Think about how those science-minded professionals feel NOW, to hear that their efforts are being  ignored by millions of Americans who refuse to take this lifesaving measure."
2021-05-03 15:07,"If you compare this map to the 2020 by county election map it is very startling.   Particularly if you look at OH, FL, PA, GA and TX.  You could very well see a partisan divide in who lives and who dies that could impact the outcome statewide."
2021-05-03 15:25,"I'm old enough to be considered at risk of serious Covid illness but young enough to feel I have a lot of life yet to live. If a large part of the American public refuses to get vaccinated and thereby insists on serving as likely carriers of the disease, I reserve the right not to associate with them. I will travel to countries that require vaccination for entry. I will vacation in states that have high vaccination rates. I will dine at restaurants that require evidence of Covid vaccinations. I will patronize businesses that require their employees to be vaccinated. People may have the constitutional right to be stupid, but they don't have the constitutional right to infect me with a potentially fatal illness."

2021-05-03 14:59,"Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the FDA, today on CNBC:

""We are going to continue to chip away and get more people vaccinated over the course of the summer...If we can get 2/3rd of the population vaccinated or a little bit better than that it is going to be a good level of protection.""

He is very optimistic."
2021-05-03 15:11,"This is the direct result of our broken healthcare for profit system. People have seen time and again that big pharma puts profit first and is not held accountable for catastrophic mistakes. Story after story of executives and legislators buying selling stock based on insider information. I think there’s a feeling that if people die or get sick from COVID, at least a virus is not making a buck off your life. I get why people don’t trust the vaccine."
2021-05-03 15:24,"I remember when I was in middle school, I had a really great and funny teacher. He said once while explaining a big group project assignment that the challenge with group projects is that, ""Your grade depends on the dumbest and least motivated person in your group."" In other words, even if you work really hard on a group project, if you have someone in your group that doesn't do the work, then you're in trouble. That's what this feels like. I've done my part for the past ~13 months by staying inside basically the entire time, and I just got fully vaccinated. But my future safety and my family's future safety with regards to the virus is impaired by delusional, narcissistic people that can get vaccinated, but would rather just hold out and freeload off of the rest of society's vaccinations than do their own part."
2021-05-03 14:46,"The only thing that has saved the CDC/health policy community from getting slammed for their horrendous performance over the last year has been that Trump set himself on fire and then drove over a cliff.  Just in the last three weeks, the CDC/health policy community have 1) set up post-vaccination guidelines that look like there's no value in getting vaccinated, 2) paused the J&J vaccine and scared people silly over a massively rare side-effect, and 3) now started talking about how herd immunity is impossible, again making people wonder why they should get the vaccine.

It makes the Department of Motor Vehicles look like a model of bureaucratic efficiency by comparison."
2021-05-03 14:46,"Vaccine hesitancy or selfishness? Most say they want things back to normal but many invent all kinds of reasons why they won’t get vaccinated.  Like masks, vaccines are being politicized. It is an extremely selfish, childish mindset, one that will cause more needless deaths."
2021-05-03 15:26,"What a shocker. I guess it depends on which experts you listen to. It's been clear to me that Sars-Cov-2 will become an endemic virus for months now, where a mix of vaccination and acquired immunity will provide some protection against emerging variants, but it will never be fully suppressed or go away. 

Were people really holding on to the ""herd immunity"" promise?"
2021-05-03 14:36,"I have said this before and will say this again. People who do not believe in science should not be allowed to benefit from it.  Won't take vaccine? Think climate warming is a hoax? Well, leave society and go live under a rock.  Almost every single thing in your life today was made possible by science. Here are a few of the things you need to give up before you leave the society:

- Any kind of medical care and medications
- Clothing
- Cell phones and other communication technology
- Most foods where list of ingredients is longer than 2 items
- Your eye glasses
- Education
- Transportation

How about them apples?"
2021-05-03 14:40,"Re vaccine ""hesitancy"":  Perhaps Jeff Bezos should offer $250.00 to each person in the U.S. who completes their vaccination by 01 August, 2021. It would be a small but effective gesture of gratitude for the vast increase in his wealth during the pandemic."
2021-05-03 14:45,We are fast approaching normalcy at the current vaccine rates.
2021-05-03 14:52,"Now we know why Covid-19 vaccine passports make sense in fact may well be essential. There will never be herd immunity. Those of us who have been vaccinated have a right to live normal lives without masks and without social distancing.

Yes let the never-vaxxers assert their right not to be vaccinated but not by making it a life long problem for the rest of us. It is their problem not ours. They must decide whether to wear masks and social distance and the same for the rest of us. Our choice.

It is now past time both President Biden and the CDC released a definitive statement rather than dancing around this issue. For our nation to return to normal we must be able to live normally. 

It is not good enough for the government to tell all of us you don't have to wear a mask when you are outdoors and alone but you must wear a mask everywhere else you go."
2021-05-03 14:54,So the healthy who refuse will pass on the burden to the already burdened sick and vulnerable. We are not a nation of one. We are a nation of 'me.'
2021-05-03 15:08,"What counts as herd immunity?  It can't mean no infections at all; that may never happen.  It could count it as a flat rate of new infections, provided that the health system can cope:  a steady number of existing patients, with no net additions or subtractions.  Or a level where the risk of getting infected is below X percent, where X is low.  If you say that we will never reach herd immunity (your headline) or may at least get sort of close to it (Dr. Fauci), somebody ought to tell us what it is."
2021-05-03 14:55,"I am just SO SO angry. This pandemic continues to be devastating for so many around the world, and 30% of the US population is so selfish and disdainful that they won't let their ""liberties be infringed"" to get vaccinated. Well, my liberties are being infringed upon and I AM ANGRY. Do my Republican frenemies think it was so easy to upend an entire year, wear masks when they were inconvenient and uncomfortable, endure fears of the loss of my job, forgo all social gatherings in favor of safety at home? Of course it wasn't easy, and it certainly wasn't my choice. But I did all of those things. I did it to help my fellow Americans, my family, the doctors and nurses, my neighbors. And now it looks like we will continue to be the adults in the room, sacrificing so the world doesn't self-destruct. Thanks Republicans. Your selfishness and self-entitlement has successfully conquered an extraordinarily low new territory."
2021-05-03 15:01,"How ironic that it's mostly Trump's base that refuses to get the vaccine when it was partly due to Trump's ""Warp Speed,""program that we have the vaccine in record time. 

In addition to all his other ""records,"" he'll go down as the main reason the US didn't acieve hurd immunity."
2021-05-03 15:34,"The time has come for President Biden to address the nation, using his persuasive rhetoric to convince the entire population to get the vaccine.  It does not need to be a simple nudge but effectively a mandate that unless everyone is vaccinated others are at  risk and if we don’t want the vaccine for ourselves we are being very selfish and inconsiderate of others.  In other words bring shame on those who deserve it.  If that is ineffective I believe by law we should require it."
2021-05-03 15:17,I guess this will likely mark the beginning of the decline of the the United States as a country experiment.
2021-05-03 14:57,"the great show now on  PBS , Atlantic Crossing, has FDR in a wheel chair with Polio.  It was that recently that people were stricken before vaccines eradicated it, entirely.   Add measles, mumps, and small pox.   
How could people not trust the science?  
How could people not care about other people? 
How could people not want this to just end, when the end is in sight?  
Do they like the thought of masks being required for all indoor activity forever?  
Do your part and cut it out already."
2021-05-03 15:07,"I recall public health experts say at the beginning, throughout and now:

1.  We can’t vaccinate our way out of covid-19;
2.  We will never return to normal behaviors like shaking hands, hugging non-family/pod members; and,
3,  vaccine hesitancy is short-circuiting herd immunity.

1 and 3 contradict each other and 2 has been thrown out the window with the relaxation or complete reversal of pubic health protective measures.

This weekend I took my first covid safe overnight and picked up take out at a highly rated restaurant.  The parking lot was packed; groups of people going in and out; and every table, booth was filled - mostly with 4-6 unmasked people.  It looked like the entire population of the small town of 4000 was there.

The air was stagnant, hot and uncomfortable even without covid-19 on my mind.

I have no idea if all, any or one of the diners were vaccinated.  

I will remain covid vigilant much longer because it’s clear people don’t understand the total picture.

It’s easy to blame vaccine hesitancy but this article doesn’t do justice to its complexity.  A major study found that there is no one size fits all solution.  It would be informative to know what is being done to identify the real reasons and address them.  

“...the SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy emphasizes the importance of understanding the specific concerns of the various groups of vaccine-hesitant individuals, as aneffective “one size fits all” intervention is unlikely ever to exist.”"
2021-05-03 15:41,"It's time to accept that we have a new disease with humanity, which appears to target the elderly - especially those with lifestyle (obesity/hypertension/blood pressure/COPD/etc.) issues.  

Just as we aren't constantly wearing condoms around to protect against AIDS (the burden is on those most at risk), going forward we'll need to re-consider constant safeguards against COVID.  The best barrier may simply be a healthier lifestyle."
2021-05-03 14:28,"To convince the reluctant people, I think it would be helpful for providers and the media to be transparent about how many people get sick from the vaccine, and somehow incentivize them. I got very sick for about 24 hours, I'm talking could not walk across the room sick and could not get my fever below 101 despite taking the maximum dosage of ibuprofen. I lost a whole day of work and could not care for my children because I was so sick. This does not even account for the time I had to take off to make 2 appointments and drive to those appointments. In total, I took off about 14 hours from work. I know so many young, healthy people who got very sick. People in their 20s and 30s with fevers of 104 and going to urgent care to get an IV because they were dehydrated from vomiting all day.  I realize that we get vaccinated for the sake of the whole population and the less vulnerable, but it's a big sacrifice to ask of people who don't stand much risk of serious illness if they were to get the virus. Meanwhile, we are also surrounded by people who refuse to get the vaccine, so that makes it feel like even more of a sacrifice. And now we are being told we'll have to do it again within 12 months - why should we make this sacrifice when we aren't going to reach herd immunity anyway? It's not as simple an argument as that for getting other vaccines without such awful side effects."
2021-05-03 13:14,"Shorter version of this story; "" Due political gamesmanship, religious zealotry, ignorance about the scientific method as well as basic biology the American people are currently, collectively too dumb to take the steps necessary to achieve herd immunity""."
2021-05-03 15:35,"A lot of vaccine hesitancy is anchored in the constant drumbeat of red state propaganda sources posing as news.  This stupidity is being fed by known sources.

Perhaps the answer is to follow the example of the companies manufacturing the voting machines and just sue the living daylights out of them.  

Every American in the country is being put at risk by individuals on say, Fox News, who are spouting this nonsense.  They should be held responsible for the deaths and illness they are promoting."
2021-05-03 11:53,"In the end, politicizing Covid and vaccines will likely be President Trump's most long lasting impact on the United States.  

A different statesperson could have emphasized that we all want the same things: for the economy to improve, for our children to go back to school, for our public spaces to be safe for everyone.  Instead, based on narrow political calculations, Trump decided to embrace what could have developed into a small or fringe view and amplify it.  Trump embraced a factually incorrect, anti-science, anti-social, ""my rights"" view on vaccines that then became part of the general divisiveness and polarization in the US.

It is ironic in that Trump himself got vaccinated the first chance he got.  And his Warp Speed program was actually a wonderful piece of public policy, that showed that there are some things that only government can do.  He could have called science-based vaccines Trump-o-care, strongly advocated for vaccines, and we would have all been much better off."

2021-05-03 16:38,"It's disgraceful. The vaccine is here, and yet people refuse to take it. Anyone who refuses to get vaccinated is just helping COVID turn into a persistent, worldwide pandemic that will never go away. We will never get the world as we knew it back."
2021-05-03 16:38,"Totally unacceptable! If this is the case, America is done. Over. Give up on anything and everything. Now. I want to scream. All you had to do was wear a mask! Properly.

2021-05-03 16:06,"So does this mean that because of the anti-vaxxers, we all have to give up things like concerts, ballgames, theatre, or large indoor gatherings where the unvaxxed can make our young people sick? Are we going to have to forever forgo a play or an indoor graduation? Stay out of dozens of our states? Be unable to travel abroad (or even across the border to Canada? You can’t blame them for keeping us away. I would too). I want every member of my family vaccinated for personal reasons — I don’t want them to die. But I don’t want them to be responsible for someone else’s death either.  It’s not just a personal choice” when you choose actions that delivers rely endanger the lives of others. Most of the time that’s called “manslaughter” — or worse.  Am ashamed of my fellow Americans. Once again our selfishness outweighs our “American values”."
2021-05-03 16:00,"Where are all the people who choose not to vaccinate their dogs and horses from rabies?  Oh, that's right, there aren't any.  Because they love and value their pets and because local laws require it.  These folks have likely not encountered any rabies-infected dogs in order to believe that it's a horrible disease best prevented.  Not sure I see much distinction here."
2021-05-03 15:48,"As soon as the vaccine pill/nasal spray/or patch is approved, I'll be at the front of the line. There seems to be an embedded obstinacy in medicine and big pharma about newer methods of vaccine administration, even as many preliminary trials show these other methods to be as, if not more, effective than injections (e.g., the flu vaccine patch has been shown to be more effective as a patch; see <a href=""https://news.emory.edu/stories/2017/06/microneedles_flu_vaccine_patch/index.html"" target=""_blank"">https://news.emory.edu/stories/2017/06/microneedles_flu_vaccine_patch/index.html</a>, which is from four years ago!). These modalities, esp. the pills and nasal sprays, which have production methods in place, can be tested and rushed through as federal emergencies just as easily as the other vaccines. So it appears that besides the drug companies, the oil and plastics industries are making a fortune out of the pandemic. Mountains of plastic waste and transportation pollution are being generated with the current vaccines, and no one seems to care, even while we are told that we have less than 30 years to turn climate change around. Global thinking seems to be at a premium. KN95 masks, hand-washing, not touching one's face (esp. avoiding nose-picking), and blowing one's nose (not snorting nasal discharge down one's throat, an action I have yet to see mentioned in the Do Not Do list) are very effective but it appears that those actions are just too inconvenient. Until another modality is approved, I'm staying at home for the duration, where I have been, and remain, very happy in my cocoon."
2021-05-03 15:43,"The entire concept of ""freedom"" and ""being forced"" has been warped beyond all measure by this generation.  We grew up with all of the prosperity and luxury earned by the Greatest Generation, and now we act like spoiled toddlers.

If our population had been around in WW II, no one would have gone to war.  We would all have claimed that being drafted and risking death was a gross violation of our freedoms.

Wanna drive 100 mph through a school zone?  It would be a violation of your freedom to make it against the law.

Wanna chain smoke in a train or a plane?  Again, it would be a violation of your freedom as a true, patriotic American to pass laws (or even just carrier's rules) preventing it.

So, how many people do you know or know of who have died from measles, polio or small pox?

Hint: Vaccines are not personal protection, they are communal protection.  They work okay when given to an individual, but the real impact comes from giving it to everyone.  That is why there have been global campaigns to eradicate diseases like small pox and polio."
2021-05-03 15:53,"“Herd immunity”, as used by Trumpers, was simply shorthand for doing nothing and letting the virus go unchecked.  It never was about being safe or getting back to normal, it was about refusing to acknowledge we weren’t safe."

China, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, New Zealand, and eventually Australia didn't decide to passively wait for herd immunity. They eliminated the virus last year; and I don't imagine they will allow failed states like the USA to bring the virus to them. Until a country achieves zero, whether through vaccination or PH measures, it remains a pariah whose residents will either require a reliable vaccine passport or be subject to a 14 day mandatory quarantines when entering a non-failed state."
2021-05-03 15:47,"The definition of who is “vulnerable” is changing since the virus is mutating around the world as we speak. Elderly people who were vaccinated are recovering in India, while many people in the 30-65 year age group with no co-morbidities who had not been eligible for vaccination are succumbing to COVID. We in the US should appreciate the luxury of having access to vaccines. It is immoral to simultaneously hoard vaccines and also be reluctant to use them (because have expiry dates)."
2021-05-03 16:02,"How sad, that having the means to defeat this killer virus many chose not to get vaccinated.  If this decision only affected those taking it, so be it.

2021-05-03 16:01,"Those citizens who are concerned about others will be vaccinated.  If there are variants, these same citizens will keep their vaccinations current with what ever new vaccines are available.  Those who believe that the vaccinations are an imposition on their individual freedoms will refuse to be vaccinated and will age.  They will become vulnerable to the virus and any new forms.   What will happen to these people as they age?"
2021-05-03 16:02,"It remains unfathomable why - if a health threat is serious enough to shut down not just national, but global enterprise and societal interaction - and there is a remedy available, the federal government does not simply mandate the vaccine. When faced with every other major health threat (polio, smallpox, measles, tetanus, e.g.) for which a vaccine became available, those vaccines were simply made part of the standard regimen. As much as I admire the Biden administration's handling of the vaccine distribution, I cannot understand the timidity behind the absence of a vaccine requirement. Here in NYC, the politics behind school administration is so thick and heavy-handed that institutions like CUNY - vital to so many students - will most likely be looking at another year of mostly remote instruction. It all leaves me at a complete loss for words."
2021-05-03 16:06,"Those who refuse vaccination provide the virus with a population within which it can mutate.  So it may not be wise for those who are vaccinated to assume they can return to normal despite the existence of that pool of unvaccinated individuals.  Maybe it will be up to the vaccinated to refuse to return to theaters, restaurants, stadiums, shopping centers and the like, until herd immunity is reached.  The economy won't get back to normal with just the unvaccinated participating.  Maybe the vaccinated should demand that places of business require proof of vaccination before they (the vaccinated) will enter.  Money is the only thing that seems to matter in this country so it'll end up having to be about that."

will make new variations feel welcome to wreak havoc as a rolling disaster from now on, as a permanent feature of our lives.

2021-05-03 13:52,"Only a few hundred Americans died during the Ebola outbreak in the U.S. in 2012 because President Obama and his staff, especially Susan Rice and Ron Klain (both now advisors to President Biden), created and implemented a pandemic response team early in the outbreak that not only sent medical teams to Ebola-stricken countries in Africa but had healthcare workers meeting people who flew into U.S. airports from Congo and other places with Ebola outbreaks to ensure infected people were quarantined immediately.

That's what an intelligent working government can do.

Because we didn't have an intelligent functioning administration in 2020, COVID will continue to circulate in the U.S. and impact our way of life for years to come.

This is what happened when a reality tv star with no government experience was elected and then when COVID hit, he worried most about protecting his chances for re-election instead of the impact of a pandemic on the American people.

Thank God this country followed that by electing Joe Biden.

Heard an intro to a piece on NPR about a week ago.  Interviewer asked “what words come to mind when I say vaccine”.  One lady said “rushed”.  I get that some people feel the vaccines have been rolled out too quickly.  But we weren’t starting form scratch.  There has been 15 - 20 years of research on Coronvirus that was quickly put to use to develop the vaccines.  The response of a very angry male was “my freedom will not be held hostage”.  How do even begin to talk to that attitude, let’s alone reason with it.  Maybe we don’t.  Maybe at some point, for the sake of heard immunity and a healthy population we have to isolate those that won’t get a shot. 
These people missed biology class, obviously, and think - what’s it to you if you got the vaccine and I didn’t.  The vaccine can mutate upon transmission and their catching the virus may become the mutation that renders the vaccines ineffective, and we are back to square one."

I have very little faith in the pronouncements of these ""experts,"" who have been wrong or filp-flopped on so many aspects of the covid-19 pandemic.

We have all been subjected to endless streams of conflicting, partisan, and emotionally fraught ""expert"" advice on mask wearing, the safety of outdoor activities, social distancing, school closures, lockdowns, covid risks to children, etc.

This latest covid alarmism --- that we will never reach herd immunity -- is particularly insidious because it undercuts the clear, hopeful message that vaccines work, and we all should get the jab.

The Times and other ""mainstream"" media should reconsider this relentlessly negative coverage of America's covid response, though negativity has been the rule.

So, if certain people dont want to be vaccinated and that number is less than 25% of the population, I dont see what's the issue here. Perhaps some of those people will get covid and die, but it is not at all likely to become a public health emergency, so who cares? Burden of risk is on them, not majority who is getting vaxed now. Israel and UK numbers show how drastically numbers go down around 50-60% of population getting vaxed.

Their firsthand confrontation with illness and death may motivate them to get vaccinated, more so than peer or familial pressure.

We were failed by our ""leaders"" at the start of the pandemic, but the CDC was the only organization with useful information, not the White House.

There are over ten million people in America who are immune compromised for various reasons, most because they take an immunosuppresent drug. Without something close to herd immunity, these people, me among them, will likely have to spend the rest of their lives social distancing, wearing masks, endlessly asking if people have been vaccinated, and then avoiding those who haven't. I have friends and family who refuse to get vaccinated I may never see again. All because they are afraid of getting a vaccination that has been proven to be safe and effective. The selfishness of the American people apparently is bottomless."
2021-05-03 14:09,"So-called conservatives are causing the increase in deaths in others based on their radical individual choices...the whole opt-out movement, which in many places was a leftist ideal, is anti-thinking, and anti-community health. Imagine if this politics takes hold? We might have elected a feckless president...played the Trump card.

A vast majority of people develop immunity without the vaccine.  And the majority of people don't get sick with this virus.

I'm not anti-vaccine.  But this whole conversation seems quite biased.  Why doesn't it explore other viewpoints?

There are many well-respected immunologists and virologists who have a different view.

I got the vaccine to protect myself but also because I know it is the right thing to do for the better health of the entire population. I wear a mask when I'm shopping close to others because they're health depends on it. Even though I've got the vaccine and am most likely not infected with Covid, I may carry it anyway. So the mask is on... gladly although mighty uncomfortably. But the effort is worth it. I feel better for it. But to now realize that this habit may have to be a lifelong one because of a bunch of fools crazy notions that the vaccine is somehow bad... makes me very sad and angry."

If we want to achieve a level of civilization that makes herd immunity possible, enough humans have to recognize a responsibility towards each other.  Civilization has made us too soft, selfish and ignorant to pay attention to life and death issues like epidemics.

Society evolved so that individuals could pool their resources against collective threats (other societies) and for collective needs (irrigation systems).  This is inimical with the US mythology of rugged independence.  This partly came from the fetishization of competition.  

But a system of individuals ruthlessly competing for survival without care for the whole eventually leads to cancer, just as in the human body.  The US cultural landscape is riddled with cancers, Facebook being preeminent.

I would push for any methods to keep the vaccine drive going. 

In this age of smartphones and information storage, creating a vaccine ""incentive app"" might go like this:

- vaccination e-certificates (""V-Cert"") shown on the V-Cert app. This status would be confired if we can make positive determination that the person had been vaccinated. There have been records kept. 
It's possible to do as other countries are doing, particularly Israel. 

Now, once we have a handle on who is vaccinated, the incentives kick in. 

Every public activity could have a two tier price structure.

Round Trip Airfare 
$650 V-Cert. $725 no V-Cert. 

Ballgame tickets. 
$50 V-Cert. $60 no V-Cert 

On and on for anything where people gather. 

The message -
There are advantages to vaccination. 
There are rewards. 
You are one of the favored because you are one of the responsible ones and you get benefits for it. 

Talk about FOMO!

Americans hate to think the next guy is getting a better deal!

Get a free vaccine. 
Get certified. 
Get the app. 
Get going.

2021-05-03 17:28,"I find it interesting that there's nearly no mention in here of the reality that a sizable portion of the unvaccinated American public (along with every other country with high infection rates over the past year) still has immunity conferred from earlier Covid infections. Per at least one estimate, a full one-third of the American public has already had it, despite most cases not having been formally confirmed. (There's also no mention of the reality that herd immunity isn't really possible until EVERYONE – including young children – can be vaccinated, and right now no one under 16 can get one.)

As for the rest (e.g. white Republicans who can readily get vaxed but refuse to do so because of conspiracy-theorist nonsense): it's simply not realistic to set national-level policies based on the warped beliefs of those willingly swallowing snake oil like the vaccines containing 5G chips & whatnot. They can either get vaccinated or, more likely than not, eventually catch Covid. Assuming we've vaccinated all of our most vulnerable, THEN it becomes an actual issue of freedom of choice for the holdouts – and we'll have to see if/when they change their minds once the inevitable variants make it cross-country en masse."

But that will accomplish nothing but more ""peaceful protests"".  

Here is my proposal to get more folks vaccinated.  Send out a $2,500 4th stimulus check to every American who gets fully vaccinated for COVID 19 regardless of income.  Then see how many antivaxxers sit at home and say, ""You know honey.  That's $5,000 between us and President Trump and Melania got vaccinated so what do you say?""  The sooner we get Americans vaccinated, the sooner the hospital numbers go down, the sooner businesses can open (my all time favorite gay bar permanently closed this week), and the sooner we can get our wonderful economy going again.  At this rate, it will be a long, long time before my county (or NYC) reaches Phase IV and opens everything up.  

FYI - Up until last Sunday, you would have classified me as an anti-vaxxer since I have turned them all down since 1978 when I was in bootcamp.  I had a sugar cube in '63, had measles, mumps, chickenpox, and old fashioned midwest flu growing up.

I work in a 1,700 person factory that was 'essential' and is staffed in a way that requires personnel to work shoulder-to-shoulder, reaching over one another, and touching all the same things, in an uncontrolled climate ranging from 45 to 105, doing industrial aerobics. Masks? Lol. Life hasn't changed for us. If you ever order anything online, we're the reason you receive it. By all means we should've been wiped out. About half the people there got it and no one died. Thus our lived experience contradicts the TV's story.

I had it. Recovery was one week with no fever. I can't acquire it or transmit it. My wife had it. We've seen people get the jab and have worse reactions.

Our nation's health services are garbage. The vaccines likely the same. Long-term effects? Anyone? Sorry, they're unknown.

No, I don't trust 'the science.' I trust observable results."

Herd immunity has never been about eradicating the virus, it is about making large outbreaks unlikely.

I can't separate out what is the actual science and what is the 'S'cience anymore by listening to alleged experts.  No, I don't believe they are changing based on new information.  They are continuously modifying their messages based on what they want the public response to be.  This works in the short term but erodes credibility in the long term.  That's where we are at now, low credibility.

Those less likely to be vaccinated are also those less likely to believe in science, less likely to believe in climate change, more likely to watch Fox News, and more likely to believe the results of the last election were fraudulent. We all know Trump supporters are THE problem. Hiding this fact does not convince them to get vaccinated. As usual, what is needed is a full transformation of the Republican media ecosystem--something that is necessary to save our world, literally."
2021-05-03 16:37,"The analysis of those who have not yet been vaccinated has been sliced and diced in myriad ways, and the resulting impression I get is that there is no simple answer to boost vaccination rates.  Our attention needs to be focused on figuring out which people are still reachable and reaching them, and spending our time, money and resources on those people.  Those with cult-like allegiance to their refusal (""freedom lovers"", anti-vaxxers, and politically entrenched) won't be easily reached and need to written off without spending another dime on them. Those who are terminally selfish, who fail to see the bigger picture of helping themselves and their fellow man/woman) are unlikely to be moved as well, and the best we can expect is that they get their immunity naturally."

2021-05-03 16:56,"It is so frustrating to hear news outlets describe the choice to get vaccinated as a ""personal decision"" when it is exactly the opposite of that. 

One has no way of knowing who else will be impacted if and when you catch the virus, however mildly. Each death in this pandemic can be traced back to a long string of infections that could have been broken had someone in that string been vaccinated. If you choose to not get vaccinated you are choosing to be a conduit for more deaths."

For me, it not only defies logic not to get life-saving shots in our arms, but also it is almost medieval for Americans to refuse these inoculations, especially because of either political or religious ideologies.  Is it the lack of education, a form of ignorance, pride and hubris, a sense that we are invulnerable?  Perhaps, it is ""all of the above.""

Although scientifically sound, the reasoning is so convoluted that the majority of the American population will not get it, or, rather, will not be able to follow it with enough conviction to change their behavior and get vaccinated.

After reading this, I am starting to have that sinking feeling that we will continue to run around forever wearing masks, piling unimaginable damage onto our society and emotional well-being.  I am starting to see a dystopian society developing.

Yes, there was no question from the very start that this virus will become endemic and that we will have to give it time to adapt to the population as a whole. But we can do this the hard way or the easy way.  The easy way requires rapid immunization and adapting the vaccines whenever new variants arise, minus taking the better part of a year for new clinical trials!  Just adapt the vaccine, then go!"

Offer free concert tickets, seats at a baseball or football game, movie tickets, dinners, whatever it takes."

Even small risks make these places--without masking and distancing--unattractive even to those who've gotten vaccinated (especially those who are older).  And because COVID is already mutating (and will continue to do so) in ways that make it more contagious, other indoor activities will probably also become riskier over time.  The author doesn't address the profound economic implications of this change of attitude among experts."

2021-05-03 15:49,"One important element that must not be ignored is the fact that both in Europe and around these parts is, the increasing dominance of the  UK and other variants among ongoing new infections in which it has shown it is more contagious and is attacking proportianetly the under 50 demographic with avengence and they are getting sicker.

The fact that 30% of Americans choose not to get vaccinated could make this more problematic and a re-surgence could actually occur especially in Trumpist/republican states where continued testing numbers are questionable.  We still don't know what the long-term immunity is in those that have been vaccinated and when one considers those  that won't, the ""mythical"" herd immunity will be just that, ""mythical""."
2021-05-03 16:11,"The numbers are headed overall in the right direction, yet, for some reason and for some time now, we have not seen how much testing is still being done especially in Trump/republican states who have had the tendency to underplay the seriousness of the disease along with  a rather significant portion of the population whom are not getting vaccinated anyway.

Vaccines are good, however, if such a large number are not getting vaccinated and not getting tested because they still believe Covid-19 is a hoax, one has to look at those case and death numbers with a ""Spockian eyebrow""."

There is not one person in this country that could persuade 80% of Americans to do something.  I am not happy about it but that is the history of this country and the world.  We must just do our best for self, family, friends, and others but not expect 80% agreement on anything in life.  Some of the tough talk I read in the comments shows me why no 80% on anything."
2021-05-03 17:00,"Why wouldn't we get herd immunity, combining the vaccinated and those who catch the disease?  

Since it is highly contagious with different strains targeting different age groups, won't most people who don't get vaccinated eventually catch Covid, resulting in eventual herd immunity?"
2021-05-03 16:25,"We've been told about 'herd immunity' since the pandemic began, but we've never been told what it means.   Voltaire would be disappointed.

We have, of course, been given percentages, but never told what those percentages mean.  Do they mean that once we reach those percentages, the disease will disappear?  Or do they merely mean that once we reach those percentages, the disease will diminish proportionally (to an 'acceptable level,' whatever that might be)?  Is there really any threshold here at all, or is it a 'sliding scale'?

Beyond that, while the headline says that ""experts"" say herd immunity is unlikely, the article quotes only one expert as saying that.

It's obvious that we won't stop this pandemic until we stop it everywhere. It's also obvious that vaccination is the best way to do it.  But when does it cease to be a pandemic?"
2021-05-03 16:31,How common is this view point about never achieving herd immunity? I literally just read in an AAMC article that with natural infections and vaccinations we would be about 3 months out. Now this? It feels like whiplash.

This article contains exactly one sentence about the most significant threat posed by the virus, dismissing it because ""[long covid cases] are unlikely to overwhelm the health care system."" Gee, I'm sure the (millions of?) people who will never taste food for the rest of their lives or who can't walk more than 100 feet without being winded will be happy to know that the health care system isn't ""overwhelmed."" There's just no version of Covid, if it continues to produce these effects, where it can be treated, per Dr. Lipsitch, as a ""regular infectious disease."" Regular infectious diseases don't do what Covid does."
2021-05-03 15:48,"I advocate that insurance companies, medical providers, and funeral services charge more for services if the client was able to medically tolerate a vaccination and chose to not get one. Sporting events, the entertainment industry, airlines, resorts, etc, should also provide discounts for those vaccinated or ideally restrict opportunities to those who are vaccinated (with the exception being those who cannot medically tolerate a vaccination). If one has high cholesterol they have to pay more to carry insurance or make strides to address the concern through diet, exercise, or medication. If one choses not to get vaccinated you should have a steep premium or copay and perhaps an inability to get inexpensive life insurance (like smokers)."
2021-05-03 16:08,"In reality, I think this was always the most likely outcome: given that Covid-19 became a partisan political issue in the US, we were never going to eradicate the virus the way, say, polio was eradicated. 

That might've been possible if we'd had consistent messaging from the beginning, better compliance with social distancing rules, mayors and governors who showed leadership rather than caved in pressure from local businesses, school districts that waited until families were fully vaccinated before re-opening in-person instruction, and a populace that didn't include 30-40 % of people who believe their government is being run by lizard people from space.

But, alas, here we are, and the virus is now a permanent part of our lives. If we're lucky, it will evolve in the same way the Spanish flu did, becoming less deadly over time, and we'll be able to develop effective vaccines against the new variants and make them available quickly enough to prevent another year like 2020.

But none of that is a given. The virus could become more deadly. Or it could develop into a strain that is impervious to vaccines. Or we might elect another president who portrays the resurgent pandemic as a hoax perpetrated by his political enemies and refuses to lift a finger to help. Or all three. 

Which is why it would've been good to take it out of circulation when we had the chance. But we didn't."
2021-05-03 16:44,"There's a lot of clutching at pearls going on. Herd immunity is not an on or off switch. A high number of vaccinations will end this epidemic, one way or another, with the high number of people who have had the disease as well. That's good. We will have something to celebrate.  

So why trot out the gloom? I don't blame the ""experts"" for encouraging everyone to get vaccinated. They should get vaccinated, the sooner the better. But to moan and groan about failure to reach a nirvana of herd immunity is going too far."
2021-05-03 16:08,"We can't mandate vaccines for everyone. But we can mandate them for school, employers can mandate them. They can be mandated for airline or train travel. We can make it extremely inconvenient for those not vaccinated, and we should. Only those with valid medical reasons should be excused and those reasons should be vetted by health departments so people can't just pay to have a medical excuse."
2021-05-03 16:10,"I just shared this article with the students in my Mathematical Biology class, where we are studying epidemiological models. We then looked at a model of the spread of influenza, in which vaccinating just 15 percent of the population cut the number of cases of the flu in half. I'd like to see similar estimates for Covid. How many cases can we eliminate by vaccinating 40 percent of the population? 50 percent? Even without the hope of eradicating the disease, maybe we could convince people that pushing the vaccinated fraction of society just a little higher is still worthwhile."
2021-05-03 16:46,"If Americans aren't ready and willing to get vaccinated right now, then we need to share our supply with the world. And we need a temporary stop on the patent protections that may be inhibiting other countries from mass production. This is all for our own good, as the more people in the world who get vaccinated, the lesser the chance that COVID-19 mutates into something that acts like it concerning transmission (very contagious, including 48 hours before symptoms start) but has sickness and death impact like SARS or MERS. Protection with vaccination must be worldwide, not just nationally or state-by-state. Sharing protects us all."
2021-05-03 16:49,"I am saddened by the dichotomy between the United States, via a technological tour de force, creating the best vaccines in the world, and the United States citizens, via an astonishing display of distrust in ""expertise"" and lack of consideration for others, opting not to take these same vaccines. Even worse, I am not in the least surprised by this outcome. It is a continuing evolution of decades-long trends, and the endpoint is not good for our country."
2021-05-03 16:26,"It's in everyone's interest to get infections down everywhere in the world to reduce the risk of harmful mutations. Each time someone is infected, there is a chance for mutations; that multiplies by the number of infections. 
Our best bet to safely reducing infections is vaccination. Each time a person is vaccinated, the risk of that person getting sick or dying is greatly reduced and so is that chance for a harmful variant to arise."
2021-05-03 16:51,"The herd immunity scenario was problematic from the start.  It depended on the virus being very genetically stable and unrealistic vaccination rates happening worldwide.  I think many people early on though that the vast majority of people were catching it and not having any symptoms while developing immunity and with that inaccurate picture, herd immunity seemed more possible.  It turns out the disease is more normal than that and will end up being something like another flu hanging around out there to get us and once everyone has some sort of immunity, either from having the disease previously or from a vaccine or both, it will be, finally, like the conservatives said, like the flu or hopefully, like a cold.   Unfortunately it will remain a threat to anyone with a compromised immune system."
2021-05-03 16:20,"My conservative nephew wants to be married in Las Vegas this coming fall.  Neither he nor his even more conservative father are vaccinated.  I would love to attend but hesitate.  I would like my children and their children to attend, but if there are nonvaxxers there, it’s too dangerous. Friends have invited me to see them in another state.  I want to fly, not drive, but there again are the nonvaxxers to contend with at airports, in planes and shuttles.  Possibly I won’t go.  While I’m vaccinated there is a small risk of getting sick, and while the case may be mile, there could still be long-haul effects.  Caution is necessary.  I think a lot of other people feel the same way.  This summer, vacation plans will be different, more localized.  People that do travel are going on shorter trips, being more discerning about where they stay.  And, as people move about more in the summer,  I suspect infections will rise, but by a smaller amount since more people have been vaccinated.

What I do and how I view people has been greatly affected by the virus.  We seem to be in a perpetual state of lockdown.  I understand people with underlying conditions not wanting the vaccine until more testing is done on people with their problems, but just refusing endangers everyone.  Maybe these people should move to states or counties that already have low vaccine rates, then the rest of us could move more freely, have more relaxed lives."
2021-05-03 16:22,"The unvaccinated but immune from a subclinical infection have yet been enumerated by antibody testing of a large representative segment of our not vaccinated population.
Until that is done and children are immunized an accurate statement about the percentage of people who are immune cannot be made.
If the vaccine deniers are close to 15% immune and if we can vaccinate  close to 60% of the rest we can be very close to what has been called herd immunity.
But this virus is very infectious, like measles, and populations are very mobile so  there is always going to some risk, albeit very small, of local outbreaks."
2021-05-03 16:23,"To the vaccine hestitant: Your immunocompromised friends, neighbors and coworkers are begging you to get vaccinated. Unlike most of the population, the vaccine does not give 95% protection to the immunocompromised -- it's a much lower level. 

Of course, most of us are now vaccinated and grateful for any level of protection. But we didn't choose to have cancer, organ transplants or any of the multitude of autoimmune illnesses that make us immunocompromised. 

But you can choose to help us by getting vaccinated. As long as Covid continues to circulate because healthy people won't get vaccinated, we remain at an even higher risk of illness and death.

The true test of morality as how we treat the most vulnerable in our society. Getting a vaccine for the greater good is one of those tests.

We're not asking you to sacrifice as much as the ""Greatest Generation"" was asked during World War II. This is a small ask, and one we hope you will be willing to make for your country."

""A better approach would be for a trusted figure to address the root cause of the hesitancy — fear, mistrust, misconceptions, ease of access or a desire for more information ...""

That'll help. But what would really incentivize inoculation is an official vaccine passport which would allow the vaccinated, and only the vaccinated, to participate in certain activities. We're loath in this country to grant our governments this sort of power, but there's nothing stopping private business from mandating passports to use their services. (I don't think this'll happen, but this is what it would probably take to get us to herd immunity.)"

I have a history of neurological attacks being provoked by pharma and surgery etc.  My history has been a devastating MS like attack  every 3 years-- with long recoveries and not back to baseline.  I took pfizer shot 1 a week ago after talking with all my doctors. I had an immediate neurological reaction which so far has not subsided.  I don't think I can get the next shot or regular vaccination.  I also have low immunoglobulins and low WBC, so I 'm not sure even with the shots I will develop immunity.  The future looks really bleak for people like myself.  I honestly wished I lived in NZ or Australia right now and had some future.  Right now with so many refusing vaccination and even wearing face masks I feel I have a very bleak future living in the USA."

Do you think people will say that that 61000 deaths from covid-19 is just nothing? Probably not, they will continue to say that people should social distance, wear masks, etc. to avoid it. As for me, I don't agree that permanently fearing illness is a sane way to live. I don't want to live in this society where other people are only seen as a source of contamination. This society is not humane."
2021-05-03 13:58,"Rushing to vaccinate children (whom are at even lower risk from serious complications than seasonal flu, drowning in a pool, etc) is abhorrent. Let's be honest- the primary reason for vaccinating kids is to assuage the fears of adults. 

Nearly 1 out of every 3 American' has already recovered from the virus. Naturally conferred immunity is likely more robust than the vaccine induced variety. 

Vaccine passports are ill conceived and unconstitutional."

2021-05-03 14:07,"I’m really sick and tired of the doom and gloom messaging out of the New York Times and other outlets recently. You guys will do this on every issue. When the J&J vaccine was pulled (where one in one million people got adverse side affects) I got a thousand notifications, tweets, and articles from the Times and it’s writers. Now this new report is out about herd immunity and it’s getting plastered everywhere. The same amount of notifications, tweets, articles. 

Why does the Times really want to whip Americans up into a frenzy? Why come out with such a doom and gloom headline? 

There is no nuance in a title that says “experts think it’s unlikely that the U.S. will reach herd immunity anytime soon…or perhaps ever.” What is the point of a title like that except to frighten people.

The media is no longer in the business of reporting facts, nor are they an institution predicated upon the betterment of society. They are merely intended to stoke the flames and frighten their readers. This is on all sides. Fox News, CNN, NYT, WSJ - everyone is guilty. 

Wait a couple more weeks for the vaccination rates to go up and for the scientific consensus to change, and then the Times will be out with a new report about the safety of vaccines, trying to skew nervousness and fear the other way. 

Whatever it takes to make a buck. Unreal."
2021-05-03 14:47,"Let us not forget, it is not just this pandemic we are fighting. There will be another, and another ... We may have lost the fight for herd immunity on this one, but let us not repeat it. I think that means we need to win the fight against anti-vaxxers. I'm afraid it's optimistic to think education can get us all the way there.

We also need to recognize because not enough of us would wear masks soon enough especially in social situations and because not enough of us are willing to be vaccinated we are suffering. Certainly Trump's misinformation and poor actions mean we have already killed more than 100,000 Americans. Even though he is out of power, Trump's past statements and lack of effective leadership mean many many more Americans will die as a result.

One day its masks and we all shouldn't get masks even though it's just as easy to use a bandana as a face covering, but he didn't promote that as a way of lessening competition for masks with frontline workers. 

Today it's about herd immunity, and if you're not vaccinated you're probably some sort of Typhoid Mary. Fact is, if the best vaccine is only 95% effective then maybe 50,000 of every million of us can get sick, hospitalized, or dead - after getting vaccinated.  

Last year it was reported that you can multiply the number of reported cases by 8 to get an approximation of those infected with Covid. Therefore one can also speculate that every American has potentially been infected and asymptomatic. We're the lucky ones. As they say.. ""The bad weeds never die"".  We just get a little fatigue and move on.

One may argue that those who didn't get tested and weren't ever getting tested again after having a swab shoved into their skull may have been infected afterward and are likely contributing to herd immunity but are not counted into the herd immunity equation since they're unvaccinated. In essence these infected folks are saying, I got the bug and I'm immune and thank goodness I didn't get too sick or die.

And, of course, the risks for those who are vaccinated are even less.

And what about variants? I'll happily take a booster if/when they are necessary. It does seem like a hopeful note, however, that Israel and the UK seem to be controlling variants with current vaccines.

I could lose or not even land a job by testing positive for marijuana, with the pretext of my not being able to do my job or that it is a gateway drug (a very questionable theory, at best). Marijuana is minimally harmful, and symptoms from its' use are not transmissible. Covid is not only transmissible, but highly transmissible, and in many cases the transmission of Covid will be deadly. Is it possible that the law which allows us to be forced to submit urine tests to determine whether we have THC in our bodies somehow is too invasive to force people to be vaccinated? At the very least employers should force employees to be vaccinated or to be tested daily and show negative results as a condition of employment. That would more effectively help us reach herd immunity. I'm a bit tired of mentally challenged people telling me they have the freedom to place my life in danger because they feel wearing a mask is an intrusion on their free-dumb, and who refuse to be vaccinated."

2021-05-03 17:52,"“New York and its neighbors, New Jersey and Connecticut, will welcome back crowds on May 19, state officials said Monday, a major step for a region that was once an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic.

Restaurants, offices, retail stores, theaters, museums, barber shops, amusement parks and gyms and fitness centers will all be allowed to operate at full capacity for the first time since restrictions were adopted last year to prevent the spread of the virus.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced the easing of pandemic restrictions on Monday as part of broader efforts to increase economic activities, including lifting curfews for food and beverage service. New York City will also return to 24-hour subway service on May 17.

... Businesses in New York will still have to abide by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s social distancing guidelines, which require a minimum of six feet of space between individuals.

So the size of crowds will still be limited by space constraints, but businesses won’t need to abide by the six-foot rule if they require that all individuals present proof of full vaccination or a negative coronavirus test result, Mr. Cuomo said. Restaurants can also get around the six-foot rule by erecting barriers between tables.

For people who have received the vaccine, Mr. Cuomo said, ‘life should be returning to normal. You’re vaccinated. And it’s an incentive to be vaccinated.’”

Get vaccinated for yourself and for everyone else!"

Our people bicker about the ""loss of personal freedom"" in simply being asked to wear a mask indoors when you cannot distance while cities such as London have been COMPLETELY shut down and only had one day to celebrate Christmas with their families.

I have one friend who I would describe as a Covid vaccine skeptic but not an anti-vaxxer. She worries that something will happen down the road after taking it because it was approved so quickly. She does not want a lecture from me on how the vaccines were made and tested vs. the severe effects from a bad Covid infection (or death). Some people are going to need a trusted source to explain this info. To outline the origins of the vaccine, that they weren't new, the solid large scale studies behind them.

Sometimes your individual freedom (to cut of your nose, to spite your face) must give way to the public interest.

The fact that the government is refusing to take responsibility for the situation, because they would take a political hit for doing more to encourage vaccination, is really disgusting.

Also, the idea that the virus will become weaker over time is nonsense. The virus has been getting more dangerous, not less. Herd immunity has to happen, or we are just setting ourselves up for a greater disaster down the road.

2021-05-03 16:57,"From the comments:

""It’s my body my choice. What’s so hard about this concept?""

Even after a year of health experts explaining the logic of vaccines, many people still don't get it.

Your choice affects MORE THAN YOU.   How hard is that to understand?

When you don't get vaccinated you are more likely to be a carrier of the virus to infect other people (not only the many susceptible, but even the vaccinated to a degree).   And you offer the virus yet another body in which to replicate and possibly mutate to a new more dangerous variant, prolonging the epidemic.  It's only all over the news every day.

Imagine being part of a crew in a giant old ship operated by everyone rowing oars.  A massive storm is coming and the only way to avoid the ship being swamped and sinking is to row the boat out of the path of the storm as fast as possible.  No one is being physically forced to row, but clearly the fate of everyone is tied to working together.

But you fold your arms and say ""You all can choose to row.   But I don't want to row.  My body, my choice. I'm expressing my personal freedom.""

The more people who take that position, the more the entire ship is imperiled.   That person just freeloads on the efforts of those who step up and row everyone to safety.  It's selfishness and short-sightedness masquerading as ""freedom.""   Who wants to be ""that person?""

Apparently many.   

The position isn't mere ignorance: it seems born of selfish inattention to inconvenient facts."
2021-05-03 17:45,"The more people who serve as “hosts” for the virus, the more opportunity the virus has to mutate into deadlier and more transmissible forms.

If “herd immunity” is to be achieved, 80-90% of the population needs to achieve immunity quickly, and theoretically, all at the same time, limiting the opportunities for the virus to mutate. It needs to be achieved before the first immune person loses his/her immunity and reverts to being just another non-immune potential host for a virus that is constantly changing.

Sadly, it now appears that any sort of herd immunity is unlikely to occur. Sadly, it now appears that we are not going to see a return to pre-pandemic life. Sadly, for the foreseeable future, the simple acts of going to a grocery store, eating in a restaurant, or having repairs done on our homes, will require a risk benefit analysis that includes the risk of Covid-19, added to the risks of crossing the street, driving a car, eating food prepared by an anonymous cook, letting people into our homes, etc. The Covid-19 risk is greater than all the others, and should weigh most heavily in that analysis.

Those who stoked the fires of anti-vaxism (vaccination deniers in Congress and the real Fake News, I’m looking at you), and those who got vaccinated and yet refused in any meaningful way to encourage their followers to get vaccinated (Former Guy, I’m looking at you) have the blood of hundreds of thousands on their hands today, and God-knows how many more in the future."

2021-05-03 17:04,"Herd immunity is a statistical concept, not an absolute. The classical formula for calculating a herd immunity threshold (HIT) is 1–1/R0, where R0 is the number of people each infected person infects. Covid19 and variants are estimated to have an R0 of 2.5 to 4, so the HIT is from 60% to 75% of all people immune somehow to the virus.

There are two big problems with this. First, some people will still get infected. Herd immunity just makes it unlikely for infections to trigger another epidemic. Second, immunity (i.e., vaccination) is unevenly distributed across the country and world. An overall average immunity in a region of 75% could occur with some subregions much lower than that, and some subregions higher. Epidemics could still occur in low-immunity subregions in spite of achieving the HIT for the region as a whole."
2021-05-03 16:09,"Though the US is clearly a different animal, it should be noted that Israel has likely reached herd immunity as over 60% of the population is fully vaccinated and 80% of those over 60 are vaccinated with another 20% of the population having been infected.

This is absolutely crazy. Ok, a government mandate may backfire, but employers can do whatever they want. Conservatives have been fighting tooth and nail for them to have that power. It's time they use it NOW, to protect all their employees by mandating vaccination. All of us rational people should be demanding this from our workplaces. Private businesses should be allowed to, and be willing to serve only vaccinated people. I'll go to a restaurant that demands vaccination, I will not go to one that doesn't.

This allowed unregulated vaccines to be used under FDA Emergency Use Authority. It also allowed state governors to proceed with lockdowns, school closures etc.

If there's no more ""medical emergency"" than this legal authority will end.

This level of intrusion into our fundamental rights has never been tested in the courts. While courts have acknowledged that the states have general authority under the constitution to impose a variety of ""public health"" measures, they have never reviewed the science to determine if the state's conclusion that there is an emergency is supported by the facts.

Unfortunately, the only way to have an open and honest debate about where we are and what's the best way forward is through litigation where the public can hear from all relevant experts, not only those who have orchestrated our existing incompetent response.

2021-05-03 16:13,"What a thoroughly depressing article to read on this Monday morning. It literally boggles my mind that people would choose to take their chances with this new, capricious virus that has killed and sickened so many people around the world (young and old) than take a vaccine that has proven to be safe and effective. Thanks a lot, anti-vaxxers."
2021-05-03 16:58,"I’ve been scrolling through these comments for a while now, looking for a well stated anti-vaccine argument. The many pro-vaccine, pro-science, pro-responsible citizenship comments I’ve read frequently cite various percentage values as being the fraction of the general public who are “anti-vaccine.”
The numbers vary, but it’s always a LOT of people.

1500 commenters to this article have clearly stated the case FOR getting vaccinated.
If you anti-vaxers have an argument, one you’re not ashamed of, why not expound on your well-considered opinion?"
2021-05-03 17:40,"People who refuse to be vaccinated are a menace to us all. Their actions will keep this devastating virus circulating among us for years to come. For their selfish, irrational and obstinate refusal to act for the good of us all, they should be ashamed of themselves. 

Herd immunity can be achieved through two methods: by mass vaccination, which is far preferable and confers the greatest and most effective type of immunity, or by mass infection which will trigger the development of antibodies, albeit inferior ones when compared to those developed through vaccination.

For those who irrationally refuse to be vaccinated for their own or the public's good, I suggest you gather together indoors in massive numbers without masks and socialize with each other shoulder-to-shoulder. 

In short, if you refuse to protect yourself and others by being vaccinated, then the least you can due is contribute to herd immunity through the second aforementioned method."
2021-05-03 17:11,"As Mark Twain said, it is truly remarkable what an American with a little bit of confidence and a great deal of ignorance can achieve.

In this case, herd immunity is impossible for us to achieve because we have too many confident, and ignorant, Americans resisting wearing masks and resisting getting vaccinated.

In the long run, we need to each of us take care of ourselves and make sure we can elect representatives and a president who consult science and tell the truth.   

That likely means getting booster shots every six months or so.  No big deal.

And, in the long run, Republicans may be expected to cancel themselves with higher infection and death rates from covid and it's mutated forms.  

No big deal, either.  They want to be free."

Get vaccinated or stay home."
2021-05-03 16:53,"You'll never get herd immunity while their is a flow of people traffickers through your borders with land locked countries. That's how those new variants of the original covid-19 virus get into the nation; and they spread about 70 times faster and the experts don't know if they are resistant to the vaccine. Those new variants; especially the Indian one, affects young people and babies as well, as some babies have ended up in Indian hospitals with the new Indian variant of the virus.
Are there any land locked nations in the world who are controlling the virus and getting to herd immunity or are the borders still open to illegals who can bring new variants into the nation."
2021-05-03 16:01,"I don't think our planet can support 7.8 billion humans. Covid has the potential to mutate a lot more than it has. Each new variant appears more virulent than the original. The one in India is killing a lot of people really fast. It just needs a foot hold in another country, a few individuals, and thousands will die. It's a race between vaccine and virus. Usually the vaccine wins. I'm not so sure this time. This is like the Great Plagues in Europe. Men going up and down streets yelling, Bring out your dead. I think those plagues reduced Europe's population so much, it raised basic labour wages a lot. No one is willing to go to India to study this new variant. It would be a suicide mission. Your vaccine shots won't help."

2021-05-03 16:55,"I think that (eventually) covid will become a nasty version of one of the flu viruses that circulate every winter. If viruses just continued to get more and more deadly with time, we'd be having waves of vaccine-proof measles, mumps, whooping cough, polio etc. decimating the population every few years. The virus's best long-term strategy is to infect a lot of people and not kill them. 

That said, there will be jobs for budding virologists for years to come. Also, thanks to DJT and religious fundamentalism, this seems to be a virus that preferentially targets conservatives, at least for now. Republicans have effectively targeted their base. Given that many of the last elections have been down to the wire, I imagine we may see a (slight) leftward shift in politics."

That's why the flu vaccine isn't mandated."

2021-05-03 17:10,"""The virus is here to stay, but vaccinating the most vulnerable MAY BE enough to restore normalcy.""--NYT

I used to wonder what the word ""normalizing"" meant. The Trump years and their devastating legacy have taught me viscerally and vividly exactly what it means to take the unacceptable, the deviant, the dangerous, the outrageous and deplorable and through a cascading series of events and through the use of ameliorating language normalize them.

The culpability does not reside solely with outlets like FOX and the more obvious culprits. The entire media has been complicit in constantly invoking language designed to excuse, contain, and downplay the full extent of how out of control this nation is.

The line I quoted perfectly encapsulates what I mean. What would previous generations who suffered pandemics have given to have had within their means the capability of ending the suffering? Instead of hitting that head on, the NYT adds an anemic, mealy-mouthed apologia suggesting that we should rest content that we ***might*** luck out and ""restore normalcy."" MIGHT.

On the other hand, witnessing the horror in India, Nepal, Brazil, Mexico, and innumerable other places we may in fact have given the selfish brats among us the capacity to ensure that this virus mutates in ways that explode, imperiling billions. 

If we don't even have the courage to voice the magnitude of our errors honestly, how can we ever hope to correct them? Passive aggressive pabulum may just end up doing us in."

To avoid some of the loss of life vaccines must be imposed on those that will not be physically harmed by a vaccine.

I know it's not popular, but we invite a complete breakdown of society in the world and perhaps even extinction of the human race if this pandemic is allowed to spiral any more out of control.

Vaccines have given America a temporary reprieve from the pandemic, but it's only temporary unless the rest of the world including those remaining unvaccinated in America get vaccinated.

We drive on the right-hand side of the road. We stop at red lights and stop signs. Individual opinion as to whether we agree with these practices counts for nothing at all.

Make no mistake, it was Trump who made believing and acting on wild conspiracy theories ok, and we suffer the consequences now.
Come August, everyone had ample margin to get a vaccine. I will no longer restrict my actions at that point. I have had it.
As for Massachusetts: 90+% of people plan to get fully vaccinated, great. Mr. Baker, demand a vaccination passport.

We are but a planet revolving around a very modest star in a universe of billions of stars. The scientific view of viruses and how they work is not understood by the vast majority of people.

2. hospitality: no vaccine card, no hotel stay, resaurant, bar admission
3. education, no vaccine card, no in-person education just as most public schools require a longish list of vaccinations
4. the office: no vaccine card, no in-person work, perhaps no work, period.

They were not all Republicans but they did not trust medical professionals, Democratic politicians, and so-called elites. Some had had COVID-19 and had mild symptoms. All of them were reluctant to take the vaccine because of its experimental nature and felt that their immune systems were strong enough to withstand Covid. That they have no regard for other people whose immune systems are not so strong, or are at risk because of age or infirmity, is depressing. We are not the United States, we are a nation of disunited, fractious, selfish individuals, and I fear we will pay a price for this.

And they won't expect that it could happen to them so they won't take any precautions.

The complete botch of a coordinated global vaccination campaign already ensured that we'll be living with virus variants for years to come. The extremely high transmissibility of COVID-19, already evident in the Diamond Princess episode, should have made the experts realize herd immunity through 86%+ vaccination would be infeasible. Now we just have to cross our fingers and hope a MERS-esque mutation won't crop up with 70% mortality."
2021-05-03 17:07,"Reportedly, the main barrier to make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory in public institutions is that the vaccines’ approval was issued on an ‘ emergency’ basis instead of a ‘full approval’ due to the limited experience with the vaccine at the time.  Several hundred million vaccines have been given in the US and worldwide, their safety and effectiveness have been proven. Therefore, the official FDA approval of the vaccines can surely be changed to ‘full approval’ now. This would allow to make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory in the military (as all other vaccines are), for first responders, teachers, students, health care providers, transportation and public employees. Private institutions and companies would likely follow this public health measure.  Overall, a simple change in the FDA label of the vaccine approval would rapidly decrease the ‘hesitancy’ rate and de-politicize the vaccine.
The FDA should also accelerate the approval of the vaccine for 12-16 years old, since they’ve had the trials’ results for weeks now.
Lastly, health care providers should document their patients’ acceptance or refusal of the vaccine, so that explicit refusal might impact their individual health care cost accordingly in the future."
2021-05-03 17:07,"I think the vaccine should be mandatory. There’s a good reason we require children get for school. This is a greater good issue and not the time for selfishness.

There are three categories to consider, not two.

2. Those who have immunity as a result of coming down with Covid-19.

3. Those who have a natural immunity.

Category 1 is the only category we have good data for."
2021-05-03 17:28,"Logically one would think that viruses would mutate into worse variants. In our experience, though, they don't. Epidemics rage and then die out. That's Farr's law of epidemics. 

This idea of a race between the vaccines and the variants seems hoopla rather than scientific. Forcing people to get vaccinated against their will has never been done in this country. We should not start now."
2021-05-03 17:31,"The government is doing nowhere near what it could to get the reluctant to move. Ads should be incessant on social media, radio and television. Vaccine tents should be set up in all high need neighborhoods. People should be offered cash to get vaccinated. It's not rocket science, it's just basic mobilization."
2021-05-03 17:43,"While the pessimism is totally warranted, I have yet to see large studies addressing to what degree variants cause vaccines to underperform and if heard immunity is impossible to achieve with them even if enough people get vaccinated. Even though we have seen a lot of variants, as far as we can tell many of these variants are similar in how they are dissimilar from the original strain, often the difference being subtle alterations of the spike protein that can help the virus latch on. Without more explicit evidence, so going on the assumption that from our best vaccines available, we still get sufficiently high efficacy combined with the fact that the virus can only beneficially mutate in a small number of ways (at least phenotypically), we should expect our vaccines to give us heard immunity on say a 10 year timeline caveating for lasting immunity and eventual innoculation of hesitant populations in this timeframe. The reason being is that in order for the virus to look radically different so as to evade the vaccine effectively enough it might need to aquire say 10 of these subtle mutations which should take 10 times longer than it did to aquire just 1 mutation, where infection rates are taken to be equal. If we can develop vaccines or boosters that are simultaneously highly effective against these year 1 mutations (so to speak) then perhaps this will give us a 10 year timeline to convince people to get vaccinated and eliminate the disease."
2021-05-03 17:15,"What I am going to say/write here will no doubt irritate or provoke hostility.  Perhaps the most tricky issue in all this is that we really don't know enough about this virus.  Yes, much research and thinking have led to a few ""answers"" -- although I would call them theories/hypotheses/educated guesses.  We simply don't know.  Hence the skepticism among many about vaccines.  I don't condone it, I merely point this out as a factor.  Those in research are working diligently at figuring things out, but the contradictory information given by leaders (i.e., the other guy and his team) and scientists creates holes in the narrative of Covid.  Vaccines have allowed the human race to persist in the face of devastating disease.  We are imperfect and finding a ""perfect"" solution which covers all the bases is seemingly impossible. Lumping everyone together, as in ""herd"", does not help.  We are indeed animals as well as sentient creatures, and those traits seem to have come out in force during this immensely difficult time."
2021-05-03 17:43,"I’m vaccinated, a trained public health professional, and chronically ill. Getting Covid would still undoubtedly worsen my existing neurological and cardiac dysfunction regardless of whether I’m protected from “severe illness.” My (privileged, white) healthy friends and family increasingly call me out for being unwilling to reduce my precautions, which are all evidence-based. But those who aren’t already disabled take their health for granted, always assuming it won’t happen to them. My sister-in-law refused to be vaccinated because it might ruin her vacation. At this point, I can hardly fathom engaging with her or anyone else who refuses vaccination for any reason other than a legitimate medical excuse (severe allergy, etc,). I’ve essentially made peace with the fact that I’m going to be wearing a mask for the long haul and that I can’t trust others to act in my best interest."
2021-05-03 17:28,"I'd like to suggest a different color scheme for the U.S. map. Make it blue-to-red for more-to-less likely to be vaccinated. Then put it next to a party affiliation blue-to-red color-map. There are other reasons for vaccine hesitancy, but that correlation stands out. It should be a point of pride for both parties, given their diametrically opposed leadership, ideologies, and levels of concern for human health and dignity."
2021-05-03 17:36,"More and more colleges and universities will require the vaccine. This will push the rate up, but sadly not enough."
2021-05-03 17:09,"Here in Canada we have socialized medical insurance so no provider carrots or sticks for anti-vaxxers - but in the USA?  No luck finding any information with Google, but I'd be surprised if insurance applications and premiums for private coverage don't start reflecting the enhanced risks of coverage for the deniers.  Aren't US insurance subscribers anticipating either premium reductions for proof of vax on policy application or renewal?"
2021-05-03 17:39,"We require school-age children to attend school.  We require that students receive the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine in order to attend school.  Many colleges and universities (including mine) will require that students, faculty, and staff all be vaccinated by Fall term.  Every company, large and small, where people work in close proximity to others - either other workers or the public - can require that workers be vaccinated. These measures will get us a lot closer to herd immunity."
2021-05-03 17:18,"If all this is true, and I feel confident it is, then the real issue we should be researching is the effect of vaccines on long Covid.  Long Covid does not seem to be associated specifically with severe disease, but long Covid from mild disease may be a worse outcome than being hospitalized with severe Covid and then recovering completely.  It involves months - and possibly years - of debilitating symptoms that in many cases prevent work and a normal life. I get annoyed when people talk like minimizing hospitalizations and severe disease is solving the problem. Without a better understanding of long Covid, we don't solve the pandemic."
2021-05-03 17:26,"If the only people they were hurting were themselves, then I'd have no problem with those who refuse to get vaccinated. But they are hurting others. There are some people who have medical conditions that make it impossible for them to receive vaccines. At this point, children and young teens cannot yet be vaccinated. These groups are put at much higher risk by those who resist vaccination. But perhaps the most troubling thing is that the larger the reservoir of potential hosts, the greater the chance that variants will develop: some of those variants may be more contagious, more lethal, and more difficult to control with vaccines. Viruses need hosts in order to replicate; unvaccinated people are providing the covid virus with hosts. I believe very strongly in individual freedom, but that freedom stops when it starts harming others. Unfortunately, the people who are refusing vaccination are putting us all at greater risk."
2021-05-03 17:18,"The sad fact is that the vaccine has become politicized. Down here in Houston, I’ve heard more than my fair share of people sharing their skepticism.

To an extent, it can be justified given the rapid speed the vaccine was released compared to standard timeline of approval which is nearly half a decade. However, science is a progressive movement built on what was previously known. Vaccines are not a revolutionary idea and the study of contagious diseases did not start just last year. What’s been released is hardly the result of mad science.

Unfortunately I don’t see any way of having things change unless the doubters build up their immunity the natural way, long term damage and fatal risks included.

The only way you’re going to see a change is if there’s a financial incentive involved: insurance premium rebates, tax rebates, declined coverage related to covid, etc. The fanaticism of anti vaxxers and contrarian attitude of hardcore conservatives won’t be broken with a few PR campaigns."
2021-05-03 17:44,"Actually the new virus variants may paradoxically make attaining herd immunity even easier exactly BECAUSE they are more contagious!

Herd immunity is both those who have been vaccinated AND those who have been infected- the unvaccinated will likely be more likely to be infected with the new variants- so attaining the needed percent of the population 'easier' - but of course at the cost in morbidity and mortality from these (unnecessary) infections..."

2021-05-03 18:04,"The implication of this article is that we--the US? the world?--should give up on the kind of herd immunity that denies the virus a place to go.  Just because something is hard, doesn't mean it isn't worth attempting.  Countries in Asia, like China, Taiwan, Australia, & New Zealand do well with or without major limits on traditionally American ""freedoms"".

Yet be realistic.  It won't happen without communitarianism taking stronger hold, esp in the US where it's particularly absent.  Carrots and sticks where appropriate and resistance to the morally and intellectually corrupt ReTrumplican party's thrusts must instill the idea that this is an essential public health crisis above all else.  The driving idea is freedom from the virus, not absolute freedom to do whatever the heck I want."
2021-05-03 17:16,"It's a little more complex and a lot less black & white then people are willing to admit. The Pharma Companies haven't exactly earned a reputation for trustworthiness and honesty over forty years. Sheer unmitigated greed yes, Honesty and trustworthiness? In whose delusions? And their kept scientific mouthpieces haven't exactly earned a reputation for honesty or ethics. The problem is folks the track record of the Pharma Corporations make Banks and Used Car salesmen look like paragons of ethics & honesty. Sorry but it's true. The Government's isn't exactly worth a hill of beans or used wad of chewing gum on that front either. 

So in the end? Everyone must make their own decisions. Myself I decided vaccine was less risky FOR ME then the virus would be. But that's a decision everyone must make for themselves. It isn't for everyone else to make for you. The reality is you may believe the science. But does that necessarily mean you believe the Pharma Corporations or the Government? Both of whom are PROVEN LIARS who wouldn't know ethics or morals if they were bitten on the keister by them? For all too many people... That's an awfully tough question."

2021-05-03 17:41,"Although I have not seen any numbers, I think more people will become less hesitant once the vaccines get past ""Emergency Use Authorization"" and get fully authorized.
As I understand it, full authorization (BLA) is almost just paperwork but so far nobody got it from the FDA.
Also as I understand it, flu and pneumonia have full authorization each year (as well as the other standards like MMR which doesn't change) not just EUA.

Not true at all. Australia, NZ, Taiwan etc all have controlled the virus the through public health measures. Oh yeah, China also has done this without vaccines!"

Do these people who have been spending the last year “owning the libs” think we’ve been making these sacrifices in our lives for fun?? 

If herd immunity isn’t achieved and public health mandates and closures are extended the only people that will continue to follow them are those who have done the right thing and have gotten the vaccine and worn their mask, because those who have proven and over and over again that they do not care about their fellow Americans will simply continue to not care and live a normal life while the rest of us are forced to suffer due to their idiocy, oh wait I’m sorry, their “hesitancy”.

2021-05-03 17:52,"O.k., NYT, you did your article on herd immunity. Now put it away and don’t bring it back. If you want vaccine acceptance, herd immunity is not the issue. People aren’t thinking, “Oh I’ve got to get my shot so I can contribute to herd immunity.”  They’re thinking they want to travel and see family and go out again. When you bring herd immunity into it it’s too easy to think, “Oh, let the rest of them get the vaccine. Then we’ll all be protected anyway because of herd immunity.”  Just don’t bring herd immunity into the discussion about vaccines. Preventing deaths, getting the case numbers down, opening up communities, going back to school with all students are the goals. I think herd immunity discussions muddy the waters too much. The message needs to be crystal clear: get the vaccine!"
2021-05-03 18:04,"One billion people have been vaccinated with effectiveness and safety. Israel with an electronic national health system proved beyond a shadow of a doubt for me the Pfizer vaccine is safe and effective. For everyone? Of course not. Nothing is.

2021-05-03 18:10,"As an epidemiologist, every time I see a headline asserting that “we will not get to herd immunity”, it breaks my heart. Herd immunity is the proportion of the population that have acquired immune protection from a pathogen, such that the number of people infected by the pathogen at any given moment is not increasing. The pathogen will still be circulating through pockets of the population, just like measles, mumps, polio, etc. We _will_ get to herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2, the only question is whether we get there the easy way (vaccination) or the hard way (natural infection), with the associated levels of mortality and morbidity that come with COVID-19.

Dr Christopher Carlson"
2021-05-03 17:51,"Perhaps in the effort to encourage more wide-spread vaccination, the NY Times, other media and the medical/scientific community could make more widely known one unfortunate fact: vaccination appears to not work well for persons like myself who are immunocompromised, due to illness or use of immunosuppression drugs. Those of us in this not all that small part of our population (transplant recipients, people with auto-immune dissease, others taking immunosuppression drugs for any reason) are more dependent on others getting vaccinated than we would like to be. I'm fully vaccinated and have my card to prove it....but the vaccination did not induce antibodies in me. Its just like I didn't get the vaccinations at all."
2021-05-03 17:55,"It is not ""your personal choice"" to infect others. You don't have that choice or shouldn't be permitted it. The only answers is mandatory vaccinations. In my small company where I work we are all vaccinated. We no longer will allow anyone to enter our office space without a vaccination card. I do not want to be exposed to someone with Covid because that is ""their personal choice"". My personals choice is to not have to deal with them."
2021-05-03 17:56,Donald Trump needs to come out and say I got vaccinated and you should too. He rushed to get it for his whole family before he left office and of course he didn’t make a big deal about it or a spectacle about it because he got his family vaccinated when they weren’t eligible. But now he should show his republican base its safe and effective. But too bad that will never happen.
2021-05-03 18:04,"What was confusing in this article was the idea that that the experts hope that COVID-19 will become a milder disease that people get during their childhood so that they have better immunity as adults with less severe reactions since their immune system would conceivably be primed, and then another statement saying all children will need to be vaccinated. Those are contradictory ideas. On another note, I have been worried about all the people not willing to take one for the team and get vaccinated. This has been really disappointing. I am connected with a number of people and organizations that have spread all sorts of fear-based messages about vaccines and masks. It's unbelievable. Even in the face of facts and a national crisis they aren't willing to change their belief systems even a smidgen - it's all about protecting their viewpoint of life and profiting and getting more ""likes"" by promoting misinformation. I simply can never look at them the same way again and will never forgive them for making COVID drag on unnecessarily and, it seems, for forever. The pandemic has exposed the great divide between those who think in communal terms and those who practice pure selfishness."
2021-05-03 18:05,I don’t at all understand why vaccines are mandatory for school age children but not for adults. How is vaccines a personal choice?  Is stopping at red lights and not smoking inside restaurants a personal choice too?  Makes no sense and is disappointing. Feel bad for those who can’t get vaccinated because of medical issues.
2021-05-03 15:47,"For those who have followed the science from the get go this is far from news. We will never eradicate COVID. It is destined to become an endemic coronavirus that as the article states, through natural immunity and vaccination will become no different in risk than any other infectious disease we have always lived with. I'll offer some hope here for those that are feeling discouraged from this. A few important things to remember:

1.  The variants, while needing to be monitored, are not the doomsday pandemic restarters the media portrays them as.

2. Immunity from both vaccination and natural infection have been shown to offer lasting robust protection from the virus and its variants.

3.  SARS COV 1 immunity has lasted >11 years. immunity to COVID19 (and it's variants) has lasted as long as we've been able to measure and is expected by the experts to be long lasting.

To me now the question comes down to a calculation of risk and personal tolerance of that risk. As a previously infected individual who is fully vaccinated I am more than comfortable stepping out into a world that still has covid. Each of us now has to start deciding that for ourselves."
2021-05-03 17:13,"You really can't protect everyone who is vulnerable unless you get to herd immunity. We tend to think of the elderly and think now it's ok because they can get vaccinated. Yesterday, I was talking with a friend whose daughter, in her 20s, can't get the vaccine because she has MS. There are many many people who are immunocompromised who can't get the vaccine. This argument is not being made enough. Like with the measles vaccine, where the argument to anti-vaxers was ""your kid should get it to protect kids who can't get it. The anti-vaxers need to hear this. Or maybe they will find out when a family member who has MS or some other disease pays the price."
2021-05-03 17:58,"Which other countries will be able to vaccinate enough people,  because most  citizens accept vaccination? 
Compare restistance to vaccine by country, and compare attitudes to government and to science."
2021-05-03 15:52,"Interesting article, but it may help to be clear that: 
* variants will be induced that undermine vaccination - when there are pockets of people to transmit to in vaccine rich areas.  
* It's the pressure pushing against the current strain that allows variants to outcompete the current one.  

More worrying to me is that the economic and healthcare incentives are aligning to seek to make this disease chronic, so it becomes a revenue stream, just like type 2 diabetes.  

Test and trace would be great prophylactic measures if they are supported by effective quarantining.  But the US has equated quarantine to stay at home and good luck.  It is not clear that there is a strategy to fix that.  

How will large cities be able to operate if this scenario becomes the new reality?  China will have large cities because of lockdowns and effective test, trace and quarantines while the US, which depends on its service economy, will have to convince people they won't get long covid, and if they do that they won't be bankrupted by the healthcare system."
2021-05-03 17:48,"Something that bothers me in Dr. Fauci’s analysis is that even people who haven’t been really seriously ill or hospitalized can still wind up with some version of long Covid. Reducing the overall health of a significant part of the population will put that much more stress on our over already overworked health system. Herd immunity is vital, and every effort should be made to persuade, or if necessary mandate, the entire population to get vaccinated."
2021-05-03 17:52,"Why is there so little mention of long covid? Why are we so sure people with long covid won't overwhelm the health care system? I've been sick for 8+ months with long covid, can't work, can't go to grad school, can't support myself, can't even function day to day (I have continuous migraine and an autonomic system disorder now), and I'm 25 years old and a was earlier a working professional. There are likely hundreds of thousands of others like me, if not millions, and many are still in the phase of not knowing what is going on (long haul can onset several months after an infection, even a minor one). This is a massive public health crisis and a terrifying one. Also, the vaccine triggered such a health flare up for me that I had to go on a two-week steroid taper. I can't do a booster vaccine every six months. What am I, and others like me, supposed to do?"
2021-05-03 17:53,"We understandably place  taxes on items that diminish health such as tobacco products, vaping devices, alcohol etc.  Why would it be so difficult to tax people that do not get vaccinated?  Their unwillingness to comply brings on big costs to everyone else. Incentivization is not at all out of the question whether through rebates or direct taxes."
2021-05-03 17:54,"As a general rule here in the US, when a new vaccine is introduced 1/3 of the public will line up to get it, 1/3 will be more conservative and wait a year or so to see if there are long term side effects, and 1/3 will not get the vaccine under any circumstances. In other words, the public response to the COVID vaccine is completely consistent with past trends and, as such, entirely predictable."
2021-05-03 15:48,"Enough is enough with letting the selfish anti-vaxxers drive the return to normalcy for all.   There should be an immediate high surcharge on health insurance premiums for anyone refusing to be vaccinated when it is available within the next 60 days.  There should be a similar high quarterly federal tax on anyone who continues to refuse to be vaccinated which taxes can go to help defray the tremendous health costs caused by their continuing the pandemic needlessly.  Major chain retailers and shopping clubs should require proof of vaccination to enter their venues, or limit hours of access to the unvaccinated and number of unvaccinated who can be on premises at one time - let them wait in the stand by line to shop.  Airlines and Amtrak and bus lines should do the same.  Gyms should require proof of vaccination to continue memberships.  The cost of continuing the pandemic at this point should be borne by those intentionally refusing to help society to stem its tide.  They can have their ""freedom"" but it should come at a high cost to pay at this juncture.  Society at large should not be paying the price, it is those who refuse to do their part well over one year into this thing who should be."
2021-05-03 17:49,"""Vaccine hesitancy"" is a delicate term that only describes a portion of those who are refusing to get the vaccine.   It does not account for those whose motivation is more accurately described as ""vaccine obstinancy"".  Hesitancy can be addressed; obstinacy is much harder, and may ultimately be successful in ensuring that we all must live with the continuing Covid threat.  America used to be greater than that."
2021-05-03 18:30,"""Natural immunity doesn't last!!!""
""You can get it again!!!""
""We're not sure how long antibodies last!!!""
Such twisting and turning to justify fear.
These ignorant people, uninformed folks who know nothing of the immune system outside of the word ANTIBODIES, remind me of this story:
A man walks down the street.
He has a duck under one arm, a pig under the other arm, and a bucket of water balanced on his head.
As he walks along he sees woman on the road and asks her if she has the correct time.
The woman says, “I’m not talking to you! If I do, you’ll attack me!”
The man says, “Lady, how am I going to attack you? I got a duck under one arm, a pig under the other arm, and a bucket of water on my head.”
The woman looks at him and says, “Well… you can put down the bucket, then put the duck in the bucket, and I can always hold the pig.”

2021-05-03 18:27,"The United States, in my opinion, is presently faced with two major threats to its national security, COVID-19 and Donald J. Trump. COVID-19 has taken well over 500,000 thousand lives, and it continues to wreak havoc on people's health, their livelihoods and the country's economy. While the U.S. has started to flatten the curve for COVID-19, and its economy has begun to show signs of improvement under the Biden administration, the country is far from achieving the state of normalcy the entire country has been long yearning for. Why? Because the U.S. cannot eradicate this virus until 75 - 80 percent of its population has been inoculated. And the major hurdle in achieving that milestone is Donald Trump's lack of support for vaccination. As a result, his supporters, that constitute 30 percent of the American population, refuse to be vaccinated.  To ensure Biden does not get the credit for ending the virus successfully and restoring the economy, Trump will do everything in his power to prevent his supporters from vaccinating despite knowing full well that they could fall prey to this pathogen. That would be the least of his concern. All he cares for is to ensure he wins the next election by erecting roadblocks in Biden's way to fight the virus and improve the American economy. With that in mind, I regard COVID-19 and Donald Trump as the clear and present danger to the safety and security of the United States."
2021-05-03 18:05,"This is the American way.  We were never going to conquer the virus in an absolute manner because of our population size and our commitment to ""freedom,"" even if there were different people in office last year.  At the same time, Pfizer and Moderna are American companies."
2021-05-03 18:26,"I’m vaccinated (two Moderna doses). I understand, however, that one can still contract Covid-19 or a variant but that lethality is unlikely. 

I don’t like to be sick at all, though, if I can help it. So I guess I’ll keep washing my hands and wearing a mask in crowded situations forever. 

I really don’t care, do u?"
2021-05-03 18:38,"Long before a vaccine was developed, ""herd immunity"" was a fantasy because a substantial percentage of Americans didn't want to be bothered nor believed in face coverings.  

If wearing a face mask was too much to ask for or expect, why are we kidding ourselves that folks would actually be proactive and help safeguard themselves and their loved ones against this virus by getting two vaccinations?

I've always believed that in times of a dire emergency, we tend to see the very best and the very worst in people.

I've come to the realization to not have high hopes and expectations of people these days.  My relationship with people have come down to this very deciding moment - no vaccination, then it's friendship amputation."
2021-05-03 18:03,Why don’t Covid recoveries ever get factored into this equation?  Vaccinations attempt to produce the same immune response of someone who’s had and recovered from a virus and those who’ve recovered from Covid are very likely to have immunity for years.  Reinfections will happen but it’s an outlier.
2021-05-03 18:18,"This is utterly revolting and shows how much scientific education in the United States has fallen. Unfortunately, that has knock-on effects for us elsewhere due to the soft power of the US; even if the current anti-vax trend stems from the UK with Andrew Wakefield's fraudulent activities, the US embraced it far too readily for its own good and has pushed that trend elsewhere in the process."
2021-05-03 18:27,"On another note,the latest StatCanada survey (published on March 26, 2021) reports that 76.9% of adult Canadians are willing to get the vaccine against Covid-19.At 23.1%vaccine hesitancy,we are not that far off from the US's 30%."

Second blaming Trump is a waste of time.  He is not president (thank goodness).  It is up to Biden to have courage and take decisive action.  Mandate vaccines if you want to fly, take a cruise, go to a ballgame, go to school, etc.  Prove it with the pass you download on your phone a la the New York State pass.  

It will take courage for Biden to require vaccines to fly etc. in that some people will resent Biden for doing so and not vote for him next time (which I suspect is the reason that this action has not been taken to date)."
2021-05-03 18:44,"How are vaccines the key to herd immunity?  The vaccinated can still become infected and transmit covid.  The CDC had to walk back its director's comment that the vaccinated cannot become infected or transmit Covid.  It also had to walk back her comment that the vaccine was safe for pregnant women.  Why is the media silent on the missteps of the CDC director?  Is it because she isn't a Trump appointee?

The problem is more likely people socializing, traveling and refusing to maintain proper distances, all while not wearing masks in the face of Covid 1.0 and its variants.   The country is opening up too soon because of unfounded reliance on the covid vaccine.  God only knows what the summer will bring.   I can only hope we won't face another fall/winter of lockdowns."

2021-05-03 16:24,"It’s long past time for us to move ahead with progressive concerns. Whether it’s ignorance due to religious indoctrination or just poor education, it’s dragging us all down. Maybe it’s already too late.
We should be long past dumping the second amendment and assuming we can’t do any better than our forefathers did. They thought we could. 
The electoral college and  unequal representation in Congress should be long gone. 
Science is way beyond the intellectual capacity of the average citizen. We are already at the point where genetic engineering on humans is possible. Yet, we are not even capable of getting people vaccinated for a pandemic when science has developed a vaccination.

2021-05-03 18:34,"Talking about federal welfare recipients in the 1990’s, a famous Republican Senator from Texas once remarked it was time for those riding in the wagon to get out and help the rest of us push. 

I suppose it was somewhat clever at the time, but the sentiment seems far more relevant to that portion of our population who have refused to do things like social distancing, mask wearing, and now vaccinations. So far their only contribution has been to get sick and gain some immunity if they survived. But mostly they contribute to ongoing spread of the virus along with the occasional threatening (and sometimes armed) demonstrations.

Unfortunately, facts and guilt won’t sway many, particularly when Fox Noise wants Biden to fail as badly as Trump did. If herd immunity is going to happen safely, it will probably come down to the advice of trusted personal health care providers and nagging wives to get us over the hump."
2021-05-03 17:04,"People in academia and government have no clue on how to communicate to the public or get them to do the right thing.  They overlook 2 issues:
1. Many people are like children and need to be treated as such.  They need to understand the consequnces.
2. People respond to pain 10x more than pleasure
That being said, to get more people vaccinated
--eliminate government benefits of ANY type to the unvaccinated (everything from social security to tax deductions)
--public message deluge, ""You have the freedom to do whatever you want.  But in this society, if you don't get vaccinated and endanger others, then you won't get any benefits and you won't get healthcare for Covid. Do as you please."""
2021-05-03 17:40,"I can understand vaccine hesitancy or the reluctance to inject something newly developed into your body and into your children's body, but what I cannot and never will understand nor accept is the unwillingness to mask up, physically distance and practice good, common-sense hygiene. I also cannot understand why evangelical Christians, who preach the mantra of ""love your neighbor"" do not love their neighbor enough to protect them from this terrible disease. I love my neighbor as myself as Jesus wanted us to do... I cannot, in good conscience, expose myself or anyone else to this virus. Is there no empathy for all the poor suffering people in this world?  I don't think this virus is ever going to go away until safe, effective, inexpensive, and accessible treatments are developed... we cannot rely on vaccination alone. In fact, having a vaccine available actually takes away the incentive to develop such treatments. But we need a multi-pronged approach to eradicate this disease. Vaccines, which have to be administered annually to a world of 7 billion people, is not a realistic strategy for eliminating Covid. It took us years to stamp out smallpox worldwide, and that was with a live vaccine that provided lifelong immunity with just one dose. None of our current vaccines provide that type of protection."
2021-05-03 17:58,"It’s almost as if telling people for months that being vaccinated doesn’t change anything about what they can and can’t do had a negative effect. 

That said, this thing was always going to become endemic."
2021-05-03 17:11,"2 factors not mentioned. Individuals entering the school system are now required to be vaccinated against many diseases. If Covid can become part of that requirement, it will gradually reduce the folks who will be seriously infected as they age up and the older folks age out (by dying). Many workplaces will require vaccination to protect customers, despite the feelings of the employees, they will be mandated to be vaccinated. (Even companies without direct exposure to customers may adopt the vaccination requirement to protect their employees from infections from fellow employees.) Curiously, the pressures to vaccinate individuals inn locations which currently eschew vaccination will outbreaks persist, muting the voices of those who resist. Finally, world-wide vaccination is needed before any semblance of virus defeat is possible. This is a very long term goal. Exprect new vaccinations that cover ALL coronavirus variations and types (now in development) to come out and create a mixed environment, where many are actually immune while those who refuse to vaccinate will suffer more and more death. Sad. (I believe that many of the right who ignore science do so because they do not understand science (the Bible is a much easier thing to accept than Science) and as they are now adults, they are empowered to make their own decisions and falsely conclude that which they do not understand can't harm them."

a) How can a society as deeply fractured as this one,    riven by fundamental differences in the basic understanding of how physical reality and the real world functions, a fact aggravated by the widespread adoption of magical  thinking 
fantasies and the revulsion of critical thinking skills, ever 
hope to get anywhere near ""herd immunity""?

 ""Herd"" implies some intuitive subconscious sense of belonging to a collective larger entity with displays of external  behavior that are  consistent with this individual intuition.  That sense of belonging simply no longer exists in this society.

b) I'm wondering if all the non vaxers who would comprise a  larger percentage of those who came down with covid actually could contribute somewhat to the ""herd"" immunity since they should be, in principle, less likely to be new spreaders. The same applies to the under 10% who can't be bothered getting the second shot.

sweet spot when added to all those who have been fully
immunized. However perhaps someone more familiar with

2021-05-03 15:54,"Let's be clear: COVID variants have been with us forever. Animals of all sorts and viruses, need each other. We've been hosts forever. What has not been with us forever is the compromise in our immunity and the number of living beings with whom we share this planet. Plagues have been with us forever too. As has vaccine resistance. Staying healthy means more than just an upgrade in vaccines: it means equitable access to clean air, clean water, healthy food and access to common sense public health education.  There has been talk all along about developing a vaccine for across the board COVID resistance. That's not news. There's not much new in this article either--it's stating the obvious. Those of us who are vaccinate, let's be grateful. I certainly am. We do not have to have our voices or choices drowned out by those who resist vaccination. Stop having the conversations that include people with whom you'll never convince. Yes, it means I have to live differently but that's my choice, not the choice of those who resist vaccination. This pandemic has laid bare some clear fault lines that were already there within families, communities, and friendships. So be it. I make no apologies for my choices."
2021-05-03 18:23,"The recovered! What about the people who got exposed early in the pandemic - like rideshare drivers at LAX and had mild symptoms that disappeared in a few days. It was hard to get tested in those early days. So I cannot say definitively that I got Covid. But subsequent testing April 2020 and May 2020 were negative. I got vaccinated anyway in January 2021. I am now fully immune. 

I speculate that a substantial number of those hesitant to get vaccinated probably recovered from mild symptoms and have purged the virus from their bodies. I believe we need to add the recovered and un-vaccinated to the number of vaccinated to truly reflect the immunity at large. Will we get to 80% if this is done? I don't know. But I have not heard any public health official talk about the people who recovered from mild covid. Are those folks not immune?"
2021-05-03 16:54,"If it's really true that we aren't going to reach herd immunity voluntarily (it seems a bit early to make that declaration), then vaccine mandates are needed. It doesn't have to be a blanket mandate. But if you want to fly, enroll in federally-funded education (K - college), or work for the federal government or a federal contractor, you have to be vaccinated. Private employers should require the same of employees who want or need to work on-site. And businesses should require consumers to be vaccinated to patronize their physical locations. 

The rest of the country, particularly those who can't get vaccinated for medical reasons, should pay for the selfishness of the minority."
2021-05-03 18:40,"As a friend pointed out to me today, slightly decreasing or stable numbers of daily infections in the face of at least a third of the country now being basically immune means that the rate of infection in non-immunized people is actually climbing in many areas.  In my county, even though 42% are fully immunized and another 13% have had one shot (not to forget the 10% who were already infected), our case numbers are flat for the last two months or so.  So a plateau or slight decline in total cases is misleading.  The pandemic is going away for (most) immunized people.  But not for the non-immunized.  Maybe that should be better enumerated in the charts and graphs."

That administration was widely not thought of as worthy of a moment's trust, after packing important top government roles with cronies and industry stooges, passing legislative changes at the behest of special interests against America's best interests, and politicizing even those departments which are supposed to be independent, such as the Department of Justice.  

We couldn't trust that ANYTHING was being done for good reasons for the past four years, or with suitable checks and balances.  They built the swampiest swamp this country has seen since Warren G. Harding.  Plus, the Trump White House repeatedly took sides against science, and denied COVID-19 was a problem while allowing the virus to take hold across the nation.  Why would anyone trust the Trump Administration's rushed process to approve vaccines?

But now that administration has slunk out of Washington, taking its rampant cronyism and corruption with it, and the vaccines have been proving themselves for months and after many millions of injections.  You anti-vaxxers can come out now - it's safe again."

Hotels, airlines and cruise lines can require it for stays, certainly if people start suing them for getting sick in a hotel, airplane or cruise ship. States that have reached wide spread immunity if not herd immunity, can require it for entry without having to quarantine, etc., Other countries can require it for tourists and immigrants too. Some vaccine holdouts remain, like you have with the polio vaccine, but they will become rare. Let's hope this will happen before some really nasty variant emerges..."

Especially once the FDA issues formal approval and we are no longer under emergency authorization usage.

This is not a new thing in America.

Distrust is motivated by the attempts of forcing vaccination like that of Macron in France, who has just announced a health pass that will ban access even into theatres to those not vaccinated (or with a test done almost every week, which is not sustainable).

Obviously vaccination is better than death, but it creates also a selection pressure that increases the chance of resistant and more dangerous variants. The argument that people that refuse to get vaccinated are evil because they damage the vulnerable (vaccinated if they want to) is not proved, the balance of cost and benefit is not evaluated. In fact, variants will always be possible from animals even if every human is vaccinated."
2021-05-03 18:53,"The article seems to make the unwarranted assumption that the vaccines provide permanent immunity.  A TV expert recommended booster shots for the current vaccines after seven months.  I have no idea as to whether the seven month period is a reliable prediction, but it is likely that the vaccines do not provide permanent immunity.  That will mean that public health officials will have to induce the already vaccinated to get additional shots to maintain their immunity for as long as the virus is around."

2021-05-03 19:03,"The proportion of people, of all ages, who suffer from at least one long-term serious syndrome, whether or not they had any symptoms while they were infected, is, as I understand it, roughly 30%. The numbers of such people who are either temporarily or permanently disabled will be extraordinarily large, if we fail to reach herd immunity.

The new variants are already putting younger, healthier people in the hospital at significantly higher rates, and they are also dying at significantly higher rates. See, for instance, Michigan. Are we willing to accept that result for relatively younger, healthier people--which will be a consequence of failing to reach herd immunity? 

Vaccine mandates are already the norm for, for example, public schools or the military. A small proportion of us have a legitimate reason for declining the vaccines. For example, they are allergic to the vaccines or their immune systems don't work as they should. We need to reach herd immunity precisely because those folks cannot be vaccinated.

The vast majority of the people who are refusing the vaccines are basing their refusal on lies, conspiracy theories and tribal partisan idiocy. Nobody has the right to infect somebody else with a dangerous disease. When the liberty of one individual causes the death or severe illness of another, that isn't freedom at all. It is something like criminal negligence."

2021-05-03 19:14,"I’m so glad the forum is still open so I can post this, less a comment than a search for response/constructive information. 

I got the JJ vaccine rather spontaneously when somebody circulated on a local chat that they were available without waiting or appointment, just a few blocks away, but limited supply. So I thought, OK, quick & easy. I got it, & 1 or 2 days later the issue about 1-in-a-million side effects broke & “out of abundance of caution” JJ was suspended. Between the rarity of this blood clot issue & my being male, I didn’t worry that I’d been exposed to that blood clot hazard. 

But I’d been lazy about learning about the vaccines’ differences, and quickly concluded the more serious hazard of JJ, that the mass-vaccination-above-all-else community seemed to be downplaying or suppressing was that it appeared less effective than Pfizer and Moderna at preventing mild infections, and was being pushed on technocrats’ determination that some spike in mild infections is an acceptable trade-off/sacrifice for the benefits of more widespread vaccination and prevention of severe cases (hospitalizations and deaths); people were being told, on this apparent basis, to get whatever vaccine becomes available to you first.

Poorer and more itinerant people lie who could not be counted on to get the second dose were considered the ideal recipients of this apparently weaker vaccine. Is that true? Is it weaker? Does (mild case) protection top out at 67%, or does it increase over time?"
2021-05-03 18:54,Money is a great incentive. It can punish by costing a person or it can encourage a person. I suggest using it in a positive manner to encourage people to get vaccinated.
2021-05-03 18:59,"On its website the CDC posts daily the percent of fully vaccinated persons 18 years or older.  Going back to April 2, the extrapolation was that it would take 103 days (until mid-July) to reach 80% fully vaccinated for the 18+ group, using the previous 7-day average for how much the vaccination rate was changing daily. As of May 2, 30 days, later the extrapolation was 72 days (mid-July) to reach 80%. While the vaccination rates rose in the first half of April and fell in the second half, the net effect was a wash. If one goes back to March 10, the extrapolation to reach 80% fully vaccinated among the 18+ was 170 days (end of August). So while there has been an undeniable slow down of the vaccination rate in the past 2-3 weeks, one should not overlook the even greater rates of increase which took place previously.  These gains did not come spontaneously but are a tribute to the tremendously good vaccination team in place during the last three months."
2021-05-03 18:53,"I worked for a large “essential” delivery company throughout the pandemic. The pandemic was never mentioned out loud, even as a variety of safety measures were implemented as per law. Most of my coworkers aren’t aware they are eligible for the vaccine - no one is talking about it. When I got Covid I was told by my employer that paying me to quarantine for 10 days was only optional - they opted not to pay. Think about what kind of incentive that provides to workers.

I know many people personally who were discouraged from getting vaccinated because they had Covid in the last three months. They're IMMUNE for the moment at least. Natural immunity should be counted, not just number of vaccines."
2021-05-03 18:54,"There's another reason we're not going to reach herd immunity: the term ""fully vaccinated"" is a moving target. No one knows how long vaccines confer protection for.  Six months is the longest I'm aware of anyone projecting. So this means that someone who was fully vaccinated in January is likely no longer fully vaccinated in June. Does that person regress to ground zero when it comes to following CDC guidance? What does it mean for businesses that require proof of vaccination? What does it mean if vaccination coverages wanes? Herd immunity could be a moving target for the same reasons. Importantly, should ""fully vaccinated"" have an expiration date?"

2021-05-03 19:18,"The ability of the government to mandate immunizations has been established by multiple Supreme Court decisions and state laws. This allows states to mandate vaccinations of children as a requirement to attend public school.  I’m not a lawyer, but it seems to me that if state governments can mandate that children be vaccinated, it makes sense that they would also have the power to mandate vaccinations for adults.  At the very least, public service employees like clerks, teachers, and police, all of whom require close contact with members of the public should be required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.  No MMR vaccine =no school and no COVID vaccine = no public service job.  See how many anti-vaxxers are willing to give up their jobs for their cause."

2021-05-03 19:35,"Israel made ""vaccine passports"" mandatory, to enter bars, restaurants, movie theaters and concerts. Guess what? When young Israelis realized they couldn't go to bars and restaurants with their friends, they got vaccinated.
A similar plan here; secure digital proof-of-vaccination on a cell phone would greatly increase uptake of a vaccine for Covid.
It will also permit Americans, this summer to travel overseas, and see Europe again. No proof of vaccine, no boarding a flight to Europe. The anti-vaxers will squawk about this, but Airlines are private business, and so are countries in the EU, not subject to US laws.
I would feel much safer at a concert, on a flight, or restaurant knowing everyone around me has been vaccinated.

These viral vaccines are immune system enhancers whereby a person's immune system is amped up to MINIMIE the adverse effects of the Covid-19 virus. The vaccine does NOT make a person immune to the disease! A person can still catch Covid and a person can pass it on to someone else! Case in point. It has been determined that if a person does acquire Covid, a vaccine may be injected within the first 10 days to help diminish the worst effects of Covid, and persons who have received a vaccine have come down with Covid!"

2021-05-03 19:33,"The worldwide distribution of vaccines, mostly in rich countries, is an obvious violation of correct ethical principles.
This is due to government control of vaccines, for example, the U.S. government under Trump with its America First policy, resulting in avoidable deaths in poor countries.

But what about what we don't know? How can an expert know any better than non-experts about what the future of a complex system will be? 

Take this issue of herd immunity. Nobody knows whether we will reach herd immunity or not. There's no way to know. And there's really no way to know whether we have herd immunity or not. There's no way to measure it. 

The idea that any expert knows what will happen is mistaken. The hoopla about the coronavirus variants being so dangerous has turned out (so far) to be just sensationalism. Where's their evidence?

Go back a few months and look what people were saying. 

In January of this year Tony Fauci said that we were facing a surge upon a surge. Instead the number of new cases were already dropping and has since dropped to a small fraction of their peak. 

Michael Osterholm said in mid-February that we would be in the worst part of the epidemic by the end of March. Didn't happen. 

Rochelle Walensky said at the end of March that a huge spike was coming. She tearfully spoke of her sense of impending doom, and how she was scared. No need to be.

1. As far as I can tell, there isn't a single agree-on definition for ""herd immunity."" It does not generally mean that there is enough population immunity to eradicate a disease completely. It means something like: ""reaching a level of population immunity so that that new infections start falling."" By any reasonable definition, vaccinations are increasing population immunity. They are both protecting the vaccinated individuals and reducing the overall spread. The question of how strong that population-level protection will be when the vaccination campaign is through is complicated. It does not help anybody's understanding to send push alerts about whether we will or won't reach the ""herd immunity"" threshold.

The difference is that the vaccine against a virus prevents infection so there is virtually no or very little reproduction cycle happening, thus no mutations to spread. This is why it's so important to get as many people as possible vaccinated - and why we don't have small pox anymore.

Antibiotics treat bacterial infections after they've occurred and we have symptoms (usually) so there is already a large bacterial population in the body. That means many reproductive cycles have already occurred. Some of those might have mutations that can resist the virus - then they reproduce and spread ""antibiotic resistant"" strains. This is why the doctor tells you to be sure to take the full amount of anti-biotic prescribed even if you already feel better - to reduce the chance of those mutant strains reproducing more and spreading. And why it's best not to take antibiotics without good reason. But the truth is that bacteria reproduce (and mutate) so rapidly that antibiotics inevitably push resistance. It would be better if we had vaccines for bacteria but we don't."

2021-05-03 20:27,"Well, it's all about ""alternative truths"" – right?!

Willful ignorance has grown to epidemic proportions in this country. Social media has accelerated it, designed as those sites are to be addictive and too prone to amplifying misinformation and dangerous rumors.

There will always be some portion of the populace who will refuse to get vaccinated. Which is tragically why some diseases are regaining footholds where they were once eradicated. The Trump administration greatly harmed the American public with their lies and incompetence in the early stages of the Covid19 pandemic. Biden's administration has done a lot to curtail that calamity. But if over 570,000 American deaths and the scenes on the news from countries like India with their funeral pyres aren't enough to get more people motivated to get a vaccine, I'm not certain what will.

I do believe that government could do a much better job with a national public health campaign. And I think businesses are well within their rights to require proof of vaccination as people return to offices. Covid19 isn't just a flu: it's much deadlier. But what do you do when you have governors like DeSantis who is as willfully ignorant and deceitful as Trump?"
2021-05-03 20:41,"The greatest crime in US history was the refusal of Donald Trump to do anything to prepare this nation after he was duly warned about the coming COVID pandemic. Americans need to know how many lives could have been spared if Trump had not disbanded the CDC Pandemic Response Team in 2018 and slashed operational funding of the CDC experts; if Trump had listened to the early warnings in December 2019 coming from intelligence agencies and the CDC about a pandemic arriving from China; if testing supplies and protective gear and ventilators had been MASSIVELY scaled up in January, 2020; if universal nationwide testing had been initiated in early February 2020 at the latest; if Trump had not said the pandemic was a left wing media hoax and then advised people to drink bleach and lysol.. Americans need to know how many lives could have been saved if at the start of this crisis, Trump would have done everything possible to lessen the spread of COVID including stressing the importance wearing a mask. It is one issue to be unprepared for a pandemic, it is another matter to deliberately undo preparations that have been made for such a disaster and then to pretend there is nothing to worry about ----hundreds of thousands of Americans have died because Donald Trump politicized a lethal pandemic while he had the key leadership role in the White House,  

Who else has single-handedly facilitated the death of more Americans than Donald Trump ?"

But taking a free vaccine during a global pandemic: THAT'S  too much to ask. We know whom we can thank for this mindset,  and it ain't Dr. Fauci."

2021-05-03 20:37,"The Coronavirus is not a new virus, it started to appear in 8000 BCE and faced a long term coevolution with bat and avian species.

Coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s but wasn't much deadly at this time, worldwide population was younger than today.

SARS (november 2002-july 2003), the first coronavirus pandemic detected, only 8 096 cases in many countries but easily contained with strict measure mostly on airports and planes and it was enough. Such efficient measure arrived too late in 2019 when the pandemy already spreaded everywhere with the  boom of chinese tourists (In 2002-2003 there was not much chinese tourist so it was more easy). China's lies favored the spreading.

MERS-COV (2012) detected in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia), coming from bats as well, but also in South Korea, 2442 cases, 800 fatalities. This virus was active for many years (251 cases through September 2018), very few contamination.

The Covid 19 is a variant of those previous version who hasn't faced a vaccine because it was not worth the cost. Is this version more deadly or is it that the population is more older and vulnerable ?
The English variant spread more but isn't more deadly, the same for Brazil and South Africa variant, and Indian variant as well.
The coronavirus will not disappaer because of the vaccine, the spreading will not be a concern anymore when vulnerable people will be protected, and there's no need for herd imunity."

First of all, you can't have herd immunity in one country, unless that country completely isolates it self.

Variants is mentioned as it was some thing very unusual for a virus. When.in fact, viruses mutate all the time. Usually getting milder and milder. A virus spreading easier is usually because it's getting milder, since you have more asymptomatic cases.

This.is not the first virus man kind has met, nor is it a particularly severe virus. We will all be fine.

Forty years later, too many Americans are using their anti-vaccine stance to express their religious/political    affiliation and their anti-government/individual rights patriotism.

So, there's going to be a toll for this widespread selfishness.  (I get that a few have a legitimate profile against vaccination.)  The problem is that many anti-vax expressors are running influence campaigns WHICH ARE PREVENTING the normal, public health good result from EFFECTIVE vaccines.

The disease will not be controlled, like other controllable diseases, because influencers are EMOTING their personal beliefs.  It causes needless suffering, please wake-up."

Of course if you still are hesitant and resisting vaccination, you are free to do so.  But with a   cost to your permitted activities.

Just like the 'old' days when the majority did not put up with a whining minority."

We older people grew up fearful of polio, my brother got it and it was terrifying. Mumps, measles, rubella, ran through schools, and sometimes a kid died or had a rotten outcome (like blindness). To us, vaccinations to prevent serious illness in the next generation were a Godsend

Perhaps this entire generation of people who were vaccinated against childhood illness just can't understand what is at stake with Covid, now."

We had a common enemy to go to war against, an enemy that has taken over 500,000 American lives. But influential politicians ignored it or downplayed it, and a lot of people, since they didn't lose anyone to it, went on with their lives as if the pandemic didn't exist. And all of us are going to pay a price for the actions for some.

How do the rest of you live in this country and maintain any hope in the good in humanity? Because living as a high-risk individual during a global pandemic has really showed me that my fellow Americans literally do not care if I'm alive or dead. If keeping the vulnerable alive means they have to put a piece of cloth on their face while they go to the store to pick up their beer, many people (most Republicans) are perfectly content to skip the mask and consign the most vulnerable Americans to the grave."
2021-05-03 21:09,"There are two ways to achieve herd immunity: by vaccination or by infection. The first is preferable because it's far safer and it produces better and broader protection. The second, while not as good as the first, still adds something to the group immunity equation.

So my advice to all those selfish and irrational fools who refuse to get vaccinated is to get together indoors with as many unvaccinated people as possible, and to do so without masks and shoulder-to-shoulder while you exercise your right to act irresponsibly and contrary to the public good. Despite your reprehensible solipsism, you might end up contributing to the welfare of others when you contract the infection and produce some antibodies."

And this woman wants to be in patient care? She is arguing there aren't enough studies to validate the safety of Pfizer, Moderna, and J & J. 

Give me a break. Salk came out with his polio vaccine 66 years ago in 1955 and we didn't have half the medical resources we have today. But it worked, didn't it?

Since she refuses to be tested, there is always a chance she might be positive but asymptomatic making her a contagious carrier.  And if she infected a patient who subsequently died? The legal liability would be rather large.

Well here we are.

The absence of anyone in authority or who have roles in protecting our health telling us that we faced a possibility of variants that could turn this whole ""hoax"" into a far more deadly pandemic makes me very, very angry.

You want everyone to get the vaccine?

Start working on the numbers that show what the possibilities will be of a crazy variant developing that leaves our current vaccines ineffective at protecting us.

For ""icing on the cake"" get the rural dummies to start thinking about what it could like if ""your young children became infected and developed a greater chance of dying"" due to a variant yet to occur.

Heaven forbid if any variant should pose a greater danger to our species and increase the overall number of deaths but those who are unaware of the consequences of having foolish ideas about NOT needing to get fully vaccinated should be told all the overstatements necessary, so that the entire population of the world is protected against covid-19 and it's dangerous variants.

The nations of the world have to ensure an entire globe is inoculated.

As a result, this article feels incredibly disingenuous with an eye towards generating clicks. I am vaccinated and would love it if everybody else was, too, but that is a pipe dream. And, at this point, even if the majority of the population was covered I'm guessing there would continue to be variants and outbreaks.

(2) When will at risk individuals be able to (a) go to movie theaters or other indoor cultural/theatrical events (b) eat dinner in restaurants indoors.  (3) When will the rate of daily new cases in the US return to the level that prevailed in the early part of last summer, when, allegedly we were at a dire point from which things would improve.

Scientists, law makers, and more learned people knew that herd immunity was unlikely due to the individualistic, I can do whatever I want frame of mind that America lives up to and promotes.  They probably didn't mean any harm, they had to offer any little shred of hope to the masses. Hoping against hope they could hold out long enough to get the ""majority"" of the American population vaccinated.  Then the cat fell out the bag, when the J&J vaccine was paused, then restarted again with caveats.  It's almost like telling a child the age appropriate birds and bees version.  Just enough that a child can handle, but not too much to be embarassing.  Now the anti-vaxxers, the conspiracy theorists and fear mongers have coelesced into a perfect storm of resistance that American individualism fosters into a huge problem.  The more people resist vaccination, the more the Covid virus embeds, mutates, spreads and sets up a scenario like, Contagion, Andromeda Strain, I am Legion, and Outbreak all mixed up in one.  Right out of a scary, shock, and science fiction someday movie coming to an indoor poorly ventilated, non-social distancing bar, gym, hair salon, nail salon, restaurant near all of us.

Vaccinations will get  us out of this, everything else is higher risk and higher cost to the economy."
2021-05-03 21:08,"As a medical doctor, in my view, the main issue is not whether herd immunity is attainable or not. Viruses come and go. They have been part of the natural human environment for hundreds of millennia. 

The main issue is what to do about pandemics like this one. After a year of lockdowns in many states and countries all over the world, the science is clear: There is no evidence that blanket lockdowns reduce death rates. Comparable jurisdictions with different lockdown policies experienced similar death rates per capita. This is the only way doctors evaluate the effectiveness of a drug or vaccine or a public-health intervention: By comparing large groups of similar people who are treated differently.

Therefore, instead of worrying about herd immunity, next time around, policy makers need to focus only on the vulnerable groups and let the young and healthy populations meet the pathogen. This would be a more effective strategy, because it won't hurt the economy, which ultimately supports the health care system. Instead of spending trillions to fix people's ruined livelihoods, the government should invest only some billions to support hospitals, nursing homes, etc."
2021-05-03 21:19,"Re. numbers cited as not vaccinated. I wondered how exactly such numbers are arrived at. Eg in my state, I would probably have died before I got an appointment date to be vaccinated after I became eligible—I got booked and vaccinated sooner, following my eligibility date, through my own patient hospital network which contacted me and organized mass vax and sites of its own—much simpler and more organized. Maybe when official state vax invites aren’t followed up on, they’re counted as no vaxes? Hey, if they changed midway how they count Covid deaths, are they might evolve the way in which they count who didn’t respond to vax appointments offers and didn’t get vaccinated through official state sites."

We can’t wait for all hesitant folks to be vaccinated or all others to wear masks and socially distance, if they won’t despite others wanting them to. The answer then is for the latter to get vaxed, keep distancing, continue washing frequently with soap, wear masks if you want, and don’t make unsanitary contacts same ways you wouldn’t have for other illness types before we even heard of Covid coming into being."

2021-05-03 21:31,"Firstly, thank you, Ms Mandavilli, for your graceful and thorough written explanation of the various milestones for the virus among us. 

This specific virus is going to put perhaps the greatest existential threat to humanity’s throat since carbon unnaturally entered the atmosphere. Like climate, this virus requires an all-in global effort to be sustained over long term measures. There may likely never be a viable return to pre-COVID social and business practices. We’re masters at getting over harsh realities with distraction. At this particular time among humans we are simultaneously meeting two cold, barbarous threats. The first is the SARS-Cov virus which is an immediate threat to our continued habitation of this earth, or nearly so. The second is equally urgent but occurs over a longer period of time. If we cannot unite as billions of human persons defined by races, ideologies, religions and philosophies, and governments humans may well die out from the virus for so long as it circulates and mutates. We may also very well design our own extinction as a species if inaction is all the effort the world’s persons give to extinguishing the release of greenhouse gases and other controllable emissions. Honestly, nothing in this picture points to a higher intelligence as a distinguishing characteristic of our species."
2021-05-03 21:26,"If we can not reach herd immunity then we should segregate those who are vaccinated from those who refuse it.  Vaccination passports are a start.  Require them for travel, require them for leaving your home state, stop the fed from paying for hospital bills for those who refuse vaccination and become ill and allow insurance companies to do the same.   Do this and you'll see far higher compliance - and also herd immunity."
2021-05-03 21:30,"Our tax dollars have paid for the vaccine to be free for everyone in the US. The economic consequences of individuals not getting vaccinated should not be paid by the tax payer. 
 
 So here's an idea -- if you do not have a medical reason for not getting vaccinated then you can't get access to any public health insurance benefits such as medicaid, medicare and you can't get insurance via the exchange. Plus, no disability or early access to social security if you become too ill to work."
2021-05-03 21:36,"I'm vaccinated, and was excited to qualify.  However, the FDA has not approved this vaccine; it has emergency use authorization only.  This in itself will make some hold off.  Even this article states we can get back to 'normal' once the vulnerable are vaccinated.  I realize some are vulnerable that don't know it, so that's a risk one takes when refusing the vaccine.  

Maybe there is too much negative rhetoric directed at people that choose not to take it.  That number will shrink once there are long term data and FDA approves it for market.  I'd  like to see more effort put into therapeutics so that fewer die if they do get Covid19; this virus is never going away, so therapeutics have to be developed as no one is going to take endless boosters for new variants."
2021-05-03 21:38,"It's been only a few months since the vaccine has been available in the US, and maybe a month since it has been available to all ages in the most populous states. Seems a little early for grand prognostications. I understand experts study data projections in real time, but I think there a lot of people who - once again - want to hijack some pretty tentative data to support their pet narratives."
2021-05-03 20:10,"All these comments are frustrating. Maybe if any of you talked to vaccine hesitant people you would get a better idea of how to change things. I have many as patients. 

1) Stop telling them they are stupid. They never persuades anyone. 
2) Stop wearing masks after vaccination, especially outside. Masks outside are useless and clearly political posturing and not following the science. This undermines the message.
3) Start promoting the idea that after full vaccination they can all go back to normal. Not someday. Now.
4) Stop saying we need to vaccinate young children for a disease that is less harmful to them than flu. We don't. Again, we need to promote an apolitical, entirely science-based approach.
5) Calm down about variant escape. Top experts know this is exceptionally unlikely to occur. Just get over it. 

Or you can whine about it and nothing will change."

Instead, we should focus on vaccinating people who are hesitant for other reasons, whatever they might be.  It’s not ideal, but you’re never going to convince someone who thinks the virus is a hoax to get vaccinated."
2021-05-03 21:47,"Just so we keep things in perspective the Indian population is about 1.3 Billion people. 2% of fully vaccinated Indians equal approximately 26 Million. About 153 Million Indians have at least one shot of the vaccine. They have a long way to go to overcome the lack of vaccines and get the population full vaccinated.

However we also have to keep in mind that those Indians who travel overseas constitute a fraction of the population and they will be fully mindful of getting fully vaccinated before they get on a plane."

""rather than making a long-promised exit, the virus will most likely become a manageable threat that will continue to circulate in the United States for years to come"". ""Herd immunity"" from vaccination was never realistic. Between prior infection and vaccination we will probably have a high number of people with some level of immunity in this country by summer.  The rest of the 7 billion people in the world are another matter. It's time to move on. Vaccinate all that want to be vaccinated and open op the country."

2021-05-03 22:03,"One of the consequences of ""vaccine hesitation"" for what ever reason, be it fear of bad reaction, fear of autism in your child, fear of nanobots or RFID getting injected, fear of government control, etc...is that more vaccine hesitant people will be likely to get and transmit covid-19 and its variants. This means there will be more deaths among this population, though this will be mitigated by all the other folks who actually got vaccinated. Not sure how I want to publicly state how I think about that."
2021-05-03 22:00,"""It is already clear, however, that the virus is changing too quickly, new variants are spreading too easily and vaccination is proceeding too slowly for herd immunity to be within reach anytime soon.""

This statement misleads. If you look at actual figures, the virus is not changing quickly. New variants are not spreading more easily than old ones. Vaccination is proceeding quick enough to, coupled with natural immunity, put us near to so-called herd immunity levels. 

Experts may believe these things, but that is just their view. Their opinion. These things are far from being proved in any scientific way. Far from being ""clear""."
2021-05-03 22:00,My partner and I are tempted to travel to Europe now that they are lifting restrictions on vistors from the U.S. and now that we are both vaccinated. But the fear of what may be lurking from variants that are out there is making the decision difficult.
2021-05-03 22:04,"Anyone who wants to mandate vaccination, and/or establish punitive or restrictive measures on those who have balked at it, consider:  

Per the CDC's own stats, 94% of the people testing positive for the virus don't get sick enough to require hospitalization.   

Distrust of the pharmaceutical industry and the FDA.  The outrageous rise in cost of insulin over the past several years, previous unsafe medication roll outs (e.g., fen-fen, Zantac, Nexium, Prilosec), rampant advertising aimed at getting patients to lobby their doctors for prescriptions and, of course, the whole oxycontin debacle.    

Why would anyone with more than 70 IQ points take it on faith that there are no long term risks to vaccines that are still in trial.

There is a history in the U.S. of medical experimentation on vulnerable, disadvantaged populations, including drug trials.

Finally, in the U.S. there's also an elevated level of general distrust for the opaque economic and political machinery of our society.  Consider just 40 years ago we were buying the ""trickle down"" economic theory hook line and sinker, which left our middle class decimated.  Now we have a chronic state of ""panic porn"" in our news cycles and the politicization of covid vaccination... 

This all may seem a little too much for some people to swallow.  So when you're designing control or revenge in your mind against those who are ""vaccine hesitant"" maybe consider that it's not all selfishness, sloth, or political loyalty."
2021-05-03 21:54,"I would add rewards to the equation.  Agencies that have administered the vaccine should read the names of those who are fully vaccinated into a federal data bank.  Each entry should receive another stimulus check from the federal government - a nice big fat reward for caring not only about one's own welfare, but also about the welfare of others.  

Why should we let the selfish ones get away with this without blinking an eye?  Those who refuse the vaccine are guilty of reckless endangerment, pure and simple, regardless of their motivations, and despite the fact that so many of them attend church several times a week.  Their religion and politics are vacuous.  Until the voice of authority thunders from their pulpits and tells them to get the vaccine, they will not make a move toward getting it.  On the other hand, if they see another stimulus check dangling in front of them, they just might change their minds.

And by the way, those of us who have been fully vaccinated should be first in line for the next round of vaccines."
2021-05-03 21:50,"Good article, but it shouldn’t be a surprise in that all main points were completely foreseeable with no tricks or trap doors. 

We always have a vocal sub population who are highly anti-vaccine. Then you have a group which is heavily politically driven and will vigorously do the opposite of the received opinion at NIH or the New York Times. 

Then, even more importantly, you have the fact that herd immunity is like a slanting slope of a landing airplane. At some point a virus actually goes extinct like the dodo bird. But before that, somewhere over 50 or 60% exposure, population wide infections will drop off a lot. As that happens, the pressure for some remaining people to get vaccinated will dissipate badly. None of these facts should be surprising, they are all inevitable."

I hope this guy is a second tier ""senior advisor"" or that he was misquoted.  Wealthy neighborhoods are rarely one block away from crowded unhealthy ones. 10X  of 10 is 100, which means everyone is vaccinated, which I would hope satisfies the criteria for heard immunity for even the most risk-averse.  No one has suggested that 10 is herd immunity unless everyone stays inside forever, which I guess is possible for the uber wealthy.  But then 0 would be too."

Making this calculation isn't rocket science, NYT, and I'm very disappointed that this article is the first one you've run that reaches this frustrating conclusion.

Consider:  
74 million = children under the age of 18, none of whom have been eligible for the vaccine until very recently (and 24 million, i.e. children under the age of 12, who will not be eligible for foreseeable future).  
15 million = undocumented immigrants who either don't have identification or who are afraid of getting deported if they show up to get vaccinated.
15 million = Republican voters (40% of the 75 million who voted for Trump) who've said they won't get vaccinated.
5 million = people without access to clinics, hospitals or other medical care.
2 million = pregnant women (who only now are being told it's safe to be vaccinated).
5 million = Blacks, who are vaccine-hesitant because of their distrust of the medical community.
15 million = people who already had Covid and don't think they need to get the vaccine.

This adds up to 131 million people not being vaccinated, out of a U.S. population of 330 million (= only 60% vaccinated).   Fauci has said we need 75%-85% vaccinated for herd immunity = approx. 264 million vaccinated.  Even substantially discounting the 131 million due to overlap among the groups, we won't get anywhere near herd immunity any time soon -- if ever."

Coupled with vaccine shortages in global hotspots and it could lead to increased numbers and varieties of variants.

Desperation to be rid of public heath protocol and return to normal life, is hampering our ability to deal with the virus as a global threat to the entire human race. If there's one thing we should've learned by now it's, every time we relax, the virus hits us like a ton of bricks."
2021-05-03 22:33,"Speaking from a high school graduate level of education, my take is that the idea of America ever attaining ""herd immunity"" should have been tossed out the window the minute we realized this global virus was mutating into more contagious variants. Ever since then it's been silly and downright irresponsible to speak of ""herd immunity"" as a realistic goal for the country.

IMO, when the United States does (and I hope we do) reach the amazing achievement of 90 percent vaccinated, the virus will continue to be mutating in unvaccinated countries, and will be boomerang back, in a more contagious form which potentially defeats our vaccines. We have to vaccinate ourselves, vaccinate the world, re-vaccinate ourselves, re-vaccinate the world, etc.

TL:DR this is a global pandemic where the virus is spreading without regard to national boundaries, mutating into more contagious variants, and rebounding back onto previously vaccinated populations. I think that in a global pandemic the ""herd"" part of ""herd immunity"" is probably referring to the entire global population of human beings."

I'd imagine that that a significant number of the vaccine refusers are the very same people who have refused to wear masks,  and have ignored public health   experts across the board, and who are responsible for the majority of the deaths due to Covid-19  in the United States.

Why  are  American public health officials discussing this in a resigned manner, as if the the Federal government is powerless  to do anything about this?

It might be best for people to just be forced to put up with restrictions, but if the government wants to level the playing field, they can issue free vaccine passports, and since health departments have records, people would not have to go out of their way to get one.  Since nobody would be forced to get one, but private businesses have every right to ask for one, nobody's privacy will be violated. Those who don't like it can stay home.

Thus multi-generational housing may be fatal for the elderly in most countries except Australia, New Zealand, and Taiwan.

2021-05-03 23:52,"So much scapegoating and over-generalizing going on about the kind of people who aren’t getting vaccinated. The virus doesn’t care. It will spread where it can and fizzle out where it can’t because that’s what viruses do. But just like we saw with the masks and the restaurants at the height of the pandemic, all the shaming and name-calling and vitriol don’t do any good. They just divide people further. They make stubborn people dig in their heels.

All transmission is local, but I really think we should focus on vaccinating people everywhere, not just hoarding doses for rich countries. Besides simply being the right thing to do, the most effective vaccine dose right now is the one that gets into an arm. We can worry about vaccine-hesitant Americans when more people are immunized overall."
2021-05-04 0:02,"""Polls show that about 30 percent of the U.S. population is still reluctant to be vaccinated.""  So if the not reluctant 70% get vaccinated and 21.5% have already had covid - wouldn't that achieve the 90% herd immunity rate? I'm guessing the 70% is an exaggeration and Feds know that. Otherwise all the political comments in the stream - Blues vax, Reds dont - cant really play out (70% of country isn't Blue!)"
2021-05-03 23:32,"The CDC and health authorities have not helped matters with their poor messaging regarding the vaccines. When the message is ""even after vaccination you still need to mask, social distance and avoid crowds"" you are only discouraging many fence sitters. This is anecdotal, but I have heard many say they will not get the vaccine until all mask mandates are gone and things are close to 100% normal. The vaccines either work or they do not. If they work as advertised, they confer high levels of immunity and drastically reduce the chances of serious illness and even further reduce the probability of hospitalization and death. Thus, the masks and restrictions should end for those that are vaccinated. It seems more and more Americans believe they are entitled to a 100% risk free existence."
2021-05-03 23:42,"We already know who has and hasn't been vaccinated. At least in MA, there is a State Vaccination Registry of some sort. (MIIS). If employers are allowed to check our credit worthiness with three or four private companies, and to check other aspects of our health histories, then this information about vaccination records is also fair game.

No need for a national registry, though that would make managing air travel a bit easier. Schools also can gain access to health records, so this is just one more vaccine to add to the existing list.

Vaccination cards or passports would invite fraud. It's already happening to such an extent that CDC is warning states to take down reproducible vaccine card templates from their public web pages.

If anyone does not want to be vaccinate, they can always find an employer who already is anti-mask. And a school like the one in FL where vaccines are discouraged. 

But try to enter a sports arena, a concert venue, a Broadway show or any place like that without proof of vaccination, and good luck being allowed inside. Or onboard a cruise ship or a commercial airplane. Or to stay in a hotel. 

That's OK -- you could camp outdoors unvaccinated, or stay in a ""vaccine optional"" place. I'm sure there will be plenty of both. We are Americans -- there will always be options.

Just maybe not the most convenient or most comfortable options. Good!"

4. Whatever they try to tell you, the vaccines in this country are 75-90 percent effective against infection. They are almost completely effective in preventing serious illness. 

5. You still need to mask up and distance inside. It is stupid not to, unless you’re at home.

I sometimes think that whether they know it or not, the Right and the anti-vaxxers and the quacks have got together and launched a kind of sloppy, informal, germ warfare. 

The general effect is that of a terrorist attack, as you can see in the aggressivity and happiness of the bellowing clowns who won’t mask up.

No rational person should want to chance becoming gravely ill with COVID-19.  The odds of contracting the disease are about 1 in 10.

It doesn’t help matters of civic cooperation when ‘vaccine shaming’ is becoming normalized in the name of ‘science’. 
While vaccination does reduce the probability of infection and severity of illness, the documented phenomenon of ‘breakthrough cases’ (vaccinated people catching COVID) means that it is still possible, though far less likely, for vaccinated people to catch and spread the virus. The US (and the world) should not be putting all of its eggs in one basket with the pharmaceutical industry to fight this war. There are strategies and tactics for mitigation which are not being discussed or promoted; can’t we do better than handwashing against an airborne respiratory threat? The promise of an easy return to “normal” once “everyone is vaccinated” ? Overly optimistic, and this will play out over the next few months., as this article implies. The big idea that “all you have to do is get the vaccine and you don’t have to worry anymore” ? Not quite, and in my view, scientifically unsound.

I would venture to say that most of the people who are hesitant to take a Covid vaccine are not your classic “anti-vaxxers”. Rather, they are anti-vaccine without long-term safety efficacy data. Here is an example of the type of news that gives a Covid vaccine-hesitant person pause:

Three days ago the Salk Institute released the results of a study that found that the spike protein by itself, in absence of the virus, damaged endothelial cells. The Covid vaccine causes our body to create the spike protein so that we produce antibodies. Weren’t we led to believe that the spike protein, without the virus, was harmless? Does this mean that we’re setting up 100s of millions of vaccinated people with potential long-term vascular disease?

Higher the better but when 74 million children await their turn for FDA to approve a vaccine against COVID for children and a third of the population unwilling to receive the vaccine and with another third not being conveniently vaccinated because of remote places they live in or just not being able to receive the vaccine conveniently, it is over half the population in the US that will never have acquired immunity. 2) Ability to eradicate a pandemic virus completely is critical to declare ""herd immunity"" in a meaningful way. Smallpox was declared dead from our planet in the 1970s by the WHO because it had no place to hide in humans or animals because by that time every human was either vaccinated from smallpox of gained life long immunity by recovering from smallpox scourge. Also unlike Coronaviruses variola virus the causative agent of smallpox has no other natural animal host. 3) Certainly viruses like Coronaviruses and Influenza viruses can never be considered eradicated because they have animals or bird hosts that continue to harbor them. The variants of SARS Corona virus 2 that have emerged globally from the original Corona virus 2 in Wuhan, China may become resistant to protection from the immunity acquired from vaccines."

2021-05-04 3:55,"""Herd immunity is often described as a national target. But that is a hazy concept in a country this large.""

That's just not true.
HIT(herd immunity threshold) for COVID-19 is as well defined as it needs to be at about 80% of population which means ~265M Americans need immunity by being immune, getting ill(~97% survive) or taking a vaccine.

Ask yourself, who is getting COVID-19?
A: The non-immune and non-vaccinated.
And ask yourself, who is dying from COVID-19?
A: The non-immune and non-vaccinated.
Over time that population(non-vac'd) will dwindle until it is statistically unimportant because they are immune, will get sick and survive with immunity or they will die. 
In the meantime, who will they infect?
A: The non-immune and non-vaccinated.
All others are, or will be, fully(90-95%) immune.

So take the vaccine, any of them, and quit with the doom & gloom nonsense and the suggestions of creating another subclass of Americans.

We already have over 50% of the 80% immune and it's only May 4.
This is 'A Good Thing'.

COVID has been unimaginable.  Loss, loss, loss.  

Did it get to the point though, if we survived, personally and physically that was first and foremost?  

It’s sad to think about the lost year of our lives.  And then to top it off, for many, all the loss of livelihood.  The ramifications.  The long lasting effects.  

I hate COVID.  

But I will never forget the spirit seen in the windows of real New Yorkers clamoring and cheering on healthcare workers.  The sight and pictures of that spirit - for many, that is New York.  That has to be regained.  How? When?  Can it happen?"
2021-05-03 12:07,"The pandemic has provided an inflection point on trends that commenced with the rise of Amazon.  Urban areas, and especially Manhatten, will transform over time.

2021-05-03 12:12,"This has been a cataclysmic year.  There's no question that major changes will come to the commercial NYC RE market.  Rents are generally correlated with local foot traffic, and that will certainly be down for years.   I suspect tourism will come back strong, and I'm sure many specialty retailers are doing fine in NYC as they are everywhere- bike shops and other outdoor recreation stores.  But there's no way the majority of office workers come back to the office 5 days/week.  The technology for remote work has proven itself, and it's only going to get better.   I suspect 1-3 days/week will be standard.  That's going to hurt every food truck, push cart, Starbucks and restaurant located in business districts.   Rents will fall, and owners will lose.  This is capitalism and the free market."
2021-05-03 12:12,"I hate to say it, but, it's probably time to start rethinking your location/business choices.  Will Manhattan come back?  Yes, I'm sure it will, a lot of people want to live there and it does have a lot to offer.  But WHO will come back?  It's very likely that the midtown ""office"" crowd is a dead end, even if they come back this year, that entire model has it's days numbered.  I think the clock already hit 0, but, who knows, you might get the big ""last gasp"" of in office for a few years and then the terminal decline sets in.

The question for a business isn't ""how to fix it"".  You can't, it's a problem far bigger than you.  The question is ""how to thrive in the new environment"", and, the answer to that question is often to relocate (hence the problem in the first place, it's a self-sustaining cycle).  And sadly, for some businesses, there's no ""fixing it"", it's just dealing with the idea that you're in a shrinking industry (class A office space, for example).  

Relocate to a new location with vastly reduced rent.  Sell your products online to a broader audience.  That's going to be the formula for a lot of businesses to survive/thrive.  Not all of them (probably not even most) will be able to do this; if you're not, then start planning your next thing."

It’s going to be different for sure but if I was a business owner I’d be proactively adapting forward. People are going to focus on their happiness and lifestyles over retail, the pandemic and remote work ensured that. Climate change means we have to prioritize changing how we do retail as a whole."

In the last recessions, Regulators required banks to write down their real estate assets, largely residential land loans and residential mortgages made on inflated values and very low down payment requirement (equity). This had an impact on the banks’ capital and some had to recapitalize because they had to recognize the losses from these loans. Same has to happen here with loans made on office buildings that remain underperforming for an extended period. This will have a huge impact on financial markets."

While I have great empathy for all the unprecedented changes we've been confronted with since the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic, the decision to close down storefronts and work from home was intended to protect the safety of citizens.  Yes, a huge number of persons and businesses have suffered severe hardships in the form of lack of medical care, severe illness and/or death from the COVID-19 virus,  social isolation, hunger, and many more.  In this day and age there is a need to be flexible.  Storefronts can switch to mailing customers merchandise that they wish to purchase.  It's not ideal; but it's better than closing down the storefronts.  With people being vaccinated, it may be possible to send staff to deliver clothes to be tried on and purchased.  Of course that's a cumbersome model, typically reserved for the very wealthy.  But it's better than having no business at all and being obliged to shut down the store.

It's too expensive, exclusionary, AND the new housing is for rich people even though we keep begging for relief. We STILL dont have affordable housing (what is considered affordable is a joke % of pre-taxed income, doesn't account for high living costs, and is often above market rate). It's disingenuous to focus on all the excessive unoccupied offices. Manhattan was in a bubble ready to burst pre-covid. It was even becoming untenable for major brands, flagships were closing before COVID, luxury apts were unoccupied for long stretches. Poor and working class people are continually being pushed further to the edges of the city's centers.

Make Manhattan equitable and you will have more people there. Reach out to the outer boroughs and convince them Manhattan can be a place for them too. (Did you know there are people who have grown up here and have NEVER left their borough? Never seen Lincoln Center, the Met, the Empire State Building... it costs $2.75. Why? because the city communicates to them that it is for privileged (and white) people and they do not matter).

Often (at least uptown), they appeared to be aiming to drive out multiple adjoining small business owners with the hope of attracting a major chain.

Midtown had always been the nucleus of my life from age 16 on (my first job in high school was for the NYPL and I'd be going back and forth from the Dunell branch to my home base off Fordham Road). Every job was a lesson in economic ecosystems -- the offices and the retailers and service establishments that fed off them.

Now, with remote work, Midtown is largely irrelevant. I can't see it coming back to where it was, when crowded sidewalks and packed delis and bars ruled the day. 

Sure, it'll rebound some. But I think a lot of air has been bled out of the balloon.  Maybe that's good. 

Then, for those counting on the tourist locusts returning, think about this: what percentage of U.S. tourists visiting NYC will have been fully vaccinated, much less vaccinated at all? Do you really want these folks rambling about in bars and restaurants, unmasked and unvaxxed? 

I don't have a crystal ball, but there will be lots of longer-term changes to the NYC way of life. Like a p/t transit system. Less office space demand. A decline in indie retail establishments, replaced by national chains and their deeper pockets. On the residential RE front, I wouldn't invest in studio or 1 br apartments now, not with the need for home office space more of an issue than ever. 

And watch for the net outflow of Milennials, who will have done their five year hitch in Brooklyn."
2021-05-03 14:19,Typewriter repair companies and analogue film manufacturers had to adjust to changing times too. That’s the free market. Forcing people back to long commutes and clinging to the past is not the answer. These retail stores should adapt; maybe warehouse their inventory and move online?
2021-05-03 14:19,"Only the useful stores survive, such as Trader Joes, Target, Wholefoods, restaurants.... The boutique stores are going out of business because they keep raising their prices. I recently went to buy beer from a boutique beer shop, and they doubled their price in less then a year. What used to cost $3 now cost $6. Not only that they raised their prices one of their two shops went out of business recently. I eventually walked away from the store with nothing and ended up going to Trader Joes wine store instead where a bottle of wine cost me $6."
2021-05-03 14:20,"A big question people are asking is ""why""?

Workers are asking: Why did I endure a multi-hour commute for a job that I could do from home? Why did I come home miserable and exhausted every day to spend a scant few hours with my spouse and kids? There's the old adage : ""No one ever died wishing they spent more time at work"". 

Businesses are asking: Why did we spend so much on office space?

As others are saying, this doesn't need to be the death knell of Manhattan. Maybe it's the correction that's needed to make city living affordable, change zoning laws, etc. Maybe instead of high rise buildings filled with office workers you'll end up with mixed-use buildings -- part residential, part retail, part restaurant, part offices, and small grocery stores."
2021-05-03 14:26,"I really understand and empathize with the plight of many of the business owners and their employees.  I don't have an and especially not the easy solution, but one factor that's really squeezing the lifeblood out of retail in many places in New York are the crazy high rents.  Many owners have viewed their holdings as the geese that will lay golden eggs, allow for taking on unrealistic high loans (mortgages) and profit margins. Commercial real estate in Manhattan was famously seen as a business in which it's impossible to lose money in. That is, until an unexpected crisis hit.  The smarter building owners who have a longer view have already adapted - taking a percentage of the sales or revenue makes the survival of the tenant's business a lot more likely.  As for the other owners, they might as well read up on bankruptcy laws - empty space doesn't pay rent."

Ironically, it was to pick things up from my old office, which will soon be closed for good.

 What didn't I do?  Stay for lunch, go shopping.  

When asked where I would like my next office to be, it won't be in New York.

2021-05-03 14:49,"Actually, the idea that most of society should have the lifestyle they do, and live on mostly borrowed money, is a fiscally failed idea.  I grew up with a father, who was an office manager, and bookkeeper, first for Wilson, and Company, in Minneapolis, and then in Chicago, when I was a baby, and because he didn't want to commute, and be out in the suburbs, we moved to Montana, where I grew up, and he was a bookkeeper, and the office Manager for a John Deere Caterpillar business in northcentral Montana back starting in 1950.  He taught my sister, and I to live within our means, pay our bills, and be honest.  We lived frugally, as not many had large salaries back then.  I grew up when our country started putting missiles in silos in the ground during the Cold War in 1966. Our country, Pondera, had 87, which are no longer there, as it was a special system they don't use anymore.  Congress decided then, to start borrowing for the build up of the cold war, the Vietnam War,  the Great Society, Medicare, and Medicaid, by borrowing, rather than taxing for all the legislation they passed, that needed funding.  Most foreign policy, is now driven by ideologies, and we have poor domestic policies, because we can borrow for more, and more of it, rather than tax for all of it. Individuals, businesses, governments at all levels, are fiscally failing,  You can't have it all, and expect not to go bankrupt, if you don't tax for all of it.  The Pandemic just revealed how bad our way of life is."
2021-05-03 14:54,"The pandemic isn't over yet, and people are still hesitant to go out. It's not that they're working remotely, it's that walking into a shop is still seen as a risk by a huge portion of the US. Even if people were going to the office, that risk is still present. Many people would simply go to and from the office as quickly as possible, mitigating every risk they could. As we phase out of the restrictions, we can't expect people to snap back into their old habits right away. These things take time. Personally, I can't wait to go shopping, see a live show, or even just prowl around down-town for no reason at all, but I still have this incessant voice saying it's not quite safe yet. I agree with Ms. Lindsey; her business will come back and thrive, as will New York City. Working remotely or not, people will soon flood the streets of Times Square once again."

2021-05-03 15:12,"Shall we call it the Great Recalibration? Fewer patrons mean lower revenue, lower revenue means unpaid rents, unpaid rents mean unpaid mortgages and unpaid mortgages puts pressure on the banks. The 2008 financial crisis was all about unpaid mortgages so it is hardly an issue limited to storefronts. Everyone, starting with the banks, are going to need to operate on a diminished cash flow initially. Ultimately workers will return to the business districts as workers in infrastructure renewal (god villing) and as newly formed businesses take advantage of the repriced commercial market. It's going to be a roller coaster and we're all along for the ride, like it or not. It won't be retails problem alone and it's going to be fine. Actually, it's going to be exciting."

We still love it and drove in yesterday, parked our car in a garage and went to see Alice Neel at the Met and Hockney at the Morgan Library along with a cello and violin concert there.  Food for the soul for sure, especially after this past year.  We walked down from the Met along 5th Avenue to 36th St. and back up to Madison and 83rd where our car was.  So sad to see hotels like the Roosevelt, office buildings and storefronts all dark. I am not sure it will ever come back with all the changes with working and shopping from home. Cute though to see many children's birthday parties in Central Park and it was impressive to see nearly everyone wearing masks - the only way is up now."

2021-05-03 15:20,"Cities are eco-systems.  Their inhabitants  health are dependent on all forms of interactions. The combination of remote work and Zoom is like introducing Asian Carp into our waterways.  They eat everything.  Without people in office buildings, lunch counters, restaurants and bars will have a very tough time.  We have to value the kinds of interactions that the city ecosystem brings us, or cities as we know them will become very different places, perhaps not unlike the cities of late 20th centuries that became crime infested because even though people worked 9 - 5 in them, after they left to go home to suburbia they became deserts, quite dangerous for those who found themselves leaving work late, or out for a rare evening outside of suburbia."
2021-05-03 15:20,"There have been a steady stream of articles from the New York Times that you’d swear were written by commercial landlords. Remote work isn’t killing any business, sorry. Working in offices didn’t mean I’d visit the bookshop down the street. Working from home doesn’t mean it, either. I go to a store or I don’t, regardless of where or how I’m working. Remote work is the future. Tourists coming back to the city is the future as well. But no, sorry Landlord X, blame us for killing businesses all you want but something tells me it’s the rent you charge that’s killing businesses. Remind me of the societal good landlords provide us?"

So basically, they now owe $3.75 million more than what they paid for the property. And when the bank calls the note, the most they'll be out of is $2.7M in capital; an easy write off for the corporation. How is this sustainable?? 

As buildings get repossessed and banks deal with the fallout, I'm hoping to see major rent corrections in the retail world. Writing off empty stores should not be a status quo for developers and banks; this benefits no one"
2021-05-03 15:24,"Workers who are working from home are shouldering a huge cost previously borne by their employer. Rent for space to work. The requirement of higher heat in the winter and cooling in the summer. Computer and telephone supplies and access. Ergonomic furniture.  Workers compensation insurance vs. your homeowners policy. And the hundreds of small expenses an employer used to bear, but now has been shifted to the employee. How many employers just love this arrangement and are willing to silently pass these expenses on to the employees while shoveling in the profits (which are not being shared). I have yet to see one single analysis of this issue. Plus, to the employer the employees are fungible. To the employees, they can’t possibly be developing the skills they need to crawl up the “ladder” while being holed up alone in a makeshift home office."
2021-05-03 15:30,"It is inaccurate to blame this on the pandemic.  LONG before it began, NYC was seeing a huge rise in empty storefronts; it was an increasing local and city issue for at least a few years prior.  We were losing everything from mom and pop shops to restaurants, and finally even things like big box stores and banks.

The problem is two-fold.  First, landlord greed, which began the process, and includes the fact that, given certain tax breaks, landlords often have an incentive to keep storefronts empty rather than rent them for prices that might be fairer.  One commercial real estate agent told me that many landlords and their agents were acting ""illogically, irrationally and in a self-sabotaging fashion.""

Second, there is the rise of the Internet, and online e-tail, including everything from food (goodbye supermarkets) to household items, to specialty items.  When one can point and click and purchase from the comfort of one's home, there is no need to patronize actual bricks and mortar stores.

These two factors gave rise to a precipitous increase in empty storefronts years before the virus.

And while the situation remains grim, some areas are now seeing the opening of new restaurants, pizza shops, and small stores (though it seems that too many are nail salons).  This is almost certainly BECAUSE landlords have had to reduce rents to entice new merchants.  Had they done so in the years PRIOR to the virus, the economic toll of the virus might have been less pronounced."
2021-05-03 15:32,"As another comment mentioned, I would have liked to have seen the owners of the lunch places/delis and coffee shops profiled, not just those selling luxury goods. That would have been a more interesting and diverse read. I’m sure their profit margins were even thinner and (I fear) the effects of the loss of foot traffic from office workers even more dire."

But the two major disrupters int the retail business are WALMART and AMAZON (now a conglomerate)-- and I am ashamed to say that while I don't order online much -- never if I can help it.. but I can't always - but I do shop at Whole Foods and for drinkable cheap wine.  

OTOH we refuse to implement policies that would re-establish factories here.  The garment district in NYC  is long gone. (I order silk scarf blanks from CA- once upon a time I could buy them here.)

A suggestion for the retailers- move to smaller towns and cities. You can purchase a beautiful building for the price of six months rent. As for fancy jewelry and clothing; I buy denim jeans from Kentucky, jewelry from a terrific artist on Etsy, and I just ordered two gorgeous coats from a maker in the Ural mountains.

The couldn't afford $400-$500 per month to commute, spend hours on a train, raise a family and work in Manhattan.  They couldn't even buy lunch for less than $15 in Midtown.  Forget coffee.  When I was looking for a Manhattan apartment, my real estate agent pointed to all the luxury buildings that were completely dark at night.  One building had less than a dozen tenants despite a hundred or so outrageously expensive units.  Just idle foreign investments she said.  You showcase upscale retail.  Try walking down the sidestreets.  It's like a scene from ""The Omega Man."""

Hard to make that argument if productivity did not decrease when majority of employees were working from home.
2021-05-03 16:00,"Over the past 20 years, the powers that be (big real estae, finance and NYC mayors/government) proactively transformed Manhattan into a playground for tourists, the super rich, and the young educated/suburban transplant upscale demographic.

Luxurification/gentrification has been displacing long time ""regular"" non-rich residents and small/local stores and  businesses.  

And NYC refused to pass legislation protecting small shops.

The small stores that had managed to hold on despite gentrification could not survive with  the Covid shutdown, the continuing tsunami of  ecommerce and chains -  and now Targets sprouting up in virtually every neighborhood.

We've lost a longtime coffee shop, a stationery store and  much more....and sadly, a Target opened up.

There is mention that the ""young"" will save NYC....won't happen if the ""young"" continue to see NYC as their ""playground"" and have no thought about civic responsibility. and a NYC for all."

My wife lived on Carnegie Hill for 37 years and worked at Christie’s. Not a bad life, you’d think. But she hated the city the whole time. Maybe Atlanta really will fulfill its comical ambition in Wolfe’s A Man in Full to be bigger than NYC in the end. It’s easy to see how remote working could kill it for good.

To thank them I ordered an elegant lemon-blueberry cake from a home bakery whose business 'model' is an  extensive on-line 'catalogue'.  No more cruising a supermarket case and maybe finding what you want.

So I selected the cake, the inscription and was notified when it was ready. Now the model gets interesting. The 'store' has a delivery kiosk in front of her house with a cooler and lock box for payment. Drive over there, pick up the cake, and leave. Security cameras record the visit and for a fee the cake could have been delivered to my neighbor. My wife took it over personally thanking them for helping me out of the raised bed.

FEDEX, UPS, UPS roam our neighborhood and the empty boxes line the walks, ready for reclining.

I've used the same model for reading 'the news'. I get it on-line, from all over the world, avoiding tiny print and useless advertising. NYTIMES, WSJ, and WAPO are 'on-line' reads, delivered when I want them, not fished wet out of snow.

And these retail problems predate the pandemic by over a decade: the problem is gentrification — exacerbated and amplified by the shutdown. The truth is that NYC has been dealing with shuttered retail all over town: 800+ vacant storefronts on Broadway alone. Gentrification + Amazon + corona is the end of traditional retail as we know it. Businesses that cater to students & tourists may survive but many retail and office spaces need to be rezoned to address the city’s housing crisis"
2021-05-03 14:48,"The two shops shown as examples of struggling retailers are selling high-end stuff, and very little of it. The shops offer no interest to a passerby. The men’s shop that is doing ok looks to be stuffed with buyables, and there’s a lesson in that. As an infrequent former visitor to midtown Manhattan, I didn’t see much of interest in the shabby storefronts that offered no style and only Chinese-made junk. If the pandemic is weeding out the least capable retailers, that could be a good thing.  And if you don’t have a web link for sales and delivery, you’re never going to make it."

And there is absolutely no point in trying to stave off or mitigate the inevitable.  Now that we know that COVID herd immunity is impossible due to wackjob anti-vaxxing sentiment, New York is not going to be able restart all its trade engines.  Amazon, Toll-hikes, subway fare hikes, pandemic fears, cost of living woes, poor infrastructure are all pushing everyone out.

Either you are a capitalist or you are not.

Let us never forget that the poster child for America's real estate industry is Donald J. Trump.

Who holds the debt?  How much of it is owed to banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions?  How much is not visible because it is ""off the books""--until it defaults?

Residential mortgage defaults caused the collapse of collateralized mortgage securities and the illiquidity that resulted in the ""great recession"" starting in 2008.  What is the risk of the same scenario in commercial real estate causing another ""great recession"" that could reverse the anticipated recovery from the waning of the pandemic?

Not only are there no answers here, either from government or the private sector, but no one seems to be asking the questions about the impact of this obvious impending debacle.  This is ""whistling-past-the-graveyard"" economics."

Instead off riding a train, you go to your dining room table or home office.

Conversely, there are residential neighborhood-based retail corridors (i.e., Williamsburg, Ridegwood) that are thriving; their customers, the residential community, are at their doorstep everyday. All there if they are working from home.

I wonder how this is going to change mid-town and the financial district and, not the least of which, the NYC property tax base.

The can has been kicked down the road. If you remember the residential housing bubble, prices started dropping in 2006 and the crisis hit at the end of 2008.

Business owners should understand that tourist are no longer around like they used to, they need to entice local NYers to return, especially with restaurant restrictions.

I do wonder, however, if this might also point to a broader development around consumerism. Perhaps many people are simply realizing that we don't need to buy so many things. For example, this year my family did not purchase any  Christmas gifts. For years, we have said we should stop, that none of us adults needs a thing, but this was the year we finally did it. And we aren't going back. 

While we all need food, some number of personal hygiene products and home goods,  a lot of what is sold is simply unnecessary. Whether or not I am working remotely or in an office, I don't need any new jewelry and I don't want to buy a 12.00 salad for lunch. I don't think that I am alone and perhaps some of this is also a broader recalibration to consumerism."

Still it's very clear that it's not a friendly environment for newcomers, and riddled with hazards. The tenant protections put in place in 2019 are incredible - it allows someone wanting to come in to apply without worry that were just getting bilked for insane application fees, it makes the rules clear on charges, etc. I wouldn't love it if I were a landlord or broker - but hopefully if those groups think long term they may realize those protections might actually save them from a long-term dire situation. If people want to come in despite the downsides (of which, to be clear - there are many which is why the suburbs are going crazy) it needs to be possible. But we've got decades of building a system designed for efficiency in a market that no longer exists, which causes problems as the parties continue to try to hold on to the old.

When I read statements such as this one, I'm always curious as to how much of gross sales are left at the end of the year. Do these pharmaceutical companies have very high margins so that Pfizer, for example, might net $8 billion on its expected 2021 Covid-19 vaccine sales of $26 billion? Or are its expenses high enough that $1.5 billion net on that amount of sales would be a terrific result for the company?

We need to know the answer to questions like this one or we're unable to better understand the meaning and significance represented by gross sales of $26 billion in a single year for a life-saving drug of such incredible importance."
2021-05-15 18:16,"We should NEVER EVER share our most prized vaccine technology.  As Stephane Bancel of Moderna pointed out:
1) Expertise in mRNA is scarce outside of USA & Europe;
2) It is not easy to make these vaccines;
3) It is very easy to make mistakes & ruin vaccines e.g. Emergent BioSolutions; the blame will inevitably fall on Pfizer or Moderna
4) China would love getting their hands on our technology.  We cannot let this happen.

Short-term solution:  push hard to make billions of vaccines quickly and quickly reduce death, pain, and suffering worldwide.  See:

This is a dangerous political precedence that has no function, and can only delay worldwide distribution of safe and effective vaccine.  It is so far off from resolving vaccine disparity that it appears it is guided by malicious intent and is punitive.  Given the E. Warren and Bernie are instigators of this, and the sources of their donation funding, much of the misguided input might be coming from academic researchers that have been left far behind by the pharmaceutical industry, but also compete for government research funding.

As for patent waivers, I'm sure that people from poor countries want the genuine Pfizer or Moderna vaccines and not some rip-off, thrown together quickly product.  Rich countries should continue to pay to keep these companies producing their products as fast as they can at the same price as they've been doing it."

This sounds like a very impressive ramping up of production. At current rates the entire population of the world could have one shot in ~10. months just from these three US suppliers.   The fastest way to get the world vaccinated would be to get out of the way of existing manufacturers and let them continue to ramp up. Once the world is in a better place we can start talking about how to better manage future pandemics, including whether it makes sense to spread manufacturing capacity and know how around the world. The US should be proud of its success in producing life saving, miracle vaccines to share with the world, and not shamed for “hoarding” vaccines. Every country in the world would take care of its own people first."

I've a bad feeling about opening borders to EU as lots of people will have false ID's and covid-negative certificates.
Don't forget the Pfizer vaccine only lasts about six months, from what I've read in the media, so what's going to happen when these vaccines wear off, and don't forget there's a gap between the first shot and second shot. 
I'd be organising that aspect to protect USA citizens if you open borders to EU. Don't forget the more people coming into your nation, the more chance of them bringing in all the new mutant strains of the original covid-19."
2021-05-15 22:47,"The issue is not just allowing unlicensed manufacturing or providing the ""secret"" recipe for the vaccines, but forcing American private companies to reveal and provide their proprietary manufacturing technology to foreign state actors. That, and not the compounds' molecular structure, is where the value lies. Once that is out, there is no way  to bring it back, and tens of billions in investments and cumulative centuries of research and know how will be transferred away and ultimately to China. That we learned nothing from letting China to become a superpower by transferring prosperity from american workers to their state enterprises is very telling.

That is an astronomical figure, it looks like the ""herd immunity"" for the whole world seems to be an impossible target, especially when you consider that many raw materials and key equipment are in short supply and the coronavirus remains a moving target since dangerous variants are appearing all the time.
  Instead of concentrating all energy on vaccine production, pharmaceutical companies should work simultaneously on oral antiviral drugs for Covid. 
  Pfizer is developing an oral drug that could be taken at home and might keep people out of the hospital. it could be a game-changer. You don't need to go to the hospital to get treatment something similar to antiviral drugs for H.I.V.
 Vaccinating the whole world for Covid is impossible to achieve."

This is the way to go. Vaccine developers increasing their own production and working in partnership with other vaccine manufacturers. They have already made ~2 billion doses. That is extraordinary!!! Allowing other vaccine manufacturers to start from scratch makes no sense. There will be considerable lag time and bottlenecks on various supplies because there will be less coordination. Will these vaccine developers make a lot of money. Sure and I could care less."

2021-05-15 23:02,"I was vaccinated last Thursday.  I had a choice of taking the single-dose Johnson and Johnson or the first dose in a two-dose mRNA option (Pfizer).  The choice was easy; I went with the J&J.  It’s by far the cheapest.  Not only is the drug the cheapest at about $10 a shot (J&J says it's offered at cost), but the cost of administering it is half as much as the mRNA options.  Like the Moderna vaccine, it also doesn’t require special storage requirements.  

I wasn’t persuaded by recent negative headlines regarding this vaccine.  The drug trials were correct.  No one who has taken the J&J has died of Covid-19 more than 4 weeks after taking the shot.  And the likelihood of dying from a blood clot is lower than the likelihood of dying in a car wreck on the way to the clinic to get the shot.  I’m convinced it’s the best option for most people and the vaccine the world really needs.  It's one shot and you're done."
2021-05-16 0:09,It's not going to happen because you need two shots of the Pfizer vaccine every six months. There's no way these vaccines last any longer than a year so it is scientifically impossible to vaccinate the whole world because you need repeat vaccines. Commonsense tells me that. The only way to vaccinate the whole world is for someone to invent an improved vaccine that you need only once in a lifetime.

Why does the author not explain how patent waivers and technology transfer will solve “the problem?”

Yes, wealthy nations used the lion’s share of vaccines, and that is a difficult ethical and political problem.

The wealthy nations where these major pharma companies reside should give money to them (in effect pay them a reasonable amount) for their sharing and any down side that so doing causes them. It should be an all out global coordination to defeat the virus as quickly as possible.

There are people up and down the supply chain who should be rewarded for that, in addition to many healthcare and essential workers.
But vacating patents is a simply bad idea.
We don’t vacate Tesla’s patents to address the climate crisis by spreading EV vehicles around the world. Or FIOS patents to spread broadband to needy communities.
And our state dept and military are actively engaged in protecting IP from adversaries, like China and Russia.
This should be no exception.
A targeted foreign aid program could bolster lower income countries’ ability to license the vaccine technology. That would ensure the protection of IP, and quality supply. And it would continue to keep the right incentives behind the hard work and invention involved in new and meaningful discoveries."

The people working at the pharmacy seemed surprised I was asking for J&J.  They even asked me if I knew anyone else who wanted it.  I don’t, but I believe it’ll be in the highest demand ahead.  It’s a single shot that has been proven 100% effective against death from Covid-19.  It doesn’t get better than that.  There were 2 people who died of a blood clot out of over 9 million doses administered.  That’s not something people should worry about.  That’s more than the population of New York City.  How many people are going to die from Covid-19, because they missed the second dose of the two-dose regimen?  I bet it’ll be higher than 2 in 9 million.  How many people are going to die, because less people were vaccinated, because the two-dose regimen takes twice the resources and twice the time to administer?  I bet it’ll be higher than 2 in 9 million.  How many people are going to lose sleep obsessing, because they didn’t get their second dose at the correct time?  Lots!  There are over 7 billion people in the world.  The J&J is a no brainer.  It’s the shot that will benefit the most people in the fastest amount of time at the cheapest price.

These governments, however, by and large did not contact Pfizer to arrange supply, and when offered refused, viewing the mRNA technology as undesirable.  Note also that Moderna announced in October that it would not enforce its patents, and clearly this did not lead to surging production in India.  Insisting on waiving vaccine IP is not going to help get people vaccinated, and poor decisions by many countries - including the USA - are responsible for the death tolls and the spread, not what has been an exemplary effort by industry."
2021-05-16 4:44,"How about the Biden admin export some vaccines before making such grand announcements? Now that there is an oversupply in the US he will likely make some very ""generous""  public gestures towards poorer countries.

2) poor countries = little vaccination = still a huge problem

Certainly it is regrettable, but if the vaccines weren't capable of doing any good, that would be far, far worse. 

You can look at the difference as being a super big worldwide case study ... and the results show much reason for hope. The answer for the future is there, it just needs to be fully implemented. There's no bigger problem that we haven't yet found a solution for. The science is done, we found the answer."
2021-05-16 5:19,"Companies that successfully make the vaccine need supply chains to manufacture it.  Manufacturing vast quantities is limited to the weakest link (necessary supplies). If Moderna, Pfizer, and others are having problems with syringes, vials, shipping containers, raw materials, and manufacturing machines, how will more unequipped facilities increase production? It impossible. Logistics to administrate the vaccine in America took longer than manufacturing it.  Existing companies will be able to manufacture vaccines quicker than countries can safely use them.  If Moderna sent a billion vaccine doses to India and Africa tomorrow, a few percent could be used. Until the vaccine is a pill, the ability to effectively distribute it to poor countries is a joke."
2021-05-16 5:35,"There is a compelling reason for advanced countries to vaccinate their own populations first: to carve out a protected zone that not only serves their own people, but also provides a buffer from more widespread contagion. There is little benefit to distribute small amounts of vaccine, here and there across the world, while allowing rampant contagion to spread locally. That said, massive efforts to ramp up vaccine production from wherever to be distributed globally is just and prudent for all of humankind. But this does take time and money, lots of it."
2021-05-16 5:43,"We can not expect hoarders voluntarily start to share whatever they have in their boxes fir one reason or another. First a big population in many nations will die, only because the world leaders are extremely weak with zero preparation for pandemic. Unfortunately the big pharmaceutical will not change their apetite for easy profit , knowing that millions of people around the globe still need their product to survive. We never change. Money always is more important. The world was not prepared, and never will be. The multinationals are interested in investors. This is fact, and this direction is the base curriculum for big corporations. This system prevailed. We knew it very well."
2021-05-16 7:06,"The next Pandemic will be more complicated if we don’t find the right thing to do now. ! We need solutions. The big business can’t think about profit during pandemic. They can profit with governments, not with investors, because the pandemic. Maybe we need to create a “globe laboratory “ with the best scientific research and technology, where all countries have specific responsibilities. The money donation from each nation should be proportional with their population. Obviously this would be used exclusively for pandemic, and other times for other diseases. We can not continue with this kind of arrogance. We need to work together for the world benefit in many issues."
2021-05-16 7:16,"The question asked in the banner is refreshing because it takes me out of the local environment and places me on our planet. This virus is an event we all share equally, not as us versus them, but as beginners. Nobody can be an expert because we’re all learning in real time. It transcends capitalism and socialism and demagogues and labels. Most of the people refusing to take part are already rich and jaded: they’re vaccinated and deny it in public. Everyone else is ready to move on."
2021-05-16 7:23,"Judged by this article the Chinese and Russian vaccines are not vaccines at all. According to other sources those vaccines dominate over the western ones in countries with together a large majority of the worlds population, albeit yet on an inadequate scale.

A recent news flash in Chinese media revealed that China had produced 200 million doses (in a month, I believe) of which 100 million had been sent to poorer countries. But this is of course not news either."
2021-05-16 8:12,"Americorp big pharma has briefed brilliantly against AstraZeneca, the vaccine sold at cost. Unfortunately for the world AstraZeneca is the easiest vaccine to store and transport, that’s the issue."
2021-05-16 10:32,"I think the government should drive a harder bargain when it funds the research that leads to vaccines, drugs, and other medical advances. It should own at least 50% of the patent rights, and minor reformulations of the drugs to extend the patent life should be forbidden. We can't have Dickensian style profit gouging at the expense of public health."
2021-05-16 12:16,The fact that the raw materials are in short supply has gotten very little coverage.  This brings to mind many questions in my mind- the amount of energy needed to store and ship them.  Vaccination is indeed important and we must keep this in mind and not devastate our forests where many of the raw materials come from.  Let's look at the whole picture rather than continue our shortsightedness.
2021-05-16 10:52,"The old movie “The Shoes of a Fisherman” keeps coming to my mind.

Right, and trust unvaccinated persons to suddenly start wearing masks? The antimaskers at my workplace were already wearing the completely useless mesh masks the first day of the new ordinances. Foolish and deadly new mandates. Heaven help us all."
2021-05-16 7:25,"The pharmaceutical companies are no saints, but neither are they the scapegoat for all the world's problems. When Dr. Beyer says this:

The world should not put poorer countries “in this position of essentially having to go begging, or waiting for donations of small amounts of vaccine,” said Dr. Chris Beyrer, senior scientific liaison to the Covid-19 Prevention Network. “The model of charity is, I think, an unacceptable model.”

I would remind everyone that poorer countries go begging for clean water, new schools, vaccines and treatments for diseases beyond Covid, and debt relief. To vaccinate the world, pharmaceutical companies will have to give a little, but so will all the competing interests and the G7 is going to have to step up and lead."
2021-05-16 6:46,"The idea of waiving vaccine patents to underdeveloped countries make little sense unless we can be sure that the approprate transfer of technology and implementing actual production can be done in a reasonable time, like a couple of months at most. 

Just off the top of my head, this would seem impossible, say, that a small country or kingdom or Africa  or South America or Central Asia can do this.

For these countries, the best thing is to directly supply them with vaccines on a non-profit or discount basis. Companies like Pfizer and Moderna would be gaining billions of dollars worth of good will not only in these receving countries but as well as in the USA.

So there needs to be at least two solutions: One for underdeveloped smaller countries who do not have the means to produce the vaccines quickly, and another solution for more wealthy and advanced countries. That is the more difficult solution and may require some degree of patent waivers.

But guaranteed, this is a problem that cannot be answered with a one-size-fits-all solution."
2021-05-16 4:26,"Sorry. Not going to fret about this.

So far:

1.  Biden admin has expressed intentions to share. Somehow. (And with all their many year experience, they should know how to deal with huge, multinational corporations.)
2.  They have demonstrated competence (frankly skill) in the whole COVID rollout here.

They will figure it out. They have good intentions. (No family grifting with uneducated friends!)

Don’t we all sleep so much better lately?"
2021-05-16 5:11,"Let's think about some of the possibilities, based on some preliminary facts we know about the coronavirus:

(1) It mutates relatively quickly.
(2) The mutation can increase the likelihood of infection, though not necessarily severe health conditions. There is however a small chance it can do so.
(3) Infected people develop health conditions that are lasting of which there are multiple, many of which are still uncertain.

If the vaccine technology is not shared, and the ability to make it is not ramped up sufficiently, infections will continue in the developing world unabated, and the virus will mutate. 

If it mutates there is a chance the virus will leak back to vaccinated countries, causing outbreaks. These are manageable, but there is no guarantee that the virus will be vaccine protected for future variants. That's why they are talking about booster shots now. If the developed countries want to prevent that from happening for as long as it takes, some technologies should be shared. This does not mean all aspects of how to make a mRNA vaccine needs to, but some technology that can help produce the vaccine quickly, that will make a difference. You're helping others to help yourself, in other words."

2021-05-16 15:09,"The US must end its embargo on exporting vaccines. The cynical and counterproductive proposition to waive patent rights will only delay vaccinations. It would take months, if not years, to ramp up production of vaccines and build an infrastructure to support that industry. Countries now producing vaccines can fill the need in a timely fashion."
2021-05-16 15:10,"This is a fallacy of only two options. The problem is too few vaccines for less developed countries.   Taking away the IP of the pharma companies who developed the vaccines may not be the only solution to the problem if it is a solution at all.  

The COVID vaccine developers are the experts who know how to ramp up production.  They developed a sophisticated and revolutionary new technology.  They are not all huge drug companies, Moderna was a start-up.  If there is capacity and resources to be used in other countries, then that capacity can be mandated to have those resources work in partnership with the current producers.   There is no need to transfer the technology.  

 If it is a money thing, then governments can provide the necessary subsidies. Transferring technology is simply having the vaccine companies subsidize less creative or competent competitors around the world.  Addressing such social needs are in the realm of government. 

Forcing the transfer of technology will have unintended consequences:

-  Vaccine production will drop when resources are shifted to less experienced producers.
-  The ability to address future pandemics will diminish.  The human and financial resources which are necessary to maintain the IP will find other endeavors.
-   Safety will plummet.  The quality control skills and regimens in the countries seeing a donation of IP are low.
-  Health will suffer as returns on investing in cures disappear."
2021-05-16 15:16,"If we navigate this challenge using bioethics then we should first respect autonomy. There is enough vaccine for all US citizens/residents. For those who choose not to vaccinate, their dosing opportunity can be donated to the world cause. 

Check the box prior to being able to cash your stimulus check. 

Your choice, freedom to not vaccinate is validated but not at the cost of someone else's choice to vaccinate (live, work, travel)."
2021-05-16 17:06,"The current crop of vaccines are very complicated biologics. They require specialized ingredients, manufacturing facilities, and expertise. It is not at all clear that allowing other manufacturers to produce them will do anything to speed their production and could potentially slow it, as the new manufacturers compete for the raw materials required. This can’t be compared with producing AIDS dugs, which are small molecules amenable to large scale manufacturing in existing facilities all over the world."
2021-05-16 18:29,"I've worked as a chemical engineer in pharma. Making drugs to high quality is extremely difficult - and these vaccines are far more difficult to make. 

So I strongly believe that just giving patent rights away is of very limited value. 

What shocks me is the lack of urgency to find a solution. People are dying every day and the pandemic risks getting out of control with variants arising and re-threatening even vaccinated populations. We need action, not statements!

This isn't hard. 

In the sense that, if one person were in charge, they could fix it. The problems are political, it's about getting agreement and collaboration. 

This is a pandemic! 

Why do we not have all the world's major vaccine makers working on this? The GSK's of this world would have a much better chance of being able to help make billions of doses in a short time. But nobody is telling them to. 

As for patents, there are various models that can work. The assumption is always that the pharma companies must just give away the patent rights. What about the government pays for them? Or the EU pays for them? Make it a limited deal, only until the end of the pandemic, only for use in developing countries, licence payment to the patent owners - and that payment could be quite small."

2021-05-16 17:40,"Let’s provide some additional context to the readers that this is about putting pressure on western governments and vaccine manufacturers ahead of the G20 meeting this week and the G7 meeting the week of June 7.  What bothers me is why the reporters keep repeating the old trope of the Aids crisis in the 1990s.  The easiest drug in the world to make is a small molecule AIDS drug.  You can mix them up in a bathtub and some gray market and counterfeiters do exactly that.  By contrast finding the 2000 ingredients from 19 countries for an mRNA vaccine, cooking it at the right temperature for weeks and then filling and finishing 11 billion of them is like sending a rocket to Mars.  So next time your reporter gets told by an academic who has never made a drug before this is a repeat of the aids crisis, ask them the following questions - for each tech transfer, the subject matter experts already making the vaccine need to put down tools, fly to a new manufacturing for 3-6 months to teach them how to make it and at the end of that period, go to the next site to teach them and so on.  And then ask them is it okay for the world to stop making vaccines for say two years so we can teach everyone else to make it and watch a world wide competition ensue for the vaccine ingredients with the inevitable shortages.   
The only real path forward is for countries to start sharing doses when they are ready. I believe the Biden administration knows this."
2021-05-16 14:17,"Pharma delivers a miracle in record time, has delivered 1.7 million doses and is already producing 400-500 million doses monthly (of  the 3 US approved vaccines) as it continues to ramp up production, so of course we get a front page article about why it’s taking so long to vaccinate the masses?, why Pharma is making money?, and how to strip intellectual property rights for the “good” of the people even when doing so won’t speed up production since the issue is raw material and know-how?"
2021-05-16 18:08,"Discussion of global covid-19 vaccine availability should at least mention NDV-HXP-S, described in Carl Zimmer's excellent April 17 NYTimes article.  This egg-grown structurally stabilized spike protein vaccine uses the same production approach as flu vaccine, successful in many countries.  This potential game-changer is currently in human trials in Vietnam and Thailand. We got lucky with the success of mRNA vaccines, lets hope our luck holds out for NDV-HXP-S."

I’ve gotten my 2 vaccinations, and if I need to continue each year hereinafter you get a new shot to be protected like I do annually with the flu shot, I will. I understand how there are folks that are immunocompromised or set against getting these Covid vaccines. Then they need to protect themselves and take precautions. Many of them may be sane folks who are dismayed if I can’t join in with their activities because I am immunocompromised to the foods they eat, beverages they drink, or allergens or smoke in their homes and activities. That’s because I avoid those situations and protect myself accordingly, as a result. I don’t expect them to change their lives for me and to stop living, and the same goes for us who’ve been Covid-vaccinated and need to return to our lives and real life."

In my area, with many tourists and elderly retirees from other areas, it seems unlikely, as shots are going wanting and the governor and other officials are denouncing the wearing of masks by school children.  I follow the CDC guidelines and mask up in stores even though I am vaccinated, but too many do not.  There is no way to know if they have been vaccinated, but it's clear that the children have not been.  It's likely that the Myrtle Beach area will see a surge within a few weeks of Memorial Day, just like last year."

The vaccine is still young and we don't know how long it lasts nor do we know when a variant will pop up that the vaccine is ineffective against. We will continue being cautious for another few months, until the infection rate is down to less than five people per 100,000 on a consistent and widespread basis. We are 70."

In the same breath, we have to hold back another couple of months.
I'm in total agreement with Dr. Walensky. We are not out of this dark forest yet and need to stay on the path that President Biden's team is showing us.

IOW, don't do stupid stuff like open up prematurely.  The number of vaccinations have to be higher and people in charge need to give it more time to get there.
