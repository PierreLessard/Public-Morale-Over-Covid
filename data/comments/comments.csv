2021-12-07 11:42,Thank you Dr. Fauci for your brave support for real science
2021-12-07 13:14,"Pass, this is over, much ado about nothing. 

The jig is up."
2021-12-07 13:53,"Goodness, isn't science fascinating!"
2021-12-07 13:54,Can you please write something about the nitric oxide nasal spray that was developed by the Vancouver-based Sanotize and which is already being sold in Israel as both an early treatment and a prophylactic? I would love to know if it works as advertised.
2021-12-07 14:26,"Wanna be empidemiologists, take notes! You'll fail the test anyway."
2021-12-07 12:43,"What about the drugs that already exist that have successfully treated hundreds of thousands of people, and done so for pennies? Why is there no mention of this?"
2021-12-07 13:59,"Twelve cheers for science and for funding scientific and academic research, including the ""big, bad government"" !

Omicron appears to be a harmless variant that produces mild symptoms, relatively speaking....but we don't know what the next variant holds.

There is a chance that Omicron will spread so quickly that it may just provide that illusive herd immunity we've been unable to achieve due to the anti-vaxx Flat Earth movement.

Omicron could be the last throes of this coronavirus pandemic."
2021-12-07 14:47,"we have been told for months that covid would eventually become endemic.  Now omicron (so far) is leading to ""cold-like symptoms"".  If there was one severe hospitalization from it we would have heard by now (thanks media).  Is this the weakened beginning of the end?  Doomsayers will tell you no but the optimist in me thinks if Fauci goes public with an 'omicron so far so good' we maybe on to something here..."
2021-12-07 13:35,"""As the world worries that the Omicron coronavirus variant may cause a surge of cases and weaken vaccines,""

This type of hype is really a problem. I understand the goal is to set up the ""solution"" of antivirals with significant side effects, but the main reason the ""world worries"" is thanks to the collective media freak out hoping for more clicks and eyeballs."
2021-12-07 15:09,"Can we finally abandon the term
‘drug cocktail’? There is nothing in the least enjoyable about this—and a cocktail is a drink. ‘Combination’ works just as well."
2021-12-07 13:32,"It's ironic that people that refused to get vaccinated might receive molnupravir in they become ill with Covid-19.  The approval of this drug for this purpose was clearly rushed through, and the possible side effects appear to be far worse than those statiscally caused by the vaccines."
2021-12-07 13:53,"Just a housekeeper question: Will taxpayers be stuck with the tab of these miracle pills for citizens who refused to get the vaccines that have been freely provided for all Americans? It’s highly unlikely that given a choice, insurance companies are willingly going to absorb the cost of such expensive optional treatments when a free shot  has simply been ignored. However, now we’re being informed about this innovative oral alternative, and (as usual) we’re provided no insights as to how the “average Joe” who has utilized his freedom and liberty to refuse the COVID vaccination, will almost certainly opt for and expect to receive this latest life saver when hit with the threat of severe illness or possible death,"
2021-12-07 13:09,"Generally I'm your typical aging boomer cynic. But this brief summary of the truly stunning progress in virology over the last 18 months is apparent even to those with the most rudimentary knowledge of the field. This pandemic may be spawning one of the greatest silver-linings in the history of humanity: as impressive as was the first ever rapid development of effective vaccines in the first year of a pandemic (and the proof-of-concept of the mRNA-template model), the likelihood of oral medications against whole classes of viruses is of much greater consequence.

We bemoan so much.

The developments show true promise to reduce humanity's suffering."
2021-12-07 13:22,"We have been on the defense against COVID for two years with masks and vaccines. We are about to go on the offense by popping pills, no less. Something a lot of Americans are already good at."
2021-12-07 13:58,"The development of these pills was financed by our government grants, cost the company $17 for a course of treatment to manufacture but we are charged hundreds of dollars by the company... not right!"
2021-12-07 13:19,"The new drugs will be meaningful when the biden administration decides to fully commit to buying enough to make them an option for all, not just those at highest risk. if there is a viable treatment that reduces death, hospitalization, and duration of illness, every American deserves access."
2021-12-07 13:52,I was first happy to read the titles that two oral drugs can reduce virus deaths. And then I read the context that critical timing and side effects could influence the effectiveness and usefulness of these drugs. We need field test data to approve these two drugs. Lab tests are not enough.
2021-12-07 14:14,"Please don't call those drugs ""convenient"". They will cost hundreds, maybe even thousands of dollars. And they need to provided in a very early stage when 9 out of 10 patients will experience spontaneous recovery anyway.

Add to that the side effects and quite likely most people will prefer not to use them."
2021-12-07 14:37,"My fear is that anti-vaxxers will see therapeutics as an alternative to vaccinations.  They aren't because they'll do little to limit the spread of the virus.

Therapeutics are an important tools in protecting individuals from hospitalization and death, but will not be effective against the spread of the virus.  Contagious people may never develop symptoms and these people would never take these drugs.   Even for symptomatic patients, they'll be contagious well before the symptoms appear and will continue to be contagious even after the treatment starts.

With our country awash in coronavirus, it's too late for standard public health measures like contact tracing.  The only way to slow the spread and end the pandemic in the US is to get vaccinated.  Like all vaccines, these are not 100% effective, but in the vast majority of cases, they'll prevent the disease from taking hold in the first place.  And I tell you this as a biochemistry professor with 40 years of experience."
2021-12-07 14:38,"The Pfizer drug will work. Its development was totally predictable by anyone who was associated with the development of antiviral drugs. The pathway and the drugs precursors were already clearly defined by earlier work on HIV, rhinovirus, MERS and SARS. It is highly likely that other drugs of the same class will soon follow. The tragedy is that any good scientist could have told you what was about to happen if someone had asked. If the process and its development had been nationalized (sort of like a Manhattan Project) the availability of a good antiviral drug could have been accelerated by several months."
2021-12-07 14:46,The FDA is again too late and too slow. The winter surge was here 2 weeks ago. The FDA needs to stop obstructing scientists at Pfizer and Merck who know what they are doing. Even after approval it will take additional weeks to distribute to pharmacies. Almost one million dead in this pandemic and the FDA moves at the speed of a giant tortoise.
2021-12-07 15:14,"This is very promising.  The key to surviving this if you are vulnerable like my son is to stay uninfected until more tools are available.  If people would get vaccinated and wear masks, it could help my son survive this pandemic long enough to get treatment if he gets infected.  This is very personal for me and for so many.  I just ask that you make a small effort toward safety for the sake of people like him."
2021-12-07 14:07,"What hasn't been mentioned is the enormous impact these treatments will have on those with suppressed immune systems. For vaccines to work, a person has to have a competent immune system. Without one, having a vaccine is like having a car with no gas. These pills work independently from the immune system which will be especially helpful for those without a competent one."
2021-12-07 15:05,"If an antiviral must be taken within 5 days of symptoms, will doctors prescribe the antiviral medication prior to receipt of a PCR test result?  Free PCR tests are taking as long as 5-6 days to report results, and the price of ""quick"" PCR testing is prohibitive and can be difficult to find nearby."
2021-12-07 15:10,"The distribution of such covid cures as pills could help especially the third world battling with the pandemic, especially if the covid treatment as an injection has raised some concerns in the less developed countries for variety of reasons and logistical concerns associated with the distribution of the vaccines."
2021-12-07 12:51,"The Covid pandemic has been a lot of things, but one thing it clearly has been, and continues to be, is a financial gold mine for the pharma companies. While we applaud the advances and benefits of the vaccines and drugs, we must realize that they are all being developed without a deep understanding of the virus itself (origins and evolutionary cycles).  

It was Dr. Fauci that stated early on (I know, he has said many things and some of it he has gone back later and then said the opposite) that the virus is likely to weaken as time passes.  If that is the case, we need to be careful about hyper-promotion of the dangers of new mutations without really knowing about the dangers. By over-promoting dangers that may not be present, we drive the pharmaceutical companies to provide remedies that may not be needed but will have to be paid for."
2021-12-07 12:32,"As long as people can afford the medicine course, it will be useful. At $500 per course, it's not cheap. However that's considerably less than an overnight in a hospital.

The question looms: will anti-vaxxers take a cure from the same companies that make the vaccine they have been told leaves a tracking chip in them?

Would a false notion that the ventilators were adding Martian DNA to anti-vaxxers' systems keep them from clogging hospitals? 

The best way forward is prevention. That happens when people are vaccinated and doing the responsible thing and wearing masks, especially indoors."
2021-12-07 15:21,This(These) SARS-CoV-2 médication(s) is(are) Band-Aid. It is not durable. Immunity created by vaccination gives the real stuff. Natural immunity from disease is wimpy. Get vaccinated folks.
2021-12-07 15:27,"Mercy drug passed multiple mutagenicity tests, but still, that mechanism gives me the willies. Any port in a storm though, I guess"
2021-12-07 15:31,"Why don't the drug companies just make one capsule that treats all disease.  
Why can't the high tech industry create a health screening apparatus, and include it in the metal detector screenings at the airport?"
2021-12-07 15:43,These new pills would work BUT we have a serious logistics issue reporting the results of a PCR test. A person could wait a few days with COVID before scheduling a test (those Home kits are also not that accurate) and then it could take 2-5 days to get a result. By then it’s too late for the drugs to be effective.   We are nearly two years into the pandemic and we are still sticking swabs up our noses for ten minutes and then waiting 2-5 days for a result. This is by far the most stressful and annoying part of the process.
2021-12-07 15:45,"No one seems to have noticed that the government is paying out $7.5 billion to these two pharmaceutical companies and, according to prior reports, will provide these treatments free of charge to patients. This raises two questions which need to be addressed.  (1) Since these drugs were already on the shelf and required only testing, is the amount proposed for the government purchase a reasonable one?  Is the government in a better position than the medical insurance companies to negotiate a fair price? (2) Does it make sense from the government's perspective to provide this benefit free of charge, since the primary beneficiaries will be those who have refused to be vaccinated?  Granted some vaccinated patients will also need this treatment, but they will have already received the earlier benefit of a free vaccine injection.  Have these issues been debated to some extent in any public forum?"
2021-12-07 15:46,I don't understand why preventative measures we know are effective are not shouted from the rooftops. Media and government officials should have and must use much stronger language. Additionally the facts of covid evolution needs to be explained to those ignorant of how covid mutates and that we have every reason to believe that a much more deadly virus will arrive killing millions of the unvaccinated.
2021-12-07 15:57,Start rumors that Omicron is more transmissible and more severe than Delta. We'll see a bigger spike in vaccinations and boosters. Use fear to get us protected.
2021-12-07 16:06,The structures of the effective molecules are fairly simple and easy to synthesize and therefore their cost should be relatively low. We'll see what the companies charge.
2021-12-07 16:19,"Over the years vaccines have prevented countless cases of disease and saved millions of lives. Studies of numerous antiviral treatments and potential vaccines for the Corona virus are already under way.  Science has been on overdrive to combat the epidemic. The focus is on old drugs  and new drugs  and the list is large  that can fight the Coronavirus. The advantage with potential old drugs, regulatory authorities can provide quick approvals and hopefully price will be competitive."
2021-12-07 16:24,"""I have argued for years that we do not have a health care system in America. We have a disease-management system - one that depends on ruinously expensive drugs and surgeries that treat health conditions after they manifest rather than giving our citizens simple diet, lifestyle and therapeutic tools to keep them healthy"". Andrew Weil"
2021-12-07 16:25,"""At a Nov. 30 meeting of an F.D.A. advisory committee, experts discussed the potential for the drug to cause mutations not just in viruses, but in people’s own DNA.""

It's ironic that anti-vaxxers who claim that the vaccine changes DNA probably wouldn't hesitate to take a drug like this, which actually might. More generally, vaccine side effects usually show up within a few months, while with drugs it can take much longer."
2021-12-07 17:02,"While we can all celebrate the arrival of anti-viral drugs to combat Covid-19 let's recognize the downsides.

Without a doubt we will see a rise in ""self-prescribing"" of this ""cure"" even when no positive Covid test precedes such.  Witness all the purported ""cures"" we've seen, including Trump's bleach chug-a-lug idea, to gauge how quickly even a ""real"" cure is abused.

And consider the on-going abuse of antibiotics that has had the boomerang effect of creating ""super bugs"".

So while development of Covid antiviral drugs is good news -- keep in mind there will also be downsides."
2021-12-07 18:50,"The single solitary reason HIV anti virals were slow to develop was because despite the overwhelming need, they were for the ""gay disease"".  Had HIV afflicted a broad cross section of the population in the US, initially, money for research would have poured in. Instead Fauci and others had to wait, beg, borrow and steal to get the money to the pharmaceutical companies to get the work underway. Even then it was largely unsupported by Reagan and his Moral Majority followers. Now, with Covid hitting everyone equally drugs will be developed faster. The HIV saga is a nauseating shame. Without fair, unbiased, government support  the cost involved developing new drugs is simply too high."
2021-12-07 18:56,"Generally having another weapon the arsenal against Covid-19 is very positive.

Perhaps there is a simple, more cost effective way to battle the disease: Name each new variant with something dark and even more ominous than the one before. 

""Omicron"" happens to sound like a Transformer that will blow one to smithereens. So far, it is more contagious but less lethal although clearly more research needs to be done.

Since Omicron's discovery in the US, there's been an uptick in vaccinations (a good thing): <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/us-covid-vaccinations-spike-as-several-states-confirm-omicron-cases.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/us-covid-vaccinations-spike-as-several-states-confirm-omicron-cases.html</a> 

Could there be a correlation between the newest strain's name and increase in vaccinations? Perhaps...

Maybe the next variant's name could be ... Satan? Cryptoworm? And instead of depicting the virus with spikes, what about horns or snakes?

""Delta"" doesn't sound as lethal, although in reality it has been.

It's all in a name... especially if it helps to get more shots in arms."
2021-12-07 19:40,"COVID is the defining challenge of our time.

Trump did an absolutely miserable job with COVID, through his denial of the problem and promotion of disinformation.
President Biden has done a fantastic job with COVID, but Trump’s cult followers refuse to listen to Biden.

The only way to defeat COVID is for everyone to get vaccines and boosters.

President Biden should also work with our allies and with the World Health Organization to ensure a worldwide program to help vaccinate poor people around the world.  Otherwise, mutated versions of COVID will just return again next year.

Imagine how bad things would be in the US and worldwide if Trump had been reelected!"
2021-12-07 22:34,Amazing science that can build molecules to attack disease in a relatively short time; one bright spot in this COVID catastrophe.
2021-12-07 23:34,"Merck pill not nothing, but not a lot either. Originally touted as 50% helpful, now down to 30%. 

Pfizer, if early study numbers hold up and are independently verified, will be the clear choice and have the most impact.  

I hopefully await the next news on that particular product."
2021-12-07 22:40,"All of these anti virals have to be used early. My experiences with sick patients especially men, they wait weeks before they seek help, sometimes until they are close to death.  The logistics of getting these drugs into patients effectively will be the conundrum."
2021-12-08 9:39,"""When molnupiravir encounters a virus’s genes, it wreaks havoc, leading to a batch of new mutations. ... At a Nov. 30 meeting of an F.D.A. advisory committee, experts discussed the potential for the drug to cause mutations not just in viruses, but in people’s own DNA. The committee voted to recommend authorizing molnupiravir, but only by a slim majority. And even the committee members who voted in favor of the drug expressed strong reservations, given the potential side effects.""

Every time I read about how molnupiravir works, it sounds rather terrifying."
2021-12-01 18:27,"""And a few hours after the positive test was received, Mr. Trump walked to the back of Air Force One and chatted with reporters, not wearing a mask. One of the reporters, who works for The New York Times, later tested positive for the virus.""

A tidy allegory for Republican governance. Nothing that is alive matters to them. Nothing."
2021-12-01 18:29,"Spreading COVID on purpose to further your chances to win an election.  Yes, I can see Donald J. Trump doing that."
2021-12-01 18:32,"Surprised? That an amoral grifter deliberately exposed hundreds upon hundreds to Covid? Not to mention his own family, abd that of his opponent and his family? 
Not on my life - which is precisely the point."
2021-12-01 18:32,"Shame on the Cleveland Clinic for not test Trump because he showed up late for the first debate hosted by CCF.  The debate should have been delayed or called off.  Trump probably arrived late on purpose to avoid being tested.  His whole family except his wife ended the debate venue without masks, even though CCF had specified they were required.  CCF officials were to weak willed to insist on there own protocols.  COVID spread rapidly in Cleveland after the debate.  My daughter had a severe case a month later."
2021-12-01 18:34,"Why censor the language of the former US president? The public needs to hear or read the actual words he utters, as offensive as these words may be. The voters should experience first hand how crude of a person he really is."
2021-12-01 18:31,"During the debate, the gravelly voice of disgraced former guy gave away that he was unwell. Many of us who watched his performance were reasonably sure he had Covid. And a fair number of us were also reasonably sure he was trying to give it to Mr. Biden. His uncontrolled raging seemed an unmistakable clue to his real intentions."
2021-12-01 18:39,Who could possibly expect Mr Trump to be truthful?  Who would expect him to consider the well-being of others?
2021-12-01 18:32,So if it’s true that Trump had a positive Covid test before his debate with Biden and did not disclose it one could assume he was deliberately trying to infect his political opponent.
2021-12-01 18:41,WHEN is this man going to be held responsible for HIS sins?
2021-12-01 18:39,Is there no bottom to the well of lies? We certainly know there is no shame.
2021-12-01 18:41,He knew he had Covid and yet continued to interact with everyone as though he was perfectly healthy.  Unconscionable.
2021-12-01 18:39,"Chris Christie said last week that Trump asked him if he was going to blame his Covid infection on Trump - 

Christie prepared Trump for the debates

Remember when the Trump kids went to the debate and refused to wear masks?  They knew at that point that Trump was positive and they were all traveling with him.

The selfishness and total disregard for everyone isn’t what’s surprising about the Trumps- it’s the support they continue to receive from cowardly republicans.

It never had to be this bad.  The war against masking and vaccine because of one man’s selfishness and vindictiveness and insecurities is going to destroy us."
2021-12-01 18:24,Classic Dotard!
2021-12-01 18:28,Trump lied? No way!
2021-12-01 18:32,"Clearly the most selfish, narcissist person to have walked on earth. He has no regard for anyone's life but his own. Anyone who thinks he cares about them is dreaming in technicolor."
2021-12-01 18:35,Please move on from this guy NYT. Aren’t there more important things to report?
2021-12-01 18:37,"Who cares? Trump isn’t president, stop giving him  news oxygen."
2021-12-01 18:31,Spreaders gonna spread. No surprises here.
2021-12-01 18:32,They need to contact trace and find all of those he infected and subsequently died.  Then bring him up on murder charges.  He knowingly spewed his disgusting Covid spittle all over Joe Biden and the many people in the audiences of the debate and rallies.  And all of his accomplices need to be charged with accessory.
2021-12-01 18:32,"Geez, that's so out of character for him."
2021-12-01 18:36,"""...like he was carrying a little extra weight on his back.”
Yes, the weight of being the most colossally incompetent person in the world."
2021-12-01 18:36,"Since he and many Americans called it the China virus, should we call it the Trump virus now?"
2021-12-01 18:30,"Reading this account on the day the Supreme Court denigrated and embarrassed itself by its brazen embrace of right wing/pseudo demagoguery (ironically as right wing women claim they don't want the ""state"" to tell them what to do with their bodies, i.e. wearing a mask and getting a Covid vaccine), it just brings back the awful memories, the baselessness of that malignant narcissist who basically destroyed our govt. over his horrific four years in office. How in the world has this man not been indicted...??"
2021-12-01 18:33,"“His face, for the most part at least, had regained its usual light bronze hue...""

Is that the color we're assigning it?"
2021-12-01 18:34,"Typical Trump tale, first one thing, then the other. The truth is so readily obscured."
2021-12-01 18:48,Surprised? How could any sentient being be?

Note to Meadows: You apparently don't understand how beauty queens maintain their alluring looks. The bronze hue comes from a jar or a tanning bed, not the natural glow of health. """
2021-12-01 18:47,"I don't normally wish illness on people, but I am willing to make exceptions.....

trump's posturing at the risk of infecting those around him is not excusable.  Knowingly endangering his opponent is criminal.  Americans have experienced hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths, untold economic damage, and political chaos as a result of trump and his ego.  Every Democrat should be hammering this home, and every news outlet outside trump's personal propaganda machine at FOX/OAN/Sinclair should be touting this through every news cycle.  If Facebook is still looking for memes to enrage people and serve as click bait, this should make its way into every user's news feed."
2021-12-01 18:45,"One must ask why the orange man was allowed to live - thanks to science - when because of his stubborn decision to underplay the danger hundreds of thousands of OUR American people died of COVID.

My family gathered on Thanksgiving and, because one person who was fully vaccinated had come in contact with the virus at his unvaccinated families' gathering, several of our vaccinated loved ones got sick with COViD.  Thankfully, as Doctor Faucci and other trustworthy doctors are saying in the news, they were only ill for a couple of days and no one needed medical care.

Meantime, my grandkids other grands in Wisconsin who were not vaccinated were both hospitalized with COVID and the grandfather may not live.  It could have been avoided if they had gotten vaccinated.  Now the unvaccinated people around them see the danger and are getting vaccinated.  Too bad it takes serious illness and/or death to wake people up.

Please people, do not put your loved ones in risk of losing you.  Get vaccinated."
2021-12-01 18:45,I'll wager that Trump faked tests and cheated his way through school.  Hearing that he cheated on medical tests is no surprise to any of us.
2021-12-01 18:40,Is this news? False positives are common and disregarded if followed by a negative test. A negative test following an infection demonstrates the individual is no longer sick.
2021-12-01 18:46,It was another test of character. He failed.
2021-12-01 18:43,"If proven true, this is criminally negligent behavior by the former president and every member his staff that was aware of his Covid situation back in late September 2020.  Trump not only put current president, Biden, in grave danger of contracting Covid-19, but also endangered the lives of a great number of people that came in close contact with him during those harrowing pre-vaccine days.

Trump has made it abundantly clear throughout his presidency and post-presidency that he is a very selfish and narcissistic individual, but this behavior goes beyond the pale.  As a nation, we must have recourse to taking some sort of punitive action against such callous behavior by people holding the highest office in the land.  If we can’t, to quote Trump, “we don’t have a country.”"

2021-12-01 18:42,Looks like we found our superspreader.
2021-12-01 18:47,"Given that lying is second nature to Trump, why would anyone including his supporters believe he would not lie about losing the election. Yet , supposedly 60% of republicans believe the lie--they are obviously lying themselves nobody can be that dumb."
2021-12-01 18:48,"Mo surprise, right? But why is NYT anonymyzing former officials of a former administration because they haven’t been authorized to speak? That’s just plain lazy - couldn’t you come up with a better explanation? Like they’re cowardly or scared to death of recriminations? Really wish NYT would show some consistency on anonymizing sources."
2021-12-01 18:49,“Bronze hue.”  Yeah.
2021-12-01 18:45,Ha! The Trump Fact Checker ain't done yet as it continues to tally his many lies.
2021-12-01 18:40,"Why is this news? The guy lied more than 35,000 times in 4-5 years. I guess he is genetically programmed not to be able to tell truth."
2021-12-01 18:39,"Just a tiny window into the amount of death and destruction he caused with his insane Covid response, most of which seems to revolve around himself remaining ""manly."""
2021-12-01 18:43,"This is typical Trump along with his thousands of lies. 

This is the manifestation of his typical corruption! 

Biden and any other sane individual would never have done anything like that!"
2021-12-01 18:44,Every time you think that man couldn't be more narcissistic and callous he proves you wrong.
2021-12-01 18:45,Let me not say it.
2021-12-01 18:52,"I suspect testing fraud! I demand a recount. Or audit!  
Get those bozos who did the Arizona thing.
Check for bamboo, too. After all, it all started in China, right?"
2021-12-01 18:53,"This failed former president, is a disgrace. Why are we shocked that a diminished human being like him with a proven record of lying to the public, put lives in jeopardy once again. He is a consummate failure."
2021-12-01 18:49,"From this reckless disregard for the health and safety of those around him to his appointment of Republican federal judges who are now striking down vaccine mandates FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS, the Republican Party has become a death cult."
2021-12-01 18:50,"“His face, for the most part at least, had regained its usual light bronze hue..."" 

So he put on more spray tan?"
2021-12-01 18:58,"Just like he didn’t care about infecting the whole country to get re elected, Trump didn’t mind getting his opponent sick, possibly die, right before the election."
2021-12-01 18:45,"BREAKING NEWS!!  Trump did yet another thing completely self-centered and lied about it, endangering others."
2021-12-01 18:46,Easy to believe. Trump truly cares only about himself.
2021-12-01 18:48,"When is this man going to be made to pay for all the dangerous, depraved and immoral crimes that he has committed?  Justice is long overdue."
2021-12-01 18:47,"Of course he lied. The only thing fake was Trump. It was a fake presidency. He had no idea what he was doing and he had no care for this country or the American people. A self serving, mentally challenged disaster,"
2021-12-01 18:40,As if we needed more evidence that this despicable man cares about no one.
2021-12-01 18:52,No surprise here.
2021-12-01 18:43,Who do you believe? Meadows or Trump? History would suggest Trump is lying again.
2021-12-01 18:56,"Every word that comes out of that man's mouth is a lie, including ""and"" and ""the."" (Channeling Mary McCarthy)"
2021-12-01 18:43,He does not care about anyone but himself. His policies (or lack of) and his personal behavior make him a criminal. He willfully spread Covid.
2021-12-01 18:40,"The former guy is selfish and a danger to humanity, and the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Of course, Biden is to blame."
2021-12-01 19:14,"Important questions to know:
-What kind of test was the initial test - Antigen or PCR?
-Was Trump symptomatic or was the test done for surveillance?

It's routine for rapid antigen tests to be used for surveillance among asymptomatic populations, and if positive AND asymptomatic, these are followed with a repeat confirmatory test (should be a PCR), which if negative, would overall lead to the conclusion of a false positive.

If Trump was symptomatic, however, an antigen positive test should be taken at face value.

-If the positive test was a PCR test (regardless of whether Trump had symptoms at that time or not), it should have been taken at face value. 

Any MD worth their salt knows that a false positive from a PCR is rare and airs on the side of assuming it's real; false positives from antigen tests can occur in asymptomatic testing (but you assume positive until the confirmatory PCR result is received)"
2021-12-01 19:24,"I tested positive from the rapid test, but negative from the test that takes a couple of days for results.  The nurse who called me with my results told me that approximately 50% of test results from the rapid test are inaccurate.  Why do we still use that test?"
2021-12-01 19:01,This only reconfirms for me how truly a worthless and revolting human being DJT is.
2021-12-01 19:06,"‘Oh spit, you’ve gotta be trucking lidding me’

Probably a direct quote of the soundly defeated ex-president. He has the best words don't you know. In any event, sickening but unsurprising behaviour by the ex-""leader of the free world""."
2021-12-01 19:07,Trump is a liar and cheat.  Why would we expect him to care about other people?
2021-12-01 19:19,I like how Trump throws Hope Hicks under the bus.  What a loser.
2021-12-01 18:58,If Mr. Meadows' can recollect details around  the President's covid-19 infection he should have little difficulty recalling details about Mr. Trumps role in the Jan 6 insurrection when he faces the  Congressional Committee .
2021-12-01 19:02,"The day after testing positive he attended an event with military families.  Guess this tells you all you need to know about his humanity and priorities.  And shame on his gutless sycophants; instead of “not authorized to discuss the matter publicly “, they should have felt “morally obligated to notify the event attendees”. Wonder how many others were infected because of his selfishness."
2021-12-01 19:02,This is  a typical Trump story - and there's nothing surprising about it. Trump is amoral - he lacks scruples and a conscience. And because his many supporters don't care - the pathological narcissist will always put himself and his needs first.
2021-12-01 19:06,"Mr Trump is responsible for literally hundreds of thousands of American COVID deaths.  He is totally contemptible.  But, we already knew that."
2021-12-01 19:12,"""The story of me having Covid prior to, or during, the first debate is Fake News.""

Oh, well, that settles it."
2021-12-01 19:14,"The pandemic has separated the intelligent from the stupid, the considerate from the wreckless, the evolved from the non-evolved."
2021-12-01 19:19,"If someone wants a negative Covid result, it’s pretty simple to just barely put that swab in your nose and breathe in. Even Trump could manage that."
2021-12-01 19:02,"Mr. Trump’s response rhymed with “‘Oh spit, you’ve gotta be trucking lidding me,’” 

 Really?  Why are we still shy about publishing direct quotes, even if they include obscenities? It’s false modesty, taken to a ridiculous level."
2021-12-01 19:04,Maybe Trump decided if he couldn't beat Biden by getting more votes he would test Biden's immune system by giving him Covid.  But that may be giving Trump more credit for strategic thinking than he is capable of.
2021-12-01 19:20,I always thought he knew he was infected and was yelling and screaming during that debate in order to get Biden infected too.
2021-12-01 19:01,So what? The bad boy of the world gets away with everything without accountability!
2021-12-01 18:49,"Why am I not surprised?

If Trump participated in the first presidential debate after testing positive for Covid, it shows how irresponsible, reckless, and selfish he is - putting everyone involved (including Joe Biden) at risk.

But that’s about par for the course for Trump, always putting himself first ahead of others.  A pathologist narcissist."
2021-12-01 18:55,"Just another example of Trump's complete disregard for anyone or anything except his self-interest.

That he would continue to expose others - including his elderly opponent Joe Biden - to this deadly virus is unconscionable. 

He should never be allowed to hold elective office again"
2021-12-01 18:55,"Why worry about having COVID when you are a plane ride on the world’s most sophisticated jet and/or a helicopter ride on the world’s most sophisticated helicopter away from being treated with world class medicine. A man of the people, indeed."
2021-12-01 19:00,"As the United States Supreme Court debates Roe v. Wade today, we learn yet another example of how Republicans aggressively do not actually care about the sanctity of life. They refuse to be adults and wear a simple mask to save their neighbors or families lives, but heaven forbid they allow abortions for women who don't want to—or economically can't—be mothers. There is no depth to their depravity and hypocrisy."
2021-12-01 19:06,"""He walked like he was carrying a little extra weight on his back.""  By the looks of him, I would say around 60-70 pounds of extra weight."
2021-12-01 19:16,"When dealing with trump news and with any statements from his loyalists, our default position should always be that they are lying."
2021-12-01 19:18,Amazingly old news that the former one lies all the time.  More a proven fact than the presence of gravity.
2021-12-01 18:54,Registered nurse and epidemiologist here. I remember watching the debate between Trump and President Biden and commented to my husband that evening that Trump looked physically sick to me. He had visible beads of sweat on him and glazed eyes. His skin color did not look right either. I worried that he might have Covid and that he might infect Mr. Biden. I wasn’t surprised when it was announced a few days later that he had Covid. He is lucky to be alive. I hope nobody died from his spreading the virus around.
2021-12-01 18:50,"This is a man who never gives a single thought to how his actions affect other people, only to how other people's actions affect him. The only thing that would have been out of character would have been Trump taking precautions to avoid spreading a deadly virus."
2021-12-01 18:52,"I hope Times reporters track down every possible case in which the president infected specific individuals, especially those officials working in his orbit and among reporters and military families."
2021-12-01 18:54,"That was the debate where TFG would not close his mouth; raging the entire time like a rabid dog.  Lucky for the world he seemed to violent to re elect.  And now we learn that that tirade was like the character in Dune who has the poison gas in the mouth.  How close to we come to losing Biden?  Can we be thankful for once that Biden is president, acting ethical, with the people of the US as his priority?"
2021-12-01 18:57,"I’m of the opinion that the main reason trump never wore a mask was due to potentially smeared makeup.  Which, if true, says about all you need to know about him."
2021-12-01 19:07,"Two things about this:

1. Disclosing this a year after the fact for Trump memoirs does not make you brave. I am (and I know many others are) very tired of people holding onto Trump scoops so there can be remaining bombshells to drive their book sales. The common societal good should trump (no pun intended) selfish greed. Trump put Biden's life in danger with this reckless disregard. Had these officials gone to the press off the record earlier, they might have saved his life by sparing him that risk. We are all lucky that the worst did not happen with him catching it too. 

2. Stories like this coming out so belated make me shudder at the likely many, MANY other horrible Trump scoops that we will be finding out over the next few decades. Expect some truly horrifying stuff, because if this could be kept secret for so long, I am sure there are dozens or hundreds of other scoops will continue to trickle out for the next couple decades at least."
2021-12-01 19:10,"No surprise here because there is no bottom. Trump's cruelty and narcissism know no limits. His lack of respect for the health of other people, our institutions and common good makes him the most dangerous person in our country. At some point, this man needs to be held accountable."
2021-12-01 19:07,I feel sure that had he had a mild or asymptomatic case he would have never admitted that he had tested positive and would have continued to carry on as usual.  He had to be hospitalized so he had to fess up.
2021-12-01 19:18,Well this revelation did nothing to improve my already highly negative opinion of Donald Trump’s character.
2021-12-01 19:08,"Luckily, he also tested positive for losing the 2020 election. That’s all that matters."
2021-12-01 19:48,"Woodrow Wilson did not disclose the extent of his incapacity after a serious stroke. Reagan apparently concealed his Alzheimer’s. And FDR concealed his paralysis as best he could. 

It is hardly unusual for a President to risk the well-being of the country by feigning good health. This is always risky, but is designed to bolster public confidence. If there are no disastrous consequences, history seldom comes down hard on the practice."
2021-12-01 19:22,"""Oh spit, you’ve gotta be trucking lidding me.""

Is this book written for third graders?"
2021-12-01 19:24,Pathological liar. What galls me is he is lavished with the plasma of a 20 year old courtesy of our tax dollars. Quite literally a pathological vampire.
2021-12-01 19:27,"And I am sure he even exposed his wife and son? The man is irredeemable, unforgivable."
2021-12-01 19:30,So he had a negative test too...
2021-12-01 19:34,"Of course TFG went ahead with the first
debate. And of course he knew he had tested
positive. He was willfully trying to endanger
his opponent's health. And of course he
would ""blame"" his infection on someone in
his orbit. That's what a man-baby does."
2021-12-01 19:35,"And, let's see when did Chris Christie coach him for debate? And oh yes, when did Christie check into hospital?"
2021-12-01 19:20,No surprise. would not believe him if his tongue was notarized.
2021-12-01 19:27,"This article provides more evidence that Donald Trump is a dishonorable man. I'd like to remind my fellow readers that the first Confederacy was lead for the most part by honorable men. Their's was a truly lost cause.￼ The current confederacy is being led by a scoundrel! 
In my opinion, putting Donald Trump back in the oval office amounts to a crime.￼￼ Let's hope that the Republican party loses big, everywhere. Criminal conspiracies should not be allowed to succeed in the United States of America!"
2021-12-01 19:28,"Why is it, everyone has to abide by rules and mandates, but not Donny? This special treatment is what is causing this country to split in half. How dare they but others in harms way. The sadder part is Donny's followers think it's okay. Who is more foolish. The fool, or the fool who follows?"
2021-12-01 19:32,"I remember watching the debate and wondering if he had COVID because he was so obviously sick. When the news came a few days later, I just assumed he was busy spreading COVID germs at the debate"
2021-12-01 19:32,Can any deaths be traced back to him directly?
2021-12-01 19:21,"Trump should be charged with endangering the life of a POTUS candidate.  Biden had Secret Service protection at that the time of the first debate, so all rules about danger to Biden's life apply."
2021-12-01 19:25,"The awfulness of this creature knows no bounds. How to account for the tens of millions who adore him? Not to mention his enablers, including the doctor, who knew about the situation and said nothing. Trump nearly killed Chris Christie, and a number of others got sick surely due to contact with him. Does no one pay a price for this?"
2021-12-01 19:35,Let's not forget that he exposed his personal Secret Service personnel to covid19 just so he could go on ride to show he'd survived.
2021-12-01 19:25,"While in no way, shape or form am I a supporter of Donald Trump - and yes, I have been fully vaccinated - what this story calls into question far beyond Trump's behavior is...the accuracy of testing.

From testing and the original source of the virus, to the billions being made on vaccines and medicines related to the virus...there are far too many inconsistencies and unanswered questions for anyone with a shred of common sense to accept what we are being told about the virus is the truth. 

I wonder if we will ever know the answers to the many questions that have not been permitted to be asked? 

For more information about the unrealiability of the testing methods, see the link of an article from this very newspaper:

2021-12-01 19:25,How would one expect a self-centered grifter and his aides to act?
2021-12-01 19:25,"Wow, Meadows is now sharing this story in a book that he is selling for profit after Trump exposed himself to others with a virus that has killed more than 700,000. Clearly, both men are self-serving and morally deprived."
2021-12-01 19:27,why is anyone at all surprised when he does unethical things? that is what he has been doing his entire life.
2021-12-01 19:31,The levels of deceit practiced by former President Trump is well-known but what is flabbergasting is that he always gets away with it.  And will be running again in a few years and has a decent chance of winning.
2021-12-01 19:31,"What? He lied? He has no empathy for others? He didn't care if he spread it to other people? What a surprise. And BTW, that 'bronze hue"" being referred to by Meadows? It  comes in a can or from a tanning bed, not from the sun."
2021-12-01 19:34,"The spreader of lies, disinformation, conspiracy theories, social unrest and xenophobia now turns of to be the spreader of the  potentially deadly Covid-19!

At least Mr. Trump has been consistent with regard to the damage he has perpetrated both to those close to him and to the nation as a whole. And he's still walking around as a free man!

This is not my father's America."
2021-12-01 19:24,I wonder how many more votes Trump would have lost by had this been known before the election?
2021-12-01 19:23,"In a statement released by his office, Mr. Trump replied, “The story of me having Covid prior to, or during, the first debate is Fake News. In fact, a test revealed that I did not have Covid prior to the debate.”"
2021-12-01 19:33,"Lest anyone forget, it was at this very debate that Mr. Trump claimed that he wore a mask ""when he thought he needed it"", while brandishing an obviously little-used mask and mocking Mr. Biden for actually wearing one.

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acSFjfyEx-o"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acSFjfyEx-o</a>

This story simply confirms that he knew AT THE TIME that he had tested positive for the virus, and was potentially spewing it into a room full of people with every breath."
2021-12-01 19:26,"I mean, wasn’t it already clear he knew or suspected he had Covid and willfully tried to infect Biden, when his whole family evaded the pre debate testing by arriving late and using the “honor system?” By now nothing should be done on the honor system as we know Trumps followers have no honor."
2021-12-01 19:30,"Why on earth weren't independent covid tests given at the debate venue? Were we still buying the fantasy that an honor code would matter to the Trump admin, or did the organizers simply want to have the debate as planned regardless?"
2021-12-01 20:22,"Everyone should know that they must read instructions very carefully. I also used the Abbot Binax Covid-19 test kit several times and am still in quarantine with the last of Covid-19. In the instructions, it is written that even a faint line is still a positive result. I know I have covid-19 from prior tests and one test was extremely faint and I used my blue telescope filter to enhance the pinkish line indicating positive. At first without the filter, it appeared as a negative result, but the blue filter, which could also be a cheap blue plastic film, revealed a positive line.  The test is a series of two tests used 36 hours apart. Follow instructions precisely."
2021-12-01 19:59,"At the time I thought Trump's behavior --- the wild hand gesticulations, the constant interrupting both his opponent and the moderator, bellicose and shouting --- was bizarre even for him. Later, when the news came out he'd been infected with covid, I wondered --- did he know before the debate? Was this an elaborate atempt to infect --- and with any luck, kill --- Joe Biden?

Silly me. Why do I doubt this sociopath's wretched, twisted capacity to wreak havoc and malice in the world. Arrest him for attempted murder."
2021-12-01 19:52,"As Bret Stephens says in his column, we shouldn't blame the man. What proof do we have that Biden wasn't carrying the Ebola virus at the time?"
2021-12-01 19:56,"This is sad and scary.  I felt bad for the President at the time and prayed for his rapid recovery, but why wasn't he quarantined?  I recall this happened before the election in the days of multiple superspreader events, before there was the Covid vaccine.  

Melania also got the virus, presumably from the President, and even Baron, the son, could have been negatively affected by the virus being spread all over the White House. 

Let's hope we have learned and are now masking up, especially with the new Omricon variant floating around.  It's only a matter of days before we start hearing about the spread in the USA, which is inevitable given the mobility of people across the world and jet travel.  Oy!"

2021-12-01 19:49,"Should this not be prosecuted as trying to actively infect your high risk political opponent ( because of President Biden’s age), with a deadly biological agent? Due to his known infection, he knowingly literally acted as a biological weapon by moving around in social settings."
2021-12-01 19:43,False positive effectively sums up MAGA.
2021-12-01 19:45,One never knows  the truth when it comes out of Trumps mouth or anyone who is loyal  to him. Frankly i am at the point where everything any Republican says is a lie. The Republican party’s mentality is based on lies and misinformation. This article about when Trump tested positive is just another example.
2021-12-01 19:54,"So COVID-19 stole the election from him.  He didn't lose it on his own, NOT.  

He showed real strength of character:  always risk the other person's life and well being.  Just what we expect from our leaders."
2021-12-01 20:05,"“His face, for the most part at least, had regained its usual light bronze hue”

Uh, that hue is not natural melatonin."
2021-12-01 20:05,Anyone who was in contact with Trump after his positive test and before he announced he had Covid and who then contracted Covid should sue him for whatever he's got left. Need any more evidence that Trump is a sociopath indifferent to the death and suffering of other human beings?
2021-12-01 19:51,This revelation ALONE should be ample reason to drown any politician. But alas…
2021-12-01 19:54,Of course he didn’t reveal that he was infected. Any actual or would-be dictator wants to project an image of infallibility. He was following the playbook.
2021-12-01 19:50,"Many people admire Trump for his determination and stubbornness, voted for him, and would vote for him again.  

Some of us admire covid patients whose last words before being put on ventilators are to the effect that covid is a fraud, not all that serious, an excuse for getting us all accustomed to following government orders.  Only cowards change their minds on the basis of evidence; real men carry on."
2021-12-01 20:04,"Once again, President Loser was only concerned about himself. Once again, he lied. And, in this instance, he put the lives of others, including President Biden, directly at risk. Yet, he is still the undisputed Republican front runner for 2024, the ruler of the Party. That is more disturbing than the unsurprising emptiness of Trump’s moral and ethical character."
2021-12-01 19:52,"This isn't at all surprising. Donald Trump has never cared how his actions affect others. That he would, after testing positive for Covid, casually go into a room of other people, while not wearing a mask, is pretty much how he would be expected to behave. He has always put himself first. The only thing he has ever done for others is losing the 2020 election."
2021-12-01 20:02,"Caught in yet another lie.  Anyone surprised?  Yet 40% of the country at least would vote for him again. And in stacking states' with pro-Trumpster election officials and officials, having stuffed the court system with conservative judges, restricting voting (or simply giving the impression of doing so), he could once more be elected with a minority of national popular vote due to the very antiquated electoral college system.  He's a dangerous man.  Not because he's particularly partisan or pro China, but because he's so very capricious, has few strong held opinions of his own except  to make money, be a showman, and now to gain power to further delay more legal actions against him, his children and his businesses.  He's a shallow man, not interested in the nation's well-being, or it's peoples, but only himself.  To him the lies are not important as long as they contribute to his own agenda, no matter who might get hurt, financially or health wise, or who might go bankrupt (so much the better to reinforce his ego) or even die.  Trump (with the likes of McConnell, McCarthy etc) is a danger to the continued existence of the great American experiment as we have known it.  The admired shining city on the hill will be no more, just a broken infrastructure filled with a very wealthy class who can buy protection and below them a new class of surfs struggling to survive."
2021-12-01 19:51,"Only in an ethically inverted universe could the Karma for a guy who knowingly exposed others to a potentially fatal pathogen possibly include:
- being airlifted (at no charge) to a hospital
- receiving free, state-of-the-art treatments not available to the general public at any cost
- being airlifted (t no charge) back home 
- being allowed to keep his job, one of whose responsibilities is to safeguard the welfare of the public for which he clearly has no regard

As awful as we ever thought Trump was, he's even worse. The idea that he may actually run again for the office he never deserved the first time should nauseate even his most ardent supporters. Wake up, Trump acolytes!"
2021-12-01 20:24,"Rapid antigen tests are generally pretty accurate when they.are positive in  people who have the coronavirus, while they are generally less accurate if the person  has the infection,  but  tests negative.

A positive test  is generally more reliable for presence of infection."

2021-12-01 20:00,"Typical of the weasel that he is. Trump would lie and keep secrets from his own mother. Trump lies about everything. Taxes, income etc... Lying about his covid status is just another lie wrapped in the big lie."
2021-12-01 20:03,Why would anyone be surprised that Trump would wander around spewing the virus onto others.  He doesn't care about anyone but himself.
2021-12-01 20:07,Trump doesn't know what it means to tell the truth 🙄.  Sad!
2021-12-01 20:18,"He should be charged with attempted murder, terrorism, and assault. Trump just might be the worst person to have ever soiled this planet."
2021-12-01 19:46,"""Trump had regained his light bronze hue"". I take it Meadows must be referencing his orange makeup."
2021-12-01 19:49,"Not sure why NYT jumped on the anonymous sources. Anyone close enough to the former guy to know this should receive considerable skepticism as potential liars.

The information is essentially click-bait quality for attention, but creates ambiguity and confusion, with no valid resolution.

It appears to be intended to impact Meadow's assertions in his book, for some reason.

We're much more interested in what Meadow's was discussing with 6 January insurrectionists, before, during, and after the insurrection at the Capitol."
2021-12-01 20:22,"It’s one thing to merely be a terrible president and a substandard human being; it’s clearly another to knowingly mingle with innocent people at multiple events — including Gold Star families — with the knowledge that you are infected with a deadly virus. 

He is reprehensible, but this is just one more heinous act committed by a grifter possessing a litany of heinous acts. Will he ever pay a price for his narcissistic, deadly behavior?"
2021-12-01 19:40,"Trump lied about his Covid test - it may be news but it isn't a bit surprising.   

Why would anyone vote for this man or support him in any way?

Mind blowing!"
2021-12-01 20:01,"He’s verifiably one of the worst people who has ever lived, and he could easily be President again. We have a big problem."
2021-12-01 20:14,"A malignant narcissist acts in a way totally consistent with his personality disorder and THIS is breaking news?  I’m just shocked I tell you, totally shocked.  Uh, yeah, no, not at all."
2021-12-01 19:42,I wish Democrats would stop treating Trump Republicans as anything other than the nefarious and immoral sociopaths that they actually are. Democrats are stacking the deck against themselves by adhering to rules and standards the other side doesn’t honor. It isn’t a game; it is a (literal) death match.
2021-12-01 19:46,"It's all an excuse for Der Trumpf's poor performance in that debate.

Because, if Der Trumpf knew of his positive test, wouldn't it be considered domestic terrorism to potentially endeavor to inflict the virus on potential head of state?

DJT jr. is already selling ""Trump doesn't kill people.  Viruses do"" tee shirts."
2021-12-01 20:01,"Trump had 5 rallies over the same weekend he tested positive.  Four were in my state of Pennsylvania.  Two weeks after his rallies with thousands of mask-less supporters our cases exploded followed by an explosion of deaths.  
Trump showed up to the debate late on purpose, along with his equally repulsive family.   They used the 'honor system'.  Trump and honor should never be used in the same sentence. Trump is an evil and repugnant man.  He is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths."
2021-12-01 20:33,"Could Trump - and Meadows - be held liable for knowingly putting large numbers of people at risk by allowing the President to attend events (often without a mask) after he had a positive test? More stories about Trump's dishonest, unethical and dangerous actions coming out as more insider books get published. Meadows should be held accountable for his unethical actions in withholding this information until now."
2021-12-01 20:31,"Not a surprise. If Mark Meadows is really the source of this information, which Trump has already called ""fake"" news, then maybe Meadows will be truthful with the January 6th committee."
2021-12-01 20:28,"Oh the lies, the shameless lies!

Who knows what else we'll about the Trump presidency!"
2021-12-01 20:33,Irresponsible.
2021-12-01 20:51,I am so very tired of Donald J. Trump's lies.
2021-12-01 20:53,"Most prolific yet worst Liar ever.
    Seriously."
2021-12-01 20:55,"Who do you believe, Trump, or anyone else on the planet?"
2021-12-01 20:52,"Trump is the worst and the media is complicit in trying to make him seem normal.  There is nothing normal about him and he is a constant threat to our lives, our democracy, government and country."
2021-12-01 19:45,"If Joe Biden caught the virus from Donald Trump, what kind of medical treatment could he expect compared to the former president's $1 million per day?"
2021-12-01 20:23,The lies and deception of the Trump administration continue even to this day.
2021-12-01 18:35,"also announced:, but ignored.....:

TFG's promise to send each of his followers a 1000% return on their  investments with him (aka: donations).

oh- and you get a certificate telling you what per cent age of the wall with Mexico you own."
2021-12-01 20:59,"Really, do you ever see this guy doing anything,helpful for anybody but for the spoiled five year old he is?"
2021-12-01 21:00,"This just goes to prove that Trump, the malignant narcissist that he is, has no concern for anyone but himself.  He placed not only Biden himself at risk, but anyone who came into contact with him. Disgusting."
2021-12-01 21:01,"I remember the stupidly small plexiglass partition placed between Trump and Biden at the debate. Some people then did protest this stage management flaw, but of course their words went unneeded. 

Thank God Biden wasn’t infected."
2021-12-01 21:04,Was there ever one day when Donald Trump never lied?
2021-12-01 21:14,"This is the Trump we know and expect. Please report the story but give him less column space. He revels in attention of any kind, as it gives him a platform to call out the ""liars"" and the people who ""stole the election."""
2021-12-01 21:14,"Doesn't this mean that the people who were around Trump that day could sue him for negligence and reckless disregard, whether they got sick or not? If you drive drunk, you're guilty whether you hurt someone or not. 

Sure sounds to me as if a lot of people would have standing to sue Trump for reckless disregard."
2021-12-01 20:14,"Hopefully this relevation further deepens the rift between Meadows & Trump. The January 6th commission should prepare the former WH Chief of Staff a comfy chair, a glass of water & an open mic…"
2021-12-01 20:38,"When Mr. Trump was first elected a friend asked what word could be used to describe his presidency.  Fear was my reply. Fear of how bad he’d be knowing that most of his businesses were failures (I’m from NYC).  Fear to be used in messaging to stir up the “base”. Fear of how he would make bad behavior “normal”.  After the last twenty months, I want to change my answer to cowardice.  Cowardly enablers who stood by as staff and reporters were infected by this virus. Cowardly medical personnel who did not blow the whistle on this result sooner.  Cowardly business leaders who did not open up their mouths against reckless politicians who have exacerbated this virus.  At what point, will it be enough for us to finally stand against this horrible, reckless man."
2021-12-01 20:52,"Is this a surprise to anyone? This man has no regard for anyone except himself.  

Everything is fake news to him if it's something he disagrees with or refuses to admit.

I'm grateful that Joe Biden didn't catch the virus from him; he probably wanted to infect Biden and get him sick so that Trump would be the only candidate and would win the election.  Oh, that's right- he did win- NOT!"
2021-12-01 20:13,"True to form, Donald Trump placed himself before the health of everyone around him. The selfishness and utter disregard for anyone and now today he lies about it."
2021-12-01 20:15,Could that be why he yelled all the way through the first debate?
2021-12-01 20:40,"Just remember: 75 million people still voted for Trump after ... everything.

We're doomed."
2021-12-01 21:06,More shocking news would be if this man ever spoke the truth.
2021-12-01 21:08,It would be horrific to catch COVID but to be infected by that monster would make me sick on so many levels.
2021-12-01 20:21,"Which test should I rely on?  I must take a Covid-19 test soon.  Should I take a PCR or Antigen test?  I am going for surgery soon.  Please reply, thank you"
2021-12-01 20:22,"The Rightwing strategy, led by the infected Trump himself, was to try to sicken/kill Joe Biden. That is crystal clear. Why do you think that Trump would not allow partitions between them during the debate? Why do you think that Trump kept up his non-stop screeching during the entire debate? Come on. It doesn't take a rocket surgeon to know that happened there."
2021-12-01 20:22,"If this doesn't prove Donald Trump is amoral, what will? He knew he was infected, yet talked to reporters, unmasked.  At least one of the reporters was infected.

Trump didn't care.  At all.

Former WH Chief of Staff John Kelly, a decorated military hero, called Trump, ""the most flawed person he's ever met,"" and that ""the depth of his [Trump] dishonesty is just astounding.""

The only thing more astounding is that Trump still has a loyal following."
2021-12-01 20:33,"Yet another reason for his opponents to hate him even more deeply, and for his followers to crow that nobody can tell him what to do."
2021-12-01 20:34,One could even speculate whether he thought he might be able to disable his opponent by infecting him with the virus. Whatever was in his mind gives another glimpse at just how blatantly irresponsible Trump has always been and will always be.
2021-12-01 20:44,"The lies just never stop.

And NO ONE in the Trump administration, not even the doctors, seemed to care who got sick, who died due to their lies."
2021-12-01 21:02,"I have a hard time believing the part ""then he received a negative result"".   It is an attempt to create the impression that his health situation at the time was not clear.  Remember that he called Chris Christie, after Christie ended up in a hospital suffering from Covid-19, asking Christienot tell anyone that he got Covid-19 from him."
2021-12-01 20:15,Ok! Who out there still doesn't know Trump is extremely dangerous?
2021-12-01 20:32,"What's another lie when he had already told over 23,000 while in office?

We should remember that he told us he tried to tell the truth ""whenever I can."" Perhaps the Covid test results  rendered him incapable of telling the truth.  It is possible many people told him that lying was one indication of having the virus. Many people may have told him that."
2021-12-01 20:37,"How is it that no one around him had the decency to speak up? Including the loathsome Meadows who is too prudish to use actual obscenities, but perfectly willing to stand by and cover for horrifyingly immoral behavior in exposing thousands to a deadly virus. Most of whom did not have access to the excellent medical care that the despicable former guy got.  I don't think it's too much to ask for Meadows to sing like a canary about Jan. 6 to atone for him multiple sins."
2021-12-01 20:55,He was in the hospital just a few days later. It was not a false positive!
2021-12-01 21:05,Didn't Trump scornfully tell Biden that he wasn't among the brightest in that debate?  But Biden had the smarts to wear a large mask and keep his distance.
2021-12-01 20:19,The facts show that Trump was infecting people for days prior to being hospitalized.  Just more of the irresponsible behavior that has killed over 700k Americans.
2021-12-01 20:42,You made my day with that rhyme and reminded me of why I am thankful that Trump no longer resides in the White House.
2021-12-01 20:24,"How long do we have to continue to hear about Trump?  He is gone, and unless the Dems do something about getting their voters out to the polls, he will be sure to be back.   This has not changed my opinion of Trump, nor will it change the opinion of the people who support Trump no matter what.

Let's remember,  had Trump gotten 45,000 more votes in three swing states, he would have gotten more Electoral votes than Biden and he would be president today.  Had Trump given $2,000 to everyone, against McConnell's advise to only give $600, that would have pushed him over the threshold.
 
If the Dems think that ""Trump Bad"" is going to win the day, they are truly delusional, if not downright crazy.  I read somewhere that the Dems are hoping that Trump runs again.  They tried that in 2016 by deliberately elevating Trump, and we see how that worked out.  

And Schumer going on MSNBC telling his host: ""For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin"" is as mean as it gets to the supporters that once backed the Dems.

I get so angry at their political malpractice, I hear myself saying they deserve to lose.  And honestly, I am beginning to think they just don't care if they win or lose, as long as they are raking in campaign donations and keep their seat."
2021-12-01 20:21,"I can’t decide who is the more decrepit.  DJT or his followers. He’s only one man but he has found a way to corrupt many educated and intelligent people.  Very scary.  
By the way his current sycophants are playing the media in the same way he did.  Say more outrageous things every day, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and get hours of free publicity.  The media interested in saving our democracy needs to consider covering these dangerous folks."
2021-12-01 20:54,"""The two former officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly ...""

Enough of this nonsense. What possible ""authorization"" could any former officials need to disclose personal knowledge of these events? One of the main reasons for loss of public confidence in the media is the number of stories it publishes based on nothing but supposed informants granted anonymity for spurious reasons."
2021-12-01 21:03,"How many people got Covid-19 directly from that guy or his kids? Without knowing in advance that he or his kids had the virus?

How many of those who caught the virus directly from that guy or his kids died as a result of that infection?"
2021-12-01 21:05,Trump was also leaning heavily into the podium. Makes more sense now.
2021-12-01 21:07,"Why are we learning of this low and where was the media when Trump went to the debate with COVID? Why wasn’t this covered before and during the debate? Why was Trump allowed to debate?

Looking back seems like media covering for Trump’s positive COVID status."
2021-12-01 20:47,"I remember vividly that it was reported that Trump arrived at the debate to be tested although that had been one of the requirements for holding the debate.

 He was probably hoping to pass the virus to his opponent."
2021-12-01 20:23,"Yet, Trump is still the one the Republicans want to lead their party and nation. For the life of me, I will never understand why republicans turned their backs on everything they claimed to hold dear."
2021-12-01 20:34,Welcome to the party of life.  Always the opposite with the GOP.  Living in opposite land.
2021-12-01 20:35,"One might surmise, based on Trump's actions just prior to the Jan 6 insurrection, that occupying the stage with his opponent 80 years of age might help his election bid."
2021-12-01 21:07,And still 74 million Americans voted for him in the last election.  That fact alone is breathtakingly beyond belief.
2021-12-01 20:56,He tested positive then negative and then a few days later was sick enough to be hospitalized? The medical establishment couldn’t do better than that?
2021-12-01 21:29,"Dear Leader would never do such a thing.
Inconceivable!"
2021-12-01 21:38,"The entire Republican Party is just as guilty and reprehensible as the former guy for cover-ups, lies, insurrection and Covid."
2021-12-01 21:40,"Why publish this? all things 45 are lies; he tested positive, then it was changed to negative sounds as based in reality as as the election being stolen... lies and free media coverage.

STOP reporting on the American embarrassments as news, if you must; move TFG to entertainment along side alien invasion; TFG has received more free coverage than any other politician."
2021-12-01 21:54,"In related news, trump tested positive for stupidity, bigotry, narcissism, etc, decades before he tested positive for COVID."
2021-12-01 21:26,"Why am I not shocked? 
The answer is easy because anything Trump does only benefits him. He cares about no one else. 

I remember that debate and Trump was sweating  and his face was beet red. I mentioned to my husband that he looked sick. Trump is a danger to democracy, the rule of law and to all people around him. 

And yet Republicans bow to him to get his approval. 
That is truly shocking and disgusting."
2021-12-01 21:27,WHY IS THIS NEWS??? Can we please move on from this buffoon after being over-fed for the past 4-5 years ? Please! Enough already.
2021-12-01 21:33,It is no exaggeration to say that Donald Trump is a pathological liar. Qualified professionals have identified him as having one or more mental disorders (not mental illness). I'm thankful our nation survived his destructive tendencies. To revisit that nightmare would be insane.
2021-12-01 21:22,Just imagine what we do not know about Trump.  Scary.
2021-12-01 21:22,"If he says FAKE NEWS, we know it is more than likely true."
2021-12-01 21:24,"What a strange irony that this comes out on the same day that Amy Coney Barrett is very likely working to undo the right to abortion in this country under the guise of being ""pro-life."" Against all reasonable advice, she brought her mask-less family to the Rose Garden event where Trump, her patron, knowingly exposed them all to a potentially deadly virus. Such reverence for life!"
2021-12-01 22:03,"A fine group of Trump medical drones and enablers who keep the sickness secret on the eve of the elections. They are as morally sick, as the sick one himself."
2021-12-01 22:04,"When trump gets a test result he doesn't like he always goes  for the ""do-over"" and works twice as hard to rig it in his favor. What you wanna bet the 2nd test was faked?"
2021-12-01 22:14,Of course?  Should we be surprised?
2021-12-01 21:39,"How surprising, given that Donald John Trump was the most truthful president in the history of the United States."
2021-12-01 21:26,Trump is quite good at making grossly wrong ethical and moral choices when choices are thrust upon him.
2021-12-01 21:53,I think many of us agree that Trump is absolutely immoral and a horrible person. But the real story has more to do regarding Mr. Meadow's ongoing fealty to Trump and refusal to do what's in the best interest of both his country and his constituents.
2021-12-01 21:59,"This only confirms what was surmised at the time: he wouldn't be tested, because he already had been and it was positive.  It was very sad to see his family unmask and refuse the Cleveland Clinic personnel's instructions to wear masks at the debate.  Please take heed, America, and do not let this clown back in your life."
2021-12-01 21:54,"Trump, as we know, has no sense of patriotism or obligation to anyone other than himself.  He is a threat to us all.  Those who served him haven't served the country well.  Please don't buy Meadows' book."
2021-12-01 21:16,"This new report further confirms that Donald J Trump has no concern for anyone else but himself, and therefore totally unqualified for public office.

The idea that a sitting American President would deliberately spread disease and death among Americans including his own family, is not just a sign of selfish incompetence but of an alarming sociopathic disorder.

As a nation we cannot allow a psychologically challenged individual with imbecilic proclivities to remain a focus of public discourse, or a distraction to our constitutional order. The fact that this occurred and continues to be a relevant topic is testament to the fact that we all as electorate are ailing, or at least a significant number of us."
2021-12-01 21:17,"Since Trump knew or should have known Joe Biden had comorbidity and at the age of 77 was a member of the highly vulnerable class of people likely to be hospitalized, ventilated, intubated, and interred in makeshift morgues,  perhaps Garland can add to his list of crimes committed by the former president, attempted homicide by way of covid breath. He knew how easily transmitted this disease was. Just ask Woodward."
2021-12-01 21:24,"Trump’s character and narcissism was known even as a reality show celebrity before he entered politics, from his personal life and business life, and lies about birtherism, ads against Central Park 5, lawsuits in business, bankruptcy, etc.

This was in full display during his run, with more lies, refusal to release tax returns, treatment of women, the tape from access Hollywood, etc.

People who voted for him were aware of his character and still wanted him as president. 

He lied through the presidency and about the results of the election, continues to lie, and his administration lies for him, as do republican politicians who are afraid of losing the next election if they don’t support him.  He continues to lie and to insult those that don’t support him or those who tell the truth.

Still, millions voted for him even after 4 years of lies and millions of Americans are ready to vote for him again and believe his lies.

He is a conman who is just exploiting and benefiting from this.  Why would he stop lying?  He has not had to pay any price or face any consequences."
2021-12-01 21:56,"People who knew this at the time had an obligation to warn people, very much including Biden, who would be in close proximity to trump. They failed to do so. If that’s not a crime, it should be."
2021-12-01 21:28,"To be clear: the former president had a positive test, and carried on with public engagements, and didn't wear a mask."
2021-12-01 21:57,"Many people said at the time Trump was trying to infect Biden. Whether he was trying or not is unknown. But the facts now show he should have been in isolation and his presence there put Biden and others at great risk. It was a reprehensible and thoughtless act, but face it, he put the entire nation at risk by not disclosing the severity of the virus in the early days. Trump  must not rule again. He is immoral."
2021-12-01 22:15,"If Trump had simply done the right (as in decent, moral, honest) thing, I would have been SHOCKED."
2021-12-01 21:42,So knowingly carrying a highly transmissible virus into close quarters with a political opponent qualifies as a) inconsiderate b) negligent c) premeditated d) criminal e) all of the above ?
2021-12-01 21:26,The expected lack of responsibility.
2021-12-01 22:11,"Trump underestimated the Covid even when the contamination became huge, people who believe in Trump's lies should worry much more about their own health safety than anybody else..."
2021-12-01 22:16,"Should Trump's Presidential Physician, now a Member of the House of Representatives (R-TX) be sanctioned by medical authorities for letting Trump be on the loose with Covid?

If you want to respond that the physician had no *authority* to order the President to confine himself, consider that the physician could have threatened to publicize Trump's infection; that might have prevented Trump from going out among others."
2021-12-01 22:34,And his family were arrogantly sitting there without masks. Let’s remember that.
2021-12-01 22:26,"Do not forget Dr. Conley, at Bethesda, saying it is not important when Trump first contracted the virus."
2021-12-01 22:33,the orange man is a viral pathogen
2021-12-01 22:16,It would have been great to watch him collapse on stage and then blame it on Biden.
2021-12-01 22:25,Who among us surprised by Trumps behavior? I recall saying to my family after his public diagnosis that “I’m sure he was positive earlier and kept it secret so he could infect Biden”
2021-12-01 22:28,"No doubt trump's strategy was to get Biden infected at the debate.

With all the people convicted over the decades of knowingly trying to infect others with HIV, trump should be prosecuted for intentionally trying to spread a deadly virus directly and through his mass virus distribution rallies that cost the lives of many Republicans - Herman Cain, for one who, like Biden, ran against trump for president."
2021-12-01 22:19,I'm confused. I thought Trump and Meadows were buddies. How is Trump going to react to Meadows spilling the tea on this covid scandal? I know it sells books (to Republicans I guess) but otherwise should Meadows be ducking for cover?
2021-12-01 22:29,Just imagine if a photographer had an infrared camera and took a picture of Trump at the debate.
2021-12-01 23:15,What else did we expect from this man?
2021-12-01 22:17,that explains his poor job with the debate - he must have been upset and thinking about something else.  Otherwise one would expect he would have spun circles around Biden as he did with Hilary
2021-12-01 23:08,"Remember how sweaty, red, and unhinged he was? Makes even more sense, now."
2021-12-01 23:10,"And apparently everyone is either so attached to their job or so afraid of the guy that they waited this long to say anything.

Anyone else reminded of the Twilight Zone episode with the evil mysterious boy who wishes people into the cornfield?"
2021-12-01 22:13,"Just as his cousin Mary Trump wrote: Trump is one of the most dangerous people in the world"". Completely selfish, with absolutely no concern for others."
2021-12-01 22:29,NO. You're kidding. I'm shocked.
2021-12-01 22:46,Former President Trump's Covid was different than regular people Covid. It has a special political spike of denial.
2021-12-01 23:00,Serial bankruptcies don't buy class
2021-12-01 23:04,"Interesting news. Knowing what Trump is capable of, you just gotta think that he was hoping to pass Covid on to Biden during the debate, thinking that Biden would be too frail to fight it off. I wouldn't put it past him."
2021-12-01 23:06,"So the pro-life party and supporters have no problem with an infected Trump possibly spreading a life killing virus , possibly that may have killed one, two, dozens?"
2021-12-01 23:22,"True to form, the 48th showed no regard for anyone else’s life."
2021-12-01 23:28,My conjecture at the time was that Trump's nonstop yammering at that debate was a deliberate strategy.  It was an attempt to infect his opponent.
2021-12-01 22:23,"When is Merrick Garland going to start doing his job and file some charges against Trump and Giuliani for what they did last November-December-January?

If Garland is not up to the job, he should resign."
2021-12-01 22:24,"Trump arrived at the Debate too late to get tested. We all found this out when a few days later he was sick and folks started to ask his staff when did he last test negative.  That's when it came out that he was NOT tested right before the Debate as required. 
This would be the very event that the Republicans would pick up and pound into the news over and over and over, even years lated.  The Democrats need to wake up."
2021-12-01 23:10,"Nothing in this long ago story astonishes at all. Indeed, if you 
go back and count the days before he had contracted the virus, it would have been perfectly plausible that the results had been  known  prior to debate #1. 

But since secrecy ruled then as it has   for his entire adult life, since it is only through systemic, layered secrecy that you accumulate what he has in the way that he has, it was not possible for this   information to have been leaked or made public  at the time.  That was  accomplished because he was intently  focused upon surrounding  himself with loyalists and only loyalists. This is a basic  sine qua non for any committed authoritarian. 

As a result, this story reflects as much about  his sociopathic character as it does about those in the society, like several commentators to this article,  who see nothing wrong about his conduct once the two tests were revealed but not publicized.  

The salient point here is that if you can get away with hiding basic facts that reveal an essential truth, then you do so since you believe you're entitled to it,  your acolytes couldn't care less, and they're the only ones who matter. 

Unfortunately,  the latter group is way too large to prevent us from sliding even further into authoritarianism once his allies win congressional power in '22. Only those ""independent"" voters  can help prevent this since
democrats seem intent upon shrugging  shoulders,  qvetching that manchin-sinema got their way, and not 
voting."

Which would have impeded Biden from campaigning and even send him to a hospital fora long period of time Vue his age.

Trump and his acolytes would do anything to win, even if it meant contaminating Biden with the virus."

2021-12-01 23:40,"This may constitute a(nother) felony by Trump.  According to WAPO 3.25.2020:

The Justice Department’s second highest ranking official on Tuesday told federal law enforcement officials across the country that they should consider using terrorism laws to investigate and prosecute those who try to intentionally infect others with covid-19.

The guidance came in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen, addressing the many crimes prosecutors might seek to explore in the wake of the global pandemic. Rosen wrote that among the wrongdoing officials might see is “the purposeful exposure and infection of others with COVID-19.”"

For crying out loud, how much more reckless and selfish can a person be, much less being the president of this country?

I don't know why I am so alarmed and angry about this behavior.  Heck, he has a history being doing things and making decisions which results in more negative than positive and helpful results.

And to think the Republican Party still continues to believe, support and rally around this guy."

2021-12-01 23:55,"By now it's pretty clear that NOTHING Trump says can (or could) be trusted. His complaints about ""fake news"" should be laid at his own feet, since he lied more often than not. How can he complain about inaccuracies that he, himself, caused?"

2021-12-02 1:44,"Let history record that Trump really did lose due to fraud.  

He fraudulently stated that he didn’t have COVID and as a result of his participation and poor performance in the first debate, he lost the election.   If he had been man enough to admit he was sick, he might have received a few more votes in PA, GA, WI and AZ.  Frightening."

I could be wrong but I thought there was a strong chance he was trying to infect the elderly Joe Biden.
I honestly thought that at the time. I am not accusing him but I remember being very suspicious of that.
Can people assure me that I am wrong? Would it be out of character? I could have been mistaken. He would not do that would he? I would like to think that any POTUS would not stoop so low.. if true. It's not like he has lied compulsively at any time is it?"

2021-12-02 2:41,"I just rewatched the debate in question. Trump was belligerent, utterly out of control, pupils widely dilated when compared to Biden who was under the same lights, and he did his best to spew the entire time in the direction of Biden. This was an attempted assassination. Now, who else besides Meadows knew? The First Family who came in and promptly took off their masks and refused to wear them, against Cleveland Clinic protocols? The Secret Service on both sides? WHO?"
2021-12-02 2:44,"So many stories like this one about Donald Trump.  A source claims he did something immoral or illegal.  Half the country screams for shaming and justice.  And Donald Trump simply denies it happened.   Rinse and repeat.  Very frustrating.  Is he really that smart that he can avoid prosecution for his most serious reported offenses?  Maybe we need to face the fact that while he loves to dip his toes in the shallows of immorality, he never puts on his floaties and jumps into full fledged criminality."

2021-12-02 2:47,"Trump tested ""positive"" - that's the story.

Then he lied about it, whether explicitly or by omission. That's not a surprise, but it reveals clearly just how morally bankrupt Trump is in every way. We knew that, but it's always nice to be reminded anew of just what the true character (using that word loosely) of the person is.

There was a ranking of presidents from 'best' to 'worst', and Trump was as I recall third worst. I can't imagine what makes two other presidents rank lower. No doubt,  future historians will reevaluate that ranking as ever more evidence emerges."
2021-12-02 2:11,"Is anyone surprised by any of this? 
Mr. Trump’s only concern is himself, which trumps everything else."

We’re not shocked, either, that millions of Americans can and do worship him. He may well rule this nation, with a vengeance, before long. No shock there, either, after all we’ve seen now. It’s a burden, though. It’s a temptation to depression every day."
2021-12-02 2:36,The fact that he was shocked when he received his positive test result is incredibly telling. The man thought the basic rules of Germ Theory didn’t apply to him.

2021-12-02 3:04,"According to the Guardian, he was first tested with an “old model kit.” Does anyone believe the president of the United States, even one named Trump, was given an “old model” COVID test? What is that, anyway? Then, from the timing of events, it seems they ran the same swab through a Binax rapid test after he departed and called him with a negative result. Anyone who has been using antigen tests during this period knows you don’t use a swab twice. This story makes no sense — more lies, lies, lies."
2021-12-02 2:39,"Well, thank God for Biden's strength! It is amazing."
2021-12-02 3:00,So how many people got COVID from exposure to Trump over those days before he admitted he was sick? Did anyone die? He needs to be held accountable.

At the time HIV was more than likely a death sentence, so they were brought up on charges of assault or something like that. (Or maybe I'm mis-remembering).

Seems like Trump's actions are kind of along the same lines though."
2021-12-02 2:59,"Is there no end to 'revelations' coming out almost everyday about how trump did not care about the American people; could not give one word of truth or empathy to a nation suffering and dying of Covid 19; showed nothing but contempt for truth, science, and differing opinions; tried to scrap the U.S. Constitution in an attempt to illegality stay in office after an embarrassing defeat at the hands of Joseph Biden; and continued to interact with hundreds of people knowing that he had tested positive for Covid.

Enough. He needs to be held responsible. Enough."

This is not to mention if it kills people."
2021-12-02 3:48,"There may very well be instances when a democratic government needs to mislead the people (in the interest of national security, for example, to protect the nation); however, this was not one of those times! Trump selfishly endangered others around him so he could appear at these speaking events during a pandemic. And in the larger context of discussion, when governments keep lying to their people over and over again, people lose faith in their governments. When President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and the government appeared to cover up the truth during the subsequent investigation; this was the beginning of the end of U.S. democracy in my opinion. We now have leaders (and a military/industrial/corporate/oligarch complex) who think they know better than everyone else (including the voting public). Kudos to the NY times for printing all the news that's fit to print (although the Times too was whitewashed by the inaccurate and incomplete Warren Commission report). May the Times and other great sources of journalism continue to print the truth even if and when they get the facts incorrect the first time around!"

Every new thing we learn about the Trump presidency brings a new low that anyone with a pulse and a conscience should be disgusted by.

 The larger problem, though, is that in spite of all this millions of people still support him. As long as that continues, we will remain in real trouble as a nation."

I am so sad and very worried for our country."
2021-12-02 3:51,"The one thing Trump is good at is figuring out the angles. And clearly the political calculation here was if he cancelled the first debate because he had come down with Coronavirus, it would be devastating to his campaign, really to everything he had been preaching since the start of the pandemic. So once again there was no societal guardrail he wouldn’t run over for his self interest.
He is a sociopath (antisocial personality disorder) who has been terrorizing our country for going on six years now. I look forward to the day our country can be out of this abusive relationship."

2021-12-02 4:51,"When considering biosafety one generally assumes the worse - that a person or sample is considered infected unless definitively proven otherwise. That was obviously not considered here. 
 As a research scientist I've always put more weight on positive results than negative as false negatives are easier to achieve than false positives.  If Trump and his staff were in the least bit concerned about others they should have at the least sought a tie-breaker test. But they were probably only after plausible deniability and let's face it Trump probably thought that infecting Biden could be a positive for him. Even if it resulted in Biden's death."
2021-12-02 5:44,Doesn’t surprise me at all that he tried to hide when he actually was infected. He only cares about himself. Wonder if anyone infected by him passed it along to someone who wasn’t so lucky.

2021-12-02 5:31,"The BinaxNow tests come in sets of 2, and they give an 83% chance of correctly identifying a positive only if you do both tests 24-36 hours a part. So, he didn't even even complete that test. Any physician would have told him he needed to get a PCR test with a much higher sensitivity rate, i.e., that would have been very unlikely to give a false negative. I imagine this was the test that the Cleveland Clinic would have given him, which he conveniently skipped by being late. The ""honor system"" only works for people with honor, and it's unbelievable to me they would have allowed it.

At least 6 people around him came down with COVID, he may have given it to many of the adoring fans he met with at rallies that weekend whom he tried to blame for giving him the disease, and he put the life of the future President in danger. How many people died from cases that trace back to his?"
2021-12-02 5:46,"Trump reported to test positive on Oct. 02, 2021 was a blessing in disguise as it resulted in Trump care that saved lives subsequently. What Trump care? The treatment that Trump received included Regeneron' monoclonals and Gliead's Remdesivir both rapidly complemented Trump's immune system to block COVID multiplication. Also before Trump tested positive there were several COVID deaths due to underlying conditions in baby boomers and elderly COVID positive patients. There were also severe complications following COVID damaging lungs and eliciting hyper inflammation. Many were also dying of blood clots in critical organs like the heart, lungs, liver and kidneys. By the time Trump was being treated by a team of almost 25 doctors, the standard of care had reached its Zenith. All Trump had to do was consent to getting treated with all proven and still to be approved meds. 

A month later in 1st week of Nov. 2020 were presidential elections and also beginning of the second wave of COVID deaths in the USA. Trump care had not trickled down yet. Some of us younger than Trump were in vulnerable group whose chances of survival from severe COVID, were zero to none. Thankfully, on the day I was diagnosed with COVID on Nov. 12, 2020, Trump care had been approved at the hospital I was admitted to and I received it while I was struggling to breathe and survive in emergency ICU. Before I was unconscious, I had a chance to suggest how to care for me.

 NO NEED to PANIC over Omicron pandemic."
2021-12-02 4:57,No proof he had it only that there was a false positive - so?
2021-12-02 5:55,There was a reason why the whole trump family showed up late to the debates and “too late” to be tested. They did it on purpose. They did it knowing they would test positive. They did it in deliberate violation of the rules agreed upon for the debate. Liars and charlatans.
2021-12-02 5:38,Imagine my shock.
2021-12-02 5:58,"What type of person?

Really people.  Admit it:  Mr. Meadows is not trustworthy and he needs to be ignored."
2021-12-02 5:31,Trump is like a drunk who insists he is perfectly able to drive and gets angry if told that maybe he should be careful and not get behind the wheel. The big difference is that drunks go to jail if they injure or kill people with their acts of irresponsibility and they don’t have sycophants defending them with lame rationalizations and excuses.
2021-12-02 4:55,"So according to your anonymous sources, the first positive test was accurate, but the second, more sophisticated negative test, was false?

How do you know this?"

I'm  so utterly surprised. Aren't you?"
2021-12-02 7:55,"That Donald Trump would lie and put the lives of others at risk for his own personal benefit surprises absolutely no one.

That Mark Meadows dared to admit that fact (a year after the fact) is somewhat surprising. Profiles in (almost) Courage."
2021-12-02 7:05,"A refusal to reveal a positive Covid test isn't very far from a refusal to keep the nuclear codes secret.  At the time  (and even today), such refusals could unleash death on thousands."
2021-12-02 7:33,"Don't see anything new here. By September 2020, public health rules for quarantine and isolation were clear and well established, for the general public through contact tracing and for sports figures through MLB rules, for example. A positive test (Trump) at that time meant you were to isolate regardless of whether you had symptoms (Trump did) for a certain amount of time, only to be cleared after a certain amount of time and/or with subsequent negative tests and no symptoms. A close contact (Hicks) meant you had to quarantine for a certain amount of time. There was discussion, but no exceptions made, about MLB players having to sit out despite (fans) presuming they were false positives. 
We knew at the time the White House set its own lax rules with the rapid tests, and that Trump ignored everything he wanted to throughout his life."
2021-12-02 6:43,"I think Ms Haberman would be better served had she said that President Trump was infected, not sick, when he met Mr Biden in the televised appearance. MAny people feel fine all through what can be called cases or infections of Covid.

It is known that he was sick enough several days later to require hospitalization-but, like many people, he may have placed his own desires and wishes to be seen as  healthy regardless of what medical doctors said, ahead of the needs and health of the people in the studio or his opponent's ""uninfected status.
     This seems to be an overriding concern of many Americans:
-to feel they have the right to refuse medical  interference until they collapse and then to be able to demand the finest , most expensive care available-while pushing other sick individuals out of hospitals so they can take up immense numbers of rooms for ""qurantine"". all while denying any illness.
Had this been Polio back in 1930, or 1950, there would have been no arguing with the medical community-that such behavior was endangering the public by grandstanding."
2021-12-02 6:16,Clearly our American civilization has peaked and we are on the decent.  Nero fiddled while Rome burned always seemed like a strange myth.  I understand it now.
2021-12-02 9:31,The only thing that can surprise me about Trump is if I learn that he has donated some money to a charity anonymously or otherwise.
2021-12-02 10:51,"Do I believe that Trump tested positive prior to his debate with Biden? Yes I do. Does it surprise me that he ignored that test result? Not at all. Do I think that Trump infected other people? Yes I do. What do I think of Biden's answer of ""I don't think about the former President"" when asked about this? Perfect."
2021-12-02 10:54,"Where were all the medical doctors in this? 
They are supposed to live up to their medical oath and we expect some degree of morality from them. For any doctor to be part of Trump's scheme is horrible. They all should have resigned as soon as he chose not to isolate. Congress needs to open an investigation into the actions of the medical doctors involved in this incident. Are any of these people still at the White House?"
2021-12-02 9:47,"He can just do anything he wants, can’t he?  And get away with it.  

Why is that?  How is that always possible?"
2021-12-02 11:18,"Additional points to recall.  Justice Barrett, who reportedly was infected in August 2020, nevertheless attended with her husband and children.   Why take them to a mass event?   Would you have done the same to your children, even if you did not know about the president's condition?   The president of Notre Dame, where she was on the faculty, also attended and soon was positive.  Senator McConnell did not attend."
2021-12-02 11:24,And he got away with it all .  Thank you Maggie Haberman for your reporting.  At least we know exactly what he got away with and how little he valued the lives of anyone besides his own and his re-election .
2021-12-02 12:00,"This infuriates me. And it encapsulates what I detest about some/many Republicans: the belief that the end—Supreme Court nominations, in particular—justifies the means. I’m stone-cold with rage."
2021-12-02 12:20,"Is anyone surprised? The man could shoot someone in broad daylight on 5th avenue and get away with it. He's been accused of tax fraud, sexual harassment, fomenting a coup to overturn a legitimate election result. He has been impeached twice. And yet, one of the two major American political parties is standing by to endorse him should he decide to run again in 2024.  The world is witnessing the Fall of the American Empire."
2021-12-02 12:09,Is there a twelve-step program for Ms. Haberman's Trump addiction?
2021-12-02 12:26,"So he tested positive with an old outdated test and then negative the same day and went on with his business because he tested negative... well duh... why wouldn't you? You all realize that many people were testing positive who weren't positive. My Aunt tested positive one day, negative the next 2 days and positive the next day and negative the next... have no idea if she ever had it."
2021-12-02 11:33,As if we needed further proof that Mr. Trump cares for no one other than Mr. Trump.
2021-12-02 11:34,"The doctors involved in Trump's care need to be investigated by Congress. By his actions Trump demonstrated to be a criminal, he put people around him in danger without one ounce of concern. It's fascinating that that guy still has supporters."
2021-12-02 13:04,"35% of the U.S. still wants this man, even knowing all his awfulness, to be president again. Chilling."
2021-12-02 13:19,"This story related the very depth of his dishonesty.  Imagine what the world would do to Biden if it came out that he endangered people by suppressing news that he has Covid, and traveled, mingled, and hosted events, mask-less?  Yet people seem to accept the lies and dishonesty from Trump.  The media should not let up on him."
2021-12-02 12:53,Another trick by Trump?  get Biden infected during the debate and hope he would give up the race?
2021-12-02 13:50,"I think this is when Trump lost the election. I listened to the debate on NPR rather than watch it on a screen. Not only did I not want to see Trump’s face, but I preferred to concentrate on his and Biden’s responses. 

Trump was, as usual, scattered, hateful, boorish and nonsensical, but I later told my husband that there was something else going on. He was out of control, even for him. It was as if he were ill, maybe even feverish. That he knew he could infect others but proceeded with the debate was indecent, if not criminal. Of course, he would take this as a compliment."
2021-12-02 14:21,"Trump held 28 campaign rallies during 2020 during which he openly encouraged people to ignore important safety precautions including social distancing and wearing masks. As a direct result of this malicious stupidity, 30,000 Americans contracted Covid and at least 700 people died.

Of course this pales in comparison to the over 700,000 Americans who have died as a result of Trump misrepresenting the dangers presented by this deadly pathogen and his advocacy of bogus alternatives treatments. 
 
By comparison, while Obama was president two Americans died on US soil as a result of contracting Ebola and Republicans called for his impeachment, even though his prompt action contributed to preventing a pandemic.

Today Republicans are trying to ignore the troubling failure of the Trump Administration to lead effectively by disrupting the efforts of the next Administration to end the crisis, and thousands more are needlessly perishing. 

Meanwhile the chief failure of the Biden Administration is that he has allowed our healthcare system to lag behind those of every other modern nation, all of whom have replaced private insurance with universal single payer coverage. Switching to Medicare for all would prevent 600,000 bankruptcies each year and save us 19.8 trillion dollars over the next ten years, money that presently is being wasted on needless private sector bureaucracy. Build Back Better? Apparently not if this threatens the blood money enjoyed by Biden’s most important donors."
2021-12-02 14:47,"Remember this is a guy who urged  people to gather in mass crowds during a pandemic, purely to stroke his ego. The epidemiological consequences of that behaviour, and the depraved thinking that spurred it,  make this story appear minor."

2021-12-02 14:54,"This should not surprise anyone.
Trump is clearly a self-centered, destructive person.
What should surprise us though is that so many are willing to give this uncaring, vindictive individual the immense power of the Presidency.

Has never been truer or more important for the survival of America's fragile democracy."
2021-12-02 14:42,"Chris Christie helped the sick Trump prep for the debate. And soon had Covid. Yes, be a pal to that fellow and see what you get."
2021-12-02 15:22,No one us surprised that Trump engaged in self serving behavior.
2021-12-02 16:10,"Was there really a “negative” follow-up test. I don’t believe that any more than I believe he scored 30/30 on a dementia screening test. BTW, the words he said he was asked to remember were obviously a figment f his imagination. Screening tests never use words that are so closely related."
2021-12-02 15:42,The smart man in the room was Joe Biden who stayed across the room at a safe distance from covid donald.
2021-12-02 15:17,"In light of the fact that tests can be false-positive or false negative, any time a person receives a positive result, especially back then when much less was known about this virus, Trump should have taken every reasonable precaution to insure as best as feasible that he would not be infecting others around him. As it happens, the positive test was correct and the negative one, if it even happened, was incorrect. But that really is a side issue. He had his agenda and an abundance of caution wasn't part of it. It is yet one more manifestation of the serious dangers of malignant narcissism."
2021-12-02 15:34,"Trump knew that if the debate had to be called off because he tested positive for Covid, it would shine a blinding spotlight on his failed response to Covid and the consequences of walking around as if Covid didn’t exist. Likely, he took as many subsequent tests as needed until he came up with one that registered as a false negative."
2021-12-02 15:52,"What if Trump attending the Presidential Debate against Biden after knowing he had tested positive (and refusing to be tested immediately before the debate as required) wasn’t just his “enthusiasm” to debate, but intentional, to possibly infect Biden and move him out of contention."
2021-12-02 16:26,"Are we surprised?  

No. 

Don't be surprised if he returns to office.  Don't be surprised at the results."
2021-12-02 15:46,"Despicable. 
Could Trump and his aides who knew he tested positive for Covid sink any lower?

They all knew Trump was infected and allowed him to intentionally expose several hundred people to Covid.

Have they no decency at all?

And dozens did get infected after Trump's Rose Garden gathering. 

Chris Christie contracted Covid immediately after prepping Trump for his debate.  Christie was hospitalized and seriously ill.  His priest was even called to his bedside.  Why isn't Christie more furious?"
2021-12-02 16:05,"Covid is a deadly virus.  Knowingly exposing others to a deadly disease should be treated as a felony:  assault with a deadly weapon.  Meadows' book portrays Trump's reckless disregard for the life, safety, and health of  others including:  Biden, debate attendees, family members and friends, PA supporters, and Gold Star families.  The same disregard for the lives of all Americans Trump showed as President during the pandemic."
2021-12-02 15:28,"... and the doctors surrounding the former president somehow had no relevance in all of this ?  

The fact that this person knowingly went into rooms full of people with a highly transmissible disease with only his selfish political angle at hand is one thing -- albeit a really despicable thing 

However; people who knew better did nothing, potentially throwing the entire process off of the rails ... 

There is a fact pattern here that continues to be gaslighted .."
2021-12-02 16:31,"Just when you think you've seen his lowest, he just keeps lowering the bar. Knowingly carrying a deadly disease and taking zero precautions to prevent spreading it? Once again, this creature leaves me speechless with seething rage.

I really don't even see a human being when I look at him anymore. I see a demon...and I'm an agnostic who doesn't even believe in such things. But that's the closest word I can find to describe the evil I see from head to toe."
2021-12-02 16:25,"Yeah. Trump is a complete disgrace. His behavior is, was and will always be  nauseating and disgusting. He put others at risk of infection and simply did not care. What he wanted was more important. Chris Christie should be very upset. He was probably infected by Trump having spent hours of time with him, unmasked., prior to these events. News of Christie's  positive diagnosis -- which came a day after President Donald Trump announced that he and first lady Melania Trump had both contracted the virus -- followed his assistance to Trump in preparing for the first presidential debate in a series of sessions where no one wore masks."
2021-12-02 15:27,"That Trump had COVID in public settings is hugely symbolic of his damaging reign.  Trump's entire presidency was as damaging to our way of life as the coronavirus has been.  We may well recover from the virus if and when it ever ends.  I am not sure we will ever recover from the racism, hatred, class divisions, and governance dysfunction fostered by Trump and his obnoxious and obscene minions."
2021-12-02 15:56,"I love Biden's reply when asked if trump tried to kill him.  ""I don't think about the former president,"" he replied."
2021-12-02 17:16,Trump most likely also infected gold star families and security personnel with this stunt. I just can't fathom how anyone can support this horrible creature. There isn't a shred of decency or human grace in him. He's just a black hole of endless corruption and lies and he leaves nothing but wreckage in his wake. He's hands down the worst president this country has ever had in it's entire history.
2021-12-02 16:43,Did he tell Melania and the kids?Was that different from what he told everyone else?
2021-12-02 17:12,"That Trump, after testting positive, would put the Gold Star families at risk, then imply that they had infected him, has got to be the absolute bottom of depravity."

2021-12-02 16:36,"When Donald Trump asked Chris Christie if he was going to blame him for getting COVID, it was because Trump knew he gave it to him.

2021-12-02 17:12,"It takes about 6-7 days after initial infection to realize the full impact of serious Covid symptoms.  

So that means that Trump really MUST HAVE had Covid on Sept 25, the DAY HE TESTED POSITIVE.

Sept 25th was 6-7 days before he became so sick he required hospitalization on Oct 2.

Trump however denies he had it.
We all know Trump is a pathological liar."
2021-12-02 16:58,"Why was this not disclosed by those who knew, when it mattered?  … because they could profit from this information later.  The author of this book is as negligent as Trump."
2021-12-02 16:51,"“Democracy dies in darkness.” 

Trump spent decades overvaluing his properties as a means of obtaining massive loans from banks, and radically undervaluing them in tax filings as a means of cheating the government out of billions of dollars in tax revenues. 

As all New Yorkers know, Trump always has been, and he remains, a master of knowing what he needs to keep hidden, “in darkness,” at all costs, and what he should expose to the public, as gilded, fanciful images that will fool the public and burnish his cosmos-sized ego. His fakery fooled the rest of the country, and continues to fool the rest of the country.

Anyone who’s surprised about this isn’t from New York City."
2021-12-02 17:16,"While it is sickening to hear about Trump's behavior and the behavior of those around him, what is really scary is that 70 million of our fellow Americans fully support his behavior and would do, and are doing, the same things themselves."

I just returned from visiting my brother that had moved to North Carlonia 12 years ago. I was reluctantly discussing politic with him and a longtime friend that had also moved to NC some 20 years ago.
All I heard from them was the same lies that Trump and his Congressional supports. I asked where they got their facts from and all I heard was from multiple sources. These Trump supporters will not listen to CNN, MSNBC or any neutral publications. Facts mean nothing to them, so people like McCarthy will never pay the price for his lies until there are enough voters to put people like him out of office."
2021-11-24 16:58,"There's never been a more exquisite example of the old saying that when you point a finger, remember there are three fingers pointing back at you. 

It seems as if the Republicans are engaged in a yearslong  blame game. They have blamed Democrats, crooked judges, witch-hunting attorneys, Antifa, rigged juries, fake media, election officials, peaceful protesters, China, liberal universities, infectious disease experts, undocumented immigrants, the ""lazy"" unemployed and others for every problem facing this nation.

To the best of my knowledge, Benji. Simba and Lassie haven't been blamed yet but they should be careful."

They turned on a dime the day Biden was elected and started dissing the vaccine rollout; then they dissed the efficacy and necessity of the vaccine; and now they are screaming bloody murder about mandates. And since police and fire departments and the military turn their TVs to Fox, even those sworn to serve and protect us are refusing the vaccine. They are violating their own values of service to others because Fox News has them convinced it’s a righteous cause, even though the Supreme Court has held for a hundred years that liberty ends when harming others begins. It is a testament to the power of rightwing propaganda to override the better angels of Republicans’ nature. It’s threatening and ominous. One only can hope that so many more of them will die that the reasonable, responsible and prudent Democrats will win elections."

2021-11-24 17:02,To the point about a full-throated push for COVID treatments: the new Pfizer pill is a great step forward here. Unfortunately we’ve gotten to a point where vaccination is such a polarizing issue that some people just frankly are not going to get vaccinated.
2021-11-24 16:56,Trump brought Republican shamelessness to new heights.  This is just the latest example.
2021-11-24 17:14,What exactly are people trying to buy that they can’t get?  I keep hearing about this and have not yet experienced it. Sure there may be supply chain issues. But store shelves are full. I’m not wanting for any essentials. What is the issue?  The news is makes me feel a concern I am not finding in my reality.
2021-11-24 17:02,"“ Republicans assert a different response: that the administration squandered an opportunity to bring the country together, by buffaloing through vaccine mandates and sending mixed signals on mask-wearing and booster shots. A more productive strategy, they argue, would have been making a full-throated push for Covid treatments and other approaches that the unvaccinated might have been more willing to accept.”

This gets more and more insane. So what would “bring the country together” is having the White House not try to get people vaccinated but just to talk endlessly about getting more treatments? 1) The folks in the White House are not biomedical researchers. Them talking about wishing to have more cures does nothing. 2) If you have been following the news, the actual biomedical researchers have developed new promising treatments, which the administration is taking steps to make available. Are these treatments not going to “bring the country together” because the administration didn’t say that they wanted new treatments enough? 3) On what basis should those of us watching the madness of pro-COVID Republicans supposed to believe that they would be more likely to accept these new treatments when they don’t want the vaccine?

At least the Democrats quoted in this article were hitting a simple, true message: the Republican Party is actively trying to prolong COVID. Hopefully that message will sink in before next November."
2021-11-24 17:06,Instead of acting like an American who cares about his country Kevin McCarthy has done everything he can to make sure Biden fails. Effectively dealing with the pandemic requires that all Americans participate to the best of their ability. That means that Republican office holders at all levels should have been at the forefront urging their constituents to get vaccinated and to wear masks in crowded public places. That most of them have sat idly by while disinformation and anti vax and mask campaigns run rampant borders on criminal behavior. Many more Americans have died needlessly as a result and they bare a heavy burden of responsibility for the excess deaths.
2021-11-24 17:06,"I just heard a Trump clip criticizing Biden for using the oil reserve (a response to the oil crisis of the 70's) saying that he filled the reserve while in reality the reserve went down by a million gallons during his term. Now, we have Republicans having the unmitigated gall of blaming Biden for the increase in cases when it was they who did everything to discourage people, from following mask mandates to get vaccinated.  And this while the increase in cases is due  precisely because Trump followers are still refusing to get vaccinated.
What is about Republicans (officials and followers alike) that they simply disdain facts and continue to tell lies."
2021-11-24 17:09,"This doesn't surprise me. But what does is how the Republican electorate doesn't see through this charade.

The GOP has mastered controlling the narrative.  The Democrats continue to play catch-up baseball, a day late and a dollar short.  This is but another example.

Instead of shying away from the GOP branding the Democrats as socialists why not embrace it, and counter that socialism is the oil for the American political machine?

Police departments.  Fire departments.  Medicare.  Social Security.  Child labor laws.  Minimum wage.

Socialism is here and it's here to stay.  Fire back at the GOP with the same relentless zeal that it attacks you!"
2021-11-24 17:10,"The apparent willingness of the Republicans to gamble with people's lives is truly stunning. We are in the rapids now, the river swift and cold, and the Republicans are not helping to bail, they are actively throwing oars overboard, and they gladly and with relish, dispensed with life jackets a few miles back. Truly, there are no words that adequately express what they are doing to this country; and the bodies pile up and ERs and ICUs are jammed once again."
2021-11-24 17:10,"I don’t get tired of carping on this point: This is how a society fares when it neglects education at a variety of levels.

A democratic order rests on a well-informed citizenry. United Statesians continue to vote for the GOP despite clear and convincing evidence of its corruption, demagoguery, greed, and compromised ethics as they lack a sense of what governing, democracy, history, or even a life in society entails, which they should have been taught about and socialized into in schools, in whatever sort of educational system may have been their lot and at all levels.

One doesn’t get that when, for example, textbook production is corporate driven and educational content determined for the nation as a whole by demographic numbers, vesting power over historical narratives and sociocultural analyses in a handful of people from a hyper conservative state.

Unfortunately, much as happens with climate change, GOP demagogues have been ensconced so long that their power, for too many years to come, is by now guaranteed through gerrymandering, the manipulation of  voting legislation with the consequent erosion of voting rights, and by packing courts at a variety of levels, among the multiple suspect strategies they’ve deployed and they’ve visited upon the US.

It’s going to be very, very hard to righten this particular ship. Too many chickens coming home to roost."
2021-11-24 17:11,"Of course they blame Biden, just as with Trump blaming everyone but himself for botching the pandemic, foreign relations, etc, etc.

The only policies ReTrumplican't lay out are lower taxes for the plutocrats and corporations, giving military weapons to local police forces, and any laws that will destroy the planet."

Since Newt Gingrich the GOP’s plan has been to do nothing. They cling to power by catering to the worst human instincts of greed and fear. And in doing so the wealthy get wealthier. And the less fortunate who are susceptible to their dog whistles? They are the fodder for America’s military machine, the overwhelming victims of COVID, the economically forgotten."

Why don’t they ever talk about that?"
2021-11-24 17:00,"The fact that the Republican Party, and McCarthy in particular, continue to lay the ground work for an overthrow of state governments in key positions across the country is so extremely serious that I question whether there should be any political engagement at all. The stakes could not be higher and things could not be more serious. These people need to be facing indictments, and it needs to happen very soon."
2021-11-24 17:05,"The GOP is entirely to blame for covid. When the first cases hit, they completely denied covid.Then they resisted lockdowns, and opposed mask and vaccine mandates, and they allowed the covid cases to grow exponentially. The GOP and Trump together have spread a great deal of misinformation-on fox news and various right wing outlets,in the wall street journal editorial and opinion columns and on facebook, and they have pushed dangerous and completely ineffective 'cures' like ultraviolet light and horse medicine throughout the pandemic. They have ignored and they have completely failed to respond to the delta variant. It should have been obvious that a more contagious variant would emerge, and that can happen anytime even now.
The GOP is not really trying to deal with covid at all.They never did. They are trying to undermine and sabotage Biden's efforts. 
It is least surprising that 90 percent of the republican base believes in all the lies. They point to rising cases in the north east and cook up the covid statistics in their own states, not even acknowledging covid cases and deaths. The cases in the north east are all unvaccinated republicans.
95 percent of democrats are vaccinated.They have taken 2 shot vaccines, and even have taken, or are about to take, the boosters that have become available."
2021-11-24 17:08,"Sadly, they behave this way because it is working just fine for the party.Meanwhile the Democrats are losing."
2021-11-24 17:12,"No big surprise here, spinning the truth. Republicans are infamous manipulators and twisting the truth to their advantage, and then their voters believe them. They are already setting up their party for taking credit for Bidens Build Back Better plan if it gets signed into law. Certainly because it is very popular among most Americans.  I am not saying Dems don't do some of this but not near to the extent that the Republicans do."
2021-11-24 17:11,"Standard GOP operating procedure.  No solutions, just wedge issues and criticisms - even mutually inconsistent criticisms."
2021-11-24 17:19,Republican hypocrisy is beyond SHAMEFUL. And they no longer care about SHAME. That is why America is in serious trouble if voters don't punish this dangerous nonsense. One party can't be permitted to lie and get away with it. Democracy can't work this way.

2021-11-24 17:18,"Secretary Clinton was right to call the Republican Party the Party of Deplorables. In order to demonstrate incompetence by President Biden, the Republicans totally do not cooperate! House and Senate Republicans did not vote for the Coovid-19 Relief Package and their supporting constituents refuse to wear a mask, refuse to get vaccinated, and harass doctors, nurses, and medical staff (even to making death threats!). Their criticism of President Bidden is essentially a self-fulfilling prophecy and is despicable! Republicans, thus, project too much; they are the incompetent ones bringing death to America!"

And remember the ReTrumplicans are the same corrupt people who claim to be religious so that they can ask for and get the vote of evangelicals, whose leaders are perhaps more corrupt and mendacious even than the ReTrumplicans, as evidenced by their unwavering support for the most mendacious president ever."

The lack of logic is heartbreaking!"
2021-11-24 17:26,"This is a typical and repulsive Republican maneuver. What's even worse, many of their constituents believe them. This behavior is not due to fealty to Trump.

The afternoon local Libertarian host who moved here from the Boston market not long before the pandemic arrived in particular loves to bash Democrats, medical experts, and science in general when eagerly promoting baseless conspiracy theories, daft ""cures"" and, arguably worst of all, almost always affirms the dim callers and ""expert"" guests who bring this junk onto his show.

Then there are the Fox News organizations of our country that blindly and robotically lap up every ounce of the lies and bile that these phonies and frauds excrete. There are a handful of Republicans that truly care about our democracy, country and its people. I would love to see them be able to form a new wing of the Republican Party that would be trusted not to take down our government.

If their constituents refuse a lifesaving vaccine in order to maintain an intractable stubbornness, then they have only themselves to blame when they get sick and die. Right? The GOP have been playing this blame game for so long now, it's predictable. But this time around, they're actually losing voters to their ill advised strategy. Their tack is so fatuous, I fully expect them to blame the weather on Biden."

2021-11-24 17:46,"The Republican Party is literally encouraging its own members to get sick or die, so they can blame it on Democrats.

It’s entirely cynical, as the leaders and misinformation purveyors themselves are all vaccinated.  They don’t misunderstand what would end the pandemic - they lie about it, continuously.

I’ve never seen anything as noxious and destructive to our country as the current GOP, and hope never to again."
2021-11-24 17:17,"You can't tell facts to people who want to believe in lies, and expect to change their minds. 

That's why I think we need to get emotional. It's cowardly not to get the vaccine. It's weak, it's a sign of being soft. The singer Nicki Minaj said her cousin got, you know, big ones from the vaccine. If you're against the vaccine you must have precious tiny ones.

I keep reading about how we need to listen to the unvaccinated, to answer their fears. That isn't working, is it. Let's call the fear what it is: cowardice."

And now, blaming Biden for the worsening of the pandemic while at the same time actively downplaying and thwarting mask wearing and vaccines, especially any mandates because ya know, “your precious freedoms!” Never mind the science. The GOP is more responsible than almost any other group for passing disinformation re the vaccines. There is no question we’d be in an entirely different place if Trump had actually followed the science, set an example by wearing a mask and getting vaccinated on camera, and if lawmakers followed suit. But no, this is all hopelessly and continuously politicized; these people know the way to garner support for the midterms is to continue to diss the science, vilify any mandates whatsoever, and “let freedom ring”, even at the cost of 1000’s of American lives."

This is why the Covid-19 pandemic continues because the Republicans are using Americans as pawns to undermine and stop all attempts at stopping the pandemic.

2021-11-24 17:54,"Walensky is Biden’s biggest mistake. Her unmasking recommendation for the vaccinated in spring at a time when Delta tore through the population of India was a huge miscalculation. Once that was done, getting people to put on the masks again is just a lot harder, not to mention the unvaccinated getting the free ride to unmask as well. Her decision to stop tracking all breakthrough infections around the same time was also proven to be costly. She was picked to restore confidence in CDC competency and credibility, and she is failing in both counts. So where’s the accountability?"

The polarization of this nation between the extreme right and everyone else almost exactly parallels the population of anti-vaxxers and those who are intelligent and caring enough to be vaccinated. That the extreme right wing uses lethal public health propaganda to maintain their base is unprecedented and represents a huge danger to our nation and the world at large. 

In the face of all the data that proves the leading vaccines are safe and effective, in the face of the clear proof that 95+% of those who die from COVID have not been vaccinated, with the crystal clear social obligation to protect others by being vaccinated, what can be said about those stubborn right wing cultists who refuse to do the right thing and get vaccinated?

2021-11-24 18:35,"The headline is a bit disingenuous, given that cases are rising the most in the Northeast and Midwest, and not necessarily due to Republican policies, because they are in fact rising a lot in high-vaccination states where a lot of people still wear masks. The common factor seems to be that they are the states with colder weather, where people congregate indoors. Meanwhile, many states with the most lax policies (Florida, Texas etc) do not currently have severe rising case rates.
If we could for a change not make Covid about politics, we would see that the impact of all the covid measures is actually quite limited -- sooner or later it arrives in each area and region, and measures can flatten the curve so as not to overwhelm hospitals but they can never truly stop the spread.
There is one area where Republicans are to blame: the lack of a strict and coherent vaccine policy. Vaccination is the one factor that makes all the difference -- the difference between high covid cases and high mortality, or high cases and low mortality. Mortality (and other severe outcomes) are what matters at this point, not case numbers."
2021-11-24 18:13,"When Trump was President, he was accorded the blame for deaths from the novel Corona Virus. He started with no vaccines and no idea how to treat the sick. 

Democrat Governors took steps like stuffing sick patients into nursing homes, yet it was Trump who was responsible, because he was President.

President Trump gifted President Biden with working vaccines and a good treatment program. When Biden came into office Trump had gotten vaccinations up to 1 million per day. 

Now Biden is President. Therefore he is responsible for the deaths under his watch. Vaccine reluctance is supposedly a Republican problem, yet the US population did not change over the last year. The people when Trump was President are the same people now that Biden is President.

Trump had operation warp speed, what has Biden done? Nothing notable."

2021-11-24 18:38,"A few steps back in time we would hear the former guy bleat and bray about states need to be “liberated”, claim we have turned the corner, berate the scientists which encouraged the, well, ignorant politicians,  all majority Trumpists who fear the magas, to pass laws and ordinances that prohibits mandates as they claim they are attacks on our freedoms. 

Perhaps the sitting president has done what he can given he is undermined by the trumpists at every move. 

I find despair when I hear the screes that Dr. Fauci is clueless or doesn’t know what he is talking about that come from non-scientists or those so far at the fringe the can be considered as quacks selling snake oil. 

The Republican playbook, as revised by Donny Trump, the magical serial liar, calls for deflection, deceit and blame others, will work its magic as we will see our country slide into the dark and tepid swamp of single party rule-the big reason Biden gets the blame-means to the end. 

And people will still die needlessly due to the lies and inaction of the party of Trump."
2021-11-24 18:34,"Trump himself was booed when he told his followers that vaccines were a good thing, trying to bring credit to himself. Right wing politicians are following rather than leading this anti-vax sentiment.  The anti-vaxers are having a field day in Europe, too.
The real question is: ""Who is pushing this lethal delusion?""  I doubt if we have to look far beyond the list of the usual suspects.  The sad part is how many people are willing to follow the leader off a cliff to prove some kind of a point while ruining things for the rest of us."
2021-11-24 18:07,"At what point will Republicans realize that, for the most part, they are now the ones dying from this virus, a virus that can be contained? Won't there come a time when they realize they have been deceived? Or is there absolutely nothing, not even the death of a loved one, that can change their minds? Seems like the cold hard facts should eventually kick in."
2021-11-24 18:08,Red COVID is surging again. The CDC tracks COVID-related cases and hospitalizations of unvaccinated versus vaccinated adults. The Jan-Sept. 2021 charts tell the ugly truth very plainly: Republicans have put lot of Americans six feet under.
2021-11-24 18:24,"If Republicans were vaccinated at the same rate as Democrats, COVID would be defeated and the economy would be back on track.

Trump and the GOP leadership are so vindictive, that they would rather deliberately kill their own followers, rather than work with President Biden to help America."
2021-11-24 18:19,"42% of Republicans are unvaccinated. This could translate into about 9% fewer republicans voting in the next few years if mortality stays around 2.1%. 

Great news."
2021-11-24 18:10,"Republicans have become incredibly cynical and insidious.  They will tell any lie, attack any Democratic success to gain and maintain power.  It's the desperation of being a minority fighting to hold on while the world moves in another direction around them.  The dangerous aspect is that they have proven they will also use and condone violence to hold power."
2021-11-24 18:15,"This Thanksgiving I am thankful that the former guy lost because, if the former guy had won, then, judging his failures and lies regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy would be underwater and the pandemic daily death rates would still be at last January’s death rates."

This is a mindset that writes textbooks and builds museums. Now it is killing people"
2021-11-24 18:11,"It all boils down to voters.We have a segment of voters that lack the basic understanding of actual issues,voters that continually vote against their own best interest.Than you have  rightwing media and  so called educated politicians that panders to them and reinforces their misconceptions.To put it mildly,I think as a country we face an uncertain furure"
2021-11-24 18:40,"The Republicans did such an excellent job against masks and vaccines that when Trump and Lynsey Graham tried to encourage people to get vaccinated, they were boo. Now let us get to the real root of the problem!"
2021-11-24 18:39,"As cases and deaths exploded in Florida this summer I put my analytical skills to work and downloaded Covid deaths to date by state.  I was astonished to see how more people in red states have died after the vaccine was widely available and the mono clonal treatment administrated for free and yet deaths were climbing due to overwhelmed healthcare in states that didn’t expand Medicaid 

More people have died in Florida than NY and most of them in 2021.  9500 people died in Florida from Covid in September 2021. 

This was entirely preventable but for Republican anti vaccine and anti mask efforts.  It’s like a war on the elderly and the ignorant."
2021-11-24 18:09,"I like to read survival stories.  They involve learning about natural rules, observing cause and effect and thinking through problems, and, of course, surviving.  One would think that surviving in our country would be easy, we’re rich and food is plentiful.  If you’re careful and creative, shelter can be found, even in high-rent areas.

But surviving isn’t that easy in the U.S.  The wealthy have always made education and decent homes unattainable for some by hoarding resources.  We’re not a country where everyone works for the common good.  If you become mentally ill and can’t figure out how to live safely, you’re life is especially in peril.

Then, along came the pandemic.  People that weren’t used to thinking for themselves, that barely got by but accepted the capitalist clap-track are going down quickly.  While it took cigarette and opioid companies decades of mass killings before our lobbyist-numbed government decided to protect people, and then just barely, the pandemic and its anti-science adherents are doing it relatively quickly.  Scientists and doctors, those committed to saving lives don’t have a chance against the many cruel lies.  

People that are relatively educated can’t figure out that viruses can kill and care must be taken.  Instead of trying to find out about pandemics and viruses, they listen to the easily found lies that tell them they’re right and safe, but only if they believe the lie.

The medium is the message and the medium is rotten to the core."
2021-11-24 18:23,"Of course, this is what they do, these Republicans. This sort of misdirection has become routine, almost pedestrian for them. My only surprise, and disappointment, is that so many so often fall for it."
2021-11-24 17:44,"Free speech is a misnomer; someone is going to pay eventually-it takes time for citizens to ""catch on,"" as they did in Iraq War II, the sequel. Serious Republicans are banking on it happening before the next election  cycle."
2021-11-24 17:14,"“A more productive strategy, they argue, would have been making a full-throated push for Covid treatments and other approaches that the unvaccinated might have been more willing to accept.”

So, the unvaccinated have the right to impede public health measures that blunt the spread of the virus.

Let those who wish to “live free and die” gather away from the rest of us, somewhere where they can exchange “thoughts and prayers.”"
2021-11-24 17:31,"This article could use better balance - it leaves too many quotes from elected Republicans and their strategists unchallenged, veering into false equivalence territory. The obvious point is mentioned in the article - the crazy anti-mask, anti-vaxx portion of the Republican base have made the pandemic worse both in terms of causing more people to be infected, hospitalized and die from COVID and they've also exacerbated the indirect effects such as prolonging the need for precautions and increasing economic harms. Meanwhile, Biden and Democrats have done nearly everything in their power to bring the pandemic to an end. 

None of the Republicans managed to rebut this central point. The best they could do is point to polls of voters (who have been fed a lot of Republican lies) saying that they blame Biden and the Democrats. The blame for the direct and indirect harms of COVID are not questions of opinion; they are questions of fact. The inability of Republicans to advance a fact-based case should be made more clear here."
2021-11-24 17:54,"A few years back Republicans were claiming that there would be ""death panels"" if Obamacare was passed.  In states like Idaho there were literal death panels created to decide who would get Covid treatment.  There is no doubt that the Republicans cynical strategy of blocking mask mandates has cost lives.  Republicans assumed, rightly so far at least, that Biden and the Democrats would be blamed for not ending Covid and improving the economy.  They claim that Biden is dividing the country by mandating vaccinations in order to control the pandemic and save lives but the reality is that they are willing to sacrifice thousands to win votes."
2021-11-24 17:57,"Based on the information reported in this article, the GOP plan to bring an end to the pandemic is to end vaccine mandates and promote expensive treatments for Covid-19 which is, basically, the Florida model. Florida, with a population of 21 million, has reported 61,147 Covid related deaths. California, with Covid policies more in line with the Biden Administration and a population nearly double of Florida at 39.5 million, has reported 72,949 Covid related deaths. Simple high school math would suggest that deaths related to Covid would increase astronomically if the GOP were to return to power and implement the Florida model nationwide. Just how many deaths are acceptable to McCarthy and the GOP pollsters/pundits interviewed for this article? That we have 775,000 deaths to date which mostly occurred both under the incompetent anti-science Trump Administration and now in under-vaccinated GOP bastions does not seem to concern them in the least."
2021-11-24 18:05,How remarkably sad it is to give into trumpism by completely abandoning fact so that the enabling of cognitive dissonance is the GOP formula to win back political power. I’m trusting in the Biden method of choosing competence of truth to foil the GOP. It worked against trump in 2020. He lost.
2021-11-24 18:07,As a Republican I say shame shame on other Republicans who refuse to accept the reality that masks work.  The best example I can think of is the precipitous decline in cases off flu over the past year and the fact that I have not had a cold for nearly two years.  This is not coincidental.  Germs spread in many ways but certainly through our breath.
2021-11-24 18:42,"When you elect people to run your government who don't believe in government it's a recipe for disaster.  A disaster that started with Reagan in 1981 and it has been downhill ever since...   

As Grover Nordquist said, ""it's all about strangling the government in the bathtub"", it's all about greed - avoiding taxes, and increasingly about lies and protecting white privilege."
2021-11-24 17:53,"It is more than the GOP.  Don’t dismiss this as a purely partisan as an attempt to trivialize sincere concerns.
My daughter is a Democrat and she is very, very hesitant to vaccinate my young grandchildren. She is very intelligent, vaccinated, and well read, and a member of her school board. With all this information, she has serious doubts about the necessity of injecting a substance into her.
Next, the masking requirement for children border on abuse. These kids sit there for six or more hours a day with their faces covered. Don’t tell me about how they get used to it and don’t mind. They are doing what they are told. 
Finally, I am in my 70s . Many of my friends are my contemporaries. Many of them are Democrats. We are all for the most part triple vaxxed. Yet, if we walk into a mall in LA or attend a large outdoor sporting event , or even get up to use the rest room in a restaurant we have to wear masks. Some jurisdictions, like LA , have carried the mask requirement to such an absurd extreme that they completely undermine their credibility and actually cause the dissent.
No, this is not just a GOP issue. Believe it or not, there are people who actually think for themselves and don’t blindly follow some cable tv fueled partisan position."
2021-11-24 18:02,"So how are the Democrats going to respond to the GOP? The fact that the GOP believes they can blame Biden for rising COVID cases is a failure of Democratic messaging and proactivity by the Democrats. 

The pandemic is still potent because of the GOP 100%! The GOP is the one that refuses to endorse common sense measures to address the pandemic like vaccine mandates and mask mandates. Republicans are the most vaccine hesitant group, and large segments of the country have poor vaccination rates because people have fallen for the GOP messaging about ""my individual rights"" as opposed to messages of the ""common good.""

 There is absolutely ZERO excuse for letting the GOP seize the narrative and blame the Democrats for rising COVID cases. And I am quite frankly appalled that anyone could believe that the GOP has the best interests of the public in mind when addressing the pandemic. It is a complete failure by the Democrats that the GOP could even seize the narrative over the pandemic crisis."
2021-11-24 18:15,"Biden never claimed he could ""shut down a worldwide pandemic."" 

When Republicans criticize Biden for his handling of the pandemic Democrats and the news media should respond with the question, ""What action do you propose that has been carefully tested and found to be more effective?"" Biden can add, ""I'm open to any evidence-based ideas that will help reduce the spread of Covid-19."" When Biden criticized Trump's handling of the pandemic during the election campaign, he offered specific ideas as to what he intended to do.

Also, politicians rarely get credit for preventing harm. It is likely that even more Americans would be deceased or impaired with long covid if the Biden administration had not made such an effort to get vaccines into arms, and continued to recommend public health mitigation measures."
2021-11-24 18:16,"The speech writers coined some humor that relates to our predicament, a punch line Ronald Reagan delivered to the Canadian parliament to rousing laughter soon after his election. His joke was a slight at government, but it works just as well with the people crying about their freedom today. Reagan said they're like infants with an insatiable appetite for their liberty and freedom at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other. Our tragedy is that over 750,000 Americans lost their life because too many Republicans have no sense of responsibility for public health."
2021-11-24 18:53,"Get vaccinated. Wear a mask. We can stop this if each of us do these do those two things. 

Here in Ulster County, NY, cases are up 100% over the last 14 days, because the unvaccinated are going unmasked. Free-dumb, you know?

I know a family here who refuse to get vaccinated, and won’t have their six-year-old vaccinated because his school doesn’t require it. Free-dumb!"
2021-11-24 18:36,"This hypocrisy aptly summarizes the Republican Party over the past several decades.  The standard playbook is to not offer anything in the way of an intelligent, constructive solution, obstruct and ridicule anyone who does, then blame them for the predictably poor outcome.  In reality, the Republican Party is the most potent domestic terrorist threat to the United States."
2021-11-24 18:09,"It's the GOP version of a very old joke: a guy murders his parents, and then throws himself on the mercy of the court, because he's an orphan."
2021-11-24 18:42,The GOP is kind of funny if you think about how hypocrites are kind of funny. Only thing is they are making their own constuents sick and some of them are dying. I wonder if those people think about how not one elected official even came to their bedside to comfort them.  It's what I try to explain on social media. Not one of the tens of thousands speaking against vaccines will be there for you when you're sick and dying.   It's time for people to get vaccinated and stop being paws in this macabre Republican political game.
2021-11-24 18:56,The cynic in me says this was the GOP plan all along. Destroy America and Americans so you regain power.
2021-11-24 19:01,"For decades now the Republicans have waged sophisticated and not m-so-sophisticated public-opinion campaigns to discredit the Democrats.

Indeed, it seems like they’re more interested in these campaigns than they are in legislating and governing.

The growth of social media, right-ring websites and cables channels, and Fox News have made these campaigns even more effective.

Thus, the not-do-subtle—but seemingly effective—campaign to discredit the Biden administration should really be no surprise to anyone."

That said, I think that it's time for the insurance companies to get into the mix.  They need to raise the insurance rates on people who refuse to get vaccinated.  They raise insurance rates on people who use tobacco because their medical needs cost more  The same is the case with those who refuse to protect themselves from the COVID-19 virus.The people who blame Biden because they won't get vaccinated are acting like Trump zombies.  He's taken over their minds.  He's poisoned them with his Big Lies.  Trump is still around and getting more dangerous every day.  Now during the holiday season, the army of Trump-tee Dumb-tee is making a lethal assault on the rights of We The People to vote in 47 states.  They've already deprived women of a right to control their own bodies.  And now they're taking away the rights of WE THE PEOPLE to elect the people we choose to be our political leaders.  They accomplish their goal by introducing laws in 47 states that will give control of the election process to the GOPpers.

There is a concerted and sustained effort by Republicans to sell this narrative.

In other words, straight from the GOP playbook."

For that matter, they’re happy to blame Biden for economic disruption resulting from the pandemic’s impact in other countries. They do what it takes to win, and that’s one reason why they dominate.

As for Democrats, they should have Kamala Harris or some party attack dogs hammering on this day and night, with such themes as “Tired of wearing a mask? Blame [Republican name here]” and “There’s an empty chair at Thanksgiving this year because COVID-denying politician [Republican name here] killed Grandpa.”  However, they’re more worried about violating norms of discourse, and that’s one reason why they lose."

This is especially telling because early Covid spread exactly mapped with population density -- the more dense the population, the greater the spread. Not anymore. Massachusetts and New Jersey and New York may still see their share of Covid cases; what they don't see is their share of Covid deaths -- because they have more vaccinated people. 

Vaccines save lives. They can't stop a disease from spreading entirely, but they can turn the death rate into something more like the flu. The fact that this was ever politicized is a tragedy. The way that the GOP -- a party of billionaires -- chases any populist lies to get votes is shameless. And it is literally killing people."
2021-11-24 20:16,"Never in my lifetime, spanning 7 decades, have I seen Americans of one particular stripe reject science, framing it as the enemy of liberty. It's worthy noting that America's first coin, at the behest of America's first president, George Washington, carried the motto, ""Liberty, Parent of Science and Industry.""

In his 8 hour 32 minute rambling rant on the House floor 6 days ago, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy touched on topics that ran the gamut from national security to his winning lottery ticket, repeatedly citing his fondness for history. He would have done well to take note of Washington's appreciation for science, as well as Benjamin Franklin's, John Adams's and Thomas Jefferson's, among the founders of the nation.

McCarthy might not be the brightest member of the House, but he should easily be able to appreciate what science has done for the country over the course of almost two and a half centuries and what it has just delivered in the last two years -- superlative vaccines, largely based on NIH research sponsored by taxpayer money. Instead of slamming vaccine mandates and blaming President Biden for the pandemic, he should spend more time touting the brilliance of American scientists."
2021-11-24 20:03,"So galling. McCarthy is not wearing a mask in the photo. (I'll bet anything he's vaccinated, but he insists that it's a personal choice. Then this. Ugh.)"
2021-11-24 19:48,"The current GOP is particularly good at blaming the people they hurt, finding slogans and reversing the meaning of anything and everything.

So evil!"
2021-11-24 20:02,"Fight masks, vaccines and science. People die. Blame Democrats.

Fight the infrastructure bill. Blame Democrats for not getting anything done.

Stir up culture wars about transgender people using bathrooms, gay marriage, abortion laws. Blame Democrats for decay of family values and cancel culture.

Start a 20 year war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Biden the only one with the decisiveness to leave. Blame Democrats.

Unfettered capitalism, Citizens United, private sector in healthcare, education, and every social service. Blame Democrats.

The GOP is the biggest group of scam artists and grifters in the 21st century."
2021-11-24 20:03,The cynicism is neverending.   A party in a fever grip headed by shameless people whose sole goal is to create dissension and division as a means to stay in power.

2021-11-24 20:05,"“Joe Biden and the Democrats ran an entire campaign based on a dishonest promise that they alone could shut down a worldwide pandemic.""

Yeah talk about dishonest. The former guy was the one who constantly made claims about how ""I alone can fix it"" and now those words are somehow being inserted into Joe Biden's mouth. 

The Democrats never said they ""alone"" could fix things. But they are alone, because Republicans have not the slightest interest in fixing anything."
2021-11-24 20:02,"These people are so out of touch, not only with the country as a whole, but reality in general. Their logic is let's fight masks, and vaccine mandates, then blame someone one else for not ending Covid.

But they're forgetting as most GQPers conveniently seem to forget, how we got to this point to begin with. It seems to me Trumps unwillingness to admit the threat that Covid posed not only to the people of this country by moreover the threat to the economy. 

When you have leadership that makes a conscious choice to ignore a pathogen that at the very least makes people very sick worst case people die. By the time Trump left office, there were already over 500K people dead and our Healthcare system on the verge of collapse. 

So red states have made every attempt to keep masks, out of schools and the workplace, they've done everything they can to end vaccine mandates.  Apparently laboring under the delusion that they have some right to spread disease, yet they don't.  There is no constitutional right to spread disease, yes you have the right to conduct your life as you see fit, as long as it doesn't negatively effect those around you. 

But to pretend it Bidens fault, is a fantasy. I shudder to think what this country would be like had Trump won a second term. I'm sure they would've tried to blame democrats for gas prices. Even though, Republicans were in charge at the onset of the pandemic."
2021-11-24 19:48,Claiming that Biden is responsible for Covid still being a problem is no different than claiming that vaccinations don’t work to prevent the spread of Covid because people won’t get them.
2021-11-24 19:52,"The vast majority of the GOP will say anything: extraordinarily hypocritical statements; misinformation; hate; lies and/or; conspiracies, all while blaming the Democrats, and others, for all the negative issues in the U.S. With their only goal of staying in power, which will not change until they are held accountable by their supporters.  The vast majority of the GOP are pathetic reflections of the voters who put them in office, their sycophants, and the people who continue to support them.  How sad we should be so much better than this."

It would be interesting right now if we knew what the total number of deaths were by party. I have no doubt the GOP would produce the winning result."
2021-11-24 19:44,"This strategy, blaming Democrats for a problem that the Republicans are actively causing, is the standard playbook.
How many times has a Republican administration cratered the economy, been replaced by a Democratic administration that fixes the problem, and then have the Republicans a) blame the Democrats for the problem that they caused and b) take credit for what the Democrats did to fix the problem?
Covid, infrastructure (Republican senators voting against the infrastructure bill and then going back to their states to claim credit for the projects that are funded by that bill), it's like Plan #1 with Republicans."

We are doomed as a country."

Hypocrisy of any kind is an abhorrent character defect, but the GOP Covid vaccine hypocrisy is not just abhorrent, it is deadly."
2021-11-24 19:47,"That the likes of McCarthy and all other Republicans are faulting Joe for being incompetent is ludicrous...this is like a gang of arsonists complaining that the fire department is inherently incapable of fulfilling their task because they can't keep up with the number of fires being set. Well, perhaps if the arsonists (and seditionists) were arrested and imprisoned that might help to begin to regain control around the ""hot spots."" Regardless, these Covidiots would rather see Biden and the country fail rather than provide any positive support for his efforts to contain Covid, thereby improving the economy and the quality of life for everyone."
2021-11-24 19:55,"Well of course that's what THEY are gonna do. It's basically their brand at this point.

The thing I don't understand is why Biden lets them get away with it."
2021-11-24 19:49,McCarthy's comments would be laughable if they were not so dangerous.  I honestly don't know how most Republican politicians live with themselves.  Their words and actions indicate their power is far more important than people's lives.  The mystifying thing though is they are killing their own supporters.
2021-11-24 19:54,Definitely from the GOP playbook. They did the same thing with infrastructure. For the four years that the ex-president was in office they kept saying they were going to do something about the country's crumbling infrastructure. All they did was talk about it and nothing was ever done because they were too disorganized or to inept to make it happen. Flash forward a year later to a new president who gets things done. The GOP is even condemning 13 of their for voting for it. The hypocrisy on that side of the aisle is so thick you could cut it with knife.
2021-11-24 20:12,"The unvaccinated are getting sick and dying like it's still 2020. I wonder if the stats can distinguish counties with the highest number of new infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Is this surge over the holidays occurring in GOP-dominated areas with relatively low rates of vaccination? Just asking. Those numbers could take away the Republicans' newest (and most hypocritical) effort to weaponize covid."

Hopefully, the American people won’t buy it, either, when the GOP tries to blame the Democrats for the current state we find ourselves in"

2021-11-24 20:00,"If you like your base you can keep it, but the GOP got the base they deserve and now they're stuck with it. The real problem for the GOP is they have groomed Trump's poorly educated in a policy free vacuum, and now their base is willfully killing themselves before they can get to the next ballot box. We have no idea what voter fraud really looks like but we're about to find out because that's the only card left for the GOP to play."
2021-11-24 20:02,"This is not complicated. Whenever a Democrat is in the White House, the number one priority of congressional Republicans is to inflict as much political damage as possible, irrespective of harm caused to the United States.  When the Tea Party GOP gained control of the house in 2010, they did all they could to sabotage U.S. economic recovery, knowing that many voters would blame Obama.  While that sounds like near-libelous hyperbole, no competent economist would dispute that GOP policies at the time would harm the economy.

Fast-forwarding to the present, now we see that there truly is no floor to the depravity of zero-sum GOP political tactics.  Trump intentionally held off on a robust federal response to covid because deaths were mainly occurring in blue states, and he and his advisors felt that it would be a winning political strategy to let Democratic governors be forced to be the ones imposing unpopular lockdowns, after which Trump would waltz in as the ""reopening president"".  Since Biden has been in office, the GOP has taken stances that can only be described as pro-covid.  Republicans seem to be doing all they can to keep the pandemic active so that their base will be as angry as possible at Biden and the CDC."
2021-11-24 19:54,"Minnesota is has a major COVID-19 surge in progress.  However, the vast majority of the surge is taking place in rural counties that Trump won.  If you look at the county ranking for Minnesota, Hennepin and Ramsey Counties (Twin Cities) are near the bottom.

The Twin Cities are deep Blue while the rural counties are Crimson.  Even though Minnesota went (narrowly) for Biden, most of the surge is among unvaccinated Trump supporters."
2021-11-24 19:55,"President Trump's $18,000,000,000 ""Operation Warp Speed"" turned a science fiction term into science reality when the first Covid vaccines were produced. Trump's vaccines were supposed to be his triumph over Covid. Given Trump's strategic delegation of leadership to the states, Trump's vaccines were his only major effort to stop Covid. Not one Trump speech encouraging precautions, no Trump PSA giving us hope by reminding us we've been through disasters as a nation before, nothing. The success or failure of Trump's vaccines alone will determine his Covid-19 legacy for the history books. 

So why are Republicans so determined to ruin the one thing President Trump can take credit for in the fight against Covid-19? 

Perhaps the same reason they fight mask mandates. They ""don't want to help Biden"", as Trump once blurted when asked why he didn't promote the vaccine once ousted from office. When Americans die, whoever is President looks bad. Now it's Biden's turn. 

I only hope our fellow Americans are intelligent enough to understand what Republicans stand for these days - dishonesty, sinister plans at the expense of American lives, promoting hate and supporting race-based attacks, all sorts of bad things. It's not the party it used to be."
2021-11-24 19:59,So perhaps these anti-mask politicians saw opportunity in not combatting anti-vax falsehoods. Now they can complain that the pandemic is out of control on Biden’s watch. Sacrificing lives and ruining businesses are likely worth it in their polarizing and greedy calculations.
2021-11-24 20:03,Those who refuse the vaccine do embody Darwinian principles of Natural Selection. Taking a page from the late Mayor Richard Daley (remember him from Chicago) playbook the Trumpsters will have to visit the graveyards to collect Trump and de Santis votes.
2021-11-24 20:03,"The GOP never takes any responsibility, which is pretty much on brand for the Party of Personal Responsibility."
2021-11-24 19:53,"A lot of people react emotionally to adverse events, uncertainty, and chaos. Emotional people are easily manipulated. Thus it follows that when the multitudes face chronic levels of chaos the multitudes are easily led and controlled (cue the internet of things). 

So Republicans not only do nothing to address society’s ills --they work tirelessly to make sure they persist. Blaming the persistent ills on the other party is just gravy – they’d do it even if they were the only party in town. In fact they’d double down.

The Republican leadership doesn’t trade in facts because you don’t control emotional people with facts. And you control people to stay in power.

As long as feelings trump facts for a majority or a near majority of Americans on the major issues of the day—Republicans, or Democrats for that matter—aren’t the problem. It’s adults who face adversity a child's emotional maturity who are the problem. And before any person, this author included, gets all high and mighty and starts patting ourselves on our collective backs for their commitment to dispassionate logic and serene reason – some introspection sure might go a long way towards a national course correct."
2021-11-24 20:11,"It does seem odd that McCarthy et al support a strategy (no masks, no vaccines) that may kill off a good number of their voters by the mid-terms."

It’s hard to argue that that is not exactly what they are doing. It’s appalling"
2021-11-24 19:45,"Thank you.  This is the first article that I've read that finally makes clear that it is a critical mass of republican leaders at the federal, state and local level are the ones barring mandates, thus permitting (or should I say, welcoming) the virus to spread and mutate.  And  they've been continuously blaming Biden for the virus' spread.  It hasn't made any sense. 

The democrats need to be more forceful with this argument."
2021-11-24 20:13,"I would love for Congressional Republicans like Kevin McCarthy and Rand Paul, and Republican governors like DeSantis, Abbott Ducey and Kristi Noem, to name even a single measure they've taken to help quell the Covid pandemic (short of telling people to get vaccinated ""if they want"").

Anyone with a modicum of discernment can see this for what it is -- a cynical strategy of waging their political futures on opposing Joe Biden on EVERYthing, even common-sense measures that would protect their own constituents from catching and spreading a potentially fatal or long-term-incapacitating pathogen.

Alas, a lot of their supporters lack discernment.
People like this don't deserve to hold public office."
2021-11-24 19:48,"Apart from vaccine mandate, there is another method to encourage people to get vaccinated. Health insurance companies should charge more money for unvaccinated people because they have higher risk to be infected severely and cost more medical resources.
Why do those Republicans have so many absurd words? Because there are a large group of people believing their words. The education system fails to teach those people basic science."
2021-11-24 19:38,"As usual, the GOP wants it both ways. Like the way they vote against the infrastructure bill & then take credit for its benefits to constituents back home, today's Republicans will do anything they can to prevent Biden (like Obama, or an Democrat in Congress) from getting a ""win."" Despite the fact that it was and is their party, from Pres Trump to their congressional allies and GOP governors, who downplayed / denied / refused to work towards mitigating COVID across the country, they always try to offload the  blame. GOP denialism and that party's collective and utterly cynical playing to the base has been responsible for incredible death and destruction throughout America. The consequences of following this party line has literally been deadly for far too many. Don't buy what they're selling, people. GOP = DEATH should be the rallying cry, moving forward."

With the arrival of the delta variant in July mortality due to Covid is vastly different between the high vaccinated Blue States and the low vaccinated Red States.  In Red States since July, 71.4 people per 100 K population died of Covid complications.  In contrast, in Blue States 31.4 people per 100 K population died of Covid complications.  That difference in mortality (40 people per 100 K) means that over 60,000 more people died of Covid in Red States compared to Blue States.  I for one would certainly place blame on the leaders of those states who fought against mask and vaccine mandates.

Emotion and politics, not logic and science, rule the day. So, what else is new? Do we really think that the RNC will accept that the SARS-Co-V2 pandemic (now endemic) is not a political weapon?

Keeping your base enraged has been the path since Koch Industries launched and funded the ""Tea Party"" and with a bit of help from some of Putin's minions and a lot of willing American internet-trolls, we have a lot of Americans convinced that what happened didn't actually happen and if it did it is all the fault of Democrats.

They need to get tough and vocal -- the Republicans want Covid to continue because it weakens the economy, which is not good for any majority party and sitting president.  This is not rocket science, it's right out of the Republican dirty tricks and lies playbook..."

2021-11-24 22:08,"I read the first few paragraphs of this story and said to myself for the millionth time, no wonder Democrats lose elections.  
Why can’t the White House spokesman and the spokesman for the Dem Campaign Committee just say, “Mr. McCarthy and his Republican colleagues have the blood of thousands of Americans on their hands because they refused to encourage the people who trust them to take the smart and simple step to wear a mask and get vaccinated to protect themselves, their families, and their communities from a deadly virus. It’s tragic that they would blame President Biden when they worship a former president who has made it a Republican imperative to oppose common sense measures to contain an unprecedented public health emergency that has killed nearly 800,000 Americans in less than 2 years.  Mr. McCarthy should have used that 8 hours to reflect on his culpability in that breathtaking reality.”"
2021-11-24 20:44,"Biden should try a different tack on the vaccines.  He should start shouting from the rooftops that the current Trump administration vaccines aren't that good, they have breakthroughs and already need boosters and are just like Trump...defeated, a failure like a Trump business gone bankrupt.  Then, he should declare some catchy sci-fi sounding program to create a better vaccine.  

If he does that, watch the MAGA crowd fight to be first to get vaccinated."
2021-11-24 21:34,In the 19th century there was a third political party know as the Know Nothing Party. Their central focus was a raft of conspiracy theories (all untrue).  Perhaps it is time to rename the current GOP the Know Nothings as they are certainly following in those footsteps.  These people are just sorry excuses for human beings with no leadership abilities.  They will drive our country into the ground given half a chance.
2021-11-24 22:03,"When Republicans vote against a measure, they take credit for it, anyway.-Like the Stimulus and Infrastructure Bill

When they are in power, they do nothing, yet blame everyone else.-Like Obamacare.

Too bad the voting public can't see through their deception.

It would be nice if Congress could deny them the funding they vote against."
2021-11-24 22:10,"Biden's Covid response has been very effective in getting vaccines to everyone who wants them. My feeling is that there is a certain percentage of the population who really prefers to face the virus on their own because they believe that so-called natural immunity is somehow preferable. So those who want protection have it, and those who don't aren't being forced.

I would prefer that everyone be vaccinated, just as we are against polio. I know these vaccinated GOP politicians like Abbott, DeSantis and McCarthy are being cynical when they try to block even the most reasonable mandates. I think it's terrible that they put their own political ambitions above the lives of their constituents. But in the end, the unvaccinated are getting what they want. They really do have to accept responsibility for their choices."
2021-11-24 22:05,"The Republican plan: convince people to not take vaccines and other precautions to spread Covid, then blame Biden for the pandemic not ending. I give them credit, they know their supporters will fall for anything. Biden and Democrats need to focus on voting rights before they are gone, and get out the vote to bury the GOP in elections."
2021-11-24 21:50,We have been failed by both parties in the fight against covid. Republicans have opposed mandatory vaccinations which have been proven safe and effective. NYC is an excellent example that mandates work when you have politicians with the political courage to mandate and enforce despite blowback and political risk. Democrats have underestimated the risks of variants and the reluctance of so many to be vaccinated so that we are still behind most developed nations in the percentage of adults fully vaccinated. In another section of today's NYT the underuse of rapid testing under this administration was documented. The CDC has given confusing guidance and the FDA has been slow to review collected data.
2021-11-24 21:48,"It’s a known fact that the people who support Republicans will support whatever they say, where ever and whenever they say it.

Trump of course took people into an entire alternate reality, where many still live. He also could effectively drown out any message from HRC during the election.

I don't know where you find competent people who can run effective PR and publicity campaigns, but I can't believe they are all Republicans.

It's not even propaganda or anything close to it. It's literally repeating facts and talking about what it takes to end this pandemic."
2021-11-24 21:23,"Let's NOT be disbelieving. Let's not be ""incredulous."" Let's recognize that if Republicans tell you who they are, we really can believe them. They deny the tax evasion which Republicans routinely seem to embrace. They deny they are racist and bigoted which many of them seem to be.  They deny legitimate news outlets in favor of ""news"" from multi million dollar hacks like Tucker Carlson, twitter fanatics and Alex (the info wars guy) Jones. They try to legitimize pretenders to Congress like Jordan, Greene, Gaetz, Gomez, Cawfield, Boebert and those wonderful senators from states which have fewer people than most of our big cities. Talk about the tail trying to wag the dog."
2021-11-24 21:09,"Does anyone really believe this is NOT part of a cynical strategy? Vaccinated political leaders rail against safety and health measures in public, with many taking precautions in their offices and personal lives; whipping up a fervor about government intrusion, and then pointing fingers saying the government is failing. 

You can’t have it both ways. You can’t preach “individual responsibility” and shout for the government to stay out of your life and keep solutions local, then blame Biden.  What a joke. Shamelessness is about the only consistency among these Republicans. They seem perfectly content to sacrifice their constituents to keep the culture wars raging."
2021-11-24 21:20,It's easy to blame others for failures. It's much harder to actually write and enact legislation. What are these people being paid to do!?
2021-11-24 21:34,"Republican philosophy is, at its core, based on a series of paradoxes: respect for life paired with a comfort over high death rates; complaints about ineffective government paired with calls to further reduce taxes; love of free enterprise paired with tariffs and “buy America” campaigns; love of freedom until it comes to abortion and birth control. To oppose all strategies for fighting COVID and then complain when the disease gets worse makes the irony all the more obvious."
2021-11-24 21:48,"And the G.O.P. trashes the economy by allowing the unchecked spread of the virus thanks to a lying president, leading to mass-death and a rise in crime, then blames Biden.

And the G.O.P. opposes all common-sense gun control, leading to a spike in murders, then blames Biden.

And the G.O.P. president cuts a deal with the Taliban for a hasty departure from Afghanistan without any realistic measures to shore up the corrupt Kabul government for which no one was willing to die, leading to the Taliban's rapid takeover of the country and a perilous withdrawal, then blames Biden.

Rinse, repeat.

How many times do we have to see this same cynical G.O.P. strategy play out before the people who vote for them open their eyes and finally get it?"
2021-11-24 21:58,"Republicans fault Biden for not ""relying"" on natural immunity? Are they trying to sell a story that Biden has somehow repealed natural immunity? The people I feel sorriest for are those who believe that and so many other obvious falsehoods."
2021-11-24 21:01,"I'm sorry but this is no different than Democrats hammering Trump for very early in the outbreak banning flights from China. Then he was quickly accused of doing too little. You can't have it both ways. Trump was also ridiculed for saying he ordered drug companies to have a vaccine before the end of the year of 2020, and, they did under his extreme pressure. i didn't vote for him, I don't like him, but credit where credit is due."
2021-11-24 20:20,"I’m shocked! The Republicans would do that? Like they do every time after they destroy the economy and the Democrats are too slow to fix it? Or when they start a war and blame the Democrats for not ending it properly? Or ruining the environment and not willing to do anything about trying to save it? Or blaming guns, not people, for mass murders?
The list is incomplete but the pattern is consistent and undeniable."
2021-11-24 20:59,This is what underfunding education and sciences gets you.... a lack of basic understanding about how communicable illnesses are passed along in the community..... We are lucky that there was some belief in science and desire to improve human health in the 'dark ages' 200 years ago when scientists were respected and were able to lay the foundation of modern medical understandings. Otherwise we'd be totally sunk.
2021-11-24 21:04,"Of course the GOP blames Biden. That’s all they do: obstruct and blame. They do nothing constructive, nothing to improve this country or our lives. Nothing. But they do everything they can to prevent the reality of living in the present and planning for the future."

2021-11-24 21:55,Never thought we would see the American leadership of the Republican Party put people lives at risk - the same people who voted them in and will likely do so again! These politicians are a reflection of the majority of their electoral districts. Shows how easily people can be duped and misled. We were told that democracy works only if people can make sound choices of the best that America has to offer. What we are seeing are some of the worst people rising to the top with a most passionate following. America is being destroyed from within - no need for outside enemies. The enemies and their effective terrorists are within. Great empires are taken down from within. Who is now the trojan horse being taken into the halls of the US Govt. and  engineering the wrecking the country?
2021-11-24 21:08,"Mr. Biden told America many times during his campaign that he and his administration were going to get the virus under control.  Joe cast himself as the modern age FDR, his calm demeanor and generosity was going to wash over this nation and people would be eating out of his hand.  People would be clambering to get in line for a shot just because Joe told them to.  When that didn't happen it was the ignorant Trump supporters who keeping Biden from attaining a 70 percent vaccination rate by Independence Day.  Practically five months later the percentage of Americans who are fully vaccinated sits at 59 percent.  That's not the Republicans fault any more than it's Joe Biden's.  What Joe and the Dems don't want to realize is that most people don't want the government meddling in their personal lives and when the government tries to get heavy handed with them the public will turn on them like a rabid dog.  That and the inconsistent messaging regarding mask wearing and now mandating the public to get vaccinated or else lose their jobs has done nothing but put more distance between Biden and the people.  I don't think the Republicans are blaming Biden for the rise in covid cases as much as they are pointing out his ineffectiveness in delivering on his promise."
2021-11-24 21:15,"But Biden could be doing a lot more.  Have the FAA and his beloved Amtrak require vaccination for all air/rail passengers, for example.  And mandates currently in place could have been implemented much earlier.  Biden does have a lot to answer for here."

Rather, many choose to believe lying politicians or conspiracy theorists."
2021-11-24 21:07,"So Republicans refuse to participate in public health measures, but then blame the President when public health goes sideways? Sort of like promising to do something, not keeping the promise, and then blaming someone else because they couldn’t keep the promise. Republican “logic”….

It is time for President Biden, the president of all Americans, the majority of whom voted decisively for him, to get on TV with a well-written speech and lay the blame exactly where it belongs: on every Republican in and out of office who promotes this nonsense. Then every Democrat and other sane person must go out locally and hammer the message home: it is President Biden and the Democrats who achieving and Republicans who are failing. Paint them with the culpability they deserve, and don’t let it wash off."

the 3 men just found guilty in murdering arbury in GA - their defense claimed, in straight face, that Ahmaud was endangering the community and needed to be killed;
the ( republican) politicians justifying the Jan.6 mob attack on the Capitol have provided their cockamamie rationalizations and, not surprisingly, there is an audience of millions  accepting that rationalizations with a cheer.
the 17 (!) years old Rittenhouse brought a battle field automatic machine gun to... defend himself !? ...and was equated.
the list of how truly lopsided, no - outrageously contorted our interpretations of what takes place in America - is indeed very long. and rather unsettling. to say the least.
im afraid that even that traditionally self - congratulatory, sanctimonial thanksgiving tomorrow could not provide a cover for the absurdity pervading our lives. the master dramatists of the theatre of the absurd couldn't have possibly come up with many of These scenarios.{ think of Ionesco""s "" the Rhinoceros"", as one example}.

The Biden Administration has worked tirelessly since day one to bring the pandemic under control. Now we seeing cases increasing among the unvaccinated and thew GOP is still at it with their nonsense. Ironically those being hit the hardest at present is the so called trump base."

2021-11-24 21:21,"“Over eight hours last Thursday night and into Friday morning, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California hit on many issues as he spoke on the House floor in an unsuccessful effort to thwart House passage of President Biden’s social safety net and climate change bill. But among his most audacious assertions was that Mr. Biden was to blame for the country’s failure to quell the pandemic.”
This would be laughable if not for the fact that these people can sell sand at a premium to the citizens of Arizona. Maddeningly, the response is thank you, may I have another truckload. All while telling their marks, “It’s Biden’s fault that the people of New Mexico have more sand than you, and you deserve their sand.” Relax, Arizona and New Mexico and the sand concession are just a handy metaphor for a national illness of unscrupulous elected officials.
The inability of so many to discern the difference between scientifically proven fact and the lies of conspiracy peddlers on cable infotainment and in Washington is an existential threat to American democracy.

“Republican strategists believe Mr. Biden’s approval ratings on the economy . . . cannot improve until voters are more satisfied with his performance on the pandemic.”
The Republican propaganda machine has harnessed the power of a deadly pandemic for power and profit. They have managed to sell death from a Covid infection as glorious martyrdom for the cause to about 45% of Americans. Sadly, 100% of Americans suffer the consequences."
2021-11-24 21:24,"Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster who has surveyed voters on the issue. “The bottom line is that Republicans have always been more focused on the economic impact of the pandemic, and now we’re seeing independents and swing voters expressing concern about those impacts as well: supply chain, inflation, jobs, stores not being open or having what they need.”

In other words, Repubs are more concerned with the economy than with the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people (heavily skewed to the non-vaccinated, their cult members). What they seem too stupid to understand is that the only way the economy improves is for the pandemic to end and they have done everything, short of protesting at vaccination sites, to keep that from happening."
2021-11-24 21:57,"The Party of Lies of Lies, Delusions and Hatred - and we can probably add Derangement to the list - is one of the most important reasons why the pandemic is still ongoing.  

It’s their elected officials and supporters who have fought mask and vaccine mandates tooth-and-nail, and spread disinformation about Covid-19.  

To blame President Biden for the rising Covid cases is ludicrous, but that’s what one expects from these deranged Republicans, who are a threat to public health and safety."
2021-11-24 21:21,That was the plan all along. Republicans may institute dangerous policies like banning masks but they are not stupid. They knew setbacks with COVID would not be blamed in the media on them. That media reports would be Biden is the President and COVID wasn’t under control. Not that their rejecting masks and mandates further the pandemic. They are well aware of how easy it is to manipulate the media.

McCarthy (kinda like another McCarthy in our not too distant history) gaslights and lies. 

What was Biden supposed to do with the intransigent R's who refuse vaccines and masking, while inviting Covid? Send out squads of RN's to pin down the anti-vaxxers and give them a jab? 

What Biden could do is mandate vaccines nationally (like the EU is moving towards). But with such a mandate, we know the squeals and howls the GOPers would emit at ""government overreach"". 

It's a no win for the Biden administration as McCarthy, and all but a handful of elected GOPers, will continue to gaslight and lie. And, sadly, their sheep will believe them --- while remaining unvaccinated and spreading disease.

The current crop of GOPers say No to legislation. No to negotiation. No to lifesaving vaccines. No to democracy.

So of course they buy all the lies put out by Fox and most of their politicians. They have no idea who a true expert is, and when doctors with years of experience say the best thing we can do is get a safe vaccine...it of course becomes gov overreach and unconstitutional. 

Helping your fellow citizen is unheard of to them. Yet, they blame the rise in covid infections, primarily among the unvaccinated, on Biden. And people die and it's the democrats fault. The playbook never changes.

The ignorance and hypocrisy is deafening. 
And of course claims of voter fraud with no evidence -- and only when repubs lose -- that's totally correct. Right.

Repubs have not done anything honorable since Eisenhower's Interstate Act of 1956 that authorized the construction of 41,000 miles of new interstate highways.

I've been around since Truman and have learned 95% of repubs will never change.

What can we do. Truly is beyond comprehension what they've become. And scary."

Rather than staying focus on stopping the pandemic, it's clear he stopped prioritizing it after the initial push for COVID vaccines and has allowed the FDA and CDC to slow walk vaccines for children and boosters.  It was clear back in June boosters were needed to stop transmission and stop infections, yet where was his leadership is aggressively promoting them even as other countries started rolling them out?!  It was clear schools would reopen in the Fall, yet why was he not doing an operation wrap speed for 5-12 vaccines (see the American Academy of Pediatrics critical letter condemning the slow pace of work on vaccines for kids).  Also, why did the administration not duel track on day one variant specific generation 2 boosters.  Moderna even did a Phase 2 trail on one, but CDC and FDA failed to jump on it.  No, Biden has totally mismanaged this pandemic.  He has not acted proactively - as any good project manager or leader would - to get ahead of it or make sure his CDC and FDA were not treating this as an academic exercise.  And he has not adapted strategies to the reality that some people foolishly will not be vaccinated to prioritize protecting the rest of us.  Shame on him.  He deserves criticism."

Securing our unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is of such paramount importance to the legitimacy of our government, our founders went on to say in the Declaration of Independence, 

“That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government ….”

The assertion of an authority to harm by government “representatives” denies those harmed their lives, liberties, and opportunity to pursue happiness, the unalienable rights endowed on all of us as declared in our country’s founding document, i.e., the Declaration of Independence. This very same document goes on to say “That to secure these rights, [i.e., our unalienable rights,] Governments are instituted among Men ….” 

By definition, COVID-19, government policies that encourage the disease’s spread are an illegitimate exercise of governmental authority. Those in government who create, endorse, and enforce such policies should change course or be removed from public office post haste."

Your lede assumes that vax mandates have been demonstrated to work, Biden has done everything else correctly, and is undeserving of any blame.

""Republicans have fought mask requirements and vaccine mandates for months, but as coronavirus infections again rise, they are blaming the president for failing to end the health crisis.""

However, the CDC has not published a single, peer reviewed study showing that vax mandates work, or that mandated masking of school children makes us safer.  (Please cite any studies to the contrary, stripped of confounding factors.)

After winning election by promising that he ""alone could shut down a worldwide pandemic,"" Biden failed, in part because no president (no, not Trump, either) can do this alone.  

Biden's covid messaging has been as crudely partisan as the GOP's, and both should be condemned.

Moreover, it was only five months ago that Biden prematurely declared victory over covid and urged Americans to celebrate over the 4th of July holiday.  This sent millions of Americans out to mingle as a more virulent strain circulated.

Biden got blindsided by Delta, despite early warnings from Europe, because we did not do the genomic testing and sequencing necessary to track, assess and manage this threat.

The Biden administration failed to establish a national program of efficient contact tracing, or timely approve and distribute instant covid tests, allowing quick isolation of infected individuals.  So many points of failure."

God save the planet  and our country if Trump is returned to office. 

 And, yes I do blame T's response for 90+% of the Covid deaths in the US. You only need to look at Asia to see that this could have been managed without losing nearly 1 million US lives. You only need to see the interview with Bob Woodward to see that the Trump administration knew everything and was in communication with China early on.

However, Democratic politicians should be aware that there are diminishing returns for such policies, and higher political prices to be paid. No reason to spend political capital to save people from themselves.

For all intents and purposes, the Pandemic is almost over for all people who are enlightened as to their own self-interest. That is, those who are willing to get Booster shots when they are on offer.

Covid Delta will continue to burn through communities of benighted and foolish people, but that no longer constitutes a public health crisis.

In a few months -- perhaps around the time of the State of the Union Address -- it would be an opportune time to announce an imminent  relaxation of some of the Mandate policies ( once the Cold-Weather months are behind us ). By then, most of the good that was to be done will have been gleaned.

Instead, implement a new Voluntary policy going forward: Those Adults who voluntarily refuse to get Fully Vaccinated can *voluntarily* take on the financial burdens of their Healthcare: Hospitalization, Treatments, Medications, Rehabilitation, and Convalescence.

Response has been driven by the economy, not by science. You don’t run  a PUBLIC health campaign by putting emphasis on INDIVIDUAL responsibility. So what’s driving this short sighted pandemic response? No idea, but I do have questions about how Jeff Zients, whose background is in business and economics, became Biden’s coronavirus response coordinator replacing Deborah Birx."

Finally, those who stubbornly and ignorantly refuse to get vaccinated and boosted are now also responsible for the deaths of Americans and for the supply chain and inflation issues.

That should go viral (""viral"" -- ha, sorry) among the right wing as they fall all over each other to stick it to Joe Biden and display their Trumpian zeal.

It is a provable fact that Republicans themselves--to stay in Dear Leader's good graces--are in fact the ones who have made the pandemic worse. They have done so by flagrantly denying scientific facts about Covid, and by refusing to wear masks and even making it illegal for others in their various states to order mask mandates.

It will get you through an infection you caught in the last week or so but not protect you for long afterwards.  The pills are not yet approved but the cost is expected to be >$100 and again it doesn't provide long term protection.  With these therapies you can catch Covid repeatedly and run up your bills each time.

Republican politicians are promoting expensive stop-gap therapies when the vaccines provide better and longer term protection at a much lower cost.  The vaccines have not caused dangerous side effects in the earliest clinical trial participants and have had low levels of serious side effects in the larger general population.

All they can do - and it is important - is mitigate the severity of the illness. And this is good enough. We need to learn to live with this pandemic.

The way out of this pandemic and for people to be able to work and play and relax and enjoy their families is to get vaccinated and continue to practice CDC guidelines by social distancing in public, and washing their hands. Wear your mask.

Rinse and repeat.

The Covid-19 crisis is the latest example, but look at the 2008 financial crisis: 1) Loosen FDR's financial regulations that protected us for 50 years (loosening started by Reagan, continued by the Republican Congress under Clinton who wrote bills rolling back Glass-Steagall and relaxing constraints on financial derivatives, which Clinton signed to his everlasting regret, and continued by Bush II). 2) When the 2008 crisis came as a result of relaxed financial regulations, Republicans blamed it on laws that prohibited red-lining and discrimination against minority loan applicants, which had little to do with causing the crisis. 3) When Obama was elected and took action to solve the crisis, Republicans in Congress obstructed him at every turn, thereby greatly weakening and prolonging the economic recovery and causing tremendous suffering for working-class Americans. 4) Trump exploited the suffering of working-class Americans to get elected.

It was not until several states and municipalities said heck with the CDC, we’re giving boosters to everyone that the CDC then came out in support of that approach. And now there is a patchwork of restrictions or lack thereof not based in any real world assessment of data or risk, with the head of the CDC now making ridiculous assertions that easily are disproven, further leading local governments to give up looking for solid direction from the federal government or CDC and make up their own set of rules. 

This is called the caboose driving the train. President Biden should be the conductor and the engineer. Instead for some reason he decided to stop leading us out of the pandemic and let the CDC push us back into a pre-vaccine world. More and more people have realized that it is time to move on.

Recall that McCarthy’s attorney Roy Cohn’s wrote Tail Gunner Joe’s playbook of the Big Lie, of waving sheets of paper supposedly containing lists of “card-carrying Communists,” of making up “facts” as he ranted in the Senate. Cohn later mentored a young Donald Trump. 

Now, as in the 50’s, the party is being cleansed of those few who still embrace responsible governance, coherent policy, or worse, cooperation with the other party. Those who remain keep their heads down, telling themselves - like Mitch McConnell - that they’re the adult in the room, even as they look away from ever more abuse of our democracy. It’s about re-election, not governance.

It. Is. Not. Hard.

Get vaccinated.  Get your booster.  When not sure of others vaccination status mask up and distance if possible.

2021-11-25 2:45,These people are not serious players.  They totally dropped the ball as it related to Covid from the very top of the ladder to the bottom.  They continue getting in the way of beating this virus even as Americans continue to die.  They have given a blueprint to America’s enemies on how to destroy America without dropping a single bomb.  I have read that they simply want power.  From what I have observed many of these Republican politicians don’t seem to bright.  I don’t think they seek power.  I think they seek the paycheque.

The hypocrisy is absolutely staggering.
If anything, if republicans gain control of the house and senate next year, let them come up with a plan to eradicate the pandemic! I guarantee that mask wearing , social distancing, vaccination will become the lay of the land.  Democrats will have no choice but agree lest they’ll be branded as hypocrites by the republican majority.
Democrats should wake up to the republican con job, and message accordingly."

Even companies, compared to people after Citizens United, are being denied the ability to promote safe working conditions by requiring vaccinations.

Following leadership, bread and butter Republicans aren't taking simple steps to help themselves. 

With all this  negativity, its no wonder COVID has persevered.

If Republicans take over congress next year, what will their approach to COVID be?  Fine and/or incarcerate people spreading the virus? Or maybe they'll simply ban the virus altogether."
2021-11-25 2:58,Maybe if the administration sent someone credible to sell masks and vaccines it would work.

Their continued efforts to politicize vaccines & masks with no regard for human life is astounding & their trying to blame Democrats & Biden is predictable.  They have played the long game for years with the goal of winning at any and all costs for pure power & money.  It is a disgrace that we live under their tyranny when they are the minority.  I am sick of it."
2021-11-25 1:06,"The Trump administration was rightfully criticized for its uncoordinated and sometimes clearly wrong covid policy.

But Biden has done little better. As long as the CDC has been in existence there has never been a disease for which there were no treatment guidelines for clinicians. And there still are none.

If you were infected you were told to go home, let the disease incubate and when it compromised your breathing, go to an ER.

This wasn't science or medicine. It was politics. While Biden didn't initiate this course he has continued to followed it.

Biden has one course and one course alone for our entire public health pandemic initiative, vaccination. But this summer two things became clear.

 The vaccines could not stop infection from the delta variant and the efficacy of the vaccines waned after only six months.

Biden's response was more vaccinations and more boosters. How long will boosters last? We don't know. 

What are the long term effects of multiple jabs? We don't know.

What data do we have on vaccine safety for kids? Vaccine safety trials for children normally take years. Now we claim to have accomplished those protocols in a matter of weeks.

One needn't be a virologist to see that somethings wrong with this picture.

So, we've gone back and forth from mediocre to bad, back to mediocre in our pandemic policy.

The common thread throughout  this misguided effort is Dr. Anthony Fauci.

The answer going forward is simple. Dr. Fauci must be replaced."

Meanwhile, MarketWatch — owned by the same folks as own Fox News — reports that 
the cause of increased Covid fatalities is “not just persistently low vaccine uptake but also the relaxation of safety measures such as wearing face masks and avoiding indoor gatherings.”

In short, precisely the behavior espoused by Fox News."

A more productive strategy, they argue, would have been making a full-throated push for Covid treatments and other approaches that the unvaccinated might have been more willing to accept.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just this one insane comment of many from the republicans shows how truly unhinged they are. So if I read this correctly, people should just take a huge crapshoot and not get vaccinated or wear masks, but IF they get Covid, there are good treatments?

2021-11-25 3:25,"Watch out south!  The current COVID wave is coming for you again. You can watch the wave migrating slowly south.

Tennessee is up 30% in cases from its recent low. West Virginia is trending up as well. Texas, and the deep south will be next.

This will go on and on until we get virtually everyone vaccinated. We are approaching 80% vaccinated in some Northeastern and far western states and still seeing a dire surge. (See Vermont and Massachusetts)

Repeat: This will go on until we get virtually everyone vaccinated. Forget herd immunity, get vaccinated now."
2021-11-25 3:31,"Republicans who say that President Biden should have focused on promoting treatments for individuals who have Covid-19 are promoting a strategy that will greatly prolong the pandemic. Unvaccinated individuals who develop Covid-19 and then present for treatment will have had more than ample opportunity to infect others. In contrast, vaccinated people are less likely to become infected, and if they do become infected to have less serious disease and shed less virus than unvaccinated people who become infected. 
Also, the Republications are all about ending waste in government. However, it is 100-times more expensive to treat someone with covid-19 than to vaccinate a person, a public health intervention that suppresses the spread of the virus and prevents people from becoming serious ill. 
Why are Republicans opposing the most effective tool for ending the pandemic, vaccination?  They want more people to die so that they can blame President Biden for the deaths. This position, and their continuing support for the traitor, Donald Trump, make McCarthy and his ilk a profound danger both to the health of Americans and to the survival of this ""Last best hope of mankind."""

2021-11-25 4:14,"By the time this ends, there will only be three types of people. The vaccinated, the people who recovered from Covid-19, and the dead."
2021-11-25 4:32,"It seems that the Republican leaders are willing to encourage their constituents to decline treatments and mitigation that protects them from Covid-19, just for political gain.  Do they also not see the downside of having so many of their supporters risk death, just to make President Biden look bad?  While they may get the continuing support of Republicans, can they not see they are also losing them to the virus.  How can this be good politics?"
2021-11-25 4:44,Can we get insurance companies to not cover any Covid expenses for someone who isn’t vaccinated (and could have been)?
2021-11-24 23:53,"It is interesting to read some of the rationale, some having merit, most laughable, about why Biden failed, why contact tracing doesn’t work, why mandates never work as reasoning to not become vaccinated or encourage vaccination. 

Biden isn’t at fault. He has tried-the mandate for employees is stayed-thanks to legal actions from “red” states, including mine. 

Imagine if we boomers tried some lame rationale when vaccines for the epidemics we faced in mid-20th century. 
We lined up. No question. 
And never blamed Ike for encouraging us to get our vaccinations. 
For those you that believe Trump more than science, imagine the country if we had Trump as our leader when we were children."
2021-11-25 5:36,"I don't see how President Biden can be blamed for the virus or the continued spread or dissemination of the disease.  It is beyond party politics and the virus recognises neither blue nor red.

By the same token data and our lived experiences seem to suggest that vaccines and masks are less than failsafe in preventing one from contracting the disease.  There are ample cases already of thrice vaccinated still getting Covid.   What is also empirically clear is that the vaccination gives those a risk a much greater chance of surviving the disease and it does seem to impede rather than prevent further contraction.  

Politicians and administrators need to stop the blame game and the soundbites and put together a comprehensive policy that includes education and encouragement towards vaccination, marrying that programme with greater promotion and distribution of the anti-viral medicines that are appearing increasingly effective and recognising that hospitalisation and death numbers are the way to measure progress not gross numbers of infection."
2021-11-25 6:02,"Im a pilot, and as a pilot, I am bound to regulations that the FAA has created on the backs of pilots before me that made mistakes we have learned from. The FAA rules are tough and many, but they are there to save lives and make travel safe for the public, so we follow them, or we are grounded. Seems to me the FDA and CDC need to become as powerful in terms of enforcing public health as the FAA is in terms of enforcing aviation regulations. It is the FAA that carries out and enforces it’s regulations, not politicians. It’s why our skies are safe. If politicians were in charge of holding air carriers and civil aviation to the regulations, planes would be falling out of the sky, just like allowing politicians to decide health policy has led to so much death in this pandemic."
2021-11-25 10:13,"As a Republican, I think we might have gone to the well once too often on blaming the Democrats on COVID.  Schemes where you are just always the party in opposition, without new or better ideas or a platform really to run on, just trying to make people angry, are getting a little old. It is a political re-run, and the voters are getting tired of it.  

You cannot fight the Democrats every step of the way on pandemic abatement measures, and then complain it has not gone away.  Is there room to criticize the Democrats on COVID?  Certainly.  But the Republicans are mostly on the wrong side of the necessary steps and issues.  Businesses need to be free to institute mandates, vaccine and masking, so that they can get workers (and customers) back into their buildings, and not have to pay a premium for  medical or salary costs for unsafe places of work. We could lose business support because of this. There needs to be further vaccine development and evolution, not just boosters, but vaccines that specifically attack Delta and other new variants.   Vaccine production needs also to be ramped up, so that further variants do not develop, domestically or internationally.   Some of the Democratic constituencies have been slow to get vaccinated, that is on the Democrats to fix, hesitancy is not solely a white Republican male uptake problem.  Rapid testing needs to be cheap and ubiquitous.  CDC messaging needs to be clearer and metric/threshold based.  Public health spending increased."
2021-11-25 10:26,"-Let's be clear, they were wrong about Mr. Joe Biden, they thought he was a President of transition, because of his leisurely walk, but they got a big surprise, they found a man of integrity, honest, thorough, a warrior and brave defender of the truth and the scientific method, who makes use of his experience and performs with wisdom; The detractors who before applauded the demagogy behind the scenes, now the shadows give them away, because expecting a fearful president they found a president who is a ""statesman"" with his head held high in the storm, who knows where is the interest of the homeland and where is the common good that exalts American democracy in the world. A true leader, a commander who knows the challenges, who does the right things, who faces the front, who does not need to denigrate the weak because his level is high, because he puts things in their place in their true dimension."
2021-11-25 11:42,"An articulate piece, and I would be impressed except for two considerations.  First, Biden campaigned as someone who would bring effective, unifying leadership to the Presidency.  That means making plans that work.   A unifying President doesn't bludgeon his constituents into submission through things like ham-handed vaccine mandates.  What we have here is a failure to provide the leadership Mr. Biden promised.
Second, the Democrats, prior to the November election, did a fair amount to cast doubt on the advisability of the Trump vaccine initiative.   Seems to this reader that vaccine refusals now are at least partly a matter of pigeons coming home to roost."

It’s almost as if masks and caution don’t make much of a difference…?"
2021-11-25 7:18,"Can anyone explain why the Biden administration has never implemented any sort of National testing and contact tracing? 
Are we meant to be clever enough to get multiple vaccine doses or , what? Die off?
I’m a transplant patient and have no idea if my 3 doses protect me or not- no antibody tracing- it feels like everyone seeks to avoid liability and so decides- take the wonderful vaccine or die off.
I’ve never felt so keenly that the government doesn’t care about me at all.- they care about metrics and optics and platforms and narratives.
Can’t they govern for the people?
Why are we disposable?"
2021-11-25 11:00,"This is once again an issue where the numbers don't match up to with reality. And as the GOP house leader tried o insist that the president has failed to stop the pandemic, he failed to show one example of positive steps he has taken to assist the president to quell the virus.  Not once has he so much as reprimanded in public GOP house members who refuse to comply with mask mandates.  
So as  Kevin McCarthy is mentally planning on how he will redecorate the House Speakers office in 2022, his constituents are dying waiting for him to articulate how once he is in control of the House he plans to help end the pandemic as well as all the financial ramifications that stem from the Civic crisis. 
To date, McCarthy seems only trying to stem the supply chain issue. People who are on ventilators or dead tend not to be comsumers."
2021-11-25 6:43,"Biden deserves a good deal of blame for declaring victory too early, specifically on July 4, when he went ahead with ""Freedom Day"" fireworks even as he knew the Delta variant was already spreading like wildfire. Instead of doubling gown on mitigation efforts, his CDC removed the mask mandate ""for the vaccinated,"" knowing full well that there was no effective way to check who was vaccinated and who wasn't: it just gave carte blanche to the vaccine resistors to go maskless and spread the virus more widely. Biden has put all his chips on vaccines, and his vaccine policy has been driven by how it will affect the psychology of the unvaccinated, who have long been a lost cause, resistant to logic in any case."
2021-11-25 8:18,"The GOP have rotted to the core to blame Mr Biden for not curing the virus yet while they fight for no masks on planes ,schools any where they are in charge.  And also fight against mandates which do work to receive the vaccines.   The GOP have been out of touch with our reality and all for  giving the rich more money and us working Americans less.  When gas and oil are outlawed wait for more chaos from them.  At least they won’t be able to use gas cars soon in Europe as they are ending fossil fuel use in 9 years and won’t sell any gas or diesel vehicles either."
2021-11-25 5:40,"If there's one thing that has been a complete failure under Biden is the development of vaccines for children. It took less than 9 months to create a vaccine for adults from scratch as part of the Operation Warp Speed. It's been almost a year since the vaccine for adults was approved and there's still millions of children who are not yet eligible for the vaccine, including children with underlying health conditions (who are disproportionately black and hispanic). It is unforgivable that Operation Warp Speed was abandoned, and that even public health measures were largely abandoned over the summer per CDC recommendations, before kids had access to the vaccine. Moderna STARTED their trial for kids 2-5 last month, more than a year and a half into the pandemic. The government keeps saying it's a pandemic of the unvaccinated, yet they won't allow my kids to be vaccinated. And it's not like they're testing ten different vaccines and trying to figure out the best option. That would at least somewhat justify the slowness of the process. The only vaccines under consideration are the mRNA vaccines. If they prove to be unsafe, there's no back-up plan. It's an utter mess, and kids are suffering and even dying as a result."
2021-11-25 5:45,"This is not rocket science. 

The Republicans have a concerted plan to resist any and all health measures to end the pandemic at the expense of the health and lives of Americans  so that they will be able to claim that Biden failed, all in order for them to use that narrative to stay in power. 

They know better."
2021-11-25 5:41,"One quote from the article: ""Mr. McCarthy used this line of attack even as members of his own Republican Party have spent months flouting mask ordinances and blocking the president’s vaccine mandates, and the party’s base has undermined vaccination drives while rallying around those who refuse the vaccine. Intensive care units and morgues have been strained to capacity by the unvaccinated, a demographic dominated by those who voted last year for President Donald J. Trump.""
To my knowledge I do not recall anyone ever accusing Kevin McCarthy and his Merry Band of having been rational and having common sense and human decency and their supporters appear to be similarly deficient.  Kevin and his Merry Band seem incapable of estimating how they will do with time moving forward.   I wonder also how those folks accept so many things modern science has given us such as cars, trains, airplanes, computers, cell phones, etc  and turn a blind eye and deaf ear to the growing difference in the correlation between those who are infected with Covid and those who are not with the substantial difference between those who are vaccinated and those who are not.  And all that after all the tax money spent by public schools educating students about science."
2021-11-25 9:40,"Europe has all of these ""measures"" and yet it is the worst COVID hotspot in the world. Some states in the US have implemented nearly all of these measures and yet see surges again. Why can we believe that by implementing more of what has basically failed everywhere, would succeed. I don't think Biden is to blame for having failed to control the epidemic, because it was impossible. However, he could be blamed for having claimed he will."
2021-11-25 5:44,What else is new? This GOP political playbook.
2021-11-25 6:22,It’s almost as if the Republicans are betting on the media to let them get away with this.  I wonder why…
2021-11-25 5:25,"It's the most absurd thing:  Republicans are fighting at every level against the Biden Administration's anti-COVID efforts and then have the gall to blame Biden for the persistence of the virus.  Where are the DNC ads touting the administration's efforts and the GOP's obstruction.

And yes, there are more deaths this year than last, because epidemics grow exponentially.  It took a long time to get to 400,000 deaths; it takes much less to get the next 400,000."

Consistent with rest of their behavior though."
2021-11-25 6:17,"""The death rate in those Republican counties is nearly six times as high as the death rate in the Democratic counties.""

I'd say this is proof of two things.  First and foremost, it appears that God is unmoved by  supplication.  If indeed He is All Powerful, All Knowing, Everywhere Present and the Protector of Those Who Follow His Commandments, why are the fervid faithful dying like flies?

And second, He appears actually to prefer the ""Socialism"" of ""Forgive The Sinner"" over the ""Eye For An Eye"" model. Is God actually a Democrat?"

That is the argument the Republicans are making."
2021-11-25 8:34,Current Republican party officials have managed to twist themselves into pretzels trying to prove up is down and down is up. But all they’ve managed to prove is that left is right and right is WRONG. Dead wrong.
2021-11-25 8:13,"Of the many ridiculous claims Republicans have made about how Biden is doing a bad job, this one is the most absurd. Biden has done everything in his power to stop the pandemic -- from upping vaccine distribution to requiring masks on public transportation to helping distribute treatments like monoclonal antibodies. He had to resort to vaccine mandates partly because of the misinformation Republicans were spreading to discourage vaccinations. I agree with the White House official in this article who says that had Republicans been more supportive of efforts to end the pandemic, our economy would be recovering faster than it is, and more people would feel safer going to restaurants, travelling, etc."
2021-11-25 5:12,"What did they want him to do, stop vaccines, and masks?

Or promote dewormer as a cure?

The only thing I would blame his administration for is they were slow to be straight about unlikelihood of reaching herd immunity with Delta.  Denying boosters wasn't his fault but those under him but those under 65 are just reaching the 6 month point when they should get one, so largely no harm no foul."
2021-11-25 5:25,So what else is new. Next Republicans will blame Biden for climate change while continuing to argue that it doesn’t exist. Logic was never a high priority for them.
2021-11-25 2:54,"Part of the problem is that the Democrats are oblivious to the Black backlash against health care authoritarianism and the frequent outbreaks of systemic racism in the Black community that have happened throughout the pandemic.  Texas, which has the largest number of African Americans of any state in the nation at 3.9 million, has acted in accordance with the needs of its constituents as have many other red states with a large Black population.

Recently, we saw a group of Black Texans fly to New York where they were instantly stripped of the civil rights they enjoy in Texas.  When they protested the new authoritarian restrictions imposed on them just to get food to eat, they were blocked from eating when they were hungry, had racial insults hurled at them and even got arrested.  They got a lawyer and were deported back to Texas to get their freedoms back.

The Kaiser Foundation's recent data shows that less than half of Black Americans have received even one vaccination dose despite the widespread, on demand, availability.  This is why Republican governors with a large number of Black constituents have joined with unions to fight vaccine mandates.

Republicans can't wait for the Democrats to see the damage from systemic racism to Black Republican constituents when the statistics, polls and studies come out.  Woke Republicans are already seeing the preliminary damage.  The Republicans have taken the lead at addressing systemic racism preemptively."
2021-11-25 4:59,"Another point…..while these reckless politicians were exacerbating the virus situation, many CEOS and organizations sat silent.  It is time for them to start opening up their mouths.  The economic recovery will not happen until the virus is under control."

But that’s highly unlikely."
2021-11-25 12:54,"""A more productive strategy, they argue, would have been making a full-throated push for Covid treatments and other approaches that the unvaccinated might have been more willing to accept.""

So waiting for people to become infected with a potentially life-threatening disease, and hoping to cure them of that disease is more ""acceptable"" to these folks than taking easy-to-perform steps to prevent becoming infected?  The future really doesn't look too bright if people like that are in charge."

The not-so-Grand-Old-Party continues to define itself by its selfishness and destructive behavior that ignores the needs of average, everyday Americans, and particularly people of color.

The GOP can dance around the issue and pretend, courtesy of Donald Trump only to some extent, that it cares about the little guy, but neither he nor they ever have. It is one of the biggest and longest cons, akin to a street-corner three-card monte shell game, ever perpetrated on the American people. But, apparently, it works. So they continue.

I get that many of the wealthy and powerful among us support Republicans because the party caters to their seemingly insatiable greed. In it's own way, that may be the purest motivator among its supporters. But it does not explain why so many who live on the lower socio-economic rungs tolerate policies that only pretend to favor them.

My take on it, aside from those who say they genuinely support Republicans simply because of its tax policies, is that its less and less subliminal messaging, and increasingly overt gerrymandering, are designed, with growing clarity and urgency, to delay the day when whites will no longer be in the majority in this country. It's that simple.

That's mainly because they don't have major political parties and their ring-wing media allies trying to sabotage government efforts to contain the virus as the U.S. does. 

Yes, Europe has its pockets of anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers, but in general, governments there appear far more willing to take the tough measures necessary to get the virus under control. Bravo especially to Germany and Austria for banning the unvaccinated from much of public life. They're doing what's needed at this point."
2021-12-06 11:43,"Delta is causing the spread in Europe. Europe is on edge about the current Delta wave which is causing huge problems throughout the continent.

Omicron is being watched, but nobody in the Netherlands is ""on edge"" about a different variant when the current one is causing such harm."
2021-12-06 11:50,"“the German government, which had been hesitant to put in place government mandates around the pandemic because of the country’s history with authoritarianism, has plans to make vaccination compulsory next year.”

By next year this will be irrelevant, which is precisely why they chose not to do it now:

Political posturing without consequences.

Exactly what I expected from this government."
2021-12-06 12:07,Let's hope that omicron turns out to be the highly contagious and much less virulent (less disease and death) causing variant that we have been hoping and waiting for. As a scientist it is too early to be optimistic but I am very hopeful.
2021-12-06 12:23,"As irresponsable as the unvaccinated are showing themselves to be, the health organizations and the media are disappointingly proving to be just as irresponsible. Not a word in the article indicates the severity of the Omicron variant. Highly contagious? Yes. Deadly? Nothing so far indicates that it is even likely to cause moderate symptoms. Please stop the fear mongering (I realize it keeps people glued to the media) and concentrate on the real problem and the only solution: getting the unvaccinated vaccinated."
2021-12-06 12:15,"Excellent pun in the headline!!  The spike is causing a spike, and both causing much concern.  Kudos!"
2021-12-06 12:43,"European nations are actually testing, therefore detecting and getting a sense of how the variant is spreading. The US can only lamely, passively wait for glimpses of their data as the variant spreads unchecked here."
2021-12-06 13:00,"What about questioning the efficacy of the vaccines? In parts of France where vaccination rates are above 80% both cases and hospitalizations are rising. The hospitalized are not only the unvaccinated.  We keep hearing about how worse it would be without these double and now triple vaccinations. But really? 
Weren’t we told we’d be out of the woods by now?"
2021-12-06 13:04,On London busses and trains I always see a number of massless people. The percentage of them varies but they are always present. All that in spite of regular announcements on bus and train stating that all must wear a mask. This gets worrisome when we’re all packed in like sardines.
2021-12-06 12:00,"So far the anecdotal evidence points to omicron being more contagious but not as lethal as delta. In the end this might be a ""good"" thing as a more ""lethal"" variant gets displaced by a less lethal one.

Hope this pans out..."
2021-12-06 13:17,"There is no real evidence--yet--that this variant is any deadlier than the previous variants. In fact, the early evidence may point to a less virulent virus. Stop making people panic, but do encourage vaccines and boosters. There is surely evidence that boosters will be effective in eliminating severe illness in much of the population."
2021-12-06 13:18,"Let us not worry too much about Omicron.
 Early reports suggest that most breakthrough infections with Omicron have been mild, which is good news. If Omicron can dodge neutralizing antibodies, it does not mean that immune responses triggered by vaccination and prior infection will offer no protection against the variant. Immunity studies suggest that modest levels of neutralizing antibodies may protect people from severe forms of COVID-19. Other aspects of the immune system, particularly T cells, may be less affected by Omicron’s mutations than are antibody responses. 
So we have enough defense mechanisms against Omicron."
2021-12-06 13:29,"Okay, it's a variant.  Okay, it spreads quickly.  Okay, so what?  Spreading can be benign unless it breaks through current vaccinations.  So far, that's not the case.  Everything points to a mild reaction even in the unvaccinated.  If that's not the case, say so instead of screaming ceaselessly.  As for the unvaccinated, let them live under the cloud of uncertainty."
2021-12-06 13:32,"There can be no return to normalcy until most of us are willing to make the behavioral changes required.  Otherwise, the virus will relentlessly survive, spread and mutate.  

Vaccine and mask hesitancy is like playing Russian roulette with a virus gun.  While it appears that most of us don't die from COVID-19 or even get sick, new variants could easily be more deadly and horrible.  

People need to find a less suicidal way to express their political views."
2021-12-06 11:41,"We re headed from the US to Scotland for Christmas, we think, and we hope we can get back. We re vax’d, and testing before both flights plus a test and 2 day quarantine on arrival should do the trick. The hotel assured us plenty of restaurants and shops deliver food and beer during our short quarantine."
2021-12-06 11:49,"The omicron variant should serve as a warning to scientists and government officials that vaccination and travel restrictions are not going to stop the spread and the evolution of corona virus mutations.  This idea of vaccinating the entire world is fantastical thinking.  Already the recommendation, a booster on top of two ""jabs"" and possibly a 4rth if the vaccine needs to be tweaked for controlling the omicron variant.  How may people in the world 7 billion plus, 21 billion ""jabs"", possibly 28 billion.  The vaccines as first  touted don't stop the virus, just lessen it's effects so variants can arise in either the vaccinated or unvaccinated populations.  The scientists say it only takes one person, so out of the 7 billion plus people in this world, every last individual needs to be accounted for in order to stop the spread.  Get real."
2021-12-06 11:44,"Of course it has spread across Europe. If you are reading this, it will be everywhere shortly. Get bolstered, mask up outside the home, and hope that omicron turns out to be the easily transmissible but low fatality virus some are suggesting. But only sequencing, testing, and tracing will tell"
2021-12-06 12:00,It feels to me that the most virulent variant is the spike in complacency. The price of a misguided desire for normalcy has been to accept tens of thousands of additional and preventablel deaths as the price for doing business with Covid.
2021-12-06 12:59,"There is a real sense of dread in Europe. Many nations have high vaccination rates (from Portugal at 88.5% of the total population to the Netherlands at 76.2% or Belgium at 76.7% (source: ECDC)) yet cases are spiraling out of control and healthcare systems are struggling to cope. 

In the Netherlands, hospitals are on the verge of ""Code Black"" when physicians will have to actively choose who to treat. This comes on top of an already stressed situation where cancer and heart disease patients saw their (often crucial) surgeries postponed because of a lack of ICU beds. 

The vaccines were supposed to have put a stop to this. At least the worst parts of this pandemic should have been mitigated, but this winter may very well be even worse than the last one. How could this happen?

I sense a shift in mindsets of the people around me. A kind of fatalism. It appears as though we are entering a world with a permanently lower life expectancy as this virus keeps mutating and becomes both endemic and seasonal. Even mRNA vaccines will not save us. This will never end."
2021-12-06 12:24,Don’t rely on a prior Covid infection to provide immunity against omicron. It will rip through the unvaccinated. Vaccine protection in the case of omicron far exceeds immunity from prior infection.
2021-12-06 13:37,"I’ve not seen a report of a single person dying from Omicron. You’d think that they would be very much on the lookout for this, and if anyone did die from it they could know very easily from which strain, and it would be reported widely.  And if it is as transmissible as they are saying, then there should be hundreds of thousands of cases by now. Therefore, I suspect that this is going to turn out to be a mild variant that is highly transmissible, including among the vaccinated. If this is the case, it probably would be a good thing.  There may be a benefit to have everyone catch omicron to increase their immunity to COVID more generally.  Get vaccinated first, though."
2021-12-06 11:39,"No one has died from this variant, apparently. The number of cases does not matter if it isn't causing serious illness or death among vaccinated people."
2021-12-06 13:38,"Omicron has been here longer than we realize. Now that it’s been “discovered,” it appears that it may be more transmissible than Delta but less virulent. Has there been an uptick of hospitalizations? Not that I’ve read. 
The coverage of Omicron spreading across the globe has been at near hysterical levels, while the sobering fact that those infected, if reported at all, are doing just fine with mild cold-like symptoms. 
Positive tests of asymptotic people have to stop being labeled as cases. If this thing were as dangerous as the reporting wants it to be, we’d know already."
2021-12-06 13:53,"I am in Portugal at the moment. To come here I had to be both vaccinated and have a negative test within 24 hours of departure. Our friend here in Portugal told us more than 90 percent of the population is vaccinated and parents are eagerly awaiting permission to vaccinate children under12 because they are believed to be responsible for a lot of the spread right now. The Portuguese require proof of vaccine to enter restaurants etc., People are incredibly disciplined about putting on their masks even outside, even though it's not mandatory, when they approach a crowded space. Our friend told us no one complains because it's the right thing to do. She had to quarantine last year after contact tracing led to the discovery that she had been
exposed at a lunch date. Her work place was informed, her pay of course covered, and the authorities made sure she had food and supplies for the duration of her quarantine. If only we could all be like Portugal. No wonder they have it under control, are not seeing a rising death rate despite a number of breakthrough cases. (Boosters are underway, organized by their public health system to make sure no one is left out). The Portuguese are out and about enjoying their lives, the kids are in school. Of course Omicron looms, but my friend is not concerned because peop will do what needs to be done to combat it. Couldn't we all be like Portugal?"
2021-12-06 13:57,"Many commenters are minimizing the effects of omicron, indicating it is causing less severe illness, observing fewer hospitalizations from the variant, and noting there are no reported deaths specifically attributed to it.  The variant was first discovered in late November. Maybe we should be less willing to minimize the effects until more is known. Maybe it is more realistic to take stock in late December, and again in late January, to get a truer picture of the severity or lack thereof for this variant.  A two week history for any covid variant seems to me to be too limited to draw any conclusions. In the meantime, assuming the worst and doing one's best to mitigate against those consequences just seems sensible to me."
2021-12-06 14:07,"Without the implementation of the following  we will be dealing with the coronavirus and its many variants for years. 
We will  need to give up on the idea of individual freedom been  a sacred cow , for the betterment of the common good. None of these are hard or new but they are necessary .
1. A vaccine mandate for all, we are doing this already in our public schools without reasonable people blinking . It is time for all Adults to now step up . 
2. Wearing Masks once again indoors, this needs to be a federal mandate.
3. The issuing of vaccine  passports, their introduction in France and Italy have put both countries on the lower end of the charts in spread of the virus in Europe. 
These simple steps are a start and are nothing that is going to cost an arm and a leg. They may come at some political cost to the Biden Administration, but I question how many of those who  will push back are voting for Democrats to begin with."
2021-12-06 13:44,"As it so far appears to evade immunity from vaccination or prior infection, appears not to cause severe disease, and is much more transmissible, I’m lost why the goal would be to avoid being infected by it. 

This is probably the first step to endemic. 

The irony is, with or without vaccines, we’d probably have ended up in the same place"
2021-12-06 12:05,"Probably the usual rule in “young evolutionary interactions” will play out.  More transmissible but less deadly variants of COVID will eventually win out. 

We will not be eradicating this virus.  We and it (and whatever other organisms it can infect, like say the ubiquitous white tailed deer) we co-evolve into a new arrangement together."
2021-12-06 12:42,"The jury seems to be largely out regarding the severity of the new variant. Will it spread widely? The past week seems to suggest, yes. Will it further thin the herd of the unvaccinated as Delta seems to be doing? Uncertain. Will it cause breakthroughs among the vaccinated? Uncertain. Will it force the world to more quickly establish a new Covid normal? It appears it might. Talk about a developing story!"
2021-12-06 11:46,More unfounded hysteria. Cases are irrelevant. How many are dying or being hospitalized for serious issues? Why is that not the measure?
2021-12-06 12:28,"While I fully support monitoring and research into this latest variant, the breathless reporting of it is annoying. So far, cases that have been reported by health officials seem to be very mild, which then makes me ask, so what?

My family is fully vaccinated, we had booster shots as soon as we could, had flu shots, and we take normal precautions like washing our hands frequently and staying home when we don't feel 100%. That's all I'm going to do from now on, I'm done.

The only thing that puts me ""on edge"" is the media focus on coming up with bad news and hyping any new story over and over and over again."
2021-12-06 14:16,"I live in NYC but am currently in Florida for a 3 day visit to attend to family business.  In Florida, NO ONE  is wearing masks.  Not the patrons or waitstaff at indoor restaurants, not in the hotel where I’m staying, not in shops, not in the private restaurant of a golf club where I had lunch.  Not one mask anywhere. And not once was I asked for proof of vac status.  They supposedly have a low rate of infection in Florida but I wonder how much of that is due to not reporting the numbers?  They do have the advantage of good weather now so many activities are outdoors.  Remains to be seen what happens when the temperatures drop.  Still, it feels like I’m
In another world compared to NYC where everyone is so careful."
2021-12-06 13:54,The infection rate South Africa is 17 per hundred thousand.  About 25% of the infection rate is many European countries. Shouldn't we be seeing a much higher infection rate in South Africa given the presence Omicron.
2021-12-06 13:37,"I plan on waiting until the scientific verdict is in before I worry about this variant. I don't expect the wait will be very long.

Meanwhile, cases of the Delta variant continue trending up in a good deal of the nation."
2021-12-06 12:27,"How can anything be back to normal? We are still in the middle of a pandemic. Any time we let our guard down, the virus wins."
2021-12-06 12:35,"Civil disobedience will destroy governments around the globe.  

People are getting fed up with Government Medical Complex."
2021-12-06 14:22,"The COVID infection pattern manifests itself as waves. Imagine a particular area, say the United States, as a flat baking dish filled with an inch or so of water. If we rock the dish, we initiate a wave and the water sloshes back and forth.

Successive waves of COVID infection wash across the country. Right now, that wave is a line from the states in the Northeast, running laterally across the country to the southwest. It is slowly moving to the southeast. States like Michigan have experienced the worst of the current wave, but New York, NJ etal. are in for a rough few weeks. States in the southeast and south like North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Texas are just beginning to see cases rise again. In two or three weeks they will be in panic mode once again.

Once the current wave peaks in the southeast, it will reverse course and the process will repeat in the opposite direction.

This will continue until we get sufficient numbers vaccinated."
2021-12-06 14:23,"Based on the COG data, the speed with which omicron is increasing as a % of total cases in the UK is phenomenal, unbelievable. 

The same will happen in the US, it is not possible to avoid, even though our rise will be a bit delayed compared to the UK and EU. There is no evidence that omicron is significantly milder, that is wishful thinking based on misleading reports in the press.

Behavior is the biggest variable determining the spread of covid, full stop. Vaccines have been successful in reducing hospitalizations, but have had little effect on transmission. Just compare this years summer surge with last years, and our current surge. Changes in behavior cause the rise and fall of infection rates.

The current vaccines are highly likely to be LESS effective against omicron. As we ignore the spread, waiting for more data, omicron is spreading rapidly, making it more difficult to contain with each passing day and week. We don't have that much time. 

If we wait, as we have in the past, until we see vertical rises in cases to take meaningful measures, it will be far far too late. Omicron can MORE than double twice a week. 

If we wait to take meaningful measures, we will have to go back into lockdown to save the hospital system. Schools will go back online, it will be a disaster.

Our goal should be to take serious measures NOW, until the omicron booster comes out, or we will squander the most important time we have to modulate the spread of omicron."

2021-12-06 13:08,"The travel restriction are definitely ""a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted"".  They are political show, not effective for fighting the spreed of Omicron.  Mandatory N95 masks in all public indoor settings and mandatory proof of vaccine for workers who expose others to their (potentially murderous) exhaled aerosols - would take care of even the Omicron variant.  Unfortunately the US is weak and whiny so we will do it the long and hard way losing 1000+ people a day until finally everybody either get it or have died."
2021-12-06 13:55,"COVID isn’t over, either in the US or especially worldwide.
With vaccines for children, and boosters for the elderly and everyone else, there is a chance of achieving herd immunity in the US this winter.

President Biden should also work with our allies and with the World Health Organization to ensure a worldwide program to help vaccinate poor people around the world.  Otherwise, mutated versions of COVID will just return again next year."
2021-12-06 14:46,"There is only few things we can do in Europe currently: vaccination, wearing masks and avoid too many contacts. Some countries did better like Spain, Italy or Portugal during the last weeks, some not so good like Germany, Suisse, Belgium, Eastern part of Europe, Russia etc..  
Due to climbs of Delta variant but mostly in case Omicron variant will be prooved to get dangerous due ease of transmission or high death rate most people overhere prepare now - the last days we had the highest vaccination rates for a long time. People in the US should also think about better preparation, you have the vaccines available and the time still. But time can quickly melt away."
2021-12-06 14:46,"At this rate IMO we'll still be dealing with this beyond 2022.  Why? Politicization of a public health crisis by deliberate disinformation, misinformation spread around the globe instantly by social media, hoarding of vaccine by wealthy countries which leads to large swaths of the third world unprotected.... get used to this folks.  It can't be wished away."
2021-12-06 12:54,"I firmly believe that the United States should immediately state the obvious, directly in a press briefing from the White House, such being that over two years since Covid-19 began, the infection and reinfection rates are climbing, and given the rate of climb, exacerbated by the Omicron variant, worldwide we will see dramatic increases in daily infections, followed by dramatic increases in death rates.

The probability that vaccinations, and exposure, may be a way to slow down this process is better than even; mask wearing, social distancing, restricted travel, and numerous other previously imposed conditions will be implemented, in the coming days.

Further, the release should ask all Americans to come together, setting aside differences, to do what Americans are uniquely capable of, which is unite in a battle against this common enemy.

The time for wasting valuable time. in useless recriminations and this endless blame game is over; get on board and simply get to work for the common good."
2021-12-06 12:16,"What part of dark winter predicted by Biden do people NOT understand? Was it only if Biden was not in his dream house, the white house celebrating Christmas.

By now not just Europe but the world should realize that the worst that can happen with the spike in Omicron variant is experience MILD Symptoms almost similar to many who had the FDA approved subunit vaccines. There have been no deaths reported from vaccines or the Omicron variants so far. I would very much like to be updated on the status of the progression of infection due to Omicron variant. The world is better prepared with common sense safety precautions. There is no need for panic and hysteria.

Travel ban on Southern African countries is a significant concern. The Biden-Harris admin should lift the crippling travel restrictions on these countries imposed a few days ago despite being made aware that such draconian and discriminatory bans and restrictions will hurt these countries economically and emotionally and hamper their abilities to get past not just the COVID pandemic but also the HIV pandemic. 

Every country has a duty to keep its own population safe first and we get it, but hasty knee jerk haphazard response that will severely hurt other countries is NOT in order. Every country should closely monitor entry of visitors, refugees, asylum seekers and migrants for infections by testing, temperature checks and  at all entry points. Economies heavily dependent on tourism should go the extra mile with vaccines."
2021-12-06 12:04,Hasn't one of the SE Asian countries barred hospitalization for the unvaccinated?
2021-12-06 13:49,"Go to your Christmas parties, but realize that YOU are helping fuel the pandemic. 

My husband is one of many elderly people at risk.  He’s vaccinated and boosted.  When he has a major asthma attack or goes into heart failure, he’ll have to go to the hospital.  Will there be room for him in a packed ICU?  Will exhausted doctors prioritize his life when the hospital is at capacity?

But you don’t care about others, do you?  

Eventually there will be a variant that outruns the vaccines entirely.  You better hope that it isn’t a worldkiller."
2021-12-06 13:22,"We do not know much about Omicron but we know that this is not the last variant. We do not know how lethal will be the next variant. Maximum possible restrictions have to be imposed in every country. Anti Vaxx and anti restriction peoples are blind and suicidal. Their number is not big but they are in the headlines in the news. If the rich countries do not help the poor countries with vaccines, our sufferings will continue. We may loose a big chunk of world population. The governments of all the countries and the scientists of the world should get together and find out the best solution. It is the WWIII. This is the war between human race against the virus. The super rich billionaires should contribute as much as possible in this war fund. We do not know who is the next victim."
2021-12-06 14:50,"Where is the highlighted, bold type face...explaining that the Omicron is not an African continent variation...but they just discovered it first, due to the widespread testing and infectious disease infrastructure in place in dozens of countries.  

Sick of people referring to it as an African variant."
2021-12-06 14:52,"Am I the only person wondering if we’re just going to have this pandemic forever? If it turns out this variant evades vaccines, will we all need to get new vaccines? Can a rollout of vaccines for a particular variant ever happen fast enough to achieve global herd immunity before the next variant takes off? 

I hate to be negative and even apocalyptic but with 7 billion potential hosts/people who need to be vaccinated, I am starting to wonder if things will just never, ever be the same."
2021-12-06 13:32,"News outlets combined with governments as frequently happens, are making matters worse than they truly are.

BTW, what ever happened to ""herd immunity""?  Between the vaccinated and those who have had covid and have natural immunity, the developed world should be at or past the her immunity level.  This was touted as the end-al and be-all target.

What keep the average citizen on the edge of their seat waiting for the next news notification on their phone ... even the smallest covid utterance from:

- A doctor interview

- A nurse interview

- A politician

- A CDC or NIH person

- Etc.

So, now we have been fully programmed so that a significant portion of our daily emotional ups and downs are linked to even the most minior retreaded covid news quip.  

Who benefits from all of this?  News outlets and politicians.  As it was once stated ... ""never let a crisis go to waste""."
2021-12-06 12:12,"I was in London this past week. I was in some very crowded shopping areas, restaurants and museums; Not to mention the tube. Mask mandates? Pffft. No one is consistent about anything.  It’s like there is no pandemic.

I’m vaxed. I masked up the best I could. I was tested 3 times throughout the week and was able to return to the states with a negative result.  I think that’s the best you can do. From my perspective, it’s the luck of the draw out there."
2021-12-06 14:55,"Airlines need to require vaccines. It is not the only solution but it's likely more effective than travel restrictions. Omicron was likely traveling around for a while prior to South African scientists finding it.

2021-12-06 14:14,"“I feel like if everyone had just followed the guidelines, we wouldn’t be in this situation…”

That’s why we should’ve mandated masks and later vaccination when it become available. But our politicians are in the pockets of the capitalist billionaires, so they prioritized travel, cruise ships, planes and carrying on as if a deadly pandemic was not sweeping across the world. 

About half of the human race has demonstrated that they are disordered in their thinking and not operating in this world with honorable intentions or as responsible adults and, therefore, must be treated as children."

This will not be the last variant; it is clear that we are not going to completely eradicate Civid anytime soon. We have to manage it. Over reactions form power hungry politicians is not helpful. We have to go on with our lives. When the story of Covid is in the history books, we will most likely find that travel bans and lockdowns were a waste of time."

Hospitals and their staff will be subjected to overload even with current attempts of reducing infections.  All politics and sensibilities to freedoms aside, what could be simpler to understand that that?"
2021-12-06 15:27,"With so many cases of omicron now confirmed, why hasn’t there been a single report about the numbers of hospitalizations and how often break-through cases are occurring? These are obvious data to report on, why haven’t we been getting this info?"
2021-12-06 15:37,"where are ""lockdowns are looming"" besides the ones already in place? please advice."
2021-12-06 15:48,"While my household is boostered, we still decided not to host a planned holiday party due to Omicron, and canceled plans to go to a holiday play. Instead we will do smaller gatherings, inviting one family at a time to our home.

I am over it - it’s so frustrating. But now that friends are vaccinated/boostered at least it’s better than last winter when all Friend activities were outdoors and masked. There is progress, and I will try to remember that even as I fight my frustration around canceled plans, lack of travel, etc."
2021-12-06 15:54,"One must be very careful taking seriously early reports of Omicron’s decreased severity. What could be happening is that we have a Covid 19 variant that is spreading as rapidly as the common cold. As such, children and young people may be more susceptible- and these groups have in the past had less severe cases of Covid 19 and less morbidity. So the virus’ rapid spread may be “masking” its impact on more typically vulnerable groups.

And, even if the strain results in less severe illness- I know of no reason that other strains may not arise that have Omicron’s rapid spreading and the same or greater severity than the Delta strain.

From a more distant perspective, it is as interesting as it is tragic to watch the human race cringe on subtle alternations of a virus only about 10 nanometers (10 billionths of a meter) in size. Indeed the weak can humble the mighty- when the weak hold the key to the genetic machinery and can invade a body cell by cell. There is nothing new here- but it shows the dangers of messing with the building blocks of life- and viruses- like the mythical zombies- considered neither alive or dead- are unliving proof."
2021-12-06 15:52,"Fauci was saying on CNN that this virus is not that strong. (something to that effect) The R's are waiting for overreaction by the Biden admin and did not get it.  From the news I have read, this instance of the virus is adapting to be more transmissible and less lethal.  I am relaxed now about it, only worried about people who may have weaker immune systems."
2021-12-06 16:00,"""Our message is this: Enjoy Christmas this year,” he said. “The vaccine rollout means we’re in a position to do so

For once, something intelligent being uttered. In Spring there will be another variant Next summer the same. Each year the flu vaccine is reworked to account for the changes in the virus which are expected.

Life is not lived without risk., Managing that risk is the end game for those of us fortunate enough to be vaccinated, boostered and sensible. I cannot speak for those who make poor choices and realize too late what the harm they've self inflicted-IF they ever realize it, by surviving the self inflicted illness.

 But for now, at our age, my wife and I , both triple vaccinated will take the risk and travel. ""Next year"", and living in constant fear is no option for us."
2021-12-06 16:31,"When the Corona virus first appeared in early 2020 people were dropping dead in their kitchen.  People with Omicron are getting the sniffles, and then testing positive.  I'm hoping Omicron is the solution to the problem--  nature's way of immunizing the unvaccinated.  Let's keep looking at hospitalization rates, not new cases from positive tests of people with 'mild' symptoms."
2021-12-06 16:36,"The degree of transmissibility is only one factor. It is worth remembering that after 2 years the Spanish flu epidemic ""went away"" when the virus mutated to a less lethal form that is still with us as one of the extant seasonal flu varieties.
I have seen one report from S Africa that it seems the omicron virus is not causing severe illness to the extent that delta has. Now, it may yet be too early to tell - maybe omicron is just more gradual, having a longer incubation period.  But maybe it will actually cause many fewer hospitalizations and deaths per capita, and we should WANT it to supplant delta as the dominant strain.
Let us keep hope alive, and not panic."
2021-12-06 14:37,"Who are the many who had hoped for a return to normal in the midst of a pandemic? It seems our societies are too spoiled, to undisciplined to handle this responsibly, like adults. It is beginning to dawn on me that the virus could actually prevail by an on-going series of waves and variants. A kind of asymmetric warfare where we, with all the advanced tools, get killed off by a virus that takes advantage of our willing failure to use them properly"
2021-12-06 16:19,"The US just has to refuse admission to hospitals to those unvaccinated, the vax rate will be 100% in no time."
2021-12-06 15:29,"COVID is not just the flu nor is it the Black Death or Ebola. If we are going to survive emotionally and economically, we need to find a rational path between being dismissive and alarmist every time a new variant is discovered."
2021-12-06 15:56,"More lockdowns, in Europe or anywhere, are not the answer. We will not eliminate Covid anytime soon, but through vaccinations we can greatly reduce serious illness and death from it while allowing people to get back to normal life.

Omicron will not be the last variant, and we can't shut down society for years on end in an ultimately futile effort to eliminate a single disease.

Get vaccinated and get on with your life."
2021-12-06 16:38,"COVID-19 aka novel coronavirus-19 aka SARS-2 aka COV-SARS-2 is neither benign nor malign in it's RNA genomic evolutionary fit quest to be fruitful and multiply.

COVID-19 is merely acting according to it's nature.

And so are African primate apes aka the one and only DNA genetic evolutionary fit human race species that began 300,000+ years ago acting according to their nature.

Currently COVID-19 knows far more about how to infect people than we know how to deter, detect and defeat it.

Every COVID-19 infection anywhere in any person is an opportunity to evolve by mutation to evade our bodies natural immune defenses along with those barriers augmented by vaccines and therapeutics.

COVID-19' s clever covert cunning strategy to be asymptomatic for days and with a lethality of 2-3 % primarily among seniors, the immunocompromised, the uninfected and unvaccinated means that it will be a long time before it becomes a regional epidemic and that it is most  likely destined to be an human endemic 

Moreover COVID-19 is far more lethal than the common colds arising from coronaviruses and rhinoviruses. COVID-19 is also much deadlier than influenza.

 While the common cold and influenza are generally symptomatic upper respiratory tract infections. But COVID-19's most serious infections are lower respiratory tract that can lead to pneumonia and serious breathing  oxygenation problems."
2021-12-06 11:31,Why are there no omicron cases being reported from Texas and Florida? Are they suppressing testing and data release? Hard to believe that states that have legislated against protective measures have been spared from this latest covid variant.
2021-12-06 14:26,"It defies credibility that people continue to travel to Omicron hotspots, then expect us to just catch the virus from them when they return. 

 I have no patients with people who:
1) don't get vaccinated; 
2) travel to Omicron hotspots;
3) return to the USA; 
4) don't wear masks in pubic
5) chide us for thinking we are being extremists; and then
6) spread Omicron to us.

I also don't care that preliminary results show Omicron not to be as virulent for the fully vaccinated and b'oosted.  We need to crack down on these people, not coddle them into getting vaccinated.

The health of the US population can't be preserved with anti-vaxxers spreading new viruses to us.  Ptooey on them!"
2021-12-06 11:50,More fear mongering. Who has died of omicron variant?  How many?  We heard the same about Delta and all the previous. Instead of reporting 'what if's' and interviewing alarmists stick with numbers and facts. We know our political nonsense here in the US will not protect us. Individual states have tried and succeeded in banning mask mandates which have done almost as much good as rushed vaccines. The more a virus mutates the weaker they become. Go interview South African scientists who have studied the ominous omicron. I am far more interested in their info than our CDC or NIH.
2021-12-06 14:31,"There is no reason a new variant needs to be more deadly; actually, natural selection favors a milder, but more catchy version of the virus.  And maybe, this “attenuated” virus both outcompetes and also results in immunity to more deadly versions of the virus analogous to the way Cow Pox was used to immunize against the more deadly Smallpox by Edward Jenner in 1796.  Maybe this is the way pandemics end.  Maybe this explains the mystery of how “Spanish Flu” disappeared.  Maybe we should be opening our borders and welcoming Omicron or a subsequent variant as natures way of ending the pandemic."
2021-12-06 16:33,"This year I lost two cousins to COVID-19 before they were vaccinated. Fast forward to the present, my extended family is fully vaccinated. One member got infected with Omicron. Symptoms are mild and he is recovering. The take home message for everyone: vaccination, basic hygiene, masking and social distancing are effective in combating this,  whether you live in Cape Town, Mumbai or Melbourne. We owe it to ourselves otherwise new variants will pop up amongst the unvaccinated and things will not go back to normal whatever that is."
2021-12-06 11:51,"I believe the Covid-19 virus will mutate itself into obscurity by November 2022 just like every other Pandemic in the last 500 years has done… without paying much attention to what little control we have over viral diseases. The ignorance of the medical community has been appalling. Hey… wake up! We control very little within ourselves, and less externally. Where an N-95 mask and avoid risky situations."
2021-12-06 16:10,"A gigantic ""so what"" about this story. Reporters are writing breathlessly about Omicron but I have yet to hear about a single person dying from it. Calm down. Take a breath. Life goes on. We're going to have variants going forward. The vaccines work. Stop manufacturing fear."
2021-12-06 16:57,"Given that there SEEMS to be little cross-immunity between the wild form (and its prior variants, including delta) and the new omicron, I would imagine the reverse is also true.  As a consequence, I imagine the more infectious omicron won't displace delta.  Rather, it will flourish alongside it.  We will have dueling pandemics.  Omicron will perhaps be the more ubiquitous and less serious of the two, but I'm sure it will kill too.  And this winter's delta surge will continue as though omicron never existed."
2021-12-06 16:59,"I wish they would tell us how many of those infected were vaccinated. As of the American unvaccinated, we need insurance companies to step in and refuse to pay for Covid treatment for them."
2021-12-06 17:05,"Unless all nations are to close their borders, wealthier nations need to make the vaccine available to all, because it's in *their* interest.
But the more intractable issue remains the refusal of too many to be vaccinated - when only 60% are vaccinated in the US, we can hardly point the finger elsewhere."
2021-12-06 17:09,"This is actually getting hilarious. Clearly lockdowns don't work, and, considering that you can't travel internationally without being vaccinated, it didn't get to Europe (or the US, for that matter) via a largely unvaccinated population. While vaccinated  with a booster, I'm no longer concerned, but another lockdown ... they really think that will do anything? I'm reminded from the scene from Spaceballs, where Mel Brooks tells Rick Morani's character ""Do something"", Moranis tells Col. Sandurz ""Do something"" and the Col. goes on the loud speaker to the entire ship and says ""Do something."""
2021-12-06 17:21,"I was in Ireland a few weeks ago. You can’t eat or drink inside without presenting proof of vaccination and mask usage is still widespread (indoors and out).

To return home I had to get a negative Covid test in addition to my proof of vaccination and show it to no less than four people before I got on the plane.

If variants are still spreading even with all these controls in place, I’m skeptical lockdowns will do much at this point other than delay the inevitable."

That to go on with your life you have to act like we're not still living through a pandemic that is sickening  and killing heaps of people every day? I'm going on with my life as best as I can, as are all of my vaccinated friends and loved ones. That life looks different right now (big surprise!). So please stop telling us to ""Get on with our lives."""

Most of the time, I only saw employees in stores wearing mask.  I just don't get it.  I fear the fourth wave is going to hammer my home country and justifiably so.  I lean to the right but at a certain point we should be like Italy if you are not vaccinated you do not participate in society, you are not allowed to go out, you are not allowed you work, you stay home."
2021-12-06 17:13,"This is deliberate single focus scaremongering.  The latest ""variant"" is one of a dime a dozen variants (note how many alphabet letters we have gone through in just a couple years), and is apparently very mild.  None of these ""variants"" need to have been considered any more dangerous than the usual flu, in fact they are far less so for children.  The issue is that basic tried-and-trusted (even FDA approved!) antiviral treatments are being denied, and people whose immune systems are not very healthy are being left untreated until they are emergency room fodder."

And we all sheepishly follow..."
2021-12-06 18:12,"Didn't this paper 2-3 weeks ago state we shouldn't be counting infections but hospitalizations and deaths? Has their been a spike in those due to Omicron? No. The data from SA is that most hospitalizations are ""incidental admissions"", meaning they came in for other issues only to test positive due to everyone admitted being tested. Meanwhile WHO has claimed no deaths have been related to Omicron. It's still early, but data hasnt been terrible."

2021-12-06 19:04,"With respect to people who say ""lockdowns don't work,"" I want to share some thoughts  centered on my perceiving the Covid virus as behaving something like a bacterial infection, even though they're not the same thing.  Bacteria are fought with antibiotics; its spread fought with personal isolation and a modicum of ""distancing"" in families.  Covid, the current King of viruses, has to be fought with a huge arsenal of non-medical weapons that includes not just social distancing, sometimes to the point of quarantine, but mask wearing, vaccination, and yes, lockdowns that shut us out of cultural, sports, non-essential shopping, in-person schooling, parties, and group or family celebrations.
   
With antibiotics, there's a cardinal rule: take the medicine every day as prescribed until you've used up the number of pills in the prescription.  Stopping earlier because you're feeling better is dangerous because the weaker bacteria are the first killed, leaving it easier for the strong, still surviving bacteria to flourish and more easily multiply, generating a more severe and dangerous case of the illness and the potential for antibiotic resistance to develop.  That behavior is something of an analogy for the way we've been dealing with Covid - prematurely relaxing the rules, dialing back the restrictions, opening even venues where crowding is inevitable  every time the case number reductions boost our optimism.

2021-12-06 19:52,It's unclear to me whether the new omicron variant is the issue here or that (as I suspect) the increased cases are mainly the same old delta variation. And: Is the spread due to a combination of insufficient vaccinations plus a failure to mask and socially distance? Great excitement and little information so far.
2021-12-06 19:52,"After the fact lockdowns do nothing more than make politicians feel better because, after all, they have to do something - don't they ? 
Meanwhile, untold wreckage is being inflicted upon those least able to sustain it - small business owners, lower income people-the already disadvantaged minorities.
The only people who  support lockdowns are those who are economically secure and/or still earning income during a lockdown, smug in their belief that they  are doing what is best for everyone else.
The virus has to be fought with the effective scientific tools now available including vaccines and rapidly developing therapeutic drugs which are dramatically reducing severe illness and death.
This is not 2020. Government officials must no longer resort to economic destruction. Endless cycles of severe disruption in peoples' lives cannot be sustained. Eventually society will crumble, and what have we gained?"
2021-12-06 19:51,Not one person has died from omicron. It has become the common cold. But if you listen to the media or the health care corporations...this is the one that will kill us all. When will the madness end? When it comes to mass manipulation...probably never
2021-12-06 20:00,"To be clear: the travel restrictions were never meant to completely eliminate spread of any new variants.  It is meant to slow down this transmission so more data can be collected and individual countries and their healthcare services to prepare.  So far, that has been effective and meeting that unstated goal."
2021-12-06 20:00,"Okay, I’ll stay alert for Omicron, but I have a limit. By November 2024, I don’t want to hear about how we need to lock  down because of overcrowding in hospitals or a shortage of ventilators. If this happens, I am going to judge the Democrats on how well they expanded our medical capacity. There has to be something in those trillion dollar bills.

My family just went through COVID. After the next election, I am not running away from a runny nose. The vulnerable population and unvaccinated need to make their peace with our new reality. I support any effort President Biden and Congress can make to ease the burdens on the vulnerable and reach out to the unvaccinated, but we need to establish time limits. Five years seems more than fair."
2021-12-06 20:33,"Actually, Europe is more restrictive with non EU countries.

Within the EU (including Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein) travel is ok/free with vaccines (or proof of recovery from Covid)."
2021-12-06 20:27,"It is long past time for restrictions, fear mongering, and scary covid misinformation to end.  (BTW, ever notice when this paper talks about covid misinformation it’s always about vaccine conspiracies and never the daily covid scary falsehoods, misrepresented data, scary claims long proven to be untrue, etc. that this paper publishes and repeats on a daily basis ad nausem? Just me?). Here are the simple facts once more. We all will catch covid no matter what restrictions, how many masks, how isolated, avoiding travel, not hugging kids, etc. we all do. It is a mathematical certainty and inevitable for every person on the planet. The very nature of inevitability makes restrictions completely ineffective and ridiculous. 

It also is a simple mathematical fact that if you are vaccinated and unless you have extenuating health conditions, you and everyone else at worse will feel like you have a little cold for a couple days. That’s it. For people who choose not to be vaccinated fine, they made their choice and those of us who are vaccinated have nothing to fear from them. And if you do have extenuating health issues then yes, you probably need to take precautions, but those precautions are your responsibility alone, not anyone else’s. 

Life is not fair nor is it without risk. If you did not know that before, you know it now. You never will feel safe in the water unless you jump in. Time to jump in if you have not already.  Your vaccine is a foolproof lifejacket."
2021-12-06 20:38,"From the last big peak of Covid (Dec 2020 to march 2021) there was 1 dead for 83 contaminations in the US

Right now, there's 1 dead for 89 contaminations, so there's a noticeable improvement when the virus is hitting the hardest, not to mention that le level of contamination and dead remain far lower than the previous year between those peaks.

So, YES, it's true, the worst is behind us, the virus failed to score better, the omicron variant is arriving quite late compared to the delta version, so he can replace him, but he can't kill more people."
2021-12-06 20:47,"It feels like trying to fight the inevitable.  All of the data seems to point to roughly a 1% case fatality rate that targets the very elderly, people over 60 who are not in good health, and people over 45 who are in very poor health.  Covid 19 is simply doing what nature has intended virus to do for millions of years - target the weakest in the population.  Overwhelming the health system only occurs if there is overtreatment.  It would make more sense to put triage protocols in place that allowed for optimal service intensity decisions,"
2021-12-06 20:54,Covid 19 is not commenting.  It’s got no opinion.  It just wants to survive.  So far it’s doing a bang up job.  Millions of humans dead but billions still alive.
2021-12-06 20:45,"My niece studied diligently for (I think) five years to get her R.N. It was was long-held aspiration. 

Her first year fully accredited?—Covid overran her SE state’s hospital. Several of her colleagues became infected and brought it home to their families. All last year and this, she had no social life, no dating, little time off. 

All the overtime shifts, all her dedication, all her knowledge and skills resulted in multiple people dying on her shift every day. She told my sister, “I just don’t know if I can keep doing this. I’m burning out.”

My point is that we can’t just hire nurses, doctors and aids. It takes years of training.

Regardless of Omicron, a thousand people in the USA die of Covid every day and others die because their injuries or heart attacks meet a staff overrun with Covid.

Please be kind to these hospitals workers, many of whom have died themselves to help others. They are not expendable nor replaceable. Mask up, get vaccinated, get your booster shot, avoid crowds and do your part."

2021-12-06 21:05,"Yes, we can ""diminish covid"" but the reality is this won’t end until we accept that it doesn’t, in fact, end. In an effort to encourage vaccination (clearly a good thing) the news media and many public health officials made the mistake of messaging that if you are vaccinated, you cannot get a covid infection. This was never the purpose of the vaccine, and the ongoing narrative of asymptomatic/mild ""breakthrough"" cases  from each variant will make it difficult to move forward with a clearly defined goal in  highly vaccinated areas  like Western Europe. The transition to endemic viral disease was always going to involve a difficult psychological step to acceptance. Many  are still in the ""zero covid"" denial stage. The public appetite for lockdowns and restrictions is rapidly waning, even in areas where the public has supported distancing, travel restrictions, masking, etc.   Policymakers in Europe (and in the U.S.) will need to recognize this going forward."

Take  test two days prior, hopefully negative, then queue for hour or two at LHR, thereafter in plane for eight hours in crowded setting, masked up and wearing fogged up glasses. On arrival  queue for test at Toronto, with many hundreds arriving from Europe at same time, perhaps for further two/three hours. Though twice jabbed and boostered, you never know with highly transmissive omnicron- so nail biting wait for up to three days, isolated in strange air bnb  before test result. If positive, all for nought: pay for extra few days of required isolation, and pay for further test before returning home after two weeks without having been with family.  Test again in London two days later, whilst spending 5000+  pounds for the privilege."
2021-12-06 21:51,"The unvaccinated are driving this wave of infections. With so much hesitancy and outright refusal, the virus will continue to mutate and we'll never get rid of it. The world's medical personnel are stressed, burned out and many are quitting or retiring. 

In 2020 one of the main reasons for lockdowns was to keep hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. Here we are just short of 2 years later and we're now in a 4th wave. If you don't want to get vaccinated for yourself or family, do it for our overburdened medical workers."
2021-12-06 21:49,"The rise in the incidence of COVID-19 since the beginning of 2020, and its various variants which have proved to be increasingly more contagious are all thanks to China. China has offered its gift to the world which keeps on giving.

China is an economy which operates on the cheap, works with unenforced regulations and is the cesspool of viruses which spread through the world."

Now the States want us to do this within 24 hrs. I don’t know how I could have done it in a 24 hr window.  1st time back to visit 98 yr old mom in 2 years. A bit of a hype but it was worth it as we knew the cases were going to rise with the holidays coming."
2021-12-06 22:22,"The tougher restrictions need to be applied in the U.S.  Not just proof of vaccination and a current negative test, but airplane, train, and bus travelers in the U.S. need to show these proofs before boarding on domestic flights/travel.  Mask mandates in all inside venues, including bars and restaurants in high COVID zones (over 7 new cases/ 100,000*).

In high vaccination areas, we can assume it is unvaccinated visitors and return travelers, and those who refuse to wear a mask who are spreading the virus.

A plus: widespread mask wearing may mitigate flu season.

*  A high COVID zone is one in which the case numbers make contact tracing difficult.  Contact tracing is made easier with cell phone tracking, which would be voluntary in the U.S. for privacy reasons.

Repeat:  Mask mandates.  If government won't do it, merchant and building owners should require it."
2021-12-06 22:27,"I was shocked on a trip to Europe a few weeks ago, specifically Switzerland, where I encountered absurd leveled of vaccine resistance (a third of the population is unvaccinated). By contrast, in Rio where I am writing from, an unseasonable flu has been a much bigger issue than Covid in recent weeks (the last COVID patient was released from public hospital a couple of weeks ago). Could this have to do with the fact that 95% of the population over 12 is fully vaccinated, and the same percentage of people over 60 have received a booster shot?"
2021-12-06 22:33,The new variants have had an increasingly exponential ability to spread. Omicron being just the latest.

After getting tested 3 days before my flight and approved by air line to be travel ready, I received a text the day before my flight on Monday that the rules had changed and I needed a test 1 day before my departure. So I got tested again, got travel ready again and got on the flight today. No big deal and I felt a little safer!!!!"
2021-12-07 0:34,"The article says Dr. Hotez would be concerned, ""if at the end of the week Omicron represented even 10% of the Delta cases"".

In the UK it looks like Omicron doubles it's share in sequencing every 3 days, now at 1,4% - to double this to over 10% takes 9 days. Continue doubling to get to 90% takes 18. Just 9 days between 10% and 90%

Wether it doubles every three days or not - point is, exponential growth looks tiny at first and gets very very big very quickly - I'd be concerned if it even doubled to 3% in the next week."
2021-12-07 1:24,I wonder why we’ve not done any work to bolster are massively outmatched healthcare system? Is there any plan to deal with future case surges? Why doesn’t every home in the country have at home tests? Maybe send everyone a mask while we’re at it.
2021-12-07 2:13,"From what I understand, for the vaccinated covid causes very mild illness.

As the NYTimes highlighted last week, the death rate for those under 50 is now basically zero and risk of serious illness for older adults is now similar to the flu given treatment advances. 

I am genuinely confused as to why we are still focusing on cases rather than hospitalization/deaths. If we do that, life will never get back to normal. The response to omicron has me afraid that a reactionary fear mindset will dominate for the foreseeable future."
2021-12-07 2:32,"So far all but one of the Omicron positive cases I've heard of in the U.S. has been in a vaccinated person, but the experts are still saying ""We know the best thing you can do to protect yourself is to get vaccinated and boosted."" I'm also still waiting for the rollout of a national plan to improve the population's health and boost their immune systems, as well as information about what I should do at home if I suspect I've contracted Covid. Why have I never heard any information about this?"
2021-12-07 3:09,"It's best to be cautious until we know more about the Omicron variant.  I am hoping for the best on this one, but if we drop our guard the virus can deliver a sucker punch to us all.  

What if the worst symptoms appear after four weeks and not two?  What if there are mild short-term effects and serious long-term effects?  What if the limited data we have right now is skewed, as seems to be the case?  We just don't know, yet.  It is a small price IMO to pay in terms of being fully vaxxed, wearing masks and limiting travel.  

Three quarters of a million people and counting have died in the US and many more may die if we get this response wrong.  The lives of human beings are at stake here -- a bit more patience is surely something we can offer for our fellow human beings."
2021-12-07 5:01,"The EU keeps trying tired old formulas that have never worked. Border closures, restrictions haven't significantly slowed any variant or solved anything. 

And the tit for tat: ""You're a bad country. We restrict your entrance."" 

""No you're the bad country. We won't let you in."" 

And always the cases keep rising. Borders in Europe are totally porous and have to be.

Cases were rising in Europe before the emergence of Omicron."

2021-12-04 16:00,"This is a very informative article. I think it should be stressed that HIV patients who take their anti-aids medicine are not the problem in South Africa; this will help avoid discriminatory application of what's happening there to other places such as in the U.S,  where HIV is under control. While the article does not report on the Omicron impact on other groups, the statement that South Africa has not been ""decimated"" is notable."

2021-12-04 16:38,"This article guts me. Why not also focus on the countless other conditions that suppress immune systems and may provide a place for viral mutations? This is so stigmatizing to a population that is already carrying so much stigma. Now people living with HIV are responsible for the world’s Covid mutations? Should we also stigmatize folks taking medications to treat rheumatoid arthritis, or preparing for a bone marrow transplant with lymphoma? This article is such a disservice to people all around the world living with HIV."
2021-12-04 16:43,"South Africa is always striving to find African solutions for African problems. South Africa can some of the best doctors and field health workers. Earlier in this century, South Africa did establish platforms for cutting edge biotech research to support entrepreneurs. 

Thanks to the South African pathologist  Dr. Allison Glass from  Lancet Pathology lab in Pretoria, Capital of South Africa for discovery of Omicon which coincided with an increase in positive cases of Covid-19 in parts of South Africa. Dr. Angelique Coetzee for played a lead role in treating local patients and telling the world that the symptoms observed in Omicron patients that she treated were ""MILD"" With no severe illness from Omicron noted and no deaths reported so far, the travel ban imposed on Southern African countries by the Biden-Harris admin and many other western countries and Israel are no longer justified. 

A great democracy like South Africa struggling to recover economically and emotionally does not deserve to be marginalized or demonized. Southern African countries being the epicenter of the AIDS pandemic deserve compassion and donations of vaccines and antivirals against COVID. 

There is a global hunt for COVID variants. In Louisville, KY, USA a federal grant of over 8 million $s has been granted to search for COVID variants in waste water around Kentucky and preliminary reports are that variants are detected earlier than in clinics. The variant hunters should form a collaborative network."
2021-12-04 16:26,"Why is the press, including the NYT, not writing about the FIRST lab to identify the new variant, which is not in South Africa, but in Botswana? Recognition should be given to those that earned it, so please correct this. Moreover, the Botswana lab’s first cases identified were from European diplomats."

It might turn out that it's ability to breakthrough current vaccines is not an issue. In fact, it is possible that a massive outbreak of a less lethal mutation could create the global immunity we are hoping for."

Unless you like conspiracy fodder for insensitive, uncaring, selfish, idiotic internet trolls. Now the New York times did a better job at providing more information under their headline, but still I worry about the conclusions people, especially non-experts, will come to just by associating HIV and COVID and not reading further into these article. So if you have come to just read the comments, please stop and go read the article. If you have questions, talk to medical experts and don't assume your hypothesis is correct. I  want to applaud South Africa for their efforts and their honesty and I want other countries to learn from and be honest about learning South Africa's efforts. This is the type of intellectual honesty we need for science to provide humanity solutions to problems and higher standards of livings. Last but not least, let us not forget the difficult situation people with HIV were put into at the beginning of the pandemic (See the article for example). These people should be encouraged by professionals to continue with antiviral treatments, not criticized by a large mass of anonymous internet trolls. People who live with HIV are courageous."
2021-12-04 16:04,"The Covid crisis melding with the AIDS crisis holds a powerful mirror up to the Western world which may lack the compassion and humility to overcome the  greed which underlies our failure to share the resources needed to solve both problems. We know that races do not exist as biological realities. They reflect only the  differences in skin color some of our ancestors acquired by leaving Africa and migrating elsewhere rather than staying in Africa and continuing to look like our earliest ancestors. We developed wealth in the US on the backs of slaves whom descendants we continue to treat as a lower caste.  We continue to minoritize them to prevent us having to own the inhumanity reflected in slavery, Reconstruction, lynching, and unequal or absent protection under the law. The AIDS crisis was seen as God's punishment of gay men for being gay men in the twisted reasoning of many. In both cases now people are blamed for the virus killing or maiming them. There is a need to fight the Covid virus by getting rid of the patents on the vaccines and helping the all of the world get vaccines to fight the virus. There is still the need to end patents on our effective AIDS medications to help the world fight AIDS. Those being enriched by these patents have blood on their hands. Those failing to recognize Africans as our brothers and sister have blood on their souls. We can join our brothers and sisters by recognizing their humanity and fighting both viruses all out."
2021-12-04 17:22,"I think the whole approach of the last two years just failed. Now there are basically two viruses, from an immunity perspective, since getting one doesn't confer immunity to the other.
With the virus mutating like this, attempting to vaccinate people becomes a game of whack-a-mole with new versions popping up, in different locations, all the time.
Either we go on with our lives, as they were before, and suffer the deaths associated with that, or we change our lifestyles to the more isolated one we have been living on a long term basis."

Too bad that there are no comedians like him any more to illustrate the fundamental stupidity of chasing viruses.

It will never end."
2021-12-04 17:57,"This article is unnecessarily stigmatizing. Anyone with reduced immune function (e.g., people with HIV, transplant recipients, people who take biologic medications, etc.) can harbor COVID19.   This is not their fault.  Some people with HIV cannot tolerate antiretrovirals because of terrible side effects.  Please do not stigmatize these people further."
2021-12-04 18:11,"The science affirms that vaccination is a pro-life choice.  The antivaxers are willing to provide human hosts to mutations of the virus that are designed by nature to spread and harm others, especially the elderly and infirmed relatives and friends."

But, I cannot help but notice in all the comments that nothing is said at all about any responsibility the people or government of South Africa may have for whatever happens there.

This needs to be overcome. Right now, Fed Ex and others are the carriers for these products. They won't send their planes into S. Africa, because those planes have to sit there until they fill back up. In the meantime their crews take commercial flights to their next job. If there's no commercial flights, Fed Ex doesn't send them in to begin with.

The governments of the world could spend fortune after fortune attempting to eradicate all that variants of this disease and fail. It's already effectively two viruses, where having gotten one does not confer immunity to the other.
I think our real choices are either to just go through it, and resume our former lives, or to keep the restructured, more isolated, lifestyle associated with pandemic avoidance.
It seems to me highly unlikely that the world can be vaccinated quickly enough to avoid future variants."
2021-12-04 19:19,"If the US had a sane policy to combat COVID, it would feature getting COVID vaccines to South Africa as quickly as possible. It would also be smart to let South Africa lead in helping the rest of Africa use their strategy to combat both COVID and HIV.

This article also suggests that we could learn from South Africa's work to prevent HIV positive people from incubating new COVID variants--specifically, to ensure our own HIV positive population has access to the HIV suppression drugs and is also encouraged to take them.  

We are fighting a war against COVID. Much better it be fought elsewhere where possible. We are awash in vaccines today. Let's get them where they can do the most good. 

Our travel ban on South Africa has obviously failed. Time to consider leveraging South Africa's expertise and hard work (in some ways better than our own) and to ensure we do not do more long-term damage with our bans than we help."
2021-12-04 19:28,"The late Dr Jonathan Mann once said that when there's a global health crisis, Africa should be prioritised, and on the frontline when therapies become available.

Now and then, I peruse the United Nations Charter on Human Rights. Disease, hunger, war, displacement, poverty, women's rights... I could go on.

Less well appreciated is that the virus actively attacks the immune response itself in a way that limits the quality and duration of recovered patients’ antibody defenses against future infection, according to Naoki Kaneko et. al. in “Loss of Bcl-6-expressing T follicular helper cells and germinal centers in Covid-19,” Cell, Oct. 2020. Gaining first immunity from vaccination, before one gets infected, may be important here, because it allows one’s body to have germinal centers active for Covid ahead of time. See Turner et. al., “SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce persistent human germinal centre responses,” Nature.

New strains can appear anywhere, with or without co-infection by HIV. We need to start the WHO’s international pandemic treaty process to solve our vaccine and border closure problems. Accusations of hoarding are unhelpful when officials aren’t at liberty to prioritize exports over local use, or to leave travel open. The US donation of 275 million doses, though impressive, is no replacement for what a distributed, global vaccine production capability offers us."

I learned many years ago in evolutionary biology that as a virus infection moved through a population, the virus symptoms weakened and the host developed resistance.  The introduction of myxomatosis to Australia with a South American strain of Myxoma to combat the plague of European rabbits was given as evidence.  I would not use that scenario as an explanation for the apparent weak symptoms of the omicron variant.  If the dogma is correct, weaker symptoms will happen when the human fatality rate reaches 99.8%.  But thankfully this is a false dogma.  Researchers took so-called resistant Australian rabbits and infected them with the Californian strain of the Myxoma virus and all of the test rabbits died of myxomatosis.  There is more to come."

2021-12-05 12:51,Here is an article worth a careful read.
2021-12-05 10:15,"It is so very, very important to have people around the world - especially in wealthier countries - understand why it is necessary for the whole world to work to get everyone vaccinated against Covid. Yet, so many are short sighted believing that only their own nation or people matter or, even more narrowly, believing that if they have had Covid themselves there is no longer any issue to be concerned about. Then, too, we have those who continue to believe the nonsense that this is all a ""hoax"" or that it is hyped for some nefarious political purpose. There are none so blind as those who will not see."
2021-12-05 10:40,"live in South Africa and just came back from the doctor. I tested positive for Covid. 

I haven’t been feeling well for the last four days. At first I thought I was just dehydrated from playing golf in the unrelenting December heat.

I checked my temperature on entering the golf club, and the thermometer said
I was a cool dude of 36,2 degrees Celsius, which I think is about 97.16 degrees in the imperial system. 

I have not lost my sense of taste or smell. Maybe that’s what deceived me. I gobbled up a small, sweet banana variant which is known as “Umbhaba” in Zulu, and then washed it down with ultra-thick guava juice. The taste was heavenly as always. It was the swallowing that was hellish. It was as if I had tried to eat a fistful of thorns, which were now stuck in my throat. 

I came out of the last few waves unscathed, even though we lost over 27 family and friends in the first lockdown. What made it really hard was that we couldn’t attend any of the funerals and pay our last respects."
2021-11-30 18:13,"India would have been much better off had Modi not instigated the first two Waves. His insistence on allowing that Festival and his own Rally where he said ""I see nothing but people "" He only acted when the World saw the Crematoriums full all over the country.  Modi is India's Trump in terms of Ego, Narcissism and priorities. Wake up India and see Modi for what he is."
2021-11-30 18:13,Measuring happiness and prosperity only through car and washing machine sales is a flawed concept. Shop till you drop is foreign concept in Indian society. Indians don’t take on debt. They would rather live gadget poor. Capitalistic society has not yet come to India.
2021-11-30 19:55,"Washing machines in the US die in three-five years; these days the warranty on major appliances is only for a year.  All of this is supposed to help in economic growth.  India has no place to trash these items, people will only buy products that last a lifetime."
2021-11-30 20:06,"The core issue is structural and it started as soon as India was basically forced to implement globalization in 1991 but never ever reformed the basic democratic institutions (e.g. judiciary, civil service, police, public education and public health etc.)  to manage a more open economy and global competition. Corruption at almost every level increased while many issues,  which used to be considered as corruption, was made legal.
India did not have any $ billionaire till 1997 and now it has 2nd/3rd highest number of $billionaires in the world (after USA and China). Keep in mind that not a single billionaire ever invented any new technology or product unlike thier American colleagues. Keep in mind that  just ~$75,000/yr income can put any family among top 1%, more than half of its population face hunger/malnutrition, and its middle class population is shrinking as per a recent PEW survey."
2021-11-30 20:24,"Indian education promote only rote memorization and not much suitable for invention and innovation that can generate wealth. Even that's getting worse with rise of private schools, colleges, and universities- run mostly by criminals like Amity Univ owner Ashok Chauhan (who had at least 2 Red Corner notice by Interpol.) No wonder, education is now the main black money generating sector replacing the traditional contender, real estate. Success in such societies depend mainly on one's ability to utilize corruption and crime to become successful.

Discipline, productivity, and health of Indian workers are very poor that affect their global competitiveness. 

Such a society does not promote solution of problems (social, political, or economic) but learn to shift the blame on someone less powerful and play with emotion (by invoking nationalism, religion, caste etc.) At the same time, Indian democracy, with all its faults, does not offer the benefits that global investors get from autocratic regimes in China and Vietnam offer. It also does not offer the benefits of a more civilized democracies of other developing and developed countries."
2021-11-30 19:11,"India needs to boot out Modi. He has nothing to offer India besides hindutva,islamophobia and an empty stomach. Many foreign investors are completely turned off by a hindu fundamentalist india. Hinduism thrived under Nehru, Shastri, Indira Gandhi, and Manmohan Singh. Many tens of millions of poor people entered the middle class,and many millions of those who entered the middle class are now wealthy, because of Nehru's,Indira Gandhi's and Manmohan Singh's policies.
Modi has destroyed India in the space of a few years. The 200 million muslims in india are stuck in poverty since 1947 and have no hope. India cannot advance without all Indians,including Muslims, moving into the middle class,and becoming wealthy, so that they can buy homes,cars,scooters,and appliances. 
The west is facing a supply crunch because of it's overdependance on China.The US exported many millions of jobs to China in the last 40 years-thanks to Nixon and the republicans, who only want to enrich the 0.1 percent of the wealthiest American donors contributing to the GOP,at the expense of 99.9 percent. They have brainwashed half of America with their right wing nonsense-like Modi in India.
India is unable to cash in on the opportunity because it's people are cowering in fear. Masking, social distancing and existing vaccines can together beat any covid variant because in the end the virus is transmitted through the air. India is today being punished for abandoning liberalism,and believing Modi's endless lies."
2021-11-30 21:43,"I don't often read other countries news on NYT, but Honestly, I expected a better coverage than the classic ""western media"" trope of biased news for developing countries.

>“Around this time last year we sold 15 to 20 dishwashers,” .... “This time, we couldn’t even sell two units.”
I don't even know how this paragraph relates to anything about economy. Dishwashers are not a thing in most countries with domestic help.

>“We had to cut costs somewhere.”
Ending the article on this line just seems like ending on a bad tone, whereas the truth is that across the world, including US, there have been massive lay-offs and unemployment due to the pandemic.

The article does talk about ~3 economic markers which makes it hold water but most of the article is just quoting words of shop-keepers from one city of India. Imagine doing that for WashingtonDC and using them for drawing conclusions about the USA economic status."

It's like calculating class average only taking the A and some B students and leaving out the strugglers in order to show high performance.
The plight of the lower middle class and below has to be seen to be believed. This article talks about dishwashers, but for them basics like food, employment and increasingly a roof above their heads is becoming a luxury.
The trend of an increased middle class has completely reversed and more folks are being thrown below the poverty line.
The media and informed citizenry never talk about this because it is not fashionable to do so and they prefer to live in their bubble.

2021-12-01 8:33,"The GDP growth had been declining for 8 quarters from 8% to 4% even before the pandemic struck. This was a result of the disastrous withdrawal of 86% of currency from circulation (demonetization) in 2016 and then a poorly implemented Goods & Service tax in 2017. The stringent Covid lockdown declared at 4 hours notice by Mr Modi in 2020 kayoed the already tottering economy. 

The closure of thousands of small businesses in the informal sector and the loss of millions of jobs has pushed the middle class into poverty and the poor to destitution. To compound these errors, the government has shown an inexplicable reluctance to spend itself out of trouble. The latest figures released today show that government spending has been the lowest in the last 5 years! All this shows up in poor private consumption, which today is lower than in 2019-20.

The stock market represents a few hundred large companies in India, who have done very well at the expense of the devastated informal sector, which provides employment for 90% of India's workforce, and is hence soaring, creating an impression that the India economy is doing well. This is very far from the reality!"

2021-11-29 2:05,"I've done all I can do.  Masked, distanced, and triple-vaxxed.  

I'm weary.

I'm still hoping for the variant that's deadly enough to scare the anti-vaxxers to get vaccinated so we're closer to 100% in the USA.  And we need to provide more vaccine to the rest of the world.  

Why does the only nation that can beat this virus keep blowing it?"

2021-11-29 2:18,"Before we have a global freakout, note that the South African doctor that discovered the mutation also just said that this mutation leads to ""very mild"" symptoms lasting a few days at most. And if this provides some level of immunity against other more serious-illness causing variants, that would be more good news rather than bad news."
2021-11-29 2:22,"""Will the Vaccines Stop Omicron?  Scientists Are Racing to Find Out.""

What happens when we run out of Greek letters?  Will we start giving them names - like hurricanes?

This is death by a thousand cuts.

Get the vaccine, wear a mask, engage in social distancing and take all other precautions recommended by medical professionals.

Then get on with your life.  What else are we supposed to do?

So far, if you are fully vaccinated the probability is about 1-2% that you will get a breakthrough infection, 0.1% that you would get seriously ill from it and 0.01% that you would die from it.  Now those are odds we should be able to live with.

But there's just so long we can keep worrying before we simply go completely crazy.

And that's definitely not the way to go."
2021-11-29 2:24,"So, what? We get three more jabs for every notably more virulent and transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant the comes along?

By the way, like when bacteria are insufficiently treated with antibiotics and the result is the emergence of ""super-bacteria,"" viruses, when insufficiently attacked by vaccine-elicited endogenous immunological responses as antibodies, can also morph into ""super-viruses""... in both cases, mutational mechanisms being responsible!

So please, CDC and FDA, please be sure that all SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are ""up to the task"" before releasing them at the public!"
2021-11-29 2:28,"If I didn't know that mutations are a product of natural selection, my growing neurosis would say that Covid and Omicron is out to get us.  After all it seems that most of the mutations are in an area of the virus that seems to make our vaccines most vulnerable.  But that is the way of it.

Ah well, more masks just when we have taken a chance to not use them in many situations.  Perhaps more distancing and Zoom which makes that company rich, but makes us all strangers.  and most of all more uncertainty.  Covid has made itself a permanent guest and I would wish that it would find someone else to bug."
2021-11-29 2:34,"Thank you to all the hard working researchers, scientists, doctors and others in Africa who have brought this variant to the world’s attention."
2021-11-29 2:34,"At this point, the government risks crying wolf, though they may have already done just that. Now, we will just wait and see just how much of a failure public health messaging is."
2021-11-29 2:34,"Obviously if Dr Walensky overruled a decision made by two separate advisory committees against the widespread use of boosters, there is obviously some concern in continued vaccine uptake. Whether it's because of the unknown the effects on the body, we don't know, but to hide behind distribution reasons at this point is silly.

That being said, what if you did decide to go in taking her word for it in respect to safety, and get the third booster shot today. Then a month from now Omicron takes over and Pfizer races once again to come out with a new booster in 3 months. Should you go ahead and take the fourth shot? What about the studies of the safety of mixing the two vaccine versions so close together, should we blindly accept that on little more than ""Trust me it's fine""?

Why are we only focusing on vaccines as the answer? The past year has clearly shown that they are not the way out. Where is the focus on therapeutics that will allow people to forget covid and live their life? Getting covid, then taking a medication that keeps the symptoms to a minimum, instantly transforms covid into little more than a bad cold... while developing natural immunity in ""the herd"" and the vaccine debate can evaporate quicker than it started. The world can be whole again instead of divided."
2021-11-29 2:38,"Biden has been in office for ten months and waited until this month to announce an initiative to increase production of vaccine. That's ten months wasted. Did nothing. So we have nothing. 
Hopefully, omicron will prod his administration into accelerating the process. Normally it takes 2 years to put such a facility. That's with a normal day's construction of 8 hours. That's after a long planning and approval process. So the planning and approval can be expedited and done in parallel fashion, and the construction can be done by paying double time for 3 shifts, as well as extra expenses associated with that type of work. 
And they could double or triple the number factories they were planning. If it was going to take a year before omicron, they should do it in 6 months now. 
The money was already there, the cost is less than a billion per factory, even with a rush job. 
Why wasn't it done already? Ten months. Not as if we didn't know from the start that there wasn't enough production for the world.
Democrats in office, do something."
2021-11-29 2:49,"My prediction is the vaccines have less efficacy but still protect against severe outcomes.  The omicron variant will probably be more deadly to the unvaccinated than the delta variant.

With so many people unvaccinated the virus does not need to keep the host alive for very long to spread to someone else. The virus from the start wants to spread before people show symptoms and isolate. They virus has likely spread by the time someone is hospitalized after a cytokine storm. 

Does tighter binding to cells mean it takes a smaller viral load to infect someone? I get that changing shapes helps to evade antibodies. How long until those are reformulated? Back to convalescent blood plasma?"

2021-11-29 2:54,"In the medical world's deep knowledge of life and disease, a point is missed; Everyone is persisting in a wack-a-mole strategy to combat Covid-19. It is mutating by natural selection and a new strategy must take hold to race against those mutations. We have had vaccines for nearly a year but the virus is mutating faster, so besides playing against time, dilute that time by focusing on far higher rates of vaccine production. I'm sorry to write that we have to negotiate with vaccine makers to allow licensing of the technology throughout the world above their current profit streams.  This epidemic cannot be conquered by business. It must be conquered by moral medicine. We might have gotten to herd immunity months ago had we done this.

And pointing out an important point in your article;

“It’s clear that hybrid immunity, the kind that people get when they are both infected and vaccinated, is superior, and that is very, very likely to take care of this thing, too,” Dr. Nussenzweig said.""""

I'm just getting over ""Uncomfortable"" symptoms of Covid-19 and am off quarantine this week and I assure everyone, although I was triple vaccinated this past year, I have a few risk factors and easily got past Covid-19 because I was smart enough to seek out vaccines and barely suffered. But as you write, having been vaccinated and infected as well, I'm hoping I will be immune to the Omicron variant. 

Get vaccinated. Without it you can die for stupid fear."

2021-11-29 2:59,"I am currently a graduate student and TA at a university that has insisted on all in person instruction and work throughout this year. My concern is that even if this, or other, future, variants are more contagious or more virulent or more deadly, and vaccines do not provide adequate protections, schools and workplaces are unwilling and unready to go back to remote. That could be hugely dangerous and is not something that students nor employees have much say in."

If that is true, evading an encounter – rather than strengthening our immune system – might be counter poductive."
2021-11-29 3:05,"Could this be evolving to become more communicable and less virulent - moving towards another coronavirus version of the common cold?

There seems to be some debate over whether the pandemic of 1889-1890 (""asiatic flu"") may have been caused by a coronavirus rather than a flu strain, with some similarities to our current COVID situation - similar symptoms including ""long"" sequelae and highest death rate among the elderly. 

Similar viruses in the past seem to have burned through the vulnerable and become endemic but less dangerous - it makes sense from a pure fitness perspective.

Of course this is just speculation, but I'm going to hope to see some better news out of this (yes, my family is vaccinated)."
2021-11-29 3:08,"There is an appearance of serious moral crime. As vaccine makers limit access to widespread production, mutations will continually appear enriching the companies in what seems to be perpetually. It means they make more money limiting production, just like OPEC. It's not just a cynical view. It shows how we cannot conquer Covid-19 with business decisions."
2021-11-29 3:09,The essence of this article has appeared the day before. We know that it will take some weeks to figure out the vaccine works against this variant and it will take some weeks to figure out how effective the variant is in spreading. What is the point in repeating it?
2021-11-29 3:12,I find it dismaying that many people – will not get vaccinated; believe vaccination somehow trumps their notion of 'freedom'; and do not understand  the challenge to Scientists and our society in trying to define and contain an emergent virus. If this unacceptable behavior existed in 1955 the Salk vaccine for poliomyelitis would not have been as widely accepted on our society as it infact was. And many people would live out their lives living in an iron lung.
2021-11-29 2:32,"If you think that this is ""just another variant,"" think again. It might be twice as transmissible as Delta and it evades innate immunity to a much greater extent (as predicted by the known mutations). This means that many more younger people will be vulnerable. If the vaccines fail, our entire healthcare system could come to the brink of collapse. It is not difficult to imagine a much worse pandemic than what we've already seen and all the early signals suggest that we should be using our imaginations."
2021-11-29 2:48,"There are a lot of missing pieces to this new variant puzzle. And a lot of hyperbole by the writer of the article. It’s one thing to select sources and quotes to support a slant, but to editorialize with an exaggerated sense of dread is just not good journalism, unless the goal is to feed into the hysteria that’s being roused by the new variant.

The only way to defeat COVID is for everyone to get vaccines and boosters.	
After COVID has been defeated in the US, President Biden should work with our allies and with the World Health Organization to ensure a worldwide program to help vaccinate poor people around the world.  Otherwise, mutated versions of COVID will just return again next year.

2021-11-29 5:07,"Pretty much every commenter on here knows nothing about how mutations occur in viruses. I guarantee you that anyone who has been infected has likely had hundreds or possibly thousands of mutations during the course of their infection. Those mutations however were unable for whatever reason to successfully reproduce. The mutations that have that capability are the ones we hear about, namely Delta, Lambda, and Omicron. And of those three, Delta seems to have been fairly successful. Lambda quite a bit less so, and we are now first learning about Omicron. 
And of course even if Omicron is successful in reproducing, we have to see how successful it is in transmission from host to host, how serious the infection is once it invades a host, and whether or not it’s resistant to the antibodies produced by vaccination."
2021-11-29 4:06,"Does Biden have the guts to do the right thing.. and force PFizer to give 11 billion $$ worth of O- modified vaccine to Africa??  Or will the nonsense that has persisted since the onset of Covid in terms of  ruinning/ruining ? in the long run the economy persist?? 

I know what I think..  

Fascinating  -- I would love to see how human blood is used in testing  for efficiacy against SARS-CoV 2?   O version.. 

Of course, so long as the upper and upper middle classes get tax breaks galore and the flood up economy continues.. does anybody really care?

Commonsense approach to the pandemic would have meant that Biden arrived on the scene with a mandate for Universal Single Payer Healthcare-- not babysitting for employers, and electric bikes,  and broadband for communities established in places where they should not... but..let them eat cake..  (I think I heard that one befoe. Now the cake is gluten-fat - and sugar free??"
2021-11-29 5:18,"A minor question: if the omicron variant necessitates a reformulated vaccine, will this need to go through the full regulatory process before it is available for distribution? Or will the FDA assume that the vaccine delivered with the same technology be covered by the original test, regardless of the genetic material inserted?

More to the point, the emergence of Omicron underscores two fundamental lessons. First, developed countries cannot prioritize their own citizens and let the rest of the world wait years to be vaccinated. And second, in early 2020, the WHO should have begun constructing vaccine manufacturing plants around the world to take advantage of mRNA techniques, and Pfizer and Moderna should have worked with them to distribute the intellectual technology so that many times more doses could be produced than are currently in the proprietary installations of these two companies. In a pandemic, with a rapidly mutating virus, the primary issue should not be how much money can be made by a handful of companies, but how the world can snuff out the spread of disease and death."
2021-11-29 5:19,"This new variant is a true litmus test in many ways: In terms of studying the virus itself, let's hope that the immediate sharing of this information by SA doctors and scientists will bring the same cooperation in return, and that this process will yield specific, concrete evidence of how this new variant will impact infection (and re-infection) rates, whether vaccines offer protection, and frequency and severity of symptoms, hospitalisation, and mortality rates (and among whom). 

In terms of the political response, will Western countries use this to further hoard vaccines for booster shots (I realize that these of course have merit) or consider a bigger picture where the broader benefits of increasing vaccinations globally might be worthy of a higher priority - the immediate reaction to close borders and block arrivals from certain countries seems to miss the point a bit, considering the spread of cases in Western countries is being driven domestically. 

In the same vein, will the producers of vaccines finally offer their research openly, so that if they're unwilling to provide sufficient doses to poorer countries, maybe generic versions can be produced.

Finally, will people really try to understand the information that's coming out. Yes this article isn't exactly a complete explanation of what this new variant means, or how exactly it is different, but it's a start, and the hopefully coverage will get more complete. But it's still on all of us."
2021-11-29 5:19,"How many times are we going to have to be vaccinated? It's too much. Meanwhile, these variants keep emerging because of all of the selfish people who refuse to get vaccinated and poor countries that can't afford to get their people vaccinated. At the pharmacy the other day, there was a chart of all of the vaccines recommended for every age bracket and it was hung pre-COVID. I just can't keep taking shots and dealing with the side effects in perpetuity. Of course I don't want to get sick or hospitalized or on a ventilator but it seems like we're in a losing battle."
2021-11-29 5:32,"Two questions: 1) if this is highly transmissible, is this Omicron variant more lethal and  2) will it bypass the immunity provided by the vaccines ? Will continue to wear a mask, social distance, avoid crowds and sanitize everything until we have the data..."
2021-11-29 5:57,"Being an uber rational person, I am constantly surprised to find people who hold utterly different opinions from mine or from the opinion of the majority. This is true for issues as different as politics, race, and public health. I would have thought of total unanimity on public health issues such as vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. 
The number of anti-vaxxers has puzzled me enormously. The anti-vaxxers are among the most vulnerable and susceptible to acquiring COVID-19, yet they defy this possibility. This is bad enough, the worst part is that anti-vaxxers contribute to the emergence of new variants such as delta, omicron, and many more to come. That will guarantee that SARS-CoV-2 will be with us for a long time. This is how a pandemic becomes endemic. Add to the anti-vaxxers billions of people who don’t yet have access to any of the vaccines against COVID-19. It looks like a doomsday scenario."
2021-11-29 5:58,"The NYT is reporting like a tabloid.  Without any facts or test results, possibilities are the scaring the public.  Without any facts,  researchers are predicting doom.  Without any research, panic is assumed.  South Africa’s limited of a COVID-19 variant is being presented as presumed as a game changer.  There is no evidence that people who are vaccinated will be more likely to die than those who are currently vaccinated.  

I have been triple vaccinated, and have never been promised I won’t get become infected.  I have been told that I could still be infected, and will have a much lower chance to be hospitalized or death without being vaccinated. That is still true.  It is reckless to tell hundreds of millions of people they should worry they are no longer unprotected.  

A year a go, the experts were saying if enough people got vaccinated, herd immunity would eventually stop the spread of COVID-19.  We are close. Just like the common flu, variants change yearly.  Rather than scaring the public, tweaking boosters yearly will probably be needed.  Most people will be immune to the hospitalization and death Covid-19 have already experienced.  Get vaccinated, wear mask in closed areas, and let scientists  do what they do best. I prefer getting a booster shot over trying to getting ahead of vaccinating the world for every new variant. It is impossible. Are countries asking for a new vaccine, or the ones that are already 90% effective for the existing COVID-19?"
2021-11-29 6:13,"If folks are able to artificially synthesize mutations and create vaccines in weeks, why can't they predict such mutations before hand and be prepared for it much earlier?"
2021-11-29 6:18,It’s high time America take charge and inoculate the world against variants of coronavirus. Protecting Americans alone is not working and it has been hurting the interests of the country. Some money from Biden’s BBB must be spent to buy out the rights of vaccines and to manufacture and distribute it with the help of collaborating nations. It would help to improve the goodwill of the country that’s perceived as a war machine in many parts of the world and hedge against China that seems to benefit from the chaos that the pandemic helped to originate.
2021-11-29 6:20,"I do not understand the hysteria about this particular variant.  

Hasn't there been potential danger with other mutations that have occurred?  So why is this one being treated differently?  Maybe panic should not set in earlier than two weeks from now when the test results are in.  
 
 IDK.  Maybe my laissez faire attitude is due to COVID-19 fatigue after quarantine, masks, shots and  a booster.  Maybe this is going to be like flu - new variants and shot ingredients annually with the prediction it might be effective. That would be a good thing."
2021-11-29 6:26,I’m travelled by air for the first time since the pandemic began this week and no one cares. There are no vaccine requirements domestically. There is no vaccine requirement for nationals to enter the US. There are no testing requirements before you fly and in returning to the US you need to only test negative 72 hours prior to departure. No COVID testing in the airports and lots of exposed noses and ill fitting masks. And what happened to social distancing? We aren’t really serious about this and I’m not sure why.

These citizens of for example the United States who are returning from one of these countries can just as easily be the carrier of the new variant...Actually it was analyzed as TRUMP allowed US citizens and  green card holders to return to the US initially from Europe and Asia and other locations more than likely brought the initial infections back to places like NYC and other locations...
2021-11-29 6:50,"Next issue — mandatory vaccines. Put the COVID vaccination on par with the measles vaccine. If you’re not vaccinated, you are severely restricted in your school/work/entertainment/socialoptions.

2021-11-29 7:07,"Countries and states that reduced or eliminated most Covid-related social measures like masks may soon discover what Yogi Berra meant when he famously said ""it ain't over til it's over"". 

By the time that the Omicron variant is identified in most places, it will already be widespread, too late to take precautionary measures. 

The great political genius Boris Johnson, who led his nation into the Brexit fiasco, also lifted most or all Covid measures and the British people surged back to the pubs and shops, just in time for winter. Case rates are already high there, Omicron just arrived and it could get worse.

Expect the same poor judgement from many US governors, particularly in southern states, who have staked their political careers on fighting mandates. With kids in school, holidays ahead and winter tourists heading south, things could change quickly here as well. 

I really don't like the idea of spending 2 weeks quarantining in my basement, even if I wasn't that sick. I'll wear a mask in stores, avoid gyms and restaurants except for takeout and take other reasonable precautions."

2021-11-29 7:17,"Back to the old mantra: None of us is safe until all of us are safe. 

First-World governments need to deliver on their Covax commitments instead of boosting their healthy citizens who don't really need it. The virus, including the Omicron variant, IS CIRCLING THE GLOBE, and it knows no borders, no matter how often we sever air links from other countries.
 
Why punish South Africa and its neighbors, the same people who were vigilant enough to alert the world about Omicron? To buy time? Then why not also sever travels from Israel and Hong Kong and other nations where Omicron has been found? It doesn't make sense. The next time a new variant emerges (and it most definitely will), do you think scientists of any given country will be as generous in sharing their new discoveries with the world? I think not.  

China, the US, Russia, and the EU can stop for a year spending their energy and money on building their arsenals and instead join hands in getting the world vaccinated so we can once and for all prevent future Omicron-like variants, which will most certainly emerge.

Then once we have a global handle on the pandemic, Russia and China can go back to their rogue, disruptive actions, and the West can resume their unrealistic policies toward them."

2021-11-29 8:37,"There are some reports that the Omicron variant's symptoms are mild.  That does not necessarily make it less dangerous.

Omicron is also reported to spread easily. The more easily a virus spreads, the more people that virus infects, the more likely that virus continues to mutate.

A fast and far spreading virus causing mild symptoms can turn into a fast and far spreading virus with un-mild symptoms.  We should still take precautions, still get vaccinated, still mask, still social distance."

It is hard to tell."

2021-11-29 9:27,What an over reaction. Msybe this was a coordinated effort by the G7 to do away with high natural gas and oil prices . By curtailing  travel overnight inflation is brought under control. So if I understand right there might be a variant thst makes current medications useless or partially curtailed. However it might also be passive . So in the next five years since many have not been vaccinated this may occur a few times. Well maybe then international travel should not be opened up for five years . Let’s give it a 5 year horizon where international travel is limited . Then we will have a random test study. The UN which is based in NYC shoukd change it’s location temporarily to a more remote location for many of the representatives may not have been vaccinated which may spread the disease in NYC.  Foreign travel is hereby questionable at best.

But, then they have to adapt and thus sell more vaccines as any single relevant mutation on the protein appears in what seems to be an endeless vicious spiral. Maybe, the more traditional vac approaches using fragments of the virus that create multiple antibodies to differetn part of the virus are better in the long run. Look, europe and US have been more vulnerable to the delta variant than Brazil, which used traditional vac initially."
2021-11-29 9:42,"If one were an intelligent writer of fiction, this story, the chapter ""Omicron variant"", would be the entirely foreseeable ""ending"" to the ""COVID-19"" story. 

Lots of the people have been vaccinated. Others were not vaccinated, and never will be, but they have caught COVID-19 at least once. 

The ""Omicron variant"" is even more contagious than the Delta variant ? Look around, the Delta variant was already super contagious. ""Even more contagious"" isn't going to change much.      

The real story is the number of hospitalizations and deaths. These numbers are quite high, but not as bad as last year.  

This is the way we muddle out of this ""COVID-19"" story. This is how it ends. Say by late next spring. Look around, look at hospitalizations and deaths. Not the number of new cases."

I see that they US sequences 3.6% of cases for genomic/variant evaluation, versus roughly 50% for the UK and even higher in other European nations. That is really quite appalling, given we have known full well that this, a small RNA virus, is likely to mutate. We already know the flu mutates like gangbusters and we follow that. Two years in with COVID, and we're still behind. That is not OK and it's not working. It's not sufficient to simply dump the vaccination bucket back on a society that you, the health agencies and administration, have left uninformed.

Funny how travel bans are now so popular when the absolute same travel bans (for the same reasons) were called out so dramatically in the US at the start of the pandemic (a day before New Zealand, then Australia closed their borders for months.)

2021-11-29 10:29,"I don't understand why we don't have a rapid response initiative to vaccinate all those near the epicenter of this new variant (and future variants). I understand South Africa has a surplus of vaccine, but neighboring countries do not and probably also lack the staff to administer the vaccine. Seems to me one tool in our kit should be to contain the virus through rapid vaccination of populations at immediate risk. This should a) reduce the spread, b) save lives, and c) answer the question of effectiveness of the currently available vaccines."

I think we would be able to produce better monoclonal antibodies and vaccines soon that will help us. But only if we continue to mask and vaccinate. Scientists need time to develop new interventions, instead we are giving that time to this virus."
2021-11-29 11:03,"Theonly way to end COVID is to make a vaccine that prevents infection altogether. That’s how small pox and polio were eradicated. As long as we have the current vaccines, this is what will happen: a mutant virus that is resistant to the vaccine will emerge and we will be back to square one. Why? Because the current vaccines don’t prevent infection, they just prevent severe illness, hospitalization and death. So every infection is an opportunity for a new variant to arise. Given enough time, a much worse variant will surely arise. It’s called evolution, the most powerful force in health and disease!!"

She’s quarantined for weeks now to make sure she would pass the numerous COVID testing places along the way and back.  She’s been thoroughly vaccinated.  Totally unselfish woman.

Mild symptoms of Omicron similar to some of the symptoms following vaccine doses or boosters many suggest that Omicron is like a live attenuated (tamed) vaccines. Excessive mutations could have made Omicron a less virulent form of COVID. So far no one has been reported dead from Omicron as far as I know and Dr. Angelique Coetzee, the South African (SA) doctor who first treated patients with Omicron has said that the symptoms of thirty something patients were mild and did not require hospitalization and recovered quickly.

South African president is begging the world to lift the travel restriction on South Africans traveling outside the country or returning to SA. With SA creeping out of a severe impact on its economy due to the pandemic is being discriminated against despite its prompt reporting of the variant. SA being my sister land I plead with the western governments to lift the travel restrictions on 8 Southern African countries as soon as it is independently verified in countries where Omicron has reached, that the symptoms caused by Omicron are mild and a broad immunity is elicited in those who were infected with Omicron. We owe to our honest African brothers and sisters to do justice and not be discriminatory to these struggling democracies."
2021-11-29 11:57,"At this point there needs to be a national vaccine mandate, full stop. On top of that, there needs to be a verified proof of vaccination QR code, similar to that in Europe.

Monto MD)). A couple of sample quotes:

""Given the parade of variants, their varying transmissibility, and continuing concern about antigenic changes affecting vaccine protection, I believe it should now be clear that it is not possible to eliminate this virus from the population and that we should develop long-term plans for dealing with it after the unsupportable surges are fully controlled. Pandemic and seasonal influenza provide the most appropriate models to aid in developing strategies going forward.""

AND

""Most predictions about the shape of the post–Covid-19 world have been inaccurate — a reflection of rapid changes in knowledge. But we can now see a picture emerging in which use of effective vaccines will continue to be critical over the long term...  Counts of hospitalizations and deaths may be more important in monitoring the overall impact than numbers of cases, as long as the vaccines continue to be largely effective at preventing severe illness....one of the greatest unmet needs we currently face: continued emphasis on better therapeutics and antiviral agents, which will not be affected by molecular changes in the virus as much as vaccines are."""

2-However, don't automatically listen to modern medicine ie in this country our de facto criminal health care system. Yes, they can give you a life saver like covid vaccines but they can push every known useless pills, procedure, operation, test on you to put the wealth of the big phrama execs over the health of the public.

2021-11-29 12:29,"We are all vaccinated, have boosters and mask up  but we canceled plans to fly and see our new grandchild during Thanksgiving. This meant opting for video calls instead and once again not using our frequent flyer miles.

The reason was I had been watching the numbers and did not want to bring something to such a vulnerable new family member. Despite all the happy news about Covid that politicians put out in NJ I had noticed the death rates were still high. This told me something was not right and now not only have we learned about Omicron but all NJ counties are listed as high contagious areas. 

We are given haphazard information based on what is good for money and not good for people. I was shocked to find out how much money is made by the hotel and restaurant industry around the Thanksgiving Day parade. It isn't for the children. Direct flights from South Africa come in daily to Newark airport and we now know passengers  use fake negative tests to board overseas. Yet flights are still allowed with no testing on arrival and Biden is on it days later. 

Biden and Harris are not and I doubt will ever be on top of this situation. I have as much confidence in them as I had in Trump. At this point I will do whatever it takes to keep my family safe but I have to say all the organizations, politicians and politically motivated scientists have failed monumentally either deliberately or due to incompetence.

I have posted before that many things about Covid remind me of multiple sclerosis. I can tell you as a person who has had MS for decades that even mild symptoms can mask severe activity in the body. Unfortunately it will take  time to see how Omicron works but in the meantime it would be reckless to assume it is mild or less harmful in how it affects the body."
2021-11-29 12:46,"Being able to formulate a new vaccine in six weeks and begin production in 100 days is absolutely mind boggling.

How in the world can so many people reject this achievement of humanity and embrace, what are essentially folk remedies, pushed by hacks?  And even worse, how can so many political leaders in positions of great responsibility push the folk remedies resulting in the death of hundreds of thousands?

This thing will never leave.  It will keep mutating so long as it has fertile ground to grow in.  The only way to tame it is for the entire world to get vaccinated.  Not 70%, but everyone must get the shot.  

How is getting a vaccine a loss of freedom?  Which is freer?  Getting a free shot that has no downside or a one way ticket to the undertaker?"
2021-11-29 12:52,"Thank you China.

Your incredibly poor public health standards gave us your wild animal public markets which gave us Covid-19. 

Your decision not to put travel bans in place early caused a small regional epidemic to quickly spiral into a global pandemic now responsible for over a quarter billion cases and 5 million deaths.

So, how is China being held accountable for this global disaster?  It’s not!  Why?

One possibility is that the developed world is so addicted to China’s cheap products that we fear that any corresponding actions regarding Covid accountability could be met with retaliation. 

Another possibility is that political correctness has become so ingrained within the developed world that the psychological and emotional fear of being called xenophobic overwhelms the logic of accountability. 

All of this while every six or so months a new Covid mutation appears creating a global panic. There seems to be nothing on the horizon that will stop this vicious cycle.  As a result millions of more cases and deaths monthly. Thanks China. 

Regardless, sadly it looks like China will not be held accountable for their deliberate actions and the global disaster they created."
2021-11-29 13:00,"It seems pretty clear at this point, from reading virology experts on Twitter, that vaccines will have very limited effectiveness against Omicron. Especially for older people  or people with health problems (obesity, weak immune systems, etc), it is best at this point to consider yourself unvaccinated until there is confirmation to the contrary.

The hope that Omicron is mild can all be traced to one doctor: Dr Angelique Coetzee, who was the first doctor in South Africa to treat this variant, in her clinic in Pretoria (the capital, near Johannesburg). There was a Telegraph article where she said that in her experience so far, the symptoms of Omicron were unusual and mild.

This morphed into ""South African doctors say Omicron is unusually mild"" all over the internet. However, what was left out of this was the part of the interview where Dr. Coetzee said that all her patients were young and otherwise healthy. Of course Omicron will be mild in that demographic, every variant since the beginning of this pandemic has been mild for young and healthy people. She went on to say that it is unclear how Omicron will affect more at risk populations, like older people or sick people.

Over the past week, hospitalizations in Gauteng (the province affected) have been increasing significantly. Hospitalizations always lag infections, and deaths always lag hospitalizations. As of today, there is no reason to think Omicron is mild, given how new it is even in SA"

2021-11-29 13:12,"Of course the vaccines will be effective against Omicron!

The only way to defeat COVID is for everyone to get vaccines and boosters.  Otherwise, it will get worse this winter.

After COVID has been defeated in the US, President Biden should work with our allies and with the World Health Organization to ensure a worldwide program to help vaccinate poor people around the world.  Otherwise, mutated versions of COVID will just return again next year."
2021-11-29 13:12,"Test, test, test! The US has to get the testing regimen straight, clear and prioritized. We haven't, we don't now, and as opposed to South Africa, we have no idea what strains are out there until people start showing up in ERs. The testing has to be prioritized, and then we won't need to be so reliant on travel bans."

2021-11-29 13:19,"Well then.  The statements made by TFG that the virus would magically disappear was fake?  That the virus was no worse than the flu?

We now can understand that our failures to heed the scientists advice and warnings are increasing the spread and the mutations.

And it isn’t a hoax."

Ms Mandevilli has started the discussion and I only hope she becomes a dominant voice.  Time to clear house at NIH and the CDC and any other advisor who are just picking up a paycheck and embracing their 401K.

The stark reality is that it is always a balance between knowledge and all American greed.  In this case, keeping the vaccine abundant in the US and throwing a bone to the rest of the world."
2021-11-29 13:25,"Even if the vaccine can have an effect on it, that only works if people get vaccinated.

This variant is a prime example of why the whole world needs to be vaccinated."
2021-11-29 13:26,"“People who recover from Covid and then receive even one dose of a vaccine tend to produce a broader range of antibodies, capable of recognizing more versions of the virus, than do people who are only vaccinated.”

So US vaccine mandates should catch up to the evidence and not require recovered people to get two doses of the vaccine.  In fact, Israel has shown that even recovered people with no doses have better long-term immunity than fully vaccinated people who never had COVID."
2021-11-29 13:28,"So far COVID-19 has proven to be more virally clever, covert and cunning in infecting and killing people than we have been in defending, deterring, detecting and defeating it.

However, COVID-19 is neither benign nor malign in it's RNA genomic evolutionary quest to be fruitful and multiply.

COVID-19 and people are both merely acting according to their natures.

Every person who is infected by COVID-19 offers the potential for evolution by mutation into a variant that is more contagious, lethal and capable of evading vaccines.

However, masks, social distancing, washing hands and contact tracing plus testing are always more or less effective against any COVID-19 variants spread by aerosols."
2021-11-29 13:29,"The danger with omicron is that there are already 30-50 strains.  It's DNA evidently mutates constantly.  So, even if we're not being infected by a deadly strain, it's inevitable that the virus will mutate to a more dangerous strain.  We've all seen zombie movies, right?  It turns out that the zombie faction now has their own political party dedicated to -what?- human extinction?  Golly, that doesn't seem like a good business model.  Viruses have different relations with their victims, some good, some deadly, some in-between.  So maybe omicron is in between fatal and ""I'm don't feel good"".  It will still be politicized by the Armaggedeon-based politicians and corporations as part of the political warfare waged by 40% of the country.  It certainly looks like we ""liberal"" humans are their real enemy, not some deadly viral invader threatening to end our race.  Let's see Mathew McConnaghey make that movie."

2021-11-29 13:38,data coming out of South Africa actually points to the vaccines being very effective. majority of the cases are unvax and ones with most side effects are those that are unvax or partially. fully vax mild symptoms or nothing.

The delta variant is responsible for almost 100% of severe illness requiring hospitalization  and deaths now . Moderna and Pfizer should be making a reformulated vaccine against delta now. The current vaccine will not stop the spread of covid in the vaccinated but a reformulated version should . They should prepare for omnicron but we  need to stop delta first."
2021-11-29 13:44,"I think your readers would tolerate a greater degree of scientific detail in articles like this.

For example, the mutations in Omicron do not include any of the mutations in other variants, which suggests that this variant developed over a long time within a single, probably immunocompromised individual.  

Another example is that the regular PCR test signals Omicron very well, without resorting to sequencing, so testing is going to be very effective, more so than with other variants, in nailing down transmissability, effectiveness of vaccines, and lethality."
2021-11-29 13:45,"It seems harsh to say but the time has now come to require vaccination for a person ro enter a hospital, no matter their medical problem.  Hospitals need to be safe from unvaccinated people.  No vax, no meds.  If the unvaxed perish from the earth future mutations will diminish or disappear.  They can retain their ""freedom"" but not require the rest of us to bear the cost. This is not schadenfreude, nor politics, just common sense science."
2021-11-29 13:45,"It's only a matter of time before a senseless, lifeless protein innocently mutates into a variant that targets its best 'host' opportunity...overpopulated humanity.

2021-11-29 13:51,"The Omicron variant has about 50 mutations & the receptor-binding domain has 10 more mutations, which is far greater than Delta. The high number of mutations suggests it came from a single patient who couldn't clear the virus, probably unvaccinated. 

This underscores the necessity to Americans vaccinated and block hospitalization to those who refuse vaccination. In essence, the willfully un-vaxxed become status DNR. For those politicians who have blocked mandates, including DeSantis of Florida and Abbott of Texas, they are directly responsible for expanding the disease. Jail is the appropriate solution. 

If we're to end this pandemic, we have to stop coddling the ignorant and the politicians who exploit their ignorance."
2021-11-29 13:55,"This seems to be an extremely clever virus, certainly it has altered more rapidly than on a seasonal basis, with mutations that continue to make it possibly more worrisome, not less.  Without fueling conspiracy theories, it is hard to imagine a better design to disrupt world economies on an ongoing basis."
2021-11-29 14:00,"Our administration needs to do a better job with detection and containment, and more urgently, with a coherent message coming from the top - the president.  Between the CDC, NIH, Twitter, and the press, there is simply too much noise without facts, so our President  needs to be far more present.  That said, we should be grateful that patents weren’t stripped from Pfizer and Moderna, amount others, so that these private enterprises can again come to our rescue."
2021-11-29 14:13,"Travel bans do not work, especially after vaccinations are readily available, other than stigmatize nations from bringing up new variants. This has been handled so poorly by the developed world. Also, apparently the virus cannot do much on weekends(none of the politicians come out and say much during weekends, and expect scientists and doctors to toil)."
2021-11-29 14:16,"As hard as I try, I cannot think of a more unnecessarily fear-inducing way to describe the current situation as a Frankenstein mix. I find it troubling in many ways, particularly because people still put faith in what so called experts say. If these experts can only propagate fear, the population will respond accordingly and behave irrationally. Yes, we need vigilance, and the new mutations should be a catalyst to learn and understand, not to disseminate fear. Panic is not a strategy."

With a solid majority, they can appoint Trump as Speaker of the House, impeach Biden & Harris, and using the order of succession, catapult Trump right back into the white house.

Do you remember how well Trump addressed COVID the last time? Disbanding the pandemic response team, advocating Clorox and Hydroxychloroquine, and telling us sunshine will beat the virus? Instead of Trump, perhaps the geniuses in the republican party will elevate DeSantis of FL or Abbott of Texas into the white house, both of whom passed legislation making vaccine mandates illegal. Why not fire the head of the Center for Disease Control and replace Dr. Walensky with republican faithfuls such as Boebert of Colorado or Gosar of Arizona?

If you think COVID is a nightmare, imagine who will advise  the country after republicans fire Fauci and everyone who disagrees with their policies. That truly is reminiscent of Frankenstein."

And insofar as that is the case, why in the world would the Times come out with a story implying Frankenstein? Sometimes I think that this generation of journalist see their charge to be responsible as a sort of joke. And this virus is no joke. A bit more awareness, maturity, and clarity may help. But  ""Frankenstein mixture"" is contemptible."
2021-11-29 14:19,"Again in the midst of a new panic, can we ask ourselves what is the final policy goal here? Provided this new variant is relatively mild compared to the previous ones, are we all leaning towards a zero covid goal or do we accept transmission and limited symptoms?"

2021-11-29 13:01,"It’s time to have a national strategy that includes a sophisticated, ethical and fair allocation of resources to combat COVID.
1. This means vaccines, antivirals, immune therapies included in a comprehensive , firm yet nuanced public health approach. 
2.This means public health spearheaded by enlightened and caring officials who can educate, empower and involve. Yes to NYC’s Dr. Dave Choksi and CDC’s Rochelle Walensky. No, No to more hats than heads the polarizing Dr. Fauci. To paraphrase a movie phrase from an outstanding Brooklyn villain Lefty two guns played by Al Pacino, “even when I’m wrong I’m right”. How different is Lefty from Fauci’s “I am science”.
1. There are many brilliant immunologists in academic labs such as Dr. Michel Nussensweig of Rockefeller. His work while on a Nobel Prize track is under resourced to do as much as it could and as quickly with COVID. Just like in WW2 these geniuses in academia need to be involved collaboratively. These academic best and brightest not worst and dumbestcould be partnered with industry.
2. Pharma’s crucial role needs careful, skeptical, supportive when appropriate handling and with real push back when needed. That’s went well with vaccines thus far, but less well with antivirals. What about Remdesivir today in treatment more than 18 mos after Fauci declared it the standard of care? 
It’s inexcusable that so many have died for lack of an infusion of monoclonal antibodies. It proves no head was under Fauci’s treatment hat."
2021-11-29 14:35,"Like climate change, the biggest determinant of Covid-19 effects is overpopulation. Without dealing with this real problem, we will be forever be behind the curve, always chasing cures for the latest symptom."
2021-11-29 14:46,"Why is it assumed that this variant originated in South Africa, or for that matter anywhere on the African continent? Omicron has been found in The Netherlands, Belgium, UK, Germany, and Israel. If incoming travel is to be banned, why not ban it from those countries as well? Is the British or Dutch version of Omicron somehow less contagious or deadly than the one found in South Africa? It doesn't appear so.

This is a problem borne of vaccine hoarding. Everyone knew that if large numbers of people remained unvacinated anywhere in the world, the pandemic would not be defeated and no one would remain safe. The U.S. and other nations are more concerned with protecting the ""Intellectual Property Rights"" of certain corporations, even though that IP and the vaccines themselves were made possible by massive public (taxpayer) research grants -- grants, not loans or equity investment.

With global crises threatening us all, government leadership proves once again simply not up to the task of protecting their own people and the world at large."
2021-11-29 14:47,"Consider these facts. COVID ICU nurses and doctors are burned out and are leaving the profession in droves. To supplement the shortage, medical schools are working overtime to churn out replacements. In some instances, graduation requirements are being relaxed. It's a war, we need more troops on the front lines.

Bottom line? Experience is exiting and well meaning novices are replacing the experienced. Perhaps that newbee kid trying to fit your COVID respirator just graduated nursing school 10 days ago. 

Hopefully, that reality is enough to convince the unvaccinated to get their shots because nothing else seems to work. But I can tell you with 100% certainty, when the sick enter my ICU & are grasping for breath, 100% of them regret their stupid decision."
2021-11-29 14:54,"We need some reporting on what symptoms doctors in South Africa are seeing in Omnicron infected patients.  Are their symptoms severe or mild? Are some asymptomatic.  Are patients needing ICU care?  Are any patients requiring ventilators?  Though the discovery of Omnicron is very new, there are reported 2,000 cases in South Africa, so there should be some substantial information on symptoms.  Though it will take awhile for results of various testing programs to be announced, it would be helpful if we knew the symptoms of Omnicron infected patients."
2021-11-29 15:13,"There is at least one report that a patient infected with omicron had mild symptoms.

If this is accurate and common for most who may be infected, it might lead to wide spread herd immunity.

The best case scenario for the corona virus is that as it mutates it becomes less pathogenic. A worldwide ""pandemic"" of a version of covid-19 that mimics the flu in pathogenesis means that the severity of SAR-CoV-2 is waining.

More importantly, if the natural immunity from this variant protects against other variants we may be looking at the beginning of the end of the pandemic.

Seasonal flu does take lives. As many as 60,000 have died in the US during bad flu seasons. But almost all are the elderly and those who are already ill from other diseases.

Those populations can easily be identified and protected with vaccines. But for the rest of the population vaccination will be neither necessary nor scientifically justified.

And we can end all lockdowns and discriminations between vaccinated and unvaccinated. 

This research on the pathogenesis of omicron needs to proceed immediately."

the only credible analysis will be the ""ICU occupancy"" come Christmas(.)

2021-11-29 16:14,Whatever happened to the vaccine being worked on several months ago that was supposed to stop all corona viruses?  I remember reading about progress on that research in the NYT. Why keep tweaking the current vaccines?  Why not go for the whole enchilada?
2021-11-29 16:58,"We need to stop panicking and start thinking like a virus. There is no incentive for a virus to be exceedingly deadly. Like any other living organism, a virus’ goal is to survive to reproduce. The most successful viruses cause minor illnesses and are highly contagious (think of a rhinovirus - many of us get 3 colds per year). Why don’t we have a pandemic of Ebola? Because Ebola is too virulent and too deadly. It self-limits because it kills its hosts too quickly.

Of course, the main reason Covid has an opportunity to evolve is because folks refuse to get vaccinated (or don’t have access because the US saved too many doses for people who don’t seem to want them). We continue to give the virus more and more opportunities to make itself smarter. There are bound to be unsuccessful mutations along the way that are more deadly. Folks will die as a result of others’ ignorance."
2021-11-29 17:06,"Instead of calming things down, the NYT is stirring them up. As far as is known, Omicron's symptoms are mild and manageable. It remains to be seen whether the vaccines remain protective.
There's a lot of politics in this. Politicians want to protect their backs and would rather be accused of overreacting than be seen as negligent. All this is very damaging to the credibility of vaccines and health authorities. There will come a time when people won't care and won't listen to anyone. Let's stop the hype now and wait to hear more. It may be that this is just a storm in a glass of water."
2021-11-29 17:24,"Thank you, NYT for finally coming to the same conclusion that many health professionals and researchers reached a long time ago about the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines. i.e. A lot more research needs to be done before they can really be deemed ‘effective’."
2021-11-29 17:28,"Much has been made of SA hospitalizations with very little data, but (1) SA has a quite low elderly population compared to EU and US so they have a naturally lower percentage of hospitalization, and (2) hospitalizations lag infection and the omicron surge is recent. No conclusions can be drawn from existing data.

We don't know if omicron just looks bad or is really, truly bad, but the presence of so many mutations that affect the antigenic regions of the spike protein is very very unlikely to be a coincidence.

Those mutations alter residues that are commonly recognized by antibodies that have been stimulated by vaccination or prior infection. While a bit under a quarter of South Africans have been fully vaccinated, most have been previously infected and should have antibodies. Yet this surge is incredibly sharp, at least in these early stages.

We are already in a Delta surge and we're only a few weeks away from Christmas. If we don't institute precautions fast, this will be a far worse holiday season than last year because everyone seems to think covid is over for the vaccinated. Christmas will spread omicron like wildfire and we will be going into lockdowns again.

Make testing mandatory before getting on a plane for domestic flights as well as international arrivals. Expand vaccine mandates, including boosters, institute mask mandates wherever possible.

Getting boosters into arms is a start but is unlikely to be sufficient until the omicron booster arrives."
2021-11-29 17:45,"I will continue to wear a mask, avoid crowds and am thankful I've been able to have a third vaccine.  I am fortunate.  If another vaccine is needed down the line I will look forward to receiving that.  Vaccines are not fail-safe, but they are certainly better than the alternative.  

Variants are a fact of life with viruses....perhaps this particular variant will offer milder disease and displace Delta, but it's too soon to know...it would help if vaccine companies would release their IP and allow manufacturers worldwide to generate more supply as needed."
2021-11-29 17:45,"Been thinking of how much better we're prepared for inevitable variants.  When covid started, one of the first things done by the previous administration was tossing the ""Pandemic Play Book"", then weeks of hype while the bug spread around the country.  They did all it could to play this down (considering it a ""blue state"" problem), culminating with ""15 cases will soon be down to zero"".  We're pushing 800,000 deaths now.  

This variant ""may spread faster, but be less severe""... maybe we'll know within a couple weeks.  In meantime, people can wear masks (HOPEFULLY they know to use N95s now - they're readily available).   

I sense we'll continue with ""Vaxxed vs Unvaxxed"", but at least we've got the pandemic infrastructure to deal with it.  More people are willing to get shots if a new vaccine is needed, while some haven't learned anything since this started (they still quote Fauci as saying we don't need to wear masks.. which he DID say ~Feb 2020, but punctuated it with ""with what we know now"")."

The hypocrisy of people like this who refuse to get vaccinated but when they get sick are all to willing to accept the science of medical care makes my blood boil."
2021-11-29 18:01,It seems the symptoms of Omicron are relatively mild compared to Delta and first wave of COVID.  So it is likely this will be the dominant endemic strain for a while since it may be slightly better at evading to some degree our vaccinations.  So I am not terribly concerned about mortality or hospital rates increasing with Omicron.  The unvaccinated and the very elderly will continue to die at the same steady rate.  My concern is how will it be politicized for the vaccinated?
2021-11-29 18:07,If you look at the shape of the spike proteins on the Omicron virus you can see that many of the areas (epitopes)are not changed. The vaccines will have caused people to develop antigens that target the unchanged areas (as well as the changed areas) therefore the vaccines will still be effective particularly if one has a high antibody levels after being recently boosted.

""The tangled history of mRNA vaccines"".. 'Hundreds of scientists had worked on mRNA vaccines for decades before the coronavirus pandemic brought a breakthrough.'
 
Pay particular attention to Robert Malone's contribution (he's now a naysayer, thinking he's been ignored) and that of this woman.  NYT wrote a great article about her Apr 2021:
""Kati Kariko Helped Shield the World From the Coronavirus""

And as of 6 days ago, in the US, 454M shots have been administered, with 195M people (59.1%) fully vaccinated.
Worldwide, 7.81B shots have been administered, with 3.33B people (42.7%) fully vaccinated.  This is far beyond the number of people involved in any drug testing."
2021-11-29 19:02,"The atomic and molecular components of the mRNA vaccines for covid-19 can be made from commonly available resources. For example, the red tide that occurs in lake Erie, is caused by farm fertilizer runoff leading to the growth of algae with a large DNA component. And, the P, N, and K in the fertilizer and algae's DNA is very similar to the chemicals composing the ingredients of the mRNA vaccines. So, there are no shortages of scarce components or materials for making  the vaccines as in the chips' shortage currently roiling the auto market. 

Also, Samsung recently announced it was building a new chip factory in Texas costing about $17 billion. But, a new mRNA vaccine plant can be constructed for only about $100 million per the Times.

 What makes the vaccine rare is the intellectual property underlying it. And, to pop the patent, would probably in the long run, enable poorer countries to regain control of their destinies once again and rob the virus of the unvaccinated which are critical components to support its unceasing mutation rate and its ability to continue to endanger more lives in developed countries.

You can feel the fatigue and frustration everywhere.  There is a sense it’s everyone for themselves out there.  That’s probably what I find most depressing about this pandemic.  If we all just pulled together- one nation… one global community… we could have knocked this out months ago.

They were all infected by another friend who had received his booster three weeks earlier. All of them had the same symptoms: headache, body ache, fatigue and a mild cough. All over it in a week, vaccinated or otherwise. 

Early reports is that Omicron has followed the pattern of every virus that ever came before it. Higher infectivity, milder symptoms. So tired of this oversold panic."

The US has failed to build a robust ""surveillance"" program to track genetic mutations, either through genomic sequencing or simple PCR tests.  Without advance warning we cannot assess risks or take steps to ameliorate transmission.

Will Omicron increase the spread of covid - 19?  Will it infect vaccinated people?  Will it make people sicker, or kill more people?  We do not know any of these basic facts because wee did not detect the spread of Omicron, and could not do lab tests to determine its virulence.

Why is no one holding President Biden or Dr. Fauci accountable?

I know, I know.  It is verboten to criticize Fauci or the Biden administration for these supposed policy ""failures.""

High inflation is the fault of the supply chain disruption.

Our supply chain disruption is the fault of the virus, which created a pent up demand for goods.

The virus is Trump's fault.

And an attack on Dr. Fauci is an attack on the High Faucerium, and an attack on the High Faucerium is and attack on ""science."""
2021-11-29 13:58,"There is a reasonable chance that the multiple mutations in the spike protein of the virus will render omicron resistant to current vaccines. IT is almost certain that omicron will be less responsive to available vaccines. Pfizer indicated that within 100 days they can come up with a new vaccine but it is likely that mass production and distribution will take longer. Either way we will be way back in the fight against Covid-19. Thus all preemptive measures including travel banes, soocial distancing and enhanced screening are justified."
2021-11-29 20:42,"Has anyone thought to ask China yet to offer restitution to the countries of the world for the incalculable losses incurred, both human and financial, due to this ongoing global health crisis? No doubt China would already be proposing the same if the coronavirus was thought to have escaped from a wet food market, or a nearby virology lab, located in the U.S., or in Germany, France or New Zealand for that matter. In a more perfect world (which I know we remain far from) some sort of assistance, in one form or another, would already have been voluntary offered … just my 2 cents."
2021-11-29 20:54,"And then what of the Sigma variant coming and then Theta? And eventually OmicronSquared.

It's endless."
2021-11-29 21:07,"According to various reports of what the doctor in South Africa who first reported it, and an article in India Times, reports from all over South Africa are that the omicron variant is very mild, like a mild case of the flu, short lived with tiredness and aches and pains, and low rates of hospitalization. 

It sounds like we may NOT want to keep this variant out of our borders.

I have had all three of my Moderna shots and am NOT anti-science or anti-vax.

You must realize that dangerous diseases often end in common mild forms.  For instance, the 1918 flu never went away, but evolved in two or three years into plain old H1N1 flu.  It is in the virus’s best interest to not frighten its hosts into avoiding it.  

An emerging variant in a country with high vaccination rates would be more likely to get its advantage by resisting the vaccines.

Even a variant that doesn’t put people in the hospital if they’ve been vaccinated or had covid before, which latter might describe most people in southern Africa, would be a huge improvement over what we have now.   

We do NOT want to stop that from happening with covid-19.   Covid-19 is never going to go away.   Too many people don't get vaccinated.  The vaccines don't stop people from getting sick.   Most people who get covid-19 never know they have it, and those who get sick are contagious before they are sick.

I hope that officials will pay attention to evidence that this variant is mild when deciding whether to continue travel bans."
2021-11-29 21:13,"There comes a time, which is now, after 22 months of begging people to care for themselves, that we just have to realize, natural selection includes the function of a survival instinct. You can't force a person to care for themselves. You can offer every possible aid, but you can not force them to live. It is obvious the real impetus of the survival instinct is the though before the deed. I'm left with the notion that a person has to be either brainwashed or deceived to save them. So is that really morally correct? Well, I'd rather suffer the guilt of deception than to have spent my life regretting having not sinned to save.

So get past the nanny state criticism and use every word possible to teach people they must save themselves with vaccines. Trump failed to do so, but you know, he was Trump. Biden is a father figure. Tell it like it is Joe. We don't want people dying of fear and stupidity, and that's what it is. We do need an alarmist strategy to get people vaccinated. Tell the nation we want everyone on this side of the grass. 

Wall Street makes tons of money when the old and poor die early. Tell the people to outlive the rich."
2021-11-29 21:13,"It is pretty obvious to this observer that for vaccines to defeat Covid, they must be widely deployed where the virus is mutating. That is, worldwide. Pfizer is large enough a company to be able to forgo some profit by licensing their patent to be produced by whoever can do it. Logistics need to be the focus of the best minds in the world.

Ending this stubborn virus means getting AHEAD of it, not trying to play catch-up."
2021-11-29 21:16,"The stock market does not reflect the health and wealth of the country, it is only a guage of the investors playing games of chance."
2021-11-29 21:23,"Surprise, surprise, America cares more about profit and loss than the nation's health. A new virus emerges and all that American's care about is how it will affect their pocket book than how it will affect their families and fellow citizens."
2021-11-29 21:24,"It seems as though when we flattened the curve early on, we also caused the curve to extend out much farther into the future. This has allowed much more time for variants to develop and flourish. So it seems like we need future strategies that both flatten and shorten the curve at the same time to lessen the chance of many variants developing."
2021-11-29 21:33,"What do we do while we wait, well more waiting and worrying.  Dealing with uncertainty has never been the strength of human beings though we need to do it all the time.  Is the Omicron variant a ticking time bomb or just another dud?  its like waiting in the doctor's office for the result of those tests we needed to do.  The question becomes will our very breath kill another or their breath ourselves.    How can we face this moment and coming ones without fear?"
2021-11-29 21:52,"On one hand, progress against COVID is vulnerable to new mutations of the virus, which are likely to happen continuously.   One the other hand, knowledge gained in combating COVID, at the front end with vaccinations and at the back end with pills, antibodies, etc. for those who get it, can hopefully mitigate the impacts of COVID.  We better hope for continuing progress on both ends."
2021-11-29 22:01,"Be prepared. It's a matter of time before we see infections in the United States, if we are seeing the identification *rapidly* progressing from South Africa to other European continent countries. Without any vaccination, the natural immunity will continually take hits -- sooner or later, the COVID virus will mutate to match the unvaccinated host.
Getting the vaccination will still effectively resist the main structure of the COVID virus ... while the scientists tweak the formula to resist the Omicron variant. It will take two weeks *as of 11-29-2021* to know more about the tweaks that will be needed. Once that tweak is determined, it will take 90-plus days to have an appropriate vaccination ready to put in arms."
2021-11-29 22:14,"On one hand, I feel like I would be fine if I ended up getting it. I am thrice poked, and for my age, pretty healthy. On the other hand, I really don't want to find out. Therefore I am canceling my travel in mid December. I keep thinking of a rather mean-spirited heavily pixelated video arcade game from the 70s where little tombstones popped up when points were scored. And oh yeah, the game has the word ""race"" in it, and instead of little cars, I keep imaging spike proteins.
As a Christmas gathering will occur mere days from my arrival back home, complete with the elderly and vulnerable, I do not want omicron to score any points. Video chatting will do just fine, even though it's a very special occasion."
2021-11-29 22:37,"""Keep Calm and Carry On"". Good advice."
2021-11-29 22:40,"If current vaccines are not effective against omicron, then the current government response -- everybody get vaccinated! -- is nothing but security theater.  And when it is revealed, the backlash is certain.

This is a risk Biden should have taken more seriously."
2021-11-29 22:49,"Why can’t 6 months to 5 year olds get vaccinated? The government’s message: get vaccinated, except for the littlest ones. Criminal ineptness by the FDA. Once again."
2021-11-29 2:18,"Given the chance for new variants to continue to emerge, doesn't it behoove scientists to place as much or more emphasis on treatment?  The much -trashed Ivermectin (the invention of which - for humans - won its inventor a Nobel Prize) ,(perhaps because it's not on patent any longerand thus cheap to administer?) seems to have met with success, when given in proper dosages by physicians who know what they are doing.  Are ""we"" waiting until a patented drug (which will be very pricey) comes along?  Why aren't we hearing more about success in treatment?"
2021-11-29 14:07,"“This thing is a Frankenstein mix of all of the greatest hits,” Dr. Hoge said, referring to the variant’s many concerning mutations. 
A Frankenstein mix or a laboratory gain-of-function mix?"
2021-11-29 5:49,"Wear your mask. Social distance. Be sure you and everyone around you is vaccinated and boosted. Get the flu shot.

Restart fomite precautions — surfaces — until we know more. (Maybe gloves again for awhile.) Wash those hands. 

And pay attention to the Infectious Disease and Epidemiology scientists.

The virus doesn’t care about low frustration tolerance, ignorance, political agendas, whatever.

And thank you, thank you that the Biden folks are in charge."
2021-11-29 21:19,I got the jab and then Delta. But good thing I was able to go into a bar with my Vax card before my symptoms showed up and I even knew.... Why isn't anyone talking about how the vaxxed still spread the Virus?  I suppose Science is inconvenient  sometimes?
2021-11-29 21:08,"The World Health Organization just lost what little credibility it had left by refusing to name this “variant” Xi. The Greek letter Xi is pronounced “Zye” not “Jee” or “Chee”.  Even in the many Chinese languages this Greek letter would not have been confused with the common Chinese surname Xi, shared by the leader of the CCP. For a body that claims science should be free of politics, they just proved their hypocrisy. Some may disagree with me, but if it is important to have the skeptics vaccinated, you just gave them another reason to never get vaccinated. Great job WHO."
2021-11-30 1:51,"Why not some objective, specific reporting about the many FDA Approved medications,that were initially regarded as safe and subsequently pulled off the shelf. 

I was prescribed the Zantac or Ranitidine for years to treat GERD.  This FDA Approved Drug was Available for nearly 40 Years before it was linked to Cancer.  

While I'm vaxxed, I'm also still waiting for Efficacy versus Panic and media hype"
2021-11-30 2:42,The answer is yes. Nothing to see here.
2021-11-30 3:52,"The word, “may,” is used so many times in this article that it may be difficult to take it seriously.  I was once taught by a virologist that the sole goal of a virus is to replicate. For that purpose a host is needed. Killing the host is counterproductive and thus those viruses that have mutated to only mildly affect their host and move on have the greatest likelihood of coming around frequently, killing the weakest hosts but generally living to see another year, decade or millennium. Thus annual flu epidemics.  Omicron anecdotally from what we know so far sounds like it has already learned how to behave in this fashion."
2021-11-30 5:22,"I have absolute faith in scientists and their ability to stay on top of what we need to do to bring the COVID-19 pandemic to an end. I have absolutely no faith that politicians in the United States can unite around a single common strategy to help us bring the pandemic to an end. As for my fellow citizens, a huge percentage of them are useless to the democracy in trying to deal with this crisis.￼ They will remain unvaccinated, spreading disease to others, and dying of Covid-19. Therefore, plan to continue to suffer for the indefinite future."
2021-11-30 5:27,"I have not noticed in the comments-- the fundamental distinction mentioned between South Africa and China.  The South Africans alerted the world in a matter of days to a dangerous development. The Chinese are still hiding information about the Wuhan lab.  One must suspect that the resilience of Covid-19, its ability to quickly evolve, its circumvention of vaccines, its effective transmission routes speaks to its probable-- unnatural (i.e. made in a lab) origins.  When will Western governments have the courage to ask-- the most troubling questions about this pandemic?"
2021-11-30 11:34,"WHERE ARE THE in-the-mailbox, at home TESTS for COVID?
If we knew where the variants are, would in-home testing reduce the profit-margins of Big Pharma?"
2021-11-30 11:48,"Don't panic. Though the Omicron variation will likely not be easily stopped, t appears thus far to be milder in effect. Maybe, just maybe, it will remain mild while boosting antibodies and resistance to other more deadly variants. For now it's more isolation and playing it as safe as possible but new variants underscore the need for vaccine mandates and for quarantines."
2021-11-30 12:52,"Merely asking a question from a person without a medical background -- When the virus bumps up against a vaccinated person, is it forced to mutate (work harder) to evade the vaccine-induced antibodies?  Asked another way, would there be fewer mutations without vaccines?  This is NOT an anti-vax post.  I am fully vaccinated.  I am just curious."
2021-11-30 13:10,"The insurance companies are the only entities that can teach these Anti Vaxxers a lesson. Stop covering COVID related medical treatment cost for people who are not vaccinated. Religion exemption, moral exemption , personal freedom are the privileges' only the rich countries can afford."
2021-11-30 13:19,"No one should purposely go out and get infected to obtain hybrid immunity, but for those that have recovered from COVID one dose of vaccine results in a more robust and durable immune response than vaccination alone. Vaccine mandates need to adjust to this reality."
2021-11-30 13:54,"Just a footnote to this piece---I personally, have been vigilant with all of the CDC recommendations---but, the American health care system is an absolute mess. What I have had to go through to get tested, to get vaccinated is a labybrith of long forms, long waits, and from our medical providers long on confusion. Frankly, I don't know how the poor and less educated can navigate the maze of forms and providers that it has taken me hours on a computer to figure out."
2021-11-30 14:46,"@John Joseph Laffiteau MS in Econ 
Just to emphasize how global this crisis is, as of 11/30/2021 the NY Times shows:  262.2 million cases worldwide with 5.2 million deaths. Also, in comparative terms, or relative terms, the Times (11/30/2021) states that China reports 114,161 total covid-19 cases with 4,636 deaths, due in part to their heavy, early diagnostic testing and then draconian lockdown policies. And, the US reports 48.4 million cases with 779,293 deaths from the covid-19 virus.

2021-11-30 15:23,"Stopped counting after six “mays”, three “suggests” and two “perhaps”.  Articles like this one abound in the media - scaremongering.  We won’t know for weeks the impact of these mutations on vaccine efficacy, severity of the flu caused, etc.  Meanwhile we have to endure guessing games and Chicken Little articles.  Get vaccinated and boosted.  Wear a mask.  And wait for sufficient data."
2021-11-30 16:23,"Two different assessments as Moderna is saying that their current vaccine will struggle to stop Omicron and that a new one is needed, with Pfizer saying the opposite, that their vaccine will probably work well against the variant, but that they could develop a new one.

Moderna has shown a strong inclination for fast and quick profits, while Pfizer, a large settled company has taken a longer view. 

Makes me think if the business influences the science, and how much."
2021-11-30 17:05,"What I can’t figure out is why we don’t try to make a vaccine that targets the core of viruses (not the spike protein).  Isn’t the core the same for all these variants? 

Also there isn’t a ‘good’ virus (although i’ve read viruses can naturally wipe out invasive species) like there is for bacteria."
2021-11-30 18:36,"“As nations severed air links....” Sounds like it’s too late (for the rest of the world), but for only one infected person getting through.￼"
2021-11-18 14:33,"I kept seeing the phrase “for adults.”  Clearly our local provider didn’t get this message. My child was so traumatized by his first test (a deep nasal swab with a brush) that I couldn’t persuade him to have another.  
Marginal increases in accuracy aren’t worth engendering permanent distrust of the medical system.  (Isn’t that a huge reason we can’t get out of this mess?).   Please, let’s not traumatize anyone. They won’t trust us and they won’t come back."
2021-11-18 14:48,We do rapid nasal swabs in my clinic if you come in within 3 days of symptoms. Go in early if you have symptoms and reserve the nasopharyngeal swabs for pre-procedure.
2021-11-18 14:45,"Call me a baby, but until I am guaranteed of the least invasive swab test my future travel plans will be limited to the US…hoping other tests become available and/or this will not be necessary after 2022."
2021-11-18 14:49,88% as opposed to 98% accuracy.  I'll go with the less invasive swab to avoid a small wound that is open to infection as we breathe in airborne germ.  Any puncture of the skin leaves you open to infection.  The last swab I received hurt and drops of blood later came out of my nose.
2021-11-18 14:50,"I went blind for several seconds of a painful swab, and have been fortunate not to have another. I can’t help wondering if some real damage can be done in these tests."
2021-11-18 14:49,"On our return trip to the States from Berlin, we had mouth swabs. If one is vaccinated, should be accurate enough."
2021-11-18 14:52,"The number of people who won't test because they fear the process is, I'd bet, highly underestimated. Really need to come up with an actually accurate better way. Surely they could."
2021-11-18 14:53,"We need tests that people are willing to take. Lots of folks, myself included, are not willing to take the deep nasal tests. I had one painful one and after that, I decided no more. When I needed additional tests, I was able to get a saliva test (still PCR). For me the option was either not test or saliva test. I can’t possibly be the only one who feels this way.  A slightly less accurate test is still better than no test."
2021-11-18 15:00,"For the UC Davis health covid test, the norm is to go up both nostrils. I’ve been tested about four times (all negative). I have a deviated septum that is curved (a surgery to correct it failed), so for the first test, only the more accessible nostril was swabbed. For the other tests, I bent my nose straight a minute before each so both nostrils could be swabbed. The techs counted to ten as I manly endured some pain, though I didn’t consider it excruciating."
2021-11-18 15:00,"I went to a Walgreen's a month ago for a self-administered swab and then test. No way was the guy behind the window coaching so as to get the test done right. I did what he said (insert about an inch into the nose; rotate; repeat). No way do I think the negative test result has any meaning.

Worse, this could be a way for Walgreen's to increase revenue? The covid swab test at Walgreen's is painless; come to Walgreen's for it?

I think this article needs more elaboration on ""testing"" practices, if said practices are even really covid tests."
2021-11-18 15:00,"The question is not how far the swab must go up our nostril, but why we have to be subjected to the nasal test at all. We just returned from Baja, and an oral swab held in the mouth until saturated provided results within minutes via antigen testing. Try to find a rapid at-home test here to make holiday visits safer: all the pharmacies are still on backorder. The US, with its siloed and profit-driven medical industry, is a public health backwater."
2021-11-18 15:02,Long overdue story. Thanks.
2021-11-18 15:14,"In Germany, we had to get tested before returning home and when I tilted  my head back for the nasal swab, the tech laughed and said they don't do swabs up the nose there. Instead, she swabbed the back of my throat. It was definitely easier than the nasal swab I have had in the states. Are there studies on the efficacy of these easier tests?"
2021-11-18 15:08,"As with most things, technology will figure this out and nasty swabs from future pandemics will be much more tolerable."
2021-11-18 15:21,Just reading this makes me recoil (I've had four tests).
2021-11-18 15:35,"I have been using Abbot’s BinaxNOW test. A swab is twirled 15 times around the inside of each nostril. The twirling causes my nose to produce quite a lot of secretion. One test is not as accurate as the deep one administered at testing centers but I am willing to do it often and the results are available in 15 minutes. Granted, I have access to the test. We need much more testing in order to manage and get out of this pandemic. The rapid tests need to be available and used often. The children in our Danish family took rapid saliva tests every day before entering school last year which allowed the schools to continue functioning."
2021-11-18 15:43,"The simple answer here is ""no.""  That was the standard early on, when the first Covid tests were being administered.  But medicine has gone beyond that and it is no longer necessary to push the swab practically behind the eye.  It can be placed just at the upper part of the visible nostril, turned once or twice, and one can now get accurate results in 8-10 minutes instead of 1-4 days."
2021-11-18 15:47,"Since the shallow swabs are 82-88% effective in comparison to the 98% effectiveness for the deep swabs, why discourage more people from getting tested because of the discomfort due to the deep swabs? If one takes account a margin of error of 5% -- which is reasonable-- the differences are not significant."
2021-11-18 15:47,"I had what I suspected was a sinus infection this past August but was first tested to “rule out” COVID. I had a nasal swab and my immediate reaction was, “THAT’S it??” because it didn’t feel like anything that I had read-the painful, it’s surely “touching my brain” accounts. It was negative for COVID. I had a sinus infection."
2021-11-18 16:10,"Years ago, I had a deep swab test to make sure that a persistent cough was not pertussis.  It was extremely uncomfortable, but not really painful, and was over in about 15 seconds."
2021-11-18 16:10,"I have five tests. The first was fine, the following 4 were miserable. I am now doing antigen tests and it's a walk in the park.

2021-11-18 16:20,"I had to get a covid test before out patient surgery.  I was required to get it at the same facility. They only offered the back of my throat swab, which makes me gag and cry with hysteria from the anxiety.  I have issues at the dentist but they know I have a strong gag reflex.

I haven’t cried otherwise in a decade.  No problem with blood draws in the arm.

They need to come up with another approach or I’m never getting tested again."
2021-11-18 16:26,"Seriously, who is taking Covid tests anymore, if it wasn’t for this newspaper, I wouldn’t even hear that word anymore here in Miami……

2021-11-18 16:23,"The nasal swab test is so painful for me that I have made an effort to minimize my need to be tested- I have been left with headaches and nosebleeds and sharp, stabbing pain with every test I've had."
2021-11-18 16:27,"I had the deep nasal swab last spring before an operation.  It was disgusting and painful.  What's more, after it, when my eyes were watering and my nose running, I asked for some tissues, I was given none."
2021-11-18 16:09,"All this talk about swabs and no mention of saliva which is simple and painless to collect, requires no special training to administer, and is as sensitive as NP swabs.

2021-11-18 16:12,I have not had a covid test yet because I have been doing everything in my power to avoid getting exposed!  And I'm not changing my habits for the foreseeable future.  Hoping my luck holds!
2021-11-18 16:13,"I'm an ENT doc. The common mistake that I see is that the swab is angled up too high and not getting back to the nasopharynx. The swab should be aimed straight back at a plane level with your earlobe. Angling any higher than this will encounter tender and delicate parts of your nasal cavity called the Middle turbinate. Every time I see a news report of someone being swabed, the swab angle is not even close to correct."
2021-11-18 16:23,"Yes the nasopharyngeal swab is unnecessarily painful. It needs to be done correctly or not done at all. It felt to me like snorting wasabi both times I had it. Both times were in drive up settings.
In clinical settings I've had antigen tests. They are quick and painless and you get peace of mind in 20 minutes, but they are not accepted for employment purposes.
At this stage of the game where I live, I feel like Covid testing is unnecessary unless there's fever or loss of taste or smell or the person just wants that peace of mind."
2021-11-18 16:08,I had the test done twice at Mass General Hospital and I swear the tech was a sadist who took pleasure in hurting people.  This experience was so bad I will avoid any testing unless mandated. The test process discourages many from being tested.
2021-11-18 16:49,When I was tested prior to cataract surgery in 2020 I was sure that it was in error and I was undergoing a transphenoidal hypophysectomy and they were treating me for the wrong procedure.  If I were given the choice between being tested weekly or getting vaccinated I would definitely choose vaccination. But I had already chosen vaccination instead of even considering such a choice.
2021-11-18 16:55,"If a deeper swab is done, much depends on the skill of the technician.  There's a reason ENT's numb you up before they insert their scopes, as we have variations in our nasal pharyngeal plumbing.   Summer of 2020 my husband had to lock down quarantine upon arrival in Italy for 2 weeks, then the provincial health ministry sent an ambulance to test him in the field behind the house.   It was a deep PCR with throat swab high up behind the uvula, which nearly made him throw up, typical of what Italy and many countries were doing that first year of the pandemic.  Summer of 2021 I was able to get a self swab antigen at CVS prior to departure for Italy, then stood in line for 2 hours at Fiumicino to get our rapid tests for entry.  There were 11 stations in full view and I chose the one nurse that wasn't swabbing furiously like it was a clogged toilet.  He was skilled and I didn't feel a thing.  Before returning to the US we went to the local pharmacy for our quick tests and the pharmacist struggled with my deviated septum.  It was uncomfortable and my nose stung for 15 minutes.  This month in the US I had to get tested 2-3 times a week for a month for a job and we were able to do self swabs.   It was pain-free and quick.  If you want people to get tested you have to make the tests comfortable.  Reserve the deep nasal pharyngeal PCR tests for those who have symptoms or are sick.  Do the 10 min self swab tests for the general public."
2021-11-18 17:02,"I am tested regularly with a PCR test that uses saliva. It is easy, convenient and accurate. Why aren’t these more widely available?"
2021-11-18 17:08,"Could the authors of this interesting article please do a follow-up on all current possible alternatives to the ‘nasal swab’, and how effective each is (ie saliva or spit tests, etc). The idea of this nasal swab test just horrifies me, and I, and I think many people, would be interested in hearing about other options and alternatives! Thank you."
2021-11-18 17:20,"I avoid all that discomfort by just saying I got tested and was negative, without doing the actual test.

Ha, just kidding!  I think I've been getting the anterior nares most of the time, once at home, and that's bad enough, uncomfortable and with sensations that last about half an hour.  Had a nasopharyngeal one or two early on, and thankfully I must have had a great nurse, because it didn't have lasting effects.

Overall it's better to experience some temporary pain and discomfort than not to know whether I've got covid and can transmit it to others.  But it'll be nicer when the tests evolve to a faster, easier method like a cheek swabbing."
2021-11-18 16:45,"I had to laugh reading this article. How did we become such pampered wimps? Women give birth in excruciating pain but I bet no one would complain if an article was written about it. These reactions are so similar to mask wearing whining: my ears hurt, can't breathe, etc. This disease called almost 700,000 people here in our country, many in great pain. People are living with debilitating outcomes of long covid, and we can't stand a swab up our nose? I had several swabs due to possible exposure, and sure it was quite unpleasant but it was a blip of discomfort long forgotten."
2021-11-18 16:47,"I'm pretty sure the poor nurse who tested me had been punched. The first thing she told me was to ""please sit on your hands""."
2021-11-18 16:48,"My god, it’s a 5-second ordeal. 

Crunching sounds? Left in shock? What is with these hysterical people?"
2021-11-18 17:16,"The ""gold standard"" is a saliva test.  That's good enough for a screening test."
2021-11-18 17:19,"About the soccer player who said he's endured worse pain, ""I am a man"": let me know when you give birth, buddy."
2021-11-18 17:20,The last test I had I was told to blow my nose. I was informed doing so would drop (the possible) covid cells down and therefore no need for a deep swab. It was painless.
2021-11-18 16:56,"When i had a test at Walgreen’s, i did the swabbing myself, as did everyone else there."
2021-11-18 17:04,"Like JD from Portland, I had the gargle test and it was so much easier. Grandsons had it too, as long as they could learn to gargle. Wonder why the article did not mention this test?"
2021-11-18 16:34,"Somewhat painful at times but a necessary procedure.

I prefer the deep end to make absolutely sure, I've gotten the best sample getting the best accurate results.

There have been some Techs that seem to enjoy seeing the pain, others so gentle, that tells me it can be done thoroughly without inflicting pain.

After a slight nose bleed, ive advised all please be gentle not responsible (then i laugh). Something to thing about. No gold down there. The look on their face alone is worth sitting.

Be gentle please no one want's to take this test, try to at least pretend your concern with our discomfort.

To all the Gentle Techs thank you so much."
2021-11-18 16:40,"I've had it done twice. The first time I didn't know what to expect, and the woman who did it inserted the swab quickly and deeply. I was caught off guard and tears soon flowed. The second time I had id done, I asked the man to do it slowly and gently. He did. I was happy. We need to use our words."
2021-11-18 16:42,"As with many medical procedures, there is a right way and a wrong way, in addition, a 'caring attitude' by the practitioner is so important.  Doing any procedure quickly often causes unnecessary discomfort.  When care and time is taken patients are more comfortable, more trusting and go away without pain or fear.  Slow down testers!!  I know this because I am an RN."
2021-11-18 16:45,The PCR test I took for a trip overseas in September was a saliva test. I just drooled into a vial and handed this to the staff. Quick and painless experience. Not sure why this method of testing isn't more widely available.
2021-11-18 17:54,"On the hospital unit I work in, I am required to administer nasopharyngeal COVID tests to all admission patients and non vaccinated partners of those patients. 
I’ve always felt that there is a Karmic energy to all we as healthcare providers do.  I test people as I would prefer to be tested.  I am as gentle as possible, and place the swab in the nares carefully. I measure the distance between the nares and throat with tip of the swab prior to testing and hold the swab with my gloved fingers at that point.  If I meet any resistance at insertion, I start over.  If it slides in easily, I put it in as far as measured and then draw it out quickly while rotating the swab.  My preference is to do it quickly and gently.  Fortunately, we are required to test only one nostril. 

The tests I have administered have had both positive and negative test results, so I believe I do them with good, accurate technique.  Patients have told me it’s not too bad.  I’ve only had one person tear up.  I hope I’m always treated as carefully as I try to treat my patients."
2021-11-18 18:13,"Many standard medical practices are painful or seriously uncomfortable. Most staff don't remotely care. Some are actively aggressive, seemingly trying to make the test or treatment worse. And we wonder why a significant number of people decline medical care as long as they can possibly put it off."
2021-11-18 18:18,"I have had these tests multiple times in the US, in Spain, in Sweden and (once) in Denmark.  The self-administered one in a drug store in the US is clearly the least painful.  I did follow the instructions as to how deep to go.  In Sweden they hit the back wall and kept spinning the swab for 10 seconds in each nostril, which was the worst.  Spain and Denmark were somewhere in between.  The one “trick” I use is to mention that I’m fully-vaccinated, recovered from Covid last year and that I’m very sensitive to there tests.  After that, I tend to get a gentler test."
2021-11-18 18:44,"The testing I had done was fine - the tech was gentle, told me everything he was going to do and when, and while it wasn't comfortable, it certainly didn't hurt, and it didn't last very long. Given what I'd heard beforehand, I was pleasantly surprised."
2021-11-18 17:39,"When I got my first COVID test with a swab, I sneezed so hard onto the nurse (in full hazmat suit, shield), that she went to change.
It would be helpful if people were told that they'll probably sneeze."
2021-11-18 17:45,"To the people who are bothered by the idea of having a Q-tip shoved up your nose, while it's being done close your eyes  and imagine what it would be like having a breathing tube shoved down your throat. That will help you get through it."
2021-11-18 18:05,Ya all need to grow up and do what’s needed to fight this virus and keep others from dying of being very sick.
2021-11-18 18:06,"Many universities, including the one where I teach, have developed saliva tests that are as accurate as nasopharyngeal pcr tests. In Israel they do a mid-turbinate plus cheek swab. In Germany, I think, children are tested with lollipops for saliva. Why can't this be the norm?"
2021-11-18 18:16,"When we took our first vacation in two years, we had gentle tests leading up to travel and I thought, ""wow, Americans are a bunch of whiners. This isn't bad at all!""

Then we got tested in Europe. Ow. It did call into question the accuracy / thoroughness of the American tests and this article confirms my worries about accuracy."
2021-11-18 18:17,"The Yale-developed saliva test is used around the world. Why didn't the article include its effectiveness? I doubt it is much less accurate than the nasopharyngeal tests, shallow or deep.  Spitting is a lot easier than having anything shoved up your nose.  Lots of literature to show that spitting is as or more accurate, including from the Beth Israel Deaconess in Boston

2021-11-18 17:25,"I've experienced a large number of antral irrigations and can attest to the intense discomfort that's possible when something is placed deep into the nasal cavity. Fortunately, I haven't had to have a swab for covid; being able to stay home all the time has at least had that advantage."
2021-11-18 17:33,Mine felt like a wasp sting to my brain.  Fortunately over quickly.  Tough times call for tough measures.
2021-11-18 18:19,I've been tested twice. They swabbed the inside of both cheeks and then both nostrils. The nostril swabs didn't feel deep and the process was painless.
2021-11-18 18:27,"The first test I had last year was one of the deep ones. Upon completion, I thought that's the closest I'll ever get to being waterboarded. Which is banned in the US."
2021-11-18 17:50,"The one time I had it done, the tech jam,Ed it in really hard and I recoiled. So he did it twice more.  Still hurt 3 days later."
2021-11-18 18:57,"Here is a non-traumatic version of the swab test someone should try to use:
Allow the subject to hold the swab - encourage them to insert it as deeply into one nostril as they comfortably can.
Have them press closed the opposite nostril--tightly.
First inhale....then forcefully exhale...so the swab is bathed fully by the contents of the upper respiratory system--this will include  any Covid viral particles. Give the swab a twirl to pick up additional material.  This can be done even with a mask still in place!! 
Let the subject remove the swab and hand it to the medical staff or place it directly into a covered container for analysis."
2021-11-18 19:04,"I travel for work and I have had 17 covid tests so far in many different countries.  The worst were El Savador and Pasteur Institute of Uruguay, but at ATG of Uruguay it wasn’t so bad. The best was Spain but the second trip to Spain I took the swab at another place and it wasn’t so good. I hope the WHO gives recommendations so that everyone will do it in the least painful and uncomfortable manner."
2021-11-18 19:43,"I have not yet been required to undergo a COVID test, but I can relate to those who have.  Growing up in a very dry, desert environment, I often developed nosebleeds.  I dreaded my mother dragging me into the doctor to have the inside of both nostrils chemically cauterized.  To this day, all I have to do is see one of those long swabs in a doctor's office and I freak out.  I can't imagine anyone choosing to do this on a weekly basis over getting a vaccination."
2021-11-18 18:57,"For vaccinated people with no symptoms and no known exposure, we should stop testing."
2021-11-18 19:25,"I'm just grateful that we have Covid testing !! Sadly, it can be painful. But think about this...if Covid-19 were a disease that caused facial disfigurement as in smallpox, the line for testing would be a 24hr ordeal !! Masks would be worn without hesitation and social distancing would be the norm. 

 Covid's effects are mainly internal. People feel terrible and look under the weather, and if symptoms become worse, do require hospitalization. However, as long as there are no pox marks or lumps or peeling skin or the possibility of looking like Quasimodo...there will be people that will never take this disease seriously.

 You know, if the narcissistic previous guy thought he'd become hideously disfigured because of Covid, we would have had  mask mandates and other mitigation strategies would have become part of our norm a long time ago..."
2021-11-18 20:57,"Retired respiratory therapist here. For those of you who found the nasal swab experience traumatic take heart, it could have been worse.  You are after all an adult who understands what’s happening to you.  

Imagine you’re a toddler. You’re ill; hot and feverish, working hard to breathe, scared of all the strange people and bright lights in the ER. Nasal swabs may not be diagnostic for a dehydrated infant or small child. So, first a little saline solution is squirted in each nostril and then a suction catheter is inserted up the nasal cavity and down the back of your throat￼.  As the catheter is withdrawn, intermittent suction is applied to obtain a diagnostic sample of secretions.  Of course while all this is happening one parent is holding your hands and torso down while the other keeps your head immobile.  All in all, an extremely unpleasant 10 seconds — but absolutely necessary to effectively identify and treat your illness.￼

So always remember, it could be worse... it could be raining."
2021-11-18 22:16,If the world can make this much progress in vaccine availability in one year then it’s time to create better tests. It’s never made much sense  the virus is everywhere and all around us but can only be detected by jamming something so far up our nose.
2021-11-18 22:22,"I've had two tests and the first time, it was like a quick jab that didn't seem to go very deep and the second was a more prolonged shallow twirl. Both results were negative. While neither was particularly painful, the point of each test was to figure out whether I had covid and thus was a danger to anyone else, so it was a little unsatisfying to feel like the samples might not actually have collected much of anything to test. (Flu and strep also negs!) Isn't a more accurate result worth a bit more discomfort? Perhaps as others have commented, the nasal swab is really not the best way to go and we need to focus on other collection mechanisms?"
2021-11-18 21:40,"It is correct that these deep nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs provide better detection of COVID-19 than nose swabs.  However, we have shown that COVID-19 testing of saliva is equivalent to tests of NP swabs as we published in the Journal of Medical Microbiology. (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34486972"" target=""_blank"">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34486972</a>/). Saliva is easy to obtain and certainly more comfortable to provide, and we believe that it should be a standard test sample.  Although we only demonstrated equivalent performance using one specific commercial test, our results are very likely to be applicable to others once validated through comparative studies.  Full disclosure - my independent laboratory at Rutgers University receives research support and licensing fees from the company that provided tests for this study."
2021-11-18 17:28,"Where I live in a red state, the local health dept people just swab around the entrance of the nostril, barely penetrating at all. I doubt that that is accurate. 

I wouldn't be surprised if this were a political decision to keep official infection rates lower. This is Tennessee, where they fired the health dept director for promoting vaccines to teens."
2021-11-18 23:01,"I never expected, at this point in my life, to have a strong preference one way or another about taking a COVID test - saliva testing is in some ways easier, but nasopharyngeal swabs get the results much faster. And yes, I'm vaxxed and boosted, but I have still needed to test before, say, a dental appointment."
2021-11-19 0:06,This is why I'm skeptical that the at-home rapid tests can possible be accurate -- most people aren't going to stick the swab up as far as it should go. Are these at-home tests really reliable?
2021-11-19 1:09,No test is effective if people won’t do it. Surely it is long past time to develop a better way to test for this thing.
2021-11-19 4:52,The tests have been extremely painful and sometimes bloody for everyone I know.  I have not had one and never will; I refuse to even go visit family in Canada until these are not required. I'm fully vaccinated.
2021-11-27 18:35,"At this point, it’s pointless to complain about blaming mitigation efforts as being political, aside from the facts that they likely only delay the inevitable. However, vaccine inequity will contribute to further worldwide transmission - and, thus- evolution of future variants of concern."
2021-11-27 18:37,"""He said it was a reflection of a lack of political and economic power that southern Africa was so quickly cut off by wealthy countries despite the uncertain evidence.""

You take action because of the uncertainty.  Time and time again it was delays due to lack of certainty that led to increased transmission and deaths (remember masks and aerosol transmission?).   

I wish that the rationale for the travel bans was better communicated -- is this intended to be a temporary measure just to assess the situation?   To buy time?  If so, how long will these be kept up?   After a few weeks I imagine that travel bans will not do much good."
2021-11-27 18:41,"I doubt many countries would have taken the same steps against the US had this been where the variant had first been detected, especially with so little data available. 
HK has stringent quarantine measures and actually detected this variant in a recent case still in quarantine. Still in quarantine! But that hasn't stopped some countries from banning arrivals from HK. We are actually one the few safest places in the world and have kept Covid out. More than can be said for those who have closed their doors but then are unwilling to take the other steps that are necessary to stop the spread. Is this a failed species or what?"
2021-11-27 18:48,"It doesn’t seem like supply was really the issue, so the hoarding narrative seems unfair. Many countries in Africa were actually turning away vaccines from more developed nations. I think many countries in Africa need to do their due diligence educating the people with the risks to move forward."
2021-11-27 18:51,"I find it curious that South Africa had sequenced this variant and was forthright in giving the data to the rest of the world.
Right now we are going into the unknown as to whether this variant will fizzle out or become a dominant strain.

It is also curious that our previous president did everything to downplay the threat and and was opaque as to making our data available in this country no less the rest of the world."
2021-11-27 18:29,"Border closures are pointless.  There is no doubt that this variant is already here.  And the closures only encourage people to sneak around them ensuring we have even less visibility.  

This horse is out of the barn.  Better for us to focus on getting the world vaccinated.  Time for the Biden administration to start exporting the vaccine to others who will use them."
2021-11-27 18:40,"I understand bans. However, I see no usefulness in the blame."
2021-11-27 18:45,"Travel bans are only a delay tactic, as we learned when this whole mess started. 

The lack of help by richer countries towards Africa has simply turned that continent into a huge Petri dish, where the virus is free to spread and mutate. Thinking that any country can unilaterally vaccinate its way out of this while ignoring what happens outside its borders is ludicrous."
2021-11-27 18:35,It is pretty ridiculous that here in the United States and in other rich countries we are already doing boosters for everyone when most of the developing world has yet to receive even one shot.  Variants won’t stop developing- and posing a threat to rich countries- until the virus is contained worldwide through vaccination.
2021-11-27 18:38,"I am grateful to the scientists in South Africa who raised the alarm and brought this to our attention. Now we have a responsibility to do the right thing and support them. And ensure that ALL have access to Covid vaccines. If there ever were a demonstration that we’re all in this together, this is it."
2021-11-27 18:57,"I think the attitude of Western Countries...in particular, the USA, can be summed up in the example of the spin class teacher, Stacey Griffith, who cut in line to get her initial vaccine last February under the guise of being an ""educator"".    The West has ignored the plight of the developing world at it's own risk...and of the 5 current Variations of Concern, 4 have originated in the developing world...2 are specific to Southern Africa.

These at risk communities have been largely ignored and left to fend for themselves...while the West has promulgated a large measure of the anti-vaccine propaganda that has spread far and wide.

The wealthy world needs to the be the leader to attacking these variants at the source...which are at risk, poor communities in the developing world...cutting them off after the variants have already spread is ineffective."
2021-11-27 19:00,"Time and again scientists and public health specialists warn us of the dire consequences of inaction or delayed action and we ignore them at our peril. Worse, they are increasingly demonized for sharing research-based information and recommendations, as are public officials following their guidelines. For over a year we have heard that vaccine inequity would likely lead to new variants that would lead to the suffering of far too many in the developing world and increased risk of an extended pandemic in wealthier countries. For decades we have been warned of the environmental consequences of man made climate change. We have the global wealth and technological knowledge to distribute resources equitably and address the climate crisis. We need to find the will to change our systems to make it so."
2021-11-27 18:38,Our inability to work together is bringing us to our end.
2021-11-27 18:28,"Closing international borders won't work so closing our own personal borders is all we have. Wash hands, mask where indicated and vaccine.  Stay safe."
2021-11-27 18:47,Not all of the west has been boarding vaccines. Don't blame all of the west.
2021-11-27 18:29,"It’s unconscionable and stupid that we haven’t helped vaccinate the rest of the world. But we should also tighten the travel bans. And send out the darn vaccines. 

But if there’s one thing we know about this mutation, it’s that we know nothing. I rely on trustworthy media to stay j formed. But even the most reliable media are loving the site hits that come from stirring up fear. 

Stay calm. Keep masking, get your booster and keep on keeping’ on. Most of us will be just fine. Isn’t that always the case?"
2021-11-27 18:34,"Another round of fear, another round of xenophobic “solutions.”

If you want to save lives, give your money. Fight for socialized medicine and food and housing. 

Fear of this virus over things that kill many times as many people is turning into the most bourgeois of concerns at this point. Global hunger has DOUBLED from our pandemic response. We’re taking hundreds of millions.  

The solution to these other things just involves  people parting with their money, so we don’t talk about that."
2021-11-27 18:34,Quite strange that they are criticizing “vaccine hoarding” considering just a few days ago￼ they were turning away doses because they couldn’t use them fast enough. ￼
2021-11-27 18:40,"Hoarding vaccines? They were developed in those nations with the primary purpose of treating their own population. If the nations creating these vaccines crash because they give it all away to nonproducing nations, then it all crashes. Maybe the African nations should look at why they are perpetually struggling. Systematic corruption that prevents working infrastructure is a place to start. Can't give aid to these corruption meccas, the real people never see the help."
2021-11-27 18:42,The people who invent the vaccines should be the first ones to get them.
2021-11-27 18:45,"Why are Africans being blamed? 

If the wealthiest nations could get their act together and coordinate an actual, credible global response to this pandemic -- ie, subsidizing and distributing global vaccinations --  this wouldn't be an issue. If they had done a year ago we could have avoided so many deaths and so much misery from Delta.

Instead, the pandemic was politicized by bad actors such as Bolsonaro and Trump, everyone tried to assign ""blame"" instead of solve the actual probelm, nations pursued separate health policies that undercut an effective global response, and pharma companies were encouraged to maximize profits instead of simply saving lives.  

We need to do better moving forward, including right now, this instant, with Omicron. 

GIVE the best vaccines to the developing world, and nip this in the bud."
2021-11-27 19:03,"First of all: it is simply wrong to write that European states already have a travel ban against travelers from some southern African states! Better check the facts! Europe has no clear united policy. In Germany for instance travelers form southern African states are still allowed to enter Germany only facing a moderate risk to get quarantined if tested positive. However, the problem is, that you get usually informed only 2 weeks following a contact with an infected person, so that you hardly can argue that this would be something of a good Disease Control Management. The first cases of the variant are already in registered in several states of Europe (Belgium, Netherlands and Germany). Acknowledging the foregoing: As we have seen at back then in 2020, the people did not travel directly from China but mostly via Europe! So, is there any good argument for making travel restrictions / travel ban against African countries without having the same against Europe? Don’t make same mistakes twice!"
2021-11-27 18:53,"As I am reading about the chaos that was created after the discovery of the omicron variant, and the nightmare of having to wait in the tarmac to be tested and all the agony of  going through so much, I was thinking to myself that there is little or no point in traveling nowadays, holidays or not. Just stay home and be happy with who is around you. If you have no one, get a pet. They offer unconditional love, warmth and company."
2021-11-27 18:54,We need to apply blanket bans to countries that include american citizens and permanent residents. If they are allowed to come back to the US they can bring the virus with them even if they are quarantined. President Biden should give them 48 hours to make their way to the US or face being stuck in those countries. We also need to flood Africa with vaccines so they can immunize the population as they always need west's support. I do love the irony that Africa is talking about vaccine sharing but I am wondering what they would have done if the situation was reversed would they have shared against their nemesis (the west)?
2021-11-27 18:58,As long as  wealthy countries  can  pretend care in poor  countries  isn't the  first  line of  defense  against the mutation and  spread of  viruses we will relive our  failures  and  cruelties.
2021-11-27 19:01,"One thing that's very clear to us in developing nations, nobody cares unless there is money in it. All those speeches and declarations and summits are just that. When the rubber meets the road everyone only cares about themselves and their voters, even if they can only lie to these people.
It's becoming increasingly clear that travel bans mean nothing where borders are simply man made demarcations of places, and by themselves cannot help if other aspects of prevention aren't followed.
Meanwhile I'm waiting for someone to answer the million dollar question of why the virus seems to largely spare Africans in terms of spread and outcomes. Even at our highest levels some countries barely even got to 100 cases daily. Could there be something we are missing. I hope so, I hope it's something that will make someone in the developed countries realize that everyone has something to bring to the table..."
2021-11-27 19:01,"“Other African countries where shortages have eased are also reporting difficulties getting vaccines into people’s arms. Many lack the necessary freezers and other storage capacity. Last month, Uganda warned that two-thirds of the 9 million vaccines it had received risked expiring by the end of the year.”

So two-thirds of what was donated to them in this case will simply expire because they can’t get them into arms. I suppose that’s our fault, too? The USA has donated more vaccine doses than any other nation already."
2021-11-27 19:03,"Condemning other countries for not sending you doses when you have doses you can't distribute (because people don't want them, among other reasons) is a bit rich , don't you think?"
2021-11-27 19:00,"We know that omicron was first reported from South Africa—but that’s because South Africa has the technology to detect and study coronaviruses. How do we know for sure that omicron did not merely travel to Southern Africa, and instead originated from other countries that are not on travel bans simply because they are not as equipped to detect and study new strains?"
2021-11-27 19:08,"This is definitely a situation where all sides are actually right. Yes, this situation has been caused vaccines not being distributed to Africa. However that doesn't mean that countries don't need to protect their citizens now it has happened.

Hopefully this will be a wake up call and vaccines will be distributed more widely."
2021-11-27 19:10,Part of the problem with getting the vaccine to poorer nations is the lack of infrastructure to deliver shots to arms. It’s complicated. And imagine the outcry if countries didn’t at least temporarily suspend border crossings. The US travelers are often not welcome due to our high Covid rates.
2021-11-27 19:04,"On the one hand, there is gross vaccine inequality the world over between rich and poor nations, contributing to the high likelihood of ever new mutations of Covid. On the other, another contributing factor to ever more pernicious Covid mutations is that about a quarter of the adult population in the developed world refuses to get vaccinated, though they have access to the best vaccines in the world -- this despite the overwhelming preponderance of evidence that doing so is perfectly safe and is the most effective means to prevent its spreading and mutating. Boggles the mind that those adults in wealthy nations in a position to stem the virus refuse to do so."
2021-11-27 19:06,"Almost every organized social unit (nations, political organizations, corporations, schools, teams, etc., etc., etc., will take care of (and try to protect) what it perceives as it's ""members"" before it takes care of ""outsiders"". This behavior is very deeply established in groups of primates (of which we humans are one). As the seriousness of the threat grows, the stronger is this response. Without making any moral judgements, this is the way we've been ""wired"" by millions of years of evolution, and it will not disappear anytime soon."
2021-11-27 19:08,I believe that restricting travel will slow the growth of the number of infected people.  We need time to evaluate the threat and determine scientifically sound responses to the threat.
2021-11-27 19:11,"While it is true and appalling that in November 2021 less than 30% of people in South Africa are fully vaccinated, Americans are in no position to lecture the world about vaccine ""hesitancy"" (i.e., hostility toward science) when there are still more than a hundred million people in the US who remain unvaccinated. 

Africans from, say, Uganda or Zimbabwe can blame limited access to Covid vaccines or a lack of storage capacity, what can Americans argue to remain unvaccinated? Twisting the Bible's teachings, conspiracy theories, lack of financial incentives, believing some radio host rather than epidemiologists, disputing about ""side effects"" after more than four billions people have been safely vaccinated, etc.?

Perhaps when the Omicron variant hits here some anti-vaccine radicals will check out from the self-defeating insanity."
2021-11-27 19:11,"No one country is to ‘blame’ for this variant, any more than one geographic region can be ‘blamed’ for the weather. As we witnessed in the last 20 months, the virus emerges, abates, changes its form and location, and wends its way across the world with little regard to borders or politics. Countries should not feel ostracized if they are targeted; it’s a mitigation effort. Sooner or later we all might be cut off from everyone else. We can walk on the moon and carry potent computers in our back pockets, but a microscopic virus can bring us to our knees.

Maybe we need divine intervention. Clearly this is getting out of our control."
2021-11-27 19:12,"Scientists insist there is much we do not know about omicron. How is everyone already certain it originated in South Africa or anywhere else in Africa?

Regardless, whatever omicron is, it seems fairly clear that it's already making the global rounds. As long as the right-wing media is obsessed with the fact that WHO skipped the letter ""Xi"" in its naming process, perhaps the rest of the media can work at this early stage to re-focus the story on the virus itself and away from the country where the scientists who identified it happened to be working."
2021-11-27 19:13,"“For now, South Africa has far more vaccine doses than it can distribute in time, forcing senior health officials to defer some planned deliveries.”

I think the “hoarding” narrative is misconstrued. The United States has donated hundred  of millions of doses, billions of dollars and President Biden has even went so far to suggest making the vaccine patents public.

The real issue is decayed public health infrastructure in much of the world that prevents quick disbursement of vaccines and a lack of education (a problem the West is struggling with also).

I think blaming the West is a cop-out to the nuanced realities of the situation."
2021-11-27 19:18,"Last time we did a travel ban only for China, COVID had already reached NYC from Europe. It’s already too late to stop the new variant from reaching the US if we only ban the countries that it originated from.  We already know this variant has reached Europe, so we should ban European travel as well if we are going to do a ban. Maybe the economic pain will encourage western countries to distribute the vaccine to more developing nations. Pharmaceutical companies and Western governments are not allowing some of these countries that are technologically capable to produce COVID vaccines either. The selfishness of the West is going to hurt us all in the long run."
2021-11-27 19:25,"I will only speak for this country, the one I was born in, raised in, and work in. The most important work being done during this pandemic has been by people unaffiliated and unimpeded by political and capitalist ideologies. Those are the voices who warned against pitting humans against each other. Against closing borders. Against confusing messages about the benefits of ongoing masking and vaccinations. Our annoited leaders never took into account this poor messaging regardless of the emerging variants and the misinformed people contributing to them. We are not an island unto ourselves notwithstanding all the ists' that control and contribute largely to the ongoing public health chaos. In its failure to lead all residents of the world, including ours, the Trump and Biden govts. , are complicit in the failure to lead us out of the pandemic. The US always wants to be seen as the world's leading force only when it's convenient to the few and to its capitalistic first message. They should accept the criticism of the African nations, who despite their poverty and lack of accessibility, in no small part to the US, have a better transparent disease tracking system than we do. We should learn from history that has taught us that inclusivity and equity are the best pillars to uplift us in society."
2021-11-27 19:26,"What is happening now is the result of lies that muddied the waters and protests that brought thousands together in maskless confrontations. 

In brighter days we would be sending help from a nation that would have been more whole and helpful. Instead, we are broken, not unified in our own response.

Shutting the boarders as a temporary measure seems like one portion of a solution. One portion, not the whole plan."
2021-11-27 19:27,"This piece seems highly biased and politicized to me. Containment is huge and always has been in combatting contagious illness.  The article itself reports thousands of cases in Southern Africa and lots of unknowns on transmission. Restricting travel is the clear prudent course. 

Conflating this issue with vaccine distribution only confuses the issue, and leads to increasing polarization and distrust of the news we get."
2021-11-27 19:31,"In six months people will be talking about how much we have learned and grown and that this will not happen again. Maybe the FED should raise interest rates after we beat the virus that time too. Will gas prices be higher after this variant and will workers be harder to find again? What a luxury compared to wondering if this virus variant is a civilization ender. 

Vaccine and mask mandates are the only way to slow the spread and the pressure to use them must be maintained until the world is vaccinated."
2021-11-27 19:38,"Look at the third picture.
The nose of the person on the right is not covered by the mask.

Look at the seventh picture.
The nose of the young girl is not covered by the mask

People who wear the mask that way might as well not wear it.

Hasten to add, I see the same in this country, too."
2021-11-27 19:40,Excellent article.  This article touches all the areas of concern.  Thank you.
2021-11-27 19:41,"As long as there is no vaccine which (also) strongly reduces the transmission of the virus, there will always emerge new variants somewhere. Blaming a country does not help.

We need second generation vaccine development initiatives, this time state-controlled and open-sourced, so that the new vaccines can be produced and distributed world wide efficiently."
2021-11-27 19:43,"Travel bans work.

Yes, the Omicron variant might already be in a given country that imposes the travel ban, but the spread would be multiplied with the arrival of travelers who have a high infection rate."
2021-11-27 19:44,"so...mandate? So that antivaxxers around the world can't point to us and say that even we, who came up with the vaccine, aren't getting vaccinated? So that, if we are fortunate enough that the vaccine will work on this or if the variant isn't as contagious as the delta or the original strain, we can get people vaccinated and minimize the chances that these super contagious strains will pop up? I really don't want to find out if we are going to lose 1 percent or so of our population every time a variant like this one pops up, which is looking like every year or two even with the measures that we have taken to prevent the original strain and the delta from sweeping over us all."
2021-11-27 19:45,"It is not at all clear that travel bans make sense.  Some times they probably are a good idea, but many times not so much.

Travel bans only make sense when they are imposed by a country without a new variant, directed towards travel from a country that is experiencing the new variant.  Once the virus has spread, it's pretty much too late.

This was certainly also true for interstate bans imposed by many US governors a year or two ago, and still imposed today.  The virus was then, and still is today, present in all 50 states, to the point where interstate travel bans do little if anything to contain the pandemic, and cause serious harm.

The virus is going to be with us for a long time. Vaccines and effective drugs are our best, probably our only, chance at returning to some semblance of normal  

Draconian lockdowns and travel bans probably do more harm than good.  They cause major, long lasting, consequential economic and social harm, and seem to provide little benefit.  Some policies do help, including enforced mandates for masks in many situations, including most indoor gatherings, and many that are held outdoors.

We are at the point were mandatory vaccination, with exemptions limited to medical reasons, should probably be imposed.  This is not an easy call; the possibility of delayed side effects to vaccination still exists.  Given the nature of the pandemic, and the continuing appearance of dangerous variants, this is probably what needs to be done."
2021-11-27 19:47,I’m not sure vaccine hoarding is an issue anymore. There is literally a good supply right now. We need to focus on education and push vaccine mandates.
2021-11-27 19:57,"Variants are going to happen; we've been lucky that the US hasn't created one (that we know of) as the virus raced through places in which politics forged resistance though a large swath of our population to not just masks, vaccines, closures, but to even admitting it was real.

Our goal has to be to get to a point in which we can live with the reality of Covid being a long term, endemic controllable, treatable infection.

Travel bans serve the purpose of understanding where the variant has already spread, and forming a plan to deal with it. It isn't punishment. 

Vaccination of the whole global population - even without resistance - takes time. We don't have first world refrigeration, infrastructure, local shipping, and distribution networks set up to reach a lot of places around the globe. That certainly seems to be a good place to start addressing Global Pandemic 2.0 before it hits."
2021-11-27 19:57,"This article points to a problem that apparently many countries face -- vaccine hesitancy, e.g., South Africa has more vaccine right now than people willing to take the shot.  Other countries have supplies they are unable to use due to lack of infrastructure but also due to  vaccine misinformation. Western countries have not donated enough vaccines, but ithey have provided or supported an abundance of misinformation and conspiracy theories and the technologies to distribute them! 

The world also needs effective ""vaccines"" from the scourge of misinformation, aka education, effective public health messaging, and controls over misinformation on social media and corrupt mass media."
2021-11-27 19:59,"The only thing that can bring the pandemic under control, and allow a return to something resembling normalcy, is effective vaccines and drugs. It now seems likely there will need to be ongoing development of modified vaccines, to insure effectiveness against new variants. This is already the situation with flu vaccines.

For vaccines and drugs to be developed, tested, manufactured and distributed, we need a strong, viable pharmaceutical industry. There are problems with big pharma to be sure, and government oversight is essential.  But all-hands-on-deck efforts by drug companies, academia, and government are vital.

Today, America's drug industry faces a truly existential threat: American trial lawyers. This is a serious issue that must be addressed by Congress. Tens of thousands of multibillion dollar lawsuits are being filed and often won against the companies that are developing treatments and vaccines.

During the the 1970's and '80's vaccines nearly became unavailable in the US due to lawsuits; only a last minute no-fault liability law, the 1986 Childhood Vaccine Injury Act allowed vaccine production in the US to continue.

Today, there is a vaccine against Lyme Disease for dogs, but none for humans. The FDA approved human vaccine was taken off the market in 2002, in large part because of class action lawsuits.

Whatever we may think of the drug industry, we need vaccines and medicines more than we need endless lawsuits.

Congress should pass tort reform."
2021-11-27 20:10,"Speaking specifically to the two flights arriving at Schiphol with a combined 61 people testing positive, I do not understand how anyone was able to board those flights without a negative test this far into the pandemic. I saw some statement from KLM that some passengers were traveling to destinations that didn't require a negative test. I've traveled a little bit during the pandemic and have more travel planned next year and every international destination I've looked into or booked travel to requires a negative test in order to board your flight. Even if it were not required, I would test, not only because it's the right thing to do but because canceling a trip at the last minute is preferable to getting stranded in a foreign country with a positive test. I know the antigen test is not as reliable as the PCR test, so instead of a blanket ban, especially since they only slow the spread of the virus, why not make a PCR test required in order to travel to or from any of the countries facing a ban? If even antigen testing had been required for every single passenger who boarded those two flights, surely many of those who tested positive in Amsterdam would have been weeded out. It seems like there are a lot of holes in the ways the spread of the virus could be tamped down - allowing any  international travel without pre-flight testing, lax mask enforcement on planes, or, in my opinion, even allowing unvaccinated people to travel at all."
2021-11-27 20:13,"Inevitable. There's resistance to vax and mask in Africa too. All over the world. And I imagine that undeveloped places would be less efficient in their public health systems even if people were not resisting. People feel overwhelmed by too many crises at one time. (The pandemic, climate change, the disrupted economy, the problems with China, Russia and terrorism, the domestic political unrest throughout the developed world). All governments need to spread calm. It would be wise to give the top priority to controlling this pandemic - and to go slow on the other problems. It's just too much for people to cope with."
2021-11-27 18:36,"News outlets reported three days ago that South Africa has a glut of vaccines and asked Pfizer and J&J to cancel shipments. They don't have a supply problem, they have a vaccine education and hesitancy problem."
2021-11-27 19:55,"Why would anyone NOT ban flights from the current epicenters of pandemics? Isn’t that common sense? And why is South Africa acting so childishly, threatening not to disclose any future variants to the international community? When public safety is at stake, why are people protesting travel bans? Or do they actually want other countries and people to get infected? What’s this suspicious encouragement of open borders in the middle of a serious pandemic?"
2021-11-27 19:24,"Anyone who has studied any biology knows if there was not a new variant in Africa it could have /would have developed elsewhere. That the Africans were perspicacious enough to recognize and report one-unlike the Chinese,(yes-lets admit it!),
is a series of leaps in all the right directions-mostly towards the West.
 They have a serious point that they are being ""dumped on"" because they did the right thing-like a person being punished for picking up anothers empty and tossing it, being blamed as a litterer.
We certainly can and could do a better job with vaccines than we have-or next outbreak in the ""developed"" world, wherever it comes from,  will anyone  have an interest in third world states to even look for it, or to report it, if it merely cuts them off from everywhere , & does nothing to aid the vaccinations.
WE are shooting ourselves in the foot and then cutting off our leg by doing this kind of discriminatory medicine."
2021-11-27 19:27,"At least for a week or two until we have better understanding. Do not repeat the mistake of NIMBY that was made the first time around ...

Retrict travel everywhere. Strengthen local rules to reduce transmission"
2021-11-27 19:45,"Excuse me, is that right.  600 passengers were left in unventilated rooms and then, if tested negative, released??? How many were infected while in those rooms with however many who did not test negative?"
2021-11-27 19:51,"Let's get serious right away. We've been inundated with COVID for almost 2 years. Dear World, we need to set up an infrastructure of vaccination sites at all international airports before entry. We do not fly unless we're vaccinated.  The choice? You can get your first dose now, right here, or not. Come back in 5 weeks once you've finished your course(s), then you can leave the Country. We have the resources and know how to do this. This is the tech age, 2021, not 1918 when 50,000,000 perished from the Spanish flu. 

Divide and conquer COVID, with readily available resources. Region by region. 

PS: Ignore anti vaxxer static, they want attention they do not deserve in the least bit.

Seek, believe, live in a solution oriented state of mind."
2021-11-27 19:54,"Good Grief.

It is absolutely ridiculous to blame any country for a new Covid variant. 

They are going to pop up wherever they want to.  Viruses mutate.

It is especially pernicious to blame countries with fewer resources to battle the pandemic.  What on earth do you expect them to do?"
2021-11-27 19:28,"Blame and preemption are two different things. I've seen no evidence of blaming,  and to presume otherwise is a paranoid take on this."
2021-11-27 19:47,"The accusations that the West is responsible for the variants because of ""hoarding"" vaccines is absolutely false and fraudulent.

First, it is not ""hoarding"" to use vaccine for Western nations that the West invented and the West manufactured.  

Second, variants do not arise because more people are unvaccinated.  As the Times itself reported a month ago on Oct. 27, 2021 (""Virus Variants Likely Evolved Inside People With Weak Immune Systems""), variants are usually created inside immunocompromised persons, regardless whether they are vaccinated or not.  Furthermore, even in nations with low vaccination rates, the immunocompromised are usually among the first to be vaccinated (after all the politicians and privileged people). But the immunocompromised tend to respond poorly to vaccinations, gaining less protection from infection from them.

The WHO, its western sympathizers, and the third world nations want vaccine denied to Americans so that it can be diverted to third world nations.  They want to sacrifice Americans' health and lives in order to protect the health of those in the third world health.  So they make these false accusations."
2021-11-27 19:59,Why would countries facing aggressive variants not proactively restrict their own travel?
2021-11-27 19:16,"Im not worried about this new variant. Viruses evolve to be more transmissible and less deadly on average over time. Most of the mutations of interest are on the spike protein, i.e. more transmissible. There is nothing here I see that indicates that its more deadly."
2021-11-27 19:33,"How did the term ""variant"" come into use. In the field of virology, new strains are called mutations. Hence, we had the delta mutant.  Calling omicron for what it is, a mutant, would likely scare more people to get vaccinated.

How did the term ""long covid"" arise?  In every other disease in medicine, the term ""chronic"" is used to describe long-term symptoms and/or long-standing disease.

New mutations were being named in sequence with the Greek alphabet. How did we jump to omicron?  What happened to epsilon, theta, mu, etc?"
2021-11-27 20:35,"Maybe I’m naive, but these travel bans seem to be more effective at harming international relations than stopping the spread of new variants. The newest is already in the UK, Hong Kong and surely many other global destinations like my home NYC. Wear a mask in public, get vaccinated, get your boosters. This is not rocket science, but it is science and the science is clear. Masks and vaccines are the most effective way to mitigate the spread of this disease. Most everything else is little more than window dressing."
2021-11-27 20:45,"Closing borders and halting flights is a good measure for slowing transmission of the variant. With 61 infections among 600 passengers on just two flights, thousands of further infections were likely prevented. The thing is, border closures alone are much less effective because many other measures are required, not that they are ineffective or unjustified in themselves. Tourism is hurt? Too bad! Let's not have tourists travel to hot spots then bring the new variant home."
2021-11-27 21:13,What good are travel restrictions when there are so many exceptions?   Anyone can be a carrier yet may not test positive.
2021-11-27 21:13,"The only way to end COVID is to make a vaccine that prevents infection altogether. That’s how small pox and polio were eradicated. As long as we have the current vaccines, this is what will happen: a mutant virus that is resistant to the vaccine will emerge and we will be back to square one. Why? Because the current vaccines don’t prevent infection, they just prevent severe illness, hospitalization and death. So every infection is an opportunity for a new variant to arise. Given enough time, a much worse variant will surely arise. It’s called evolution, the most powerful force in health and disease!!"
2021-11-27 21:32,"There has been insufficient attention given to covid impact on African nations. It's not clear from publicly available data what level of infection may have occurred there. Public reporting has shown very low case and death totals in Africa, which may or may not be accurate given poor infrastructure. Low rates of infection in Africa have been cited since the outset, potentially attributed to average population age being lower than US, or active vaccination efforts for other diseases among younger people. The point is, no one has followed up to find out whether these low rates are accurate, or why.
In fact, 94% of all deaths in the US have been among those over 50 and even now post-Delta it’s still 90%. A younger African population wouldn’t be nearly as susceptible. Unfortunately, asymptomatic/nonfatal illness among such a large, susceptible, unvaccinated population presents the perfect environment for mutation. That’s how viruses evolve until they break out. Is that what’s been going on? It’s pretty late in the game to not know.
Someone should have forensic epidemiologists/genomic testing there to monitor this stuff, not wait until some UK scientists raise the warning flag. WHO was late to the game. Where is CDC in all this?"
2021-11-27 19:57,Many South African doctors have said that Omicron cases have been mild/not worse than previous variants. European countries and US have quite good vaccination rates. So probably these flight bans are unnecessary. Western governments wants to show their citizens that they are doing something. Not a science based decision.
2021-11-27 21:43,"""southern African officials note that the West’s hoarding of vaccines helped create their struggle in the first place.""

If the first human cases were due to poor wet market regulation, or virology research in Wuhan, did the CCP create the struggle?  

WRT to hoarding, if the West is using what it has as it produces it, I don't thing that is hoarding.  Isn't hoarding when one collects and stores things beyond what they can use?"
2021-11-27 21:46,"Global public health system are dealing with an unprecedented, rapidly evolving pandemic and the suffering it is causing will not be mitigated by visceral outrage at measures being taken by countries trying to buy time while Covid defense strategies continue changing as they must. Scientists will keep reporting the facts to the powers that be, and the data will be challenged, ignored or countered with disinformation, all driven by politics, greed and ignorance.

Meanwhile, those who can be, should be vaccinated, wear masks and get tested when necessary. Right now, the best we can hope for is pandemic control, because in our highly polarized and disinformed world, effective global cooperation is not on the table, at least not yet."
2021-11-27 21:47,"Let's keep the pharmaceutical companies in the spotlight while we're considering variants. Moderna, for example, sold Botswana 500k vaccine doses at around $29 per dose - far more than what even wealthy countries pay - promising they would arrive in August, but none had been delivered by October. Consequently, Botswana gets a travel ban and Moderna profits skyrocket, because they created the type of conditions that allow variants like this to emerge."
2021-11-27 20:29,"Most people on the left accuse the right of being cavalier and unconcerned about Covid, of refusing to get vaccinated and wear masks. But when it comes to unrestricted international travel during a pandemic, including in cases of particular flare-ups, the left says... come on in! Travel restrictions? Totally unnecessary!"
2021-11-27 21:12,"This is just absurd. We are almost two years into the pandemic and scientists are telling us now that just another round of ramped up testing and partial lockdowns is going to save the day. It hasn’t, and continuing to do the same thing over and over while hoping for a different outcome is the definition of insanity."
2021-11-27 21:28,"Africa is most certainly not to blame.

The country to blame is China -- which to this day assiduously prevents WHO and other international bodies from determining the origins of the Covid virus which has killed millions and thus keeps alive the theory that Chinese scientists manipulated an existing bat virus in their labs. 

Why else would we be seeing so many mutations?"
2021-11-27 21:37,"Why blame and shame a responsible global citizen? South Africa has handled this responsibly.

They test aggressively, they sequence the tests, and they report results openly and transparently.

The world should follow their example.

Right now the best thing for humanity and the planet would be for the World Trade Organization to suspend global IP rights relating to vaccine production. Then the International Monetary Fund can build regional facilities and expand vaccine equity.

Other international associations can work on preventative vaccines and see if total immunity is possible. They can then release that formulation finally get this virus under control."
2021-11-27 21:40,"So The Blame Game has begun. 

Me? I like to blame China. If they had been more open about this and not so negligent in the first place we might not be where we are today.

2021-11-27 21:42,Hoarding? Really? How much of Africa has the infrastructure to maintain the ridiculously low temperatures necessary to transport and preserve the Pfizer and Moderna Vaccines? Are we hoarding the J&J vaccine? Not that I've heard...

We must defeat COVID as soon as possible.  This requires emergency measures to ensure that everyone gets vaccinated, including children. Boosters for others are also needed. This is essential to achieve herd immunity. 

After COVID has been defeated in the US, President Biden should work with our allies and with the World Health Organization to ensure a worldwide program to help vaccinate poor people around the world.  Otherwise, COVID will just return again next year.

COVID is the defining issue of our time."
2021-11-27 21:45,"Many commenters have pointed to South Africa’s request to slow shipments of vaccine due to refusals to get vaccinated. One pointed to the logistics and issues with storage for why Uganda may allow a very large percentage of its vaccines to expire at year-end. Given that much of the discussion is about whether the “West” is being stingy with the vaccine, I’d like to know:

1) What is the situation in all the vast regions of Africa with regard to vaccination? Is the hesitancy found in South Africa the rule across the continent? Is it a general distrust or does it have specific reasons that could be addressed?

2) What efforts have the South Africans made to share vaccines they can’t use with neighboring countries? If they aren’t sharing or offering to share, what are the reasons? 

3) What can be done in Africa to counter pernicious false information as they read on social media and hear through the rumor mill? (And while you are at it, how do we get through to stubbornly anti-vax Americans?)

4) How do we help all the people across the continent of Africa who want the vaccine to get it?"
2021-11-27 21:46,"I seriously doubt anyone in blaming the South African countries.  Rather, we owe them an enormous debt of gratitude for spotting and reporting this variant.

2021-11-27 20:18,"This article points out three causes of the problem in South Africa: 1. there is a vaccine supply shortage according to some SA politicians because of rich country hoarding 2. contrary to #1, there is enough vaccine but SA government has been slow in getting it administered 3. extremely high SA vaccine hesitancy. Whatever is the case amongst these competing narratives, SA has only 10% vax rate so far which is abysmal. Time to stop pointing fingers and fix the problem."

2021-11-27 21:24,"Blame? Trump’s approach to avoiding responsibilities seems to be spreading more rapidly than the viruses. This is a force of nature at work and we stop it by using the knowledge that we have. That tells us to vaccinate the world, all the people alive. Then it’s done."
2021-11-27 20:38,"Trying not to borrow trouble.  Definitely grateful to South African scientists who discovered this, regardless where it originated.  Africa's problem is enough health care workers to administer shots.  And, yes, an adequate supply if they could administer them.  They also have anti-vaxers, just like other countries but probably not as bad as here in the U.S.  Nothing, nowhere could be as awful as ours.

Maybe burned out health care workers could be offered free trips to Africa, where people may be nicer, more appreciative of their services.  I'm thinking a week tops, giving shots in areas that need them, then a week on a beach.  And, why not that rotation here?  Being a health care worker has to be horrible when people are so incredibly bent on dying in hospitals after insisting they won't do anything to stay well and out of same hospitals.

Let's make a world wide push to give shots to anyone that wants them, and accompany shots with staffs to administer them, everywhere.  Stop depending in local healthcare workers, they have enough to do.  If people don't want the vaccines, so be it, just move forward saving those that desire it."

The Chinese and Russian vaccines don’t work as well as the western ones being manufactured in USA, Germany and Ireland - they are the vaccines in most demand - and yes, they are scarce but becoming less so."
2021-11-27 21:09,"It is MISINFORMATION for countries, for example like South Africa, to blame ""Western hoarding"" for its outbreak:  the truth is that a country like South Africa has an excess of vaccine supplies and the outbreak of the omicron variant in South Africa is due to a low uptake in the vaccine among its population (roughly 25-35%).

Other African nations may be experiencing shortages of vaccines, but overcoming distribution shortages must be paired with local, national programs of MANDATING VACCINES for populations who are too often skeptical of ""western"" medical vaccine science.

In other words, there is a problem about covid science in many countries that evokes, uncannily, the problems of AIDS science that countries like South Africa suffered long ago."
2021-11-27 21:14,"If the logic holds, we now need to ban travel from the UK sine they now have reported cases

Probably wise to ban travel until drug companies can confirm how the current vaccine protects against the new variant."

2021-11-27 21:24,Why people seem so surprised when they  hear “variant”? It is inevitable that the COVID-19 will evolve-mutate into a stronger or deadlier virus as nature intends it.
2021-11-27 22:18,"Follow up from a story elsewhere in the Times, quoting Ms. Nolen and adding a point that absolutely, positively should be in an updated version of this story: “That number of people [61 of 600 being infected] seems like a very high number to have this happen,” said Andrew Pekosz, an epidemiologist from Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Unless there’s really tremendous amounts of spread of this virus locally [in South Africa] that was not detected.”  This story refers to ""South Africa's daily number of infections"" being ""a small fraction of case counts in countries with similar populations, like German and Britain.""  That's a completely irresponsible statement: they have a small number of REPORTED CASES, which is not the same thing as actual infections, as Prof. Pekosz suggests.  If 10% of a random sample of 600 people from SA have covid, it's pretty obvious that a country of 60 million people has a lot more than 2828 cases. Relevant countries might think about targeted these southern African states for an emergency vaccination campaign."
2021-11-27 19:16,"Articles like this make me despair.  It’s becoming clear that as a species, we’re incapable of acting responsibly. The west hoards vaccines while large chunks of its citizens spurn them and refuse to wear masks. Many Americans are acting like the pandemic is “winding down” — in the middle of a surge. A potentially nasty variant appears and some on the left complain about restricting travel from its apparent origin — for political reasons. Meanwhile, the right complains that the pandemic is a hoax and vaccines make you magnetic.

Quarantining people on a plane was a completely reasonable thing to do, yet a Times correspondent on the plane whined on Twitter in a way that reminded me of Americans who howl about shutdowns taking away their FREEDOM!  Releasing passengers who tested negative was foolish. Some got infected and will spread the virus. Maybe the new variant.

The major difference is Omicron is a genie already out of the bottle. Countries vaccinating their own citizens first are inevitable, a thing we might avoid in future by creating a network of regional vaccine trusts to which licensing & tech transfer would be compulsory in the event of a global pandemic.

Omicron shares the N501Y “Nelly” mutation with Alpha and E484K “Eek!” with Beta, and a P681H mutation functionally similar to the P681R in the Delta strain: Amino acids H and R both have side chains with a (+)-charge. That’s probably why doctors worry about immunological escape. Like Alpha, Omicron can be detected by S gene target failure with Thermo-Fisher test kits; it doesn’t require sequencing.

The UNICEF Covid vaccine market dashboard shows Covax having secured 5.6 billion doses, but only 548 million shipped and 11 million in transit. This needs speeding up. World deliveries stand at 8.8 billion to date, with current capacity about 600 million per month.

All these vax laggards in the rich world must get shots now. I hate the spirit of mandates, too; I wish this was happening voluntarily. Yet it’s not. Europe & North America have 2½ million dead with the virus raging as fiercely as ever; Germany’s 70,000 daily new cases is a record. Blame doesn’t stop the economic disruptions."
2021-11-27 19:55,"Efforts to contain this latest variant must continue including travel bans.  The U.S., E.U. and others have donated millions of vaccines to Africa.

2021-11-27 22:35,"""sequencing the virus takes too long to allow health officials to pick out people infected with the Omicron""

Other articles suggest this isn't true: PCR revealed markers can detect this particular variant.

Unless a country bans all entry all the time, it seems unlikely that travel bans can be effective. By the time politicians figure out they want a travel ban, the variant is already endemic in that country. 

A negative PCR on arrival in a country also doesn't necessarily mean the person isn't infected, since there may not be enough virus present to trigger a positive test outcome. Quarantining arrivals plus testing could make a difference.

Other than vaccination and the individual precautions, there appears to be no practical ways to contain this virus."

The Moderna vaccine was developed in the United States.  The J&J vaccine was developed by a joint U.S.-European scientific effort of the U.S. company Johnson and Johnson, which owns Janssen. The Pfizer-BNT vaccine (developed in Germany) we have because of the large scale clinical trials and manufacturing capability of the US company Pfizer. GSK was developed in Britain. So number one, we would not have multiple highly effective and safe vaccines without the US and Europe. (We really don’t know the effectiveness or safety of the Russian and Chinese vaccines.)

Secondly, for every shot in the arm of an American the US has donated THREE shots to the developed world. Utilizing 25% of vaccines is hardly hoarding. 

Can we do more by sharing manufacturing technology and expertise? Yes. Should we donate more vaccine doses. Yes. But this hoarding narrative is not helpful or true. The US has only 5% of the world’s population but we are and will be a critical partner for ending this pandemic worldwide."

The rich countries can try to contain it, but that’s all they will be able to do.  Even then, you have millions of people fighting against vaccines and adding to the increasingly vicious divisions in the world. There is no way the world’s countries are going to work together on this, just like they can’t work together on climate change.

Millions of us are going to die, and our healthcare systems are already overstretched and overstressed and not adequate to a never ending pandemic of this proportion.

My life is not significant here, as I am in my 70’s and close to being on the way out anyway.  But the worldwide population may well be culled, and as per usual it will be the poor who die first, and the rich will take every advantage, however ‘immoral’ to save themselves.

The one country that may survive this pretty well is China.  They can mandate vaccinations universally with no exceptions allowed, and isolate populations ruthlessly if necessary.  Also their scientists will be on these new variants in a nanosecond, and planning for the future accordingly. The 21st century belongs to the Chinese - like it or not."

Omicron has 32 mutations at key receptor binding domains. The chances of so many functionally adaptive mutations occurring in someone not severely immune compromised (ie severe HIV) are close to zero. Vaccines are not terribly effective among this specific cohort."
2021-11-27 23:32,Lots of blame to go round here but here's the facts as we know them today: Viruses mutate. That's what viruses do. The m-RNA vaccines (Moderna & Pfizer) were build on a platform that could be modified to meet new variant threats fairly quickly. New m-RNA vaccines could be ready by next summer. Meanwhile-- no one knows (epidemiologists included) if this new variant will take over the Delta variant. Other variants have come and gone with the Delta variant remaining dominant. No one knows enough at this moment to make conclusive statements. I would have said 12 months ago that closing borders and mandatory vaccines are the way forward but I don't believe that anymore--I simply look at the results--the data isn't there to support it. Each of us will have to make our own decisions about our risk tolerance.Blaming each other or one country after another for its failures isn't productive.
2021-11-27 23:33,Canada realizes that other countries like the USA can not be counted on to do the right thing so it requires full vaccination and PCR test to board inbound and outbound flights.

Why should wealthy countries not drop patents and help countries who can’t make vaccines on their own?

If the goal is to completely stop Omicron from entering Europe and the US, then of course “bans don’t work,” as there is almost certainly community transmission. 

If the goal is to hopefully lessen the spread and make an unknown risk hopefully more manageable, then of course it can’t hurt as long as policy is informed by respect for other rights and dignities (ie returning to ones family, nation, etc. I can’t imagine there are hoards of Botswanans clamoring to travel to Bavaria as cases reach record highs, nor is flying to St. Moritz to ski for the weekend a particularly good idea at this time.

2021-11-27 23:41,Can you report on the percentage of people in South Africa getting the vaccine vs the amount available? I heard one doctor saying there was great availability but low take up
2021-11-27 23:46,"This is 100% expected, inevitable, and unavoidable. You can't vaccinate the Earth instantaneously, the virus is continually mutating, and this is the next step on the path to an endemic virus. We will all get it soon."
2021-11-28 0:19,"The news about Omicron is disturbing in many ways beginning with public fears of the unknown. I’m not a fan of it either. Dealing with a murky near term future can throw a lot of us into a hysteria of premature disappointment and horror at future events that MAY happen, or not. Learn to shrug a bit and let the whirling go on outside your sphere of influence, you. 
Keep abreast of government announcements and/or protocols and local virus news. Then walk away if it is too much to absorb to form calmer state. Accept none of us can do a darned thing about COVID other than follow instructions and use our intelligence to determine risk based on our personal status.
I’m going to wait to hear what scientists learn about Omicron before I completely freak out! Travel restrictions hold no long term benefit but they do provide a slowing of the global spread. Whatever the character and attributes of Omicron, we’ll figure it out. Most who pay attention will survive, regardless.
Best to all."
2021-11-27 22:31,"Omicron is a serious enough problem that it is the lead story on the Fox News website.  Since it appears to have originated in Africa, that allows coverage to appeal the racial/political bent of their readership.  It also has nothing to do with Trump, so by covering it they are not contradicting him.  It's can be portrayed as a new disease.

I write this in hopes that their coverage will motivate their followers to get the shot.  We see that Omicron evolved in a poorly vaccinated group of young people.  It could have just as easily evolved in Mississippi or Alabama with their low vaccination rates.

Bottom line is that if we want to get control of Covid, everyone, everywhere must get the shot.  If not, the virus will continue to evolve.  And the US and other wealthy nations must do more to vaccinate the poorer ones or this will keep happening.  Sometimes foreign aid pays off really well."
2021-11-27 23:09,"Perhaps it’s time to focus the worlds scientific community on why these virus’s are taking hold.  As warned for years, the burning and destroying the rain forests have an extreme affect on the eco system of Earth.  Climate change?  Are we going to continue to treat the symptom and not the cause?"
2021-11-27 23:15,"All countries should have a mandate: Until vaccinated, you are not allowed in our country. 

All employers: Until vaccinated, you can't work.

Exceptions: under 5 and proven allergy to vaccine. If you fall in these 2 categories, stay home or test.

You don't want to follow, stay home. The rest of us want to live our lives.

Mutations were causes by selfish people refusing to got vaccinated.

Hopefully, this isn't the mutation that is beyond vaccine resistant."
2021-11-27 23:44,"It’s clearly says S Africa has more vaccine than its people want, so this is not the fault of the US or any rich country. It’s viral evolution. This will come as a shocker, but viruses mutate. Can you imagine if we had to give a name for every endemic virus variant that emerged, we would run out of names in a hurry. Coronavirus like many other viruses cannot be eradicated, and there will always be variants. All you can do is make vaccines and/or get exposed to the virus and develop immunity to them. A travel ban won’t really do anything at this point, we’ve seen for 2 years how any restrictions we take are short-term solutions at best. There’s not really a way out, or an end game, it’s just our immune system evolving versus a virus evolving, and the only way you really can win is through vaccination and exposure to it."
2021-11-27 22:57,If the African countries where Omicron originated were interested in doing the right thing they would ban their citizens from traveling outside these countries without the appropriate test or vaccine instead of complaining about other countries not allowing travelers from these countries to enter.

2021-11-27 23:09,"The authorities in Amsterdam have pulled one of the top 10 dumbest moves on Covid. (And I live in the U.S. - a trend-setter for Covid dumb moves.) gathering 600 people for hours into crowded indoor spaces with 61 covid positive people, then setting free all those were exposed - because they had negative tests in the moment? Does anyone there (yet) understand how Covid is spread? Or the concept of “incubation period”?"
2021-11-27 23:09,"Its unrealistic to expect the average tourist to choose a covid-19 hotspot, like South Africa, for a vacation. Only a fool would ignore the pervasive presence of that new variant.

The truth is that there are more than seven billion homo sapiens living on this planet. We either selfishly destroy ourselves and our world thinking only of ourselves, our family, our nation, our religion, our race... Or we begin to see all men and women, ALL men and women on this world, as brothers and sisters.

2021-11-27 22:59,"Lot of blame to go around?

People can blame South African countries and India before that for the delta variant.

What price has China paid for covering up, delaying information or preventing investigation into this origin?

UK was the origin of alpha (no banning of flights or preventing people from coming in) which also spread to India and may have contributed to delta.

Trump and his administration contributed to lies and anti vax beliefs, leading to so many preventable deaths, what about blaming them?  These anti vax beliefs are spread by social media around the world.

Omicron has spread to UK, Germany, Israel, etc. already, so will flights be banned from Europe?

Maybe instead of blaming, we should focus on cooperation and sharing around the world.  Everyone everywhere is connected somehow."
2021-11-27 22:20,"Governments across the globe have failed miserably to take this virus seriously enough to effectively combat it and instead act like weak helicopter parents of millennials trying to be 'friends' and overly permissive of their constituants. We desperately need real leadership that is more concerned about world health than getting re-elected or protest. We need to re-read the playbook of the polio vaccine. We need to double down on mandates. We need to allow only those vaccinated on planes. We need to sue all of those that willingly disseminate false vaccine propaganda and misinformation and the platforms that support this misinformation. We need to sue those companies that fail to follow federal mandates. We need to place all the unvaccinated at the back of the line at the ER and intensive care units. We need to do all these things because folks we won't have an economy or a functioning government with this virus still with us for another 3-4 years. We need to do all these things because our basic right and freedom of health is far MORE  important than anyone's perceived right to spread falsehoods.

I am astounded at the degree of hand wringing and downright milquetoast responses most Western governments have had to this global war on Covid. Our very way of life is at stake and yet all we hear is kindergarten squabbling about protecting the tourist industry. Pathetic."
2021-11-28 1:10,"Not sure anyone is blaming anybody in Africa.  It is simply a rational choice to curb or put on temporary hold travel to and from a Covid hot spot. 

That said, I do blame Big Pharma for refusing to delete their patents, which I believe are based on basic science paid for by taxpayers, and allow mass production of Covid vaccines to allow access to anyone and everyone who wants and needs it.

To belabor an old saw, there's never enough time to do it right but there's always enough time to do it twice. This possibility has been growling around in the back of my head for a while now, along with irritation that wealthy Western countries (and pharmaceutical companies) didn't somehow figure out how to afford vaccinations for Africa and other poor nations outside of it. 

I can't imagine the virus getting around inoculations entirely, but if its R0 number is high, we could easily see another rebound this winter."
2021-11-28 2:27,"Whatever happened to common sense? 

It is pretty clear what needs to be done to curtail and reduce the spread of covid and its variants, which is pretty low tech--get vaccinated, wear masks, and social distance until more people get vaccinated. 

OR, What will make the pandemic last longer, increasingly difficult to control, result in more hospitalizations and deaths, and greatly delay economic recovery and make socializing more hazardous? Don't get vaccinated (only 55% vaccinated in our red state), don't wear masks (hardly anyone is in our packed hospitals state), and don't gather in large groups until more people are vaccinated.

""A study from the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School Of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, finds that states with Republican governors have experienced the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic...The study suggests that policy differences between the two parties regarding safety measures, such as mask and social distancing policies, likely account for the disparity...The authors of the study say that political polarization led to politicized responses to the disease that have resulted in worst-case numbers.""

Vaccinations, masking, tracing, isolation, travel restrictions, regulation of drug companies: all these must be strictly-enforced. It is time to listen to the ""scientists"".

And I thought, yeah, right, that's (not) gonna happen. 

And how ignorant and narrow-thinking it was to do otherwise, because viruses don't follow borders. At least not airborne ones. 

So true. 

Add the above to the murderous lies of TFG, and cronies, about it being a hoax, and vaccines being bad, one gets the richest and supposedly, most advanced nation in the world, with about a 50% overall vaccination rate, nearly a year after widespread availability and real-life, real-time results. 

When thousands, even tens of thousands of doses were being flushed, as they had expired, due to lack of demand -- again, and at that time, maybe only 40% of nation overall was vaxxed ...

2021-11-28 5:22,"Why do we keep thinking that the first place that detected a variant was the origin? And who cares where patient zero lives anyway? Even if Patient zero is from South Africa (an assumption I personally doubt), it isn't like it is their fault. 

I am waiting to find the ""Michigan Variant"". When I look at the data for my state, it is hard to see that the vaccine is making a difference. 93% of those 65 years and up have had the vaccine, yet our hospitalization numbers are quickly climbing to a new peak, with those 65 years and up still keeping about the same ratio of hospitalizations as the last peak. Something tells me mutation for vaccine escape has happened more than once already. 

Yes, I have my two shots, and will get the booster, but no, I don't think this is behind us."
2021-11-28 6:45,"Vaccination should be mandated by law in every country and those avoiding vaccination without a medical reason (and certified by a physician) should face fines and forceful vaccination. This might sound terribly right-wing and authoritarian but is possibly the only way for reducing the suffering, deaths and evolution of dangerous new variants."
2021-11-28 7:33,"You can add Australia to the list as well, two people on an incoming flight, from the continent of Africa, have tested positive for the omicron variant."
2021-11-28 9:26,"It’s my understanding that viruses only mutate when they replicate, they can only replicate when they are successfully transmitted to a new host.  If vaccines greatly inhibit virus transmission, they not only protect individuals and populations from current variants, but also inhibit the development of new variants.  Conversely, if a country doesnt have access to vaccines or doesn’t use them, that country is far more likely to not only have higher case loads, hospitalizations, and deaths, but also is far more likely to develop variants. So, if we, as a species, really want to get a handle on COVID, we must freely share vaccines and vaccine technologies amongst all countries and people without limitation."
2021-11-28 10:39,The joyous optimism that I felt upon receiving two doses of the Pfizer vaccine last spring (plus the booster) has now--with the emergence of the Omicron variant--been replaced with despair.
2021-11-28 10:42,"Obviously the best way to prevent the spread of Omicron is to prevent travel. Unfortunately, by the time we detect a new variant like Omicron the spread has already started. What's the answer? Worldwide vaccination. Is that possible? Using Our Country as an example I'd have to say NO. Too many people are putting Politics ahead of Public Safety."
2021-11-28 11:02,Excuse me.  I've also heard that the lack of vaccination happening in Africa is also due to vaccine hesitancy in the population.  Too much of the population do not want to take the vaccine.  It's not a supply issue.
2021-11-28 11:19,We have been through close to two years of living in a Twilight Zone episode.  At this point we need to take reasonable measures to protect ourselves regardless of hurt feelings.  It is a no brainer to ban travelers from southern Africa to prevent the further spread of this particular variant.
2021-11-27 21:16,"This blame is so typical...black people are barred from opportunity and then vilified because they aren't more successful.  The poorer African countries did not have a share of the vaccines so now that a variant has emerged, they are blamed for something over which they had no control... you can't exclude some human beings from a vaccine and not be expected to suffer the consequences of your actions."
2021-11-27 22:24,Let’s mandate vaccination for air travel ASAP!
2021-11-28 10:58,"As a South African, some of the arrogance displayed in this comment section in cherry-picking references to our poor vaccination rate astounds me. During the time when Western nations were hogging vaccines - while those in Africa desperate for their first dose were dying - something else spread almost instantly from the West to here: vaccine conspiracy theories and misinformation. Just look at the Disinformation Dozen, and where they're from. Zapped straight across the oceans by the likes of Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter, which the US has failed to keep in check from doing untold damage around the world. This misinformation had many months to percolate in the collective consciousness before the first vaccine dose ever arrived on our shores, driving up suspicions and fears. Unfortunately, quality education is hard to come by in South Africa, due to systemic inequality caused by colonialism and apartheid, making it harder for the average person to discern fake news from fact (a problem that even rich Western nations struggle with).  Add the fact that many South Africans are HIV positive and thus immunocompromised, potentially creating conditions ripe for mutations. With those facts in mind, did we ever stand a chance? (And before anyone argues that apartheid was a long time ago, I am 32 years old and started off my schooling in a racially segregated school.)"
2021-11-28 8:22,"With regard to vaccine hesitancy in South Africa; yes, it is present and this is unfortunate. Many South Africans use Facebook, Twitter and other social media; and there is a significant amount of misinformation out there. It is time for the world to realise that the proliferation and global dissemination of false health information has global economic consequences."
2021-11-28 12:36,"We are a world that struggles to learn our lessons. Vaccinations and boosters are required, it should go without saying. There are exceptions but are relatively few. 
Wear masks in public where half the people around you may or may not be vaccinated. Stay away from small, enclosed spaces unless they include only your “bubble.” Unless it’s an emergency, don’t fly. 
Wash hands frequently.

Don’t patronize businesses that have relaxed attitudes about employee vaccinations. Ask doctors if their office staffs and nurses are vaccinated. Express your unease if they are not. If your workplace is lax, say something. Don’t “try to understand” healthy people who refuse vaccinations. They have earned themselves the least “freedom” of anyone around you, and they do not have your best interests in mind."
2021-11-28 4:02,"“It feels like these rich countries have learned absolutely nothing in terms of support.”

Was there a bona fide effort to TEACH the CITIZENS of democracies?  (Such as trying to get the attention of the main steam media, such as the NY Times, and begging for interviews.)

I don't know if that happened or not.  I do know that I pretty much pay attention (except when work is especially demanding).  I noticed some complaining but not anything in the way of teaching.

If the teaching was attempted, when and how did it happen?  What is your best guess as why I, who does try to follow the news, didn't notice the teaching attempt?

If the teaching didn't happen, why not?

(I want to be clear.  The way to get something done when dealing with a democracy is first try to negotiate with the national government.  If that doesn't work, which it apparently didn't, the next step is to go to the citizens of those nations ... because they are democracies.)"
2021-11-28 5:02,"Blaming some nation is ridiculous. If anyone is to be blamed, let it be shared by the rich nations too. Many African nations got vaccination shipments very late. Only after Europe and the U.S. met their needs, the focus turned on Africa. Let us admit this fact. 
Also, this virus still remains a mystery to scientists too. Unless medicine is found, the virus will only mutate. No nation could be blamed for the mutation."
2021-11-28 5:49,"“With roughly a third of South Africans vaccinated, officials there blame a number of factors, including vaccine hesitancy caused by rampant online misinformation. ... For now, South Africa has far more vaccine doses than it can distribute in time, forcing senior health officials to defer some planned deliveries.”

Your article is giving us readers whiplash with sentences like this tucked into the last paragraphs, coming after paragraph after paragraph of tenacious framing as a rich-country-hoarding problem.  You have an obligation to your readers to construct an intellectually-coherent argument.  

Worse, I think you’re burying what is the truly distressing story, that vaccine hesitancy and misinformation is not just a USA phenomenon, but is worldwide and in fact, may be the single most foreboding aspect—an apparently universal human behavioral flaw that may make victory over covid impossible.  Seeing vaccines overstocked and expiring in South African warehouses is an ominous sign."
2021-11-28 8:44,"If evolution is an intelligent process, then a virus does not really want to kill the person it infects, since that dead person will not be able to transmit the virus to others. 

So from the point of view of its own survival, the virus would prefer that its victims stay alive and transmit the virus to others. So as a virus mutates, at a certain point in time it should get less and less lethal even as it becomes more transmissible.  

Whether we are at this stage with Covid, nobody knows yet."
2021-11-28 11:31,"What about the other parts of Africa? Noticed that flights to Nairobi were boarding in the article. With so few people vaccinated there, the entire continent is at risk.
Perhaps we need to be much stricter about quarantines for all foreign travelers to be sure they aren't infected before they return here."
2021-11-28 12:33,"Dr. John Campbell (Omicron objectivity <a href=""https://youtu.be/cdkCVeWc1pQ"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/cdkCVeWc1pQ</a>)  shares conflicting observations about Omicron severity from perhaps, doctors treating two different South African patient populations. 

Dr Angelique Coetzee, South African Medical Association was said to have been the first doctor to raise the alarm about Omicron. Her patients are mostly men under 40 reporting mild symptoms of fatigue and headaches. 

She seems to think things are being vastly overblown at this point, and suggests that people check with other doctors at Pretoria hospitals who will back up her observations.

On the other hand, Rudo Mathivha, head of the intensive care unit at Soweto’s Baragwanath Hospital, reported that his facility is seeing young people in their 20’s and 30’s; many with moderate to severe symptoms and some requiring intensive care. 

Those who are either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated are faring the worst.  Dr. Mathivha, fears that SA hospitals may soon become overwhelmed."
2021-11-28 5:28,"I don't want school closures, even if numbers start going back up. In Washington state, where I am, all teachers and school staff had to get vaccinated. We all wear masks. That should be precaution enough. I'm tired of democratic leaders overreacting and closing things down. No more lockdowns!"
2021-11-28 6:02,"I recall reading articles in NYT & WAPO when vaccines first became available. Americans were going to great lengths - searching far and wide, some even braving stormy weather and traveling with loved ones (into what came to be known as ""hot spots"") in order to reach areas of our country where the opportunity was being squandered.... I was so incredibly proud of fellow Americans who stepped up, in determined numbers, assuring that the vaccine would not go to waste."
2021-11-28 9:42,"I am very sympathetic to the idea that the West could and should have done more. Whatever trouble the West gets from this new variant should not simply be laid at the door of the Southern African countries. However, I also think that southern Africa blaming the West for all their covid troubles is not constructive, and they should not overlook their own roles in failing to control transmission. All in all, a mess all round."
2021-11-28 11:31,"Of course there has to be a travel ban until we I understand what this is. I am sick of everyone with a political axe to grind trying to influence science. It is not true that there is a supply problem South Africa. Their vaccination numbers are shockingly low, and that is not always and entirely the West’s fault."
2021-11-28 3:53,"Blaming is not a useful action.   The Covid is changing - Alpha,Beta, Gamma,Epsilon, Eta,Iota, Kappa, Mu, Zeta, 1.617.3, Omicron, according to the CDC.  If Humans stayed in place, masked and got vaccines as available, good.   Some nations did not get vaccines due to money, most probably, or other countries hoarding the vaccines.   These actions are important and impact others.  If vaccines were not available, do not blame the lack on people, who may have wanted these very much.  
Manage yourself, in light of the larger global effort."
2021-11-28 8:19,"I am in the construction industry and work with a lot of working class folks. There is definitely a vaccine hesitancy amongst working class and also 'lefties' who have been misinformed by Facebook and other word of mouth methods. It will be extremely difficult for the South African government to turn around their views. The only hope to get mass vaccination is to require a proof of vaccine when entering govt. buildings, or a workplace vax mandate."
2021-11-28 10:55,vaccinating a nation's people is not hoarding. why is the west responsible for the rest of the world?
2021-11-28 11:25,"How can you NOT impose a travel ban when a new and potentially very dangerous variant turns up? And how is a government supposed to deny vaccines to its own citizens in order to ship some to other countries? Covid-19 is a new disease and vaccines had to be created from scratch. Inevitably there won't be enough vaccines to go around soon enough to quash the virus.

The fact that 60 people on two flights arrived positive shows that it's almost certainly too late to prevent Omicron spreading around the world. But that doesn't mean one should just forget about trying to limit the damage."
2021-11-28 12:12,"Hoard vaccines, don’t have any serious plans for, or concerns about, ensuring that poorer nations are able to fight this virus as effectively as rich nations and then blame THEM when variants are reported in their countries. Charming!"
2021-11-28 3:37,"If (big IF), Omicron is highly transmissible, AND strongly outcompetes Delta (et al), AND turns out to be a significantly *less* virulent variant (as so far only anecdotally observed), why wouldn't it be a net *plus* in the transition from pandemic to manageable endemicity?..."
2021-11-28 3:56,"This variant may be the natural vaccine - milder disease, higher transmissibility. ￼That is the recipe to eliminate the virus."
2021-11-28 5:27,"I recognize that testing is unlikely to be nearly as common in the southern Africa region but the case loads there as reported by the NYT appear to be as low as the best counties in the US.  Perhaps that's misleading, but it also makes me wonder if the variant actually originated there.  We may know more in the coming weeks, to be sure, but to me it is a wonder that a variant hasn't come out of one of a multitude of European nations, or even from the intense areas of activity in the US.  Hard to blame the Africans.  They didn't start the fire, and the rest of us haven't put it out.  The horse may already have been out of the barn for weeks, and we just don't know it yet."
2021-11-28 7:19,"Interesting how many commenters didn't seem to read the whole article before chiming in on how western hoarding is to blame here. Meaning, the part where it says supply in Africa is not the problem, but rather vaccine hesitancy and online misinformation creating the inability to distribute. Sound familiar? 

Also, have you stopped to ponder how much Covid has revealed about the extent of our economic dependence on climate-killing jetting about, and keeping up a constant flow of food and libations served by others? The whole venture is totally unsustainable - how many clues do we need?"
2021-11-28 10:45,It is not Africa to be blamed for this mutation but the extreme greed and short term thinking of the developed world in hoarding vaccines and allowing Vaccine manufacturers to profiteer. No one was safe until everyone was vaccinated was the clarion call of experts. Now it is in the past tense as the horse has bolted from the stable and there will be further global economic devastation.
2021-11-28 12:26,"Pete Buttigieg said last week on NPR that a vaccine mandate wasn’t required for airline travel because masks work fine.  He refused to explain why the administration carves out domestic airline travel from its mask mandate.  A recent NYT article discussed how international travelers arriving in the US (including US citizens and legal residents) are not asked for proof of vaccination, evidence of prior covid illness or a negative covid test result.  Hours before Biden slapped a Trumpian travel ban on southern African countries, Fauci claimed we didn’t need a travel ban at all.  Meanwhile, our borders are still open to travelers from non European countries where Omicrom has surfaced, including 60 positive people in the Netherlands.  I don’t care about politics on this issue, I care about public health.  Biden needs to up his game.  More people have died of this brutal virus in 2021 than under Trump, and that’s with the benefit of 3 vaccines, and it looks like it’s about to get a whole lot worse."
2021-11-28 12:53,"Omicron is here, there and likely almost everywhere. We humans learn little and retain less.

Since the 1918 pandemic masking (primarily when indoor or in very crowded spaces) social distancing and scrupulous hygiene have been effective at slowing spread. But this is too big an ask for too many people.

We also have vaccines and even in countries such as the United States where anyone can get it for free we have a dismal vaccination rate due to politically motivated misinformation.

Proof of vaccinations for admission to the workplace and other venues is good. Proof of vaccination to fly is good. Monitoring international passengers (and those arrivals from our own yahoo states) would also be helpful. 

Testing, isolating …we have tools. But too many want to exercise their individual freedom to be irresponsible.

The more human wood available to burn unhindered the more chances for mutations.

Healthcare workers are beyond the brink and I don’t blame them."
2021-11-28 13:17,"1st to blame, Pharmaceutical industry & vaccine patents.  The world should be working together to beat this before it beats us.  There should be no patents, they should all be open source and available to everyone.

2nd to name, Rich countries for not sharing with the poorer countries.  COVID is not over with until it is over everywhere.  It doesn't matter if you have 70% or 80% immunity if your neighbor is at 20%.

The GREED of the corporations and governments to blame and we cannot let them get away with this blaming the poor countries."
2021-11-28 13:40,"Many comments suggest folks haven’t understood the situation the article addresses.  South Africa reported results of their genomic surveillance.  The results pointed to emergence of a new variant which may be more able to transmit than previous variants.  European (and U S) response was to suspend air traffic from SA.  SA followed protocol of transparent global reporting and public health cooperation was not the first action; it was abrupt targeted suspension of travel.  The 30 or 60 COVID-19 cases detected on the 2 flights landing in the Netherlands did not include reporting whether those cases were the new variant.  Thus those cases point to poor compliance with confirming vacation status and proof of a negative test upon boarding.   

We need universal compliance with the disease control actions that we know work."
2021-11-28 13:47,I got the J&J in April and a Moderna booster in October.  I'm also PCR-tested twice a week at work (where vaccines are required) and take rapid antigen tests for good measure the morning of critical events like Thanksgiving.  But let's not forget that Covid cases and deaths in NYC dropped to remarkable lows at the end of August 2020 when there were no vaccines.  A lot more people were wearing masks then.
2021-11-28 13:49,"""the latest indication of how difficult it might be to stop the variant from crossing borders""
But I have serious business / Plans ? etc.  You can't expect ME to change MY important travel plans."
2021-11-28 13:51,"I am grateful to South Africa for being forthcoming when they discovered the new variant. If only China had done the same!

This development should galvanize the countries with more money to spend, to help countries with less of it inoculate as many of their people as possible, as quickly as possible, so we can reduce the number of new variants in the future. Travel bans won't contain Covid well; the virus is just too nimble. Cooperation is the key."
2021-11-28 13:56,"When I saw ""blame"" in the title, I knew the African nations were in for it.  The readers are not doing justice to the brilliance of this article, which clearly shows the very complicated nature of the emergence of this new variant.  The readers who think that it is simply a matter of ""education and hesitancy"" should have learned the lesson that Bill Gates did when the Gates Foundation ran into a roadblock with their vaccination campaigns in days of yore.  The problem is infrastructure.  These countries do not have the infrastructure in place, nor the trained personnel, that we take for granted here in the United States.  One can have an ample supply of vaccine but cannot get it into arms because there are not enough freezers, or for that matter electricity for freezers, to accomplish the task.  Ironically, we are the ones with an education and hesitancy problem, not so much these African nations."
2021-11-28 14:24,"Travel bans will do absolutely nothing to slow the spread of this variant.  South Africa detected Omicron not because it originated in Southern Africa.  But rather because given pandemics of HIV and TB it has scientists that are probably the best and fastest in the world in sequencing viruses.

If they found it on Thursday it’s already in every country on earth, or nearly so.  And if it is more contagious than Delta then it is going to spread rapidly throughout the globe.   There is no blame to be place on any particular country or continent.

What can be blamed is vaccination inequity and vaccinating too few people globally.  Of which Africa lags due to lack of supply which should have been addressed and can be addressed moving forward.

What can’t be accounted for is those who remain willfully unvaccinated in a country with ample supply of vaccines like the United States.  This is the real issue at hand.  I wouldn’t be shocked if Omicron is eventually found to have originated in the giant case surge among the unvaccinated in the US.

IF Omicron can get around vaccines the priority shouldn’t be on travel bans.  It should be on an immediate six week lockdown like March 2020 extended to three months if necessary while a vaccine is developed and rolled out as quickly as possible to protect against it.

As for those who still will not take that enhanced vaccine.  Well, I have no empathy left for them.  They will evolve to immunity the hard way or the harder way."
2021-11-28 14:27,"I listened to the hour long public disclosure internet discussion by the South African government and its scientists.  They are to be commended for the quick and through release of their findings on the data for the spread of cases, sequencing of the variant and as much as they can infer of the transmissibility and seriousness of the resulting disease.  They also discussed what they have learned about detecting the specific strain by PCR testing for the S2 gene of the virus.

It is unfortunate that all this warning information for the benefit of other countries results in South Africa's isolation.  While countries shutting their borders might be expected, it should also be expected that the next country to identify another new variant will not disclose it for fear of the economic harm that will follow.

If South Africa already has the vaccine doses it needs, then the support they need from wealthy countries should be aimed at the economic harm resulting from the isolation.  This support could encourage other economically vulnerable countries to be willing to report outbreaks and help the entire world end this pandemic."
2021-11-28 14:43,"Travel restrictions are an obvious reaction. But clearly we need to devote resources to getting the rest of the world vaccinated, however remote the terrain and however poor the country may be.  I still marvel that the world drug supply was not disrupted, when India was flattened by Covid for so much of this year. That would really be something to get hysterical about, as opposed to a temporary interruption in supply of dishwashers or Playstations. And even worse than no drugs: the surprise import of a new virus for which there is no cure. Which is obviously going to have a better chance to happen if big parts of the world continue to go unvaccinated.  

Kudos to South African scientists for having the public health infrastructure and the technology to detect this variant and the honesty to alert the world."
2021-11-28 14:47,"The African nations have a legitimate and moral claim that the wealthier nations are not doing enough to provide vaccines to get their populations vaccinated. The large rapacious economic nations led by the U.S.  have even won monopoly rights to the manufacturing process that produces the vaccine thanks to the 1995 TRIPS agreement.  All the scientific technology to create the covid vaccine was developed by tax-payer funded NIH grants to universities.   

The continent cannot seem to escape the legacies of colonial empire;  at one time 90% of Africa was colonized.  Virtually all the nations in desperate need of vaccines have one aspect in common- a population predominantly non-white.  Most likely the response would be different if the reverse were true.  

We are all in this together.  The longer the virus exists in any country the more we are pushing the envelope that future mutations will move beyond efficient transmission to resilient strains- that's the greatest danger.

Their anger over being banned from travel to other nations is not reasonable and not exclusive to just them.  Efforts to hinder covid's spread between nations is a legitimate response just as each nation has tried to slow the spread internally with their own citizens.  Not to share the vaccines is immoral and counterproductive."
2021-11-28 14:54,"Why can't we accept that viruses are a natural phenomenon?
That they have been around since earth's existence in one form or another.
They can mutate very quickly and the only thing mankind can do is try to minimize the effects it has on our human bodies.
Viruses like the one we are dealing with are airborne.
And very possibly as it 'floats' from one area to another it changes its form, its makeup, to adapt to the changing environment in which it finds itself.
Wearing a mask is one way to try to minimize the effects it has on our bodies, as is the vaccine.
So people, wear the mask, get the shot, 
Can't hurt, might help."

2021-11-28 15:05,The initial surge in New York city was triggered by the flights form Europe more than direct flights from China. Yet we didn't seem to have learned much. Testing at airports and quarantine is the only way albeit expensive to slowdown the spread.
2021-11-28 15:13,"We live in Florida.   Vaccinated and boosted, at this point I'm much more concerned with unvaccinated snowbirds from hot spots such as Michigan.    Since our horrific summer surge, cases have fallen dramatically, but that could change quickly.

And, of course, we also have a governor and state leaders who have fought vaccine mandates tooth and nail, even calling a special session of the legislature to make the point that ""freedom"" from vaccination is more important than the health and well being of Floridians.    Variants may be a concern, but we are more concerned with the flood of unvaccinated Americans who will be flocking to Florida to escape winter!"
2021-11-28 12:34,"Two Points.

1-Announcing you have a new strain is good and bad. Good, lets the world know about it, bad you get blamed for it and become a 
blacklisted nation.

That is what happened with Spain circa 1918. They announced it was in their country and got blamed for it despite the fact till this day we do not know where it started.

2-I am twice vaccinated with moderna and not an anti vaxxer, but it is why you wait a little bit before you get a vaccine or booster. Several of my senior friends were waiting in line to be the first to get a booster and now because of omnicrom are not sure whether it will work."
2021-11-28 15:09,"Another article that uses anecdotal statements to back up claims to follow a narrative that reinforces a worldview and gets clicks. 

It's misleading to state the West is hoarding vaccines by citing ""just over 10 percent of people in Africa have received one dose of a vaccine,"" without any mention of the distribution infrastructure and coordination required to have over a 60% rollout on such a large continent."

These are the kind of ""Scientists"" who need a good solid injection of common sense and they need to learn that we should be about saving lives rather than indulging in politically correct group think.

Yes, we should be subsidising South African mitigation big time, and yes, we should be adopting infection control measures everywhere, but it's 100% definite that stopping people sharing and spreading the virus on planes does help."
2021-11-28 14:39,"As an epidemiologist, I haven’t heard a single other epidemiologist advocate for travel bans since many epidemiologists made the mistake of recommending them in early 2020.

COVID is endemic, we have to live with it.

Having looked closely at the data, the chances are overwhelmingly that the news and Twitter and now governments are panicking irrationally, far more than deserved by this new variant. The fears that vaccines are rendered ineffective to protect against infection have already happened with Delta, and the failure of the world to adopt the appropriately updated paradigm in COVID could now cause people in S Africa to starve from misguided beliefs that their strain poses a threat larger than what we’ve seen"

With vaccines for children, and boosters for the elderly and everyone else, there is a chance of achieving herd immunity in the US this winter.
After COVID has been defeated in the US, President Biden should work with our allies and with the World Health Organization to ensure a worldwide program to help vaccinate poor people around the world.  Otherwise, mutated versions of COVID will just return again next year."
2021-11-28 13:51,"The emergence of a new coronavirus variant is a wake-up call. Disruption of an integrated global economy might occur for some time to come. Three factors work against controlling the virus spread: (a) it is impossible to vaccinate over 7 billion people; (b) negationism-anti-vaccination dominates the mindset of large segments of society; (c)  politics and the economy guide the outlook of consumers and investors. Thus, certain media outlets instilling fear make an uncertain economic"
2021-11-28 12:59,"A few thoughts on genomic surveillance - according to GISAID: 
In Europe among countries with significant populations AND number of cases UK is the leader on genomic surveillance, with 13.8% of all positive cases sequenced. Russia leads in having cute acronyms for its coronavirus genetics programs (CORGI) but sequences only 0.065% of thousands of its daily cases. Ukraine sequences 0.012%, and Turkey - 0.471%. Basically we don't know any more about new variants in most of Europe, than we do about India (0.36%) or Botswana (1.13%).
In United States the overall level of surveillance is 5.8%, but it greatly varies between the states. Massachusetts and Vermont sequence 21.1% and 31.1% of their cases, topping UK surveillance coverage. But Oklahoma with its 1.13% falls below South Africa (1.25%). 
Should we ban travel from Oklahoma?"

2021-11-28 8:23,"As ye sow, so shall ye reap. Those looking for African scapegoats for the Omicron outbreak should first look in the mirror. When developed countries rushed to the front of the queue for vaccines while the poorest countries languished waiting their turn — even as the richest launched third booster shot campaigns, the vaccination rate in the poorest countries remained a measly 2.2 percent at the end of September — they created vast mutation factories for the virus. That’s what happens to viruses ricocheting around in large unvaccinated populations of people without the infrastructure to manufacture vaccines or the money to buy them. So here we are, riches notwithstanding, facing a mutation which may be more deadly, more transmissible and may have the tools to evade the limited protections from vaccines. Anyone who thinks wealth, privilege, devil-take-the-hindmost attitudes and Whack-a-Mole travel restrictions ensure safety in this interconnected world should revisit Edgar Allan Poe’s The Masque of the Red Death and think about the consequences of hiding behind walls of arrogance and indifference."

And another saying it’s too soon, with so little known yet. The article’s early claims that “rich” nations are “hoarding” vaccines look different when, later in the article, we hear that African nations have millions of shots that are expiring, useless, due to citizens’ refusals to take them. We hear of lack of infrastructure there to distribute them. And we have some of those problems ourselves, actually. It’s irresponsible to gin up angers with blaming in bold print while getting to more honest analysis little and late. Wish you wouldn’t."
2021-11-28 12:15,"Why would you put up an inflammatory headline saying that ‘African nations face blame’?
This is ridiculous and irresponsible. Normal, thinking humans are not blaming Africa, or anyone, for the emergence of a variant of COVID 19. Why sow division and escalate controversy? 
I have lived and worked in Africa many of the years of my life, and I am truly impressed at the response that many African countries have had to this virus in terms of testing, mitigation measures, vaccination; and now, genomic research of the virus.

Yesterday (Saturday) eight deaths were reported and this morning (Sunday) only two. For the preceding week it was low as well. This is for the whole of South Africa with its 60+ million people. 

Systems have deteriorated since the end of white rule but medical reporting is still at a high standard so while there may be under-reporting it is not grossly so. What is going on? There is a theory that a very high percentage of the black population has had the virus and are now immune. This is based on at least two surveys that I know of but the real figure is not known.

But this is not good and blame can be put everywhere, and include Facebook with that.  That is the FACT I am here now, it is not easy for me to get out. Thank the stars I am triple vaccinated...but...we don't know yet what that means now, do we?  USA,, shame on you. Paranoia instead of real action. And other EU nations.  GET THE WORD OUT.  Tell Africans that the vaccines are not some ""Bill Gates Death"" fluid, or what ever.  And Zambia, I sure hope is not hit bad by this.

here are the Facts that we know
1)
Both, Vaccinated and un-vaccinated people are still going to be infected.  
The unvaccinated are more likely to be severely infected and hospitalized

2)Both are spreaders as well. As per usdavis.edu recent study the virus in vaccinated and unvaccinated is no different.

3) At present, The top 6 states that have the highest coved cases are Blue states.  Michigan with its most stringent Mask Mandates and Vaccination rules is the First.
(Souce: NyTimes covid status)
Heck, Florida with no vaccination mandate and no mask mandate is better than California currently.

The hole thing is politicized.  
What is the problem.
Vaccination is not complete, it helps reduce the risk but that is it.  Don't blame the unvaccinated for any of the issues. 

I am not against vaccination,  I am vaccinated and plan to take a booster shot by the end of the year.  I don't go out without wearing a mask and wish all would wear as mask as well."

They did the right thing. Their failure to notify could have had much worse consequences for them and the world as a whole. I hope that the international community will reward South Africa for its openness with an ample supply of available vaccines as soon as possible. It's only fair that they are given a priority in this regard.

Now that we know how damaging it could be for a country to alert the international community about discovering a new variant, which in all likelihood could happen again, the world's response must be more calculated and balanced. A kneejerk reaction not only appears punitive, but it can also be a cause of severe damage to the country's economy. With the negative consequences of reporting a new variant in mind, most countries might feel compelled not to notify WHO and the world community about discovering a new variant. And that would be the worst thing we could do to the world community that has so far failed to bring the pandemic crisis under control in the last two years."

The word ""note"" is a factive; it implies the truth of the statement that is being ascribed to the officials.

If you allow people through, like many places that claim to have them do, whether citizens or permanent residents, then, those aren’t really travel restrictions! 
You have to stop everybody, no exceptions! That would actually be real “travel restrictions!” 
Second, we have to start talking about vaccine hesitancy in Africa and other poorer parts of the world! 
There are vaccines in Africa that people there have declined to have, hoping to get what they view as better ones later, if they decide to get any at all. 
We’re only talking about the lack of vaccines there and hoarding by richer countries, which is happening. But we don’t even know how much hesitancy is going on there!! 
People who have friends and relatives there will tell one people there are refusing to have the vaccines already there!! 
I’ve spoken to friends and relatives there for months now, and some have told me they’re “waiting” or that people don’t want to have, for instance Astra Zeneca, in one of the countries!! This is happening all over the continent! 
At some point it needs to be highlighted and addressed because if there’s as much hesitancy as there also seems to be, then, getting the so called “better” vaccines there might not help vaccination either!!"
2021-11-28 10:55,"Vaccine suspicion in Africa is high and somehow justifiable. In 1999, British journalist Edward Hooper wrote The River: A Journey to the Source of HIV/AIDS. He speculated that the virus that causes AIDS transitioned from monkeys to humans via a polio vaccine. Scientists and medical scholars have provided plentiful evidence to discount Hooper’s ideas, but media attention has served to support conspiracy theories from the rich countries against the poor countries. It is necessary to invest in the creation of a vaccination culture in the poor countries. Brazil has done just that and so far, it has managed to immunize 62.15% of its population against COVID. As Jacobson versus Massachusetts case established more than 100 years ago, individual liberties can and should be limited to protect the public’s health."

Religiously.  I blame those same nations for hoarding vaccine.

Blame doesn't do anyone any good.  The only way we are going to get out of this deadly mess is for all to come together to make absolutely certain that they themselves and everyone else care about the welfare of the planet.  And then we need to direct the funds away from the greedy to get the job done.

And when I say the welfare of the planet, I mean just that.  How many of you know that the white-tailed deer population in many states is also infested with COVID?  Look it up."

The news story, shame on cable news and others, is all about the blame game.  For once, be serious and actually respect science and human lives.

If a variant is found to potentially be high risk then both disseminating these facts far and wide, along with travel bans are prudent.  

Maybe the media wants a shut down again - often seems since trump gloom and doom - and the forcing of it is the US capitalistic agenda.  Enough. We need to get this pandemic under control.  History will judge you all as amateurs, deathly risk-takers, and so many greedy - with money as the foundation of motives and actions.

I am fed up.  I am watching European news to find an oasis from what is happening in the US and the environment.  They are serious and likely will be stabilized before America.  Rome is calling and you all are answering.  History repeats itself.  Greed...hate...rinse...repeat."
2021-11-28 13:15,The African nations are absolutely right. The hoarding of vaccines by the West has surely resulted in the development of the latest Coronavirus variants. It's the old I'm Alright Jack perversion at its worst.
2021-11-27 21:04,"Over Sixty percent of globally reported cases of Covid 19 is in Europe. In wealthy developed countries there is a false sense of security of having been vaccinated and evinced by increased global travel, and failure to take recommended precautions. With that said how can any source be so certain of where the new variant originated. Take heed developed countries Europe remains the epi center of the pandemic, not Africa which is a problem for everybody - poor and rich alike."
2021-11-28 15:58,The powers that be should have worked towards a more equitable vaccine distribution. Citizens of wealthy countries who cornered the market early are in the streets protesting and refusing to get vaccinated. We are all at risk until more people globally are vaccinated. Anyone anywhere who wants to be vaccinated should have access to do so.
2021-11-28 16:07,Blame does no one any good. The most important thing is to take what we've learned from the first two outbreaks and apply the best of that to managing the spread of this new mutation in the best way possible.

Later in the article it notes that over 30% of SA residents are vaccinated but that many have avoided vaccines out of misinformation, superstition, fear.  So which is it?
While I agree that we need greater distribution of vaccines worldwide, our own (U.S.) experience shows us we can't even get our population  vaccinated: nearly 50% of adult Michiganders remain unvaccinated, and are flooding hospitals.  Is it vaccine inaccessibility here, and around the world (where vaccines can be gotten) or is it us?
The 'blame game' seems to be affecting notably nations where the mutations seemingly arise, but also our international forums."

2021-11-28 16:47,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus is showing us how interconnected and interdependent we are. But we humans are obviously not prepared to fully appreciate and act in accord to this fact. The virus spread is strictly the result of human behavior - we have full control. It comes down to our wits versus their genes. As David Quammen concluded ""Viruses can evolve, quickly and efficaciously. But we humans are smart, sometimes."" The irony is there are a lot of smart humans out there, working to meet the challenge of this pandemic, but they apparently are in the minority."

The military is great at figuring out and executing logistics involved—transport of equipment and supplies, erecting portable clinics, etc."
2021-11-28 17:03,"The current slate of vaccines do not produce sterilizing antibodies so vaccinated individuals can harbor and spread the virus.  This means that a mass vaccination strategy alone is not sufficient to stopping the replication and transmission of the virus and the emergence of new variants.  So when new, potentially troublesome variants like omicron emerge, and they will, then other more restrictive strategies are warranted despite our frustration and fatigue.  If we rely on solely on vaccinations then we will be sorely sorry."
2021-11-28 17:06,"Actors in the blame game have forgotten the most important point.  If the coronavirus escaped from a laboratory on Wuhan (which I believe is the prevalent view although I'm not sure about this), who was the person (or persons) whose negligence opened the door to a world-wide  pandemic?  Where are they now and have they fully comprehended what these dangerous experiments have done to the entire world?"
2021-11-28 17:09,"Partially immunized and immunosuppressed people (those infected with HIV, being treated for cancer or inflammatory disease, organ transplant recipients, and many others) are incubators for novel versions of SARS-Cov-2. A huge portion of the world's population falls into this category. Viruses are all unstable genetically and we're fortunate SARS-Cov-2 is more stable than most and doesn't swap genetic fragments through random encounters unlike influenza for example. But still, variants, some very dangerous, are inevitable. The unevenness of human immune response to infection and immunization and variation in the genetics of the virus and the viral load to which potential hosts are exposed means Covid won't go away through past infection or immunization. This is now obvious as 1/3rd of current new infections are in vaccinated people. Control requires, in addition to vaccination, social distancing, masks, limitations on indoor gatherings, improved ventilation and travel restrictions - domestic and foreign - the strictness of which calibrated carefully to current and predicted infection rates. Americans and the British refuse to accept this, consequently the epidemic has never been managed in either country with the consequent disease, disability, death topping the developed world. Worse, American authorities have been promoting shopping, travel, attending sports matches, holiday parties, and frequenting bars and restaurants. The Thanksgiving hangover will be horrendous."
2021-11-28 17:26,"The message here is quite simple, the longer the virus persists in any community the greater the opportunity it has to mutate. Those who are vaccine hesitant simply MUST follow the guidelines for masking and distance. Those who are vaccinated should also be following guidelines because, as we have seen with the delta variant, they can still transmit the virus even though they may not show symptoms. Rugged individualism is all well and good but there are times when collective action is necessary and this is one of those times. Freedom and liberty are grand concepts but there is no “right to infect”."

For us the technology is social media, Facebook in particular, and the our change in environment is Covid-19. Misinformation spread by FB is a huge factor in anti-vaccine movements both in the US and outside of the US including Africa. It is severely hampering our ability to wage what should be a straightforward vaccine campaign, which of course has resulted in mutations like Omicron.

It would be far more effective to shut down Facebook than it would be to stop international flights at this point. FB is killing us on multiple fronts."

Resistance to the vaccine is high in Africa, as it is with most vaccines and care offered from the west.  The WHO and numerous volunteers have seen this for decades.  I'm not saying that more vaccines shouldn't be made available, and thought that was one mission for the WHO, but I am saying that the vaccination rate is not just tied to availability."

that are coronaviruses.

2021-11-28 16:45,"Have we learned nothing?  Travel bans are effective, when implemented early… not several days after the fact.  700 people per day have been flying into the UK from South Africa since Omicron was discovered on November 11th (yes, they knew about it then… not November 24th the day WHO decided to talk about it).  If it’s in the UK, it’s in Italy, Spain, Germany and France not to mention every other country in the EU, and Israel and UAE.  Not to mention Singapore and China.  Which means it’s everywhere based on simple math.

Will it be worse than Delta? Probably not, but that’s a risk not worth taking while states like Michigan, Wisconsin, are seeing surges that rival the Deep South a few months ago.  If it’s on par with Delta, we would witness a surge unlike anything we have seen thus far; in vaccinated and unvaccinated folks.

Is it punishing areas like South Africa that have advanced and significant testing campaigns that dwarf anything the US is doing?  Probably… but it should only be done to buy time.  If we are going to allow air travel at all, which is for the most part a luxury and not a necessity, then it should be done with the caveat that there may be times where air travel just isn’t permissible.

We all know these liars and their families are all well protected by the very vaccines they decry. And I cannot understand this whole stop the world from traveling scenario.

2021-11-28 15:44,"We have the means but, so far, lack the will to stop this pandemic.  A large subculture of freedom without responsibility undermines our ability to take effective collective action.

IF ... Omicron is an (immune) escape mutation, we will have a Do Over opportunity.  The strategy for stopping such a virus in its early stages is straightforward, but must be executed quickly and universally before spread gets beyond our capacity to control cases. We must avoid the ineffective and even counterproductive actions of 2019 and 2020.

We are not off to a good start.  The travel bans put in place may slow spread a bit, while scientists figure out how transmissible Omicron is, whether it escapes immunity and how likely it is to result in severe illness. But, the bans leak like sieves and the virus probably started to spread from its source some time ago. To have any real chance of stopping Omicron, we must assume spread has already started in the U.S. and take quick and effective action.

IF .. Omicron is as dangerous as it could be, let's not repeat our mistakes.  Let's apply all of the tools we have - testing, isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, vaccination, mask wearing, social distancing, etc.  If we do this quickly and universally, cases today will not be able to create infectious contact with enough (unprotected) susceptible people and will fail to replicate sufficiently to spread.

We can do this if all Americans commit to stopping the virus.  That is the challenge."

Mutations happen all the time and there are many. So the most important thing is to get the vaccines out to all countries as rapidly as possible. One country left out means we're all at risk . 

The Media shouldn't blame countries, especially ones who have little access to the vaccines,  else they may, like China, be reluctant to share critical information. We have to get Moderna to give up some rights to create vaccine centers throughout the world. Moderna was funded by tax payer money and NIH research. US has some patent rights here. The current model is great for monopolistic US healthcare, but not for the rest of the world.

If influenza hit the world for the first time ever this year the amount of death would be staggering. Likely far more that Covid. But we have evolved with influenza and now we have to evolve with covid.

The vaccines are great and I was happy to get it. But we have to live in reality. People will not be restrained from life.

The virus has to be left to run. This will become apparent to all over the next few months as we watch the country run through another wave while Florida (which basically already allowed the virus to run through.) keeps a lower infection rate."

But his ego got in the way, and as a result of the escalating waves of infection nationally and worldwide, much of it is on him and his “freedom” loving cohort, who have felt free to constrict my life with their wanton disregard for anyone but themselves."

I suspect it is because Trump, in his rude and crude fashion, was first to point fingers at the Wuhan Institute for Virology. The Liberal media immediately assumed he was just being racist and dismissed the notion. In fact, all evidence currently suggests that the virus was unleashed however accidentally by Chinese scientists and, what's more, after it got out Chinese authorities did not take appropriate measures to limit its spread. Instead, they lied about transmission and let the population of Wuhan travel for the Lunar New Year. Therein lies the origins of this pandemic which, almost two years later, is still terrorizing the world."

The wealthy left town, including King Charles II and his court, and stopped interacting with people outside.  The less literate and poor were the victims.  When things appeared to be getting better, people took the same kind of risks we see today.  They originally thought a comet that flew over London a year before caused it.

2021-11-28 16:17,"Looking at the most ""popular"" comments, it seems like the main problem that humanity has had with controlling COVID is shown in spades: inability to operate logically and cohesively: tribal nonsense rears its ugly head (again).

Travel bans only DELAY transmission and does not prevent it. If you do nothing with the time it buys, it is worthless. Even before omicron, the U.S. was simply unable to operate cohesively in a once a century pandemic to get broad testing and then later broad vaccination in place (given its fragmented healthcare system, political system and economic model).

This is the ugly part of human nature. When even the threat of illness and even possibly death cannot outweigh the emotionalism of tribalism."
2021-11-28 16:30,"Travel bans are merely a speed bump before the open road straight away where, if truly a highly contagious variant, Omicron will accelerate to the red line.

""Mariners returning to Europe in 1346 brought back tales of a deadly plague that left thousands of corpses piles up in cities throughout China and India.

The next year the news came in a more ghastly form, as trading ships sailed into European ports with virtually all their crew dead or dying of the plague.

Tradesmen infected with the bubonic plague in the Crimea spread the disease to Sicily, and from there to North Africa and to southern Italy.

Within months all of Europe was consumed by the plague, which soon came to be known as the 'Black Death'. 

[...]

As the plague spread from country to country, it devastated whole populations. By 1348 millions were dying in England, France, Germany and Austria.""

2021-11-28 15:49,"Israel has the correct approach: ban travel period until more is known. This is prudent, universal, objective, and puts paid to all the rubbish coming from certain South African scientists who should know better than to complain about the country being ""victimized"" for telling the truth about the discovery of a potentially serious new variant. Any scientist who would hide the truth for fear of economic repercussions has become a politician and should have their science credentials revoked. Politicians who conceal such public health risks should be criminally prosecuted for public endangerment, including one very famous one from the start of this pandemic. 

I think we need to assume that this variant is now present all over the world because of the incubation period between the time it starts to spread until it is recognized. It only spreads through the air that infected people expel, so the more infected people that are moving about the world, the more this new variant of the pandemic is likely to spread between countries. Banning travel as early and as thoroughly as possible is the only rapid defense mechanism the world has until more is known about the risks it poses, and international vaccine programs become more widespread and effective."

I am hopeful, but not optimistic that we will help, but we have done something similar before.  After WWII unlike after WWI, the U.S. and other countries helped Germany get back on it's feet.  It was called the Marshall Plan.  It is an understatement to say politically it was difficult to pass the necessary legislation.  However, it is not an understatement to say it helped save Germany from a far worse fate.

The divide between the super rich and the rest of us is already a serious problem in the U.S.  The ability of a democracy to function in difficult times is virtually impossible if a country can't meet the basic needs of it's people for a good education, good healthcare, adequate housing and the availability of meaningful employment.  Why should people trust what a government says about a vaccine when it can't trust them to provide safe drinking water, clean air, a good eduction and meaningful work that allows them to raise their family properly?

After all, we live on one small planet and our current problem with viruses is hard evidence about the fact we can't defend ourselves if we don't demonstrate we care about care about all of us."

To create space for desperately needed progressive change, one must first win elections, but among the chief reasons Mr. Biden and the Democrats have plunged in popularity is the flow of thousands of untested migrants entering the US daily.

Why are all African nations facing blame here?  South Africa is an outlier among African nations.  Almost all of Africa has had VERY low vaccination rates AND also VERY low Covid-related mortality.  Africa doesn't seem to need widespread vaccination against the virus like most other nations do.  But maybe Omicron will now help the pharmaceutical industry start helping this continent....

There are a number of hypotheses why Africa is faring so well against Covid (but none of them seem sufficient to explain the numbers), e.g. young median ages/short life expectancies/few nursing homes, low testing rates, population genetic characteristics, prior exposure to corona-viruses and tropical parasites, as well as exposure to antimalarial drugs, ivermectin, etc..

So, imo, we should be trying to learn from the situation in African nations and not accusing them as being a threat to the world.  If there is any need for blame here, our profit-amassing pharmaceutical industry seems a better target, to my eyes.  Rather than producing conventional (inactivated whole virus/Al adjuvants) Covid vaccines, Big Pharma has elected to play 'evolutionary whack-a-mole' against SARS-CoV-2 variants... where each of THEIR (mRNA/lipid nanoparticle) vaccine variants and booster shots come with a huge profit.

The very different treatment of this new variant by different media outlets is interesting.

We were still wrestling with the question of whether to prioritize booster shots for our own people or to ship vaccines overseas, when Omicron struck. The real question is who ""owns"" the vaccines. Most decent people recognize that public good (global public good) should trump profits, especially since the profiteers are not the same people who actually invented or discovered the vaccines. Yes, profit should not be an obstacle to global distribution. But one can acknowledge that point and still argue that Western nations have a right to put their own people first."

So wrong!  In order to survive, viruses must mutate if their host is no longer available.

Certainly, it is a moral obligation of wealthier countries to help poorer countries fight Covid-19.
But the idea that working towards a 70% vaccination rate is somehow 'hoarding' strikes me as preposterous.  The fact is that governments have the obligation to first help their own citizens and then to help others as they may.
The amount of government funds the U.S. has expended to develop and distribute these vaccines is unprecedented in human history.

Airlines or US government could pay for tests and give them out to passengers debarking from planes.  

Instead we manage with broken system, and not too many people dying, or knowing for sure they got the virus from their flight, and in a pinch, the government will bail out the airlines partially. The airlines are mostly too stupid and shortsighted and Trump like, as is the Biden administration and the FAA to do otherwise."

I know I’m lucky that my immediate family is awesome and love every moment I’m around them, but even if you are married to a mini-Trump or have a bunch of jerky kids, please just consider taking this time to live a quiet(ish) life. Try learning a second language or picking up a new hobby or drinking a lot of whisky - whatever you desire. But the traveling all over the place. Just stop. These aren’t normal times and unless we want to be gobbled up by every new variant, we need time for more people to get vaccinated."

It's bad enough we have to deal with the homegrown ignorant unvaccinated but tests are showing some  foreign travelors are using fake negative tests to fly into  the United States or other countries.  Just because some infected people slipped into the nation doesn't mean we should just let it continue. There is a huge difference between a few hundred getting in and tens of thousands. 

Yes travel bans and closing the border does work in helping to protect the common people.  If such things don't work in keeping out potential threats then why is it the White House, congress and the unber rich all have  fences, gates and private or public security to keep them safe. 

I am also tired of hearing about the plight of so called poor countries where they always  seem to have a very  large segment of wealthy elites. We have been giving them money , supplies and medicine for decades at the expense of American citizens. They don't need more from us, they need better management of what we have given them and that is not our problem. Time for them to sort things out for themselves."

I understand that the science is constantly changing, but from the beginning of this pandemic it's been one messaging misstep after another. Masks don't help; oh wait, they do help. Disinfect your groceries before you bring them inside; oh wait, not necessary. Sneeze guards! Oh wait, no sneeze guards. Gloves! No, never mind. And now it's travel bans.

Enough already! Is it any wonder nobody trusts anybody? We have enough misinformation on social media without all this."

Imposing travel restrictions merely slows global transmission, it does not stop it. Vaccination lessens the severity, but does not stop a person from getting, or spreading it. We could lock down the borders of all 192 countries, vaccinate all 7.9 billion of us on earth, completely destroy global travel and trade, devastate our economies, and guess what,  we'd STILL be living with COVID.

However, we know a lot more about it. Here's the scale:

Total global infections to date: 261MM.
Total global deaths to date: 5.2 MM
Total human population: 7.9 B.

That's right, about 3% of the world has been infected, and .06% have died of it, and the large majority of those deaths are within small demographics: The elderly, and those with underlying conditions/comorbidities. This isn't the Black Plague. 

We need to stop thinking this is going away, we need to adjust to it. Should we take reasonable steps? Get vaccinated, mask on public transportation, wash hands often, take extra precautions around the elderly? Certainly. 

But should we slam borders down, keep kids out of school, badly damage our economic and social lives, and hide under the table like frightened puppies every time a new strain is discovered? 

No."
2021-11-28 21:12,"The health security should not be driven by hysteria

The Omicron variant make me think about something similar

The Mosquito Tiger invaded the south of France some years ago, nearly replacing the old local mosquito much less virulent.

Through the time the tiger mosquisto was feared and fiercely fought, before the Covid started, the tiger mosquito started to disappear and be replaced by some soft and less painful mosquitoes. 

was it a variant or the return of the old mosquito ?

It doesn't matter, it appear that only the soft mosquito species which are less fought can survive, and I bet the Covid virus will react the same, realizing that it can spread only if he's less deadly, he will become soft trough new variant. (mutation is something else that has not appeared yet for the Covid)."

There is no evidence whatsoever that this new variant is a threat to the vaccinated, and yet, within just three days of copycat media headlines, politicians are overreacting.  It is mind boggling and depressing."

2021-11-28 21:21,"Most commenters are focusing on whether the rich countries are at fault for hoarding vaccines when the more pressing issue is what to do now to prevent preventable deaths. Several scientists were quoted in the article saying that limits on travel are far from enough. 

Here is the US we have done too little at almost every point in the pandemic: too little testing, too little sequencing, too little contact tracing, and too little support for those who need to quarantine. Some responses, like mask mandates or occupancy limitations indoors need to be tailored to local conditions, but when local governments won't do it, then what?

And it should not be the case that some states (Florida and Texas) are not sequencing only 4% of samples.  Nor should it be possible for governors to pass laws to prevent local mayors, businesses, and schools from requiring masks. 

Allowing Covid to simmer and sometimes rage (like September in the south) is a plan that has far more costs than has been acknowledged. How many people will have what kind of long-term health problems? We don't know. Trauma and burnout among healthcare workers is another cost that we have not reckoned with.

Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and China are handling the virus well. The US is not. We allow levels of virus incidence that few other countries allow. We shouldn't throw too many stones at South Africa; it is quite likely that this country will be the source of a dangerous mutation in the future."
2021-11-28 20:16,"The headline that travel bans ""may do more harm than good"" is dangerously misleading pretzel logic. 

The case as presented is:

1. ""Travel bans will have negative economic impact on targeted countries"": Irrelevant for purposes of viral containment. Even if economic harm were relevant, the economic impact of a travel ban would be dwarfed by that of a global vaccine-resistant Covid wave. 

2. ""the Omicron variant could yet fizzle out"": Blind optimism and scientifically prudent approaches have little in common.

3. Wealthier countries are causing resentment because they failed to send vaccines earlier / ""Told you so"": Good for you. Irrelevant to the utility of a travel ban. 

4. Wealthier countries ""should ramp up testing and vaccinations"": Everyone knows. Not a counterargument to travel bans.

5. Restrictions ""may discourage other nations from reporting variant cases"": We should allow a worse-Covid variant in, or else people might not tell us about other bad variants? Insane pretzel logic. The point of reporting is to prevent global outbreaks of Covid variants via containment.

5. ""If all we do is a travel ban-"" It isn't. Does the writer seriously think the CDC hears about Omicron and shrugs? 

This isn't about historic fairness or any one nation's economic wellbeing: it's about stopping another pandemic wave. Travel bans are an important containment tool. The NYT needs to be more responsible with their headlines, lest they actually persuade someone."

2021-11-28 21:42,"Blaming any country is ridiculous. This is an equal opportunity virus and a new variant can occur and spread anywhere, especially in poorer countries.  Banning travel until more is known may be sensible, but blaming is no more than a form of prejudice."
2021-11-28 21:17,COVID uses air travel to spread globally.  In order to stop the spread of mutated variants air travel needs to be suspended world wide until the majority of the world’s population is vaccinated.  Unfortunately this won’t happen under global capitalism; because capital takes precedent over human life.

We can stand by and do nothing.  Or we can help them with vaccines and education.  Either way, we need to do something.  Otherwise, sooner or later Omicron will spread to here if we don't seal the borders tight enough."

Extremely effective COVID treatments will be invented and those in rich countries in the Global North will forget about COVID, either being vaccinated or knowing if they do get it they can treat it easily. But it will continue to kill hundreds of thousands of people in the Global South, particularly in Africa, every year. More than 1 million people die each year in Africa of each AIDS and Tuberculosis. That’s over 2 million lives lost a year to infectious diseases that are either preventable or treatable, and COVID will be added to that list. The current hoarding of vaccines is a grim indicator of how rich countries will ignore these deaths once they are relegated to the Global South."
2021-11-27 21:43,What is troublesome about the emergence of this COVID-19 mutation is that unvaccinated people may continue to be hesitant since it was reported today that Pfizer indicated it needs 100 days to retool their current vaccination formula.

And the reduction in deaths from either Merck or Pfizer is not that significant (7% vs. 1%). There were also adverse events in 20% of patients and serious long-term fertility issues for women with both (neither of these are new drugs). And neither will be producing much anytime soon. 

Bottom line is, vaccination is still the key. These drugs are a last gasp for the unintelligent and unhealthy. Literally."

It is necessary and fair for all who enjoy the benefits of new drugs and vaccines to share in their costs. There is nothing wrong with drug companies making a profit - this motivates them to do the important work that they do.

It is good that companies like Merck and Pfizer are making these drugs available to countries that are truly poor. But wealthier countries, including Brazil, should share in the costs.  Brazil is not a poor country, though it has a sizable portion of its population living in poverty. The US also has many poor people.  Brazil should pay its fair  share.

What is infuriating to US patients is that we often pay 5 to 10 times more for medicines than other wealthy nations like Europe and Canada. This is something Congress very much needs to address.

And one more important issue: a  major factor in the high costs of drugs in the US is inappropriate litigation, by both private citizens and in many cases public officials. Multi-billion dollar verdicts are awarded based on junk science, emotion, and politics.  This very much contributes to the high cost of drugs.  The US needs tort reform."

2021-11-16 16:04,"I'm sincerely glad that Pfizer is making this decision, but...
1. It ought to be made so more widely to include those other countries, upper-middle income or not
2. Now both Pfizer (which is still doing better than Moderna!), AND Moderna (and, J&J, too) need to make their vaccine available for manufacture and/or distribution FAR nore widely to those same countreis that will be able to avail themselves of the pill. Treatment will not prevent the continued appearence of variants, any one of which coud render the vaccines we have (and the treatments, too) obsolete."
2021-11-16 16:23,"Will Pfizer allow North Americans the same pricing?

It used to be back in the first half of the 20th century that companies developed vaccines, pills, etc. to benefit *all* the people at a reasonable (if not free) price. Not their pockets."
2021-11-16 16:27,"How come Pfizer who does not own the covid19 patent is calling it Pfizer vaccine. So who really owns the right to sell the patent to other countries, is it the German company. Someday there will be a country who says I am strong enough to break these patent rules. To save lives I am going to make these drugs, come and get me.  Just like China now says I am not going to obey American rule not buying oil from Iran, come and get me. How does American react they don't talk about it. No sanctions on China."
2021-11-16 16:28,"Thank you, Pfizer, for recognizing that we share one world.  We don't escape the world's problems just because we live on a separate continent.  We can't just be tourists, we really do have to be neighbors."

What’s the rationale for Brazil being excluded? There’s nothing we can do with the M.P.P. or Pfizer to get them included: It’s take it or leave it. So you take whatever scraps come your way, because how can you say no?” ""

Is Pfizer really interested in 'curing' a pandemic or increasing  $36 billion this year to $56 billion next year?

So much has and is wrong with this program to cure this pandemic. And Pfizer is still the winner at #1 and the only one. Why? What is in that original contract signed by Pfizer & the US Government back in the summer of 2020?  Even the splitting up of the profits with the German Co. Bio-N-Tech favors Pfizer side of the equation."
2021-11-16 16:49,"I don't even have to read this article to be infuriated.  ""Cheap to other countries ....""  

It is not just Pfizer to blame, as other drug makers are in the same snakebite. It is our healthcare-for-profit, big-pharma, insurance companies, and most esp. our government that continues to place their best interests above humanity's.

We live on a tightrope dangling over a 700 foot cliff due to the insanity and inexcusable rationale of those making money and laws against the better interests of all of us.

2021-11-16 17:17,"This is excellent news. The developing world relies on cheaper generic drugs to make a serious dent in the spread of disease.  Cheap generic drugs produced in India to deal with HIV saved Africa.

2021-11-16 17:23,"We need to vaccinate everyone in the world.  That is the only way to defeat COVID.
President Biden should work with our allies and with the World Health Organization to ensure a worldwide program to help vaccinate poor people around the world.  Otherwise, COVID will just return again next year.

Now get out there and keep working and paying your taxes so the insatiably greedy 0.01% and their 9.9% operatives in every segment of OUR society can make even more obscene wealth."
2021-11-16 19:03,"The comments, and the article are ridiculous. And I don’t work for Pfizer, BTW, but I know what it takes to develop a medicine. 

So we want these innovators to come up with new medicines, give them away for free, and still yell at them?

Pfizer didn’t take any money from the government. They aren’t making money on the vaccine either. 

Would it help if they were broke and there would be no one to discover and manufacture these medicines?

I’m just amazed at the comments. Just goes to show how people don’t know the effort that’s involved in clinical trials to bring medicines to market - which is entirely funded privately. Moderna is the exception. 

Once Brazil fixes the liability rules to align with UN principles, they can get the medicines too. They are off the charts in terms of MPP guidelines."

2021-11-16 19:31,"It is a great news for all humans.

We have many crisis to deal with, like inflation. Why do we have inflation? Because supply chain is disrupted severely by the pandemic. It is NOT just a moral problem to vaccinate or provide affordable medicines to poor countries, it is also necessary to solve the supply chain problem and curb inflation in US.

Giving poor countries affordable medicines and vaccines can prevent strict lockdowns in future. It means that all factories overseas will continue to produce cheap goods for wealthy countries and reduce inflation. US heavily relies on global supply chain. The current highly inflation is because strict lockdowns in poor countries suspended numerous factories that manufactured electronics goods, automobiles, and all other goods that wealthy countries including the US stopped to produce many years ago.

It will benefit all of us. Thanks you, Pfizer and Merck, for providing cheap pills to poor countries. It is a great step to conquer economic difficulties caused by the pandemic."

After Haiti, Jamaica has the lowest vaccination rate in the Caribbean - if they don't need the Pfizer pill, I don't know who does. This just encourages Jamaica to buy only enough pills to distribute to any visiting foreign tourists who become ill, and for their own governing elite. I do not know by what metric Jamaica is deemed a 'middle income nation,' but Pfizer and Merck execs should be treated to a little tour even short distances away from resort areas. The poverty in Jamaica is staggering. Ditto probably all these nations. If they are categorized somehow as 'middle income' it is only because their nations' .1% have stolen and amassed exceptional amounts of income that get mashed into a meaningless 'average' income.

Nevertheless, they each received their second dose of the vaccine yesterday. They did it for the teacher in their school undergoing cancer treatment, for their 9 year old neighbor with a lung disease, for other children who can’t yet receive the vaccine, for the doctors and nurses who have worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic, and for everyone else in our community. The vaccine is the best protection we have right now to prevent contracting and spreading this virus and getting vaccinated is the responsible and loving thing to do."

It's also obvious that the principal reason so many Americans are unvaccinated is the flood tide of disinformation about Covid-19 and the vaccines.   Ergo, we need to combat the disinformation that is largely spread on Facebook, Twitter and Fox News.  These corporations make big bucks catering to the ant-vax crowd, which means they are profiting from a disease that kills more than a thousand Americans a day.   That's shameful, unpatriotic and sociopathic, and these companies have a moral duty to promote vaccination.

2021-11-25 14:14,"I was deeply relieved when our kids were finally able to get the shot, but one of the tragedies of all this is that it took so long to get the approvals through.  There are many families with situations like those described in the article.  The FDA simply needs a new protocol for pandemic situations.  There was no reason to treat different age groups as fully independent; instead, the eligibility age should have been gradually decreased, while experimenting with slightly different doses and keeping a careful eye on adverse outcomes.  And the all-or-nothing way the question was posed also made no sense; there could have been a period during which they were fairly confident in the safety of the shot but not yet efficacy, and during that period it could have been offered to anyone willing to pay for it and submit to follow-up testing."

They are a preventative measure and actually work best on people who are, in fact, perfectly healthy."
2021-11-25 15:08,"Parents are weak only when they are uncertain; they are decisive and clear when they are certain.   Facts create oughts.  The more clearly something is known, the more true and unmistakable something becomes (vaccines save lives) the more ought quality it becomes the louder it clamors for particular action.  It calls for certain kinds of actions rather than others. If ethics, morals, and values are guides to action, then the best guides to decisive actions are the facts, the more ""facty"" they are the better guides to action they are.  If I know exactly what I am doing I don't hesitate even if my child protests, cries, is in pain.  Knowledge brings certainty of decision.

2021-11-25 15:28,"3.5 million sounds like a lot, but it's only about 1 in 8 eligible children who've received the vaccine. That's a slow roll-out and shows how much hesitancy is out there when it comes to their kids. Consult your pediatrician, not Dr. Facebook."
2021-11-25 13:17,Please remember those of us with children under the age of five who cannot be vaccinated. I live in the Midwest where vaccination rates are abysmal. Coworkers can’t understand why I continue to wear a mask; it’s because I love my child and will continue to take all precautions necessary until they can be vaccinated.
2021-11-25 15:24,"Our children got vaccinated because we know it will not only make them a bit safer, but also reduce community spread, making new variants less likely and therefore making the vaccinated population that much safer. Fewer overall cases means the virus won't evolve as fast and the elderly will be safer and the vaccines we already have will work better.

The way some parents do this calculation (where it's only their one child's risk vs. reward) reveals either a shocking lack of knowledge about how diseases work, or a shocking degree of selfishness. It's really hard for me to grasp. 

It's called a team effort, people."
2021-11-25 15:38,"I hope that parents don't believe that their vaccinated kids will be invincible.  Just like with adults, vaccinated children can still get and spread Covid-19.  We've seen the vaccine's effectiveness wear off over time for adults too, requiring boosters, so I hope that parents also keep that in mind.  

I have to say, I find nothing thrilling about this ordeal at all, neither the disease itself, which came from who-knows-where, nor the vaccines, which we have to hope are somewhat effective and have no bad long term effects (having been tested by Pfizer only on 1518 kids age 5-11 for around 2.5 months).

Sadly, we both have family members who are refusing the most obvious solution to a pandemic that's ruining lives. I don't have any empathy with their fears and/or beliefs in conspiracies; adults have the obligation to not only take care of themselves but others too -- without a lack of social responsibility comes a breakdown in humanity, which has now become the other pandemic for which there may never be a vaccine. Sad!"
2021-11-25 15:32,"Despite all the speculation that parents weren't going to allow their younger children to get the shot, shot appointments were booked solid for weeks as soon as ages 5 to 11 were approved.

Finally the youngest is vaccinated and we can visit at Christmas. My home town is a hot mess of high COVID, with anti masking, low vax rates. My father has diabetes and cancer. With rapid tests and vaccination, we can breathe a little easier about getting on that plane. With our KN95s."

Kids are adaptable. They'll be fine."

She can protect me (I take immunosuppressive medications for an autoimmune condition), her three living grandparents who we see multiple times per week, and also her younger sister who is too young to be vaccinated. Not to mention to multitude of others in our community with health conditions that put them at risk. This vaccine buys her the freedom to go back to in person learning, and I am so excited for her to get back to that option. Thankfully she has thrived in spite of everything, but she will greatly appreciate making friends in person and becoming more independent from mom and dad. I only wish her four year old sister was also eligible already."
2021-11-25 16:37,"Our school district has opened vaccine clinics in several of the middle schools for the 12 and under students.  From what I hear, every appointment for the next six weeks is booked and more people want access. Our whole family was so relieved when my nine year old granddaughter got her first shot.  She was the last in the family to get vaccinated and the minute the vaccine was approved for her age group her parents started looking for a vaccination appointment.  Their pediatrician didn’t have it because their office didn’t have the needed hyper cold storage available.  Such a relief when the school district stepped in. Vaccination rates in our city/state are very low and currently over a hundred children are hospitalized locally with COVID.  So don’t tell me kids don’t get COVID."
2021-11-25 16:43,"While I’m thrilled for these children and their families, I’m disappointed that coverage these days ignores all the children under 5 who are still ineligible. I was worried that the sense of urgency around getting vaccines approved for young children would wane once 5-12 year olds were eligible . Thus far it seems my fear was warranted. Families with kids under 5 are still waiting anxiously for vaccine eligibility while the rest of the world seems to have moved on."
2021-11-25 16:48,"Great news. Childhood vaccinations are the key to any public health policy. It is how we stopped (for the most part) measles, pertussis, polio and chickenpox, to name some common childhood diseases rampant a few decades ago. No more. 

You hardly hear about them, chiefly because the majority of children are vaccinated. Overall case numbers, and notably hospitalizations, should drop in the next few weeks in accordance with increasing vaccinations of the 5 to 11 cohort. Once a vaccine (likely Pfizer-BioNTech) is approved for kids under 5, I think the case numbers will drop even more."
2021-11-25 16:45,"With every new category of people made eligible for the vaccines we limit the potential for symptomatic or asymptomatic transmission.  Man, it's been a slog but we're getting there. My hope, more realistic this time, is that next year we'll be in good shape. People will be getting regularly boosted, kids will be vaccinated, vulnerable populations closely monitored and those testing positive strictly isolated. And contact tracers being able to really do their jobs methodically and completely. Anti-viral drugs will be in ready supply and people will be able to test at home and take them as needed thereby stemming the flow of serious illness. And most importantly, our healthcare workers will not be exhausted. 

In the meantime, mask up, be cautious, socially distance ...and get vaccinated and boosted."

2021-11-25 15:50,"Good article, detailing real world examples of the benefits of vaccination for real people and families.

This is the type of persuasion that will encourage those on the fence about having their children vaccinated for Covid.

Coercive and punitive ""solutions"" will not convert those who have made up their minds to not get vaccinated and are more likely to cause them to dig in.

The last remaning portion of the US population is obviously the most vaccine resistant. It will take clever, nonpoliticized persuasion to reach the various target groups with messaging that alleviates their fears while persuading them to protect themselves and others.

Shaming and demonizing won't do any good and makes everything worse."
2021-11-25 16:02,A big reason for young children to get a vaccine too is to allow them unmasked in schools. We need an off ramp to masking and vaccination will allow that because many irresponsible adults refuse to do so.
2021-11-25 15:56,"My kids understand the importance of protecting themselves, classmates, their teachers, families, grandparents, and community. They’ve gotten used to masks long long ago and it hasn’t gotten in the way of playing tag, soccer, hand ball, monkey bars. Kids are so adaptable and want to do the right thing for the safety of others. My kids got shot #1 and will be fully vaccinated next week. As the article says, their circle will widen soon. If only adults could strip away their fear, anger, and hardened politics, and just focus in on what’s most important to them."

Today House subpoenas are being ignored, and our Judicial system and  Justice Department are creeping along at a glacial pace, as the smart money attempts to run out the clock.  States are redistricting and gerrymandering new districts to promote authoritarian control, that could cancel your vote.  

Meanwhile, wealthy, deep pocketed investors have been selling alternative facts, to protect their self interest, dividing our great nation.  They have people focused on face masks and not getting  vaccinations, while their pockets are being picked.  Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are near collapse as is our infrastructure.  Our schools are a mess, and we have failed to invest in a replacement generation, flu and COVID are ramping up. The number of retirees and disabled are growing faster than the number of children (future workers) being born, needed to keep our social safety net solvent and our infrastructure functional and competitive.  

We should be afraid, very afraid of losing it all and becoming just another 3rd world nation, who has lost their middle class."
2021-11-25 15:43,"For all the people say vaccine don’t work because of waning immunity, Science has a solution, boosters. The boosted adults are 25 times less likely to get infected than unvaccinated  and  10  time’s less likely then people with two doses.
I am healthy and young , but all it takes to be protected is to go to a pharmacy and get the harmless but very effective shot. I will take them as long as they will protect me . No side effects, only positives.
I think unvaccinated or vaccinated people who spread anti-vaccine propaganda by cherry picking facts are the worst people and truly shapely,"
2021-11-25 16:46,"COVID isn’t over, either in the US or especially worldwide.
With vaccines for children, and boosters for the elderly and everyone else, there is a chance of achieving herd immunity in the US this winter.
After COVID has been defeated in the US, President Biden should work with our allies and with the World Health Organization to ensure a worldwide program to help vaccinate poor people around the world.  Otherwise, mutated versions of COVID will just return again next year."

2021-11-25 16:39,"Thank you for printing stories like this. We need to read more about those who actually care about their families, their freedoms, and the wellbeing of all the citizens of the world. I'm done with and tired of reading about the anti-science, anti-vaccine, politically motivated, and the willfully ignorant crowd."
2021-11-25 17:01,"Good for Ms. Mooneyhan and family, but what is still missing from our medical community is a definite answer on how likely it is for the vaccinated to pass on Covid. It seems the story has been changing from ""extremely unlikely"" to ""potentially still possible""."
2021-11-25 17:19,"For the future, the need to include children in vaccine testing protocols as early as possible has to be addressed.  The possible complications clearly need to be considered very carefully, but so do the consequences of leaving a huge part of the population unvaccinated and able to spread the virus."
2021-11-25 17:37,"It is very important to vaccinate children because parents will be safe to send their children back to schools. Children interact with each other more intimately than adults and their immune system is not as mature as adults. Therefore children are vulnerable to any kind of infectious disease, not to mention COVID 19. Vaccine protects children from severe symptoms and also curbs potential transmission from children to their families.
I hope all children in the world will be vaccinated soon."
2021-11-25 17:10,"This article needs to be read in tandem with the retailers suing to prevent mandatory vaccination. On one side, we have responsible families and on the other, corporations putting profit before health on the belief that employees will resist the jab. This article suggests that many households support the jab and I sure that many of those households have retail workers.
Until retailers mandate vaccination, I will not go into a department store built without windows and lacking ventilation.
Shame on the National Retailers Foundation taking a stance that endangers their employees and customers."
2021-11-25 18:13,"I have twin 11 year old and one 8 year old.  I scheduled them for the vaccine, but they became asymptotically positive before their appointments.  They probably got it from school which did not mandate masks.  My husband and I both got very sick with Covid.  This was even though we had received vaccinations.  Now we are struggling to work from home, take care of our kids, and make it to doctor appointments.  The whole family is positive which means the kids are home and my husband and I have very little time to rest.  I can’t understand why anyone would want to go through this.  I’m also a little dismayed by what little faith Americans have in our scientific community which comprises some of the smartest people in the world.  As soon as my family is eligible we will get boosters /vaccines."
2021-11-25 18:20,"Our daughter was hospitalized in an ICU a few months after she was born.  She was intubated for a couple of weeks at a children's hospital.  We didn't know if she would survive her viral infection.   It was the most terrifying thing we have ever experienced.  She is eight now, and healthy, but her experience is always close to our minds, especially during a pandemic.  We were worried about her getting Covid.  She got her second vaccination yesterday.  What a relief.  So grateful to research scientists on Thanksgiving Day.  Thank you for this vaccine!"
2021-11-25 17:03,"As any doctor will tell you: there is no such thing as long-term side effects for this vaccine or any other ever invented for that matter. NONE. Side effects have to do with medications taken over and over again, generally daily, causing a buildup of chemicals in the body. Vaccines are eliminated by the body within a couple of days, and the immune system takes over. This ridiculous notion that in 10 years the kiddos will be infertile, or what have you, is impossible."
2021-11-25 17:56,"The lack of reliable data (and reporting about that lack of data) about the actual rates of infection in kids and rates of transmission by asymptomatic kids has been extremely frustrating. What we got by and large were constant reminders that kids don’t die of covid and hospitalizations were “rare”, or “relatively uncommon” even when 30,000 kids got hospitalized in one month. This is the first time I’ve read the word “vector” in an article about Covid and children. It seems that now that they can get vaccinated the media feels they can address the elephant in the room that so many of us were asking about all along all along - now that    the economy is safe from school closures. As one student returning to class put it back in August - The school reopenings of 2021 were the children’s crusade for capitalism."
2021-11-25 17:55,"I have no problem with retailers not having all of their staff vaxxed in time to sell me things for the holidays, as long as they post a sign in the window telling me that so I can just go to another store where they are vaccinated and skip spending my money on people who won't go the less than an extra mile for my business."
2021-11-25 17:41,"I’m grateful for this news story on what the Covid vaccine means to families with children ages 5-12. Now how about families with children under 5? Our family rushed to get my 6-year-old grandson vaccinated as soon as we could, and we will breathe a huge sigh of relief when he gets his second shot next week. But we’re still holding our breath waiting for a vaccine to be approved for my 3-year-old grandson."
2021-11-25 18:31,"I remember when responsibility to family and community were core values in our country.  These values were reinforced at home and at school.   Parents dutifully took their kids for vaccinations.  Children lined up to receive their ""sugar cube"" polio vaccines at school.   School nurses gave TB tests to children when the community spread was increasing.   I do not remember any of my schoolmates missing these interventions.  Nor remember my parents mentioning PTA meetings interrupted by parents screaming about their ""freedoms.""  The freedom was in saving their families and communities from disease.   I am so thankful that there are parents that are instilling these values in the next generation."
2021-11-25 18:55,"The crazy thing is, just being vaccinated does not at all guarantee that one won't pass the virus to others.  The only relief parents should feel is that, hopefully, IF their child gets COVID, they will be less likely to die, and will have a lesser case.  It is no way at all makes the elderly safe from getting COVID from children who have picked it up at school or at play."
2021-11-25 18:57,"I am so glad that the moms and dads with little ones will have one less very scary thing to worry about.  
It's easy to imagine that any sniffle these past two years has been met with dread."
2021-11-25 19:22,"Everyone needs to get vaccinated. The virus will exploit every vulnerability to survive. I understand that it has taken nearly two years to get to this point. Here is my concern.

Will a new variant that escapes the current vaccines require the same approval processes or will they be able to quickly manufacture approved vaccines like with the flu?

Before this pandemic the great pandemic fear was influenza. That a variant could kill an order of magnitude between 10% and 90% of those infected. SARS-COV-1 killed 20% of those infected. Coronaviruses can absolutely become more deadly. 

The spike protein can only adapt in some many ways but the point is eventually it will adapt if it can. A universal flu vaccine focuses on proteins the virus needs to survive and cannot change without destroying its ability to bind to cells.

The coronavirus is well adapted to North American white tail deer and will be a viral reservoir. Almost makes me wonder if it evolved in Asian deer. Hunters will be eating venison and there will be spillovers. 

We are in the middle game against the virus. The endgame may take decades to play out. The only way to beat it is with a universal vaccine."
2021-11-25 18:57,"Once again, personal and family considerations seem to be all that matters. What about a GIANT step forward in tamping down the pandemic by reducing the unmeasured, but undoubtedly significant community transmission by unvaccinated children."
2021-11-25 19:23,"Long as 40 percent of America remains unvaccinated the huge weight will be never fully lifed, because as Fauci says the virus remains in circulation, and vaccines don't protect us 100 percent, though they degrade the severity of the impact drastically by preventing hospitalization and death. The aged and immunocompromised, which includes kids, remain at a high risk of hospitalization and death to covid.

Vaccine and mask mandates need to be strongly enforced, and the courts will hopefully see sense in it, eventually. Everybody needs to be vaccinated."
2021-11-25 19:31,"If the vast majority of America, including the President, Congress and judges in the appeals and supreme courts are united in their resolve to protect all Americans from covid, the aged and immunocompromised in particular who are most vulnerable, then covid can finally be contained and beaten.
The vaccines that protect us from delta and existing variants are likely to get better but more needs to be done.The virus is circulating globally. A new variant can emerge,deadlier than the delta variant long as the virus is in circulation. A global effort is needed to vaccinate everybody on the planet, so that the covid threat ceases."
2021-11-25 20:17,"What did immuncompromised people do before COVID 19? Did they isolate for years or increase their children’s anxiety, PTSD, or anorexia or indirectly increase their guilt? Was waiting for the vaccine and isolating and decimating your children’s mental health worth it? No it wasn’t."
2021-11-25 21:13,"We got our 10 year old vaccinated on November 13th at a county-wide clinic.  The next week, my oldest had 4 play performances with a majority-vaccinated high school cast, and a band performance.  She had been vaccinated in June with the Pfizer vaccine.  Play rehearsals were masked but performances were unmasked... and she came home Tuesday night with a sore throat and a positive home COVID test.  Our county has low rates of vaccination, and cases are rising again after waning through October and the first half of November.  So we are home for Thanksgiving and my oldest is isolating at her dad's house.  I am grateful for rapid home tests that told us to stay home and not expose my parents, who are 80 and 82."
2021-11-25 21:25,look at the study that got EUA approval for the vaccine in children. Children in the vaccine and placebo groups had the same deaths and severe covid cases (zero). So the vaccine is not proven to reduce deaths or severe covid infections. Why put millions of children at risk of a vaccine issue until the vaccine has proven results of decreasing deaths or severe cases?  That is politics over science and divisive for no reason aka Democrat's version of Trumpism.
2021-11-25 21:53,"A mother not kissing her 5 year old daughter good night for 2 years is mental illness.

2021-11-25 23:02,"My 10 yr old got his first shot  and said he didn't need Christmas presents this yr because being able to go back to his school in Jan is awesome enough. He's been so tired of online classes and greatly misses his friends!

Of course we're still going to secretly get him gifts, but even at his young age, he's grateful and aware about how important and life charging this vaccine has been for high risk families like us."
2021-11-25 20:44,"Is it too much to expect the Times to,stop stereotyping concerned parents as being exclusively women? Not a single father was quoted in the article. If the roles were reversed, it would be roundly criticized by readers, and rightly so."
2021-11-26 0:19,"My Thanksgiving gratitude: thanks to all of the scientists, researchers, doctors, and technicians whose work contributed to the development of the coronavirus vaccines."
2021-11-25 23:50,"This is going to be a hugely unpopular comment, but I believe that everyone, vaccinated or not, who resumed pre-Covid life is dead wrong."
2021-11-26 0:28,"Families should be aware that vaccines do not prevent exposure, infection or spread from an infected person. Of course, the good news is that vaccines will prevent serious illness or death. That should certainly lift a 'huge weight' for families whose kids are fully vaccinated with all age appropriate vaccines including a vaccine against COVID. All previous safety precautions should still be followed and it is good to see Jack Rymer received the first dose of a vaccine against COVID-19 while wearing a proper mask mask properly.

What does the future lie for those who were previously considered fully vaccinated? Que sera sera. What will be will be. It is alarming that NY Times breaking news reports a new variant of  COVID, whose mutations display a “jump in evolution,” is driving a spike in COVID infections in S. Africa and other countries.

As  I had predicted, sooner or later there was going to be a variant of the Wuhan strain that was going to emerge that would not be neutralized by the antibodies against spike protein elicited by any of the current vaccines. One just can hope that the variant does not spread as fast as the delta variant did. Also for several months I have been advocating for the development of second generation vaccines that will simulate long lasting protective immune response similar to those who acquire a robust immunity following a severe COVID infection. It should not be technically that difficult and could provide broader immunity against variants."
2021-11-26 1:02,"I wish my wife would get vaccinated. 

We have no children, and are about 40. We were close to making the choice to have a kid, after years of heartache, bad decisions, and perseveration.

Now, we are barely holding on. 

Happy Thanksgiving, and love to all those with a family still. And all those without—more so."
2021-11-23 17:22,"Here in the US, the baby boom generation has reached retirement age and then some.  No surprise that they are leaving the work force and that there are not enough younger workers to take their place.  It’s a matter of simple demographics.  Of the 3 million or so who retired in the US since pandemic began, presumably most of their jobs will need to be filled by someone, but who?  Immigration has to be a major part of the answer.  Automation, too, but the phenomenon of “aging populations” is now worldwide and demands solutions.  To the extent that new workers do not appear, the world’s economy will have to change."
2021-11-23 17:25,"It would be great if the US could adopt a system like Canada, Germany or Australia. With obvious exceptions like refugees, asylum seekers or family reunification, we should have a path for immigrants come in as long as their visas are linked to jobs that pay well so they're filling gaps in our economy, they're not being  exploited, not undercutting current citizens, and not immediately adding to our social services burden. That would be better than unfettered entry, followed by efforts to push up wages by legislation and having to support displaced American workers."

2021-11-23 17:38,"From the article: ""On busy nights, dishwashers at one upscale restaurant in Sydney are earning $65 an hour.""  If you'd offer workers $ 65/h to wash dishes stateside, your line of applicants would stretch around the block.  

However, there is an important message here, a case of a missing qualifier:  The ""shortage of workers"" should better read ""shortage of cheap workers"".  Now, paying people better is not a fix-all, but it'll go a long way for many situations.  As for jobs requiring significant skills (not necessarily taught at four year Colleges or at University!), encouraging formal apprentice programs and offering financial incentives for companies to really train on-the-job would help.  Workers' interest in such programs is also likely to increase if the jobs they lead into pay better."

Capitalism has become so addicted to an endless pool of slave labor that it is contorting our societies into unrecognizable new forms rather than just allow unions. I can almost hear Marx saying “Told you so.”"
2021-11-23 17:41,"Yesterday I read in a finance magazine that forty-six percent of Americans cannot afford to retire at all or if they do, they will retire with debt they will never be able to pay off. 

And yet employers routinely reject older people who apply for jobs simply because they are perceived as “old,” which now appears to be a euphemism for uneducable, untrainable, and undesirable. 

At the same time, we hear that Social Security is going bankrupt. So what exactly do the US and other wealthy countries expect to do with millions of unemployed older citizens who have no savings and no ability to retire, especially when employers automatically reject older applicants who are perfectly fit or can easily be trained for the jobs they offer?

My ex-husband is European and cannot get a decent job in a country that claims to be “desperate” for workers — and he has a PhD and is only fifty!

The reason why employers claim there is a “labor shortage” is straightforward: they do not want to pay higher wages to citizens and their profit margins are bigger when they can pay immigrants far less than they would have to pay older citizens who are already living in the country."

In my research and experience, migrant workers are the one of the most hard-working and dedicated subgroups of workers. 

Unfortunately the Republican party has wrongly made migrants their scapegoat and use their human lives to advancing their agenda. They have successfully made them the enemy - including the eyes of most of the readership of the NYT.

Globalized capitalism is not the answer.  Societies need to live within their own means... which might involve less sex and more love, but I digress."
2021-11-23 18:03,"""In advanced economies, the immigration measures being deployed include lowering barriers to entry for qualified immigrants, digitizing visas to reduce paperwork, increasing salary requirements to reduce exploitation and wage suppression, and promising a route to permanent status for workers most in demand.""

This is the key difference between the US immigration system and those of the rest of the developed world. Most Americans support reasonably high levels of legal immigration and simply want the caveats highlighted above to apply to all those seeking to come here. 

As this article points out, the battle in advanced economies is for SKILLED laborers, not unskilled migrants. The US admits far too little of the former and far too much of the latter. We need a comprehensive fix for the system that:

1. Frees up unused green cards from years past
2. Increases the number of CBP and ICE agents 
3. Increases the numbers of asylum courts and advocates within those courts so we can handle same-day processing of asylum claims rather than admitting asylum-seekers into the country to await a hearing
4. Identifies which sectors need workers and provide visas to immigrants based on need in those sectors
5. Ensure that visas are attached to jobs that pay livable wages so that immigrants don't undercut American workers while being a net positive for our economy

It's not heartless to want migrants to be net positives for society and it's not wrong to tie visas to that desire."
2021-11-23 18:13,"I have to ask. What are the Republicans going to say if they do gain control of one or both houses of Congress and we desperately need workers?  Maybe new immigrants will be welcomed to such places as eastern Oregon or the outback  of some of the empty red states.

2021-11-23 18:22,"Immigration will be the most powerful force impacting the nations of the world in the 21st century.

This will include both migration from country to country and within countries. 

Climate change will be the most powerful driver and economic opportunity the most powerful magnet. 

Oppressive, authoritarian and/or corrupt regimes with weak infrastructure, including education, will be unattractive to more skilled migrants and their families, especially those with high climate risk.

I think Canada maybe one of the best positioned to benefit from immigration, while China and countries in the Middle East may be the worst. So many wealthy Chinese families have already invested in second homes in Canada and the US that places like Vancouver, BC have imposed vacancy taxes. (China is already facing severe demographic decline due to one-child and a cultural preference for sons).

Because corruption and organized crime also migrates, the US Treasury is scrutinizing all cash property purchases in certain US counties and the Congress passed the Corporate Transparency Act to require US shell companies to reveal their beneficial owners by next year. (South Dakota may regret their freewheeling shell games some day).

The US may see some of the largest internal migration, from south to north and away from populous, low lying coastal areas. Agriculture will shift northward while southern states may grow more wind and solar energy than soybeans. 

Its going to be a wild century."
2021-11-23 18:30,"Interesting to see so many anti-immigrant comments under the guise of immigrants holding down native wages in a supposedly  'liberal' newspaper. Just an observation. There is somewhat of a paradox here in that I know several smaller businesses that can't attract workers yet they can't afford to pay much more than the minimum wage as margins are so thin. So the work just gets spread across the remaining workers adding to their stress and the business can't scale or grow.

I also see this in my own life since various cleaning ladies we have been using are asking for 15%-25% increases for the same duties (due to restricted supply). My wife and I were considering getting a temporary nanny to help with our three kids but the prices we've seen floating around on FB groups are unreal. It's not the end of the world but certainly would not be able to afford a 'native' Canadian (and actually haven't seen any native Canadians ever apply for cleaning/nanny roles I've put out including when I've raised the offer rates). Once there's an increase in the supply of labour these prices should ease."

When do we start to connect the dots--our two largest cities spend billions, yearly, on those who do not work, and yet the Times is telling us we need to start to import more immigrants because the rest of the world is doing that?  Something is wrong with this picture.  The only common denominator is that there are people outside our borders who want to work, and because they do not have money being handed to them by their government, they will come here and do it."

2021-11-23 18:02,"In the US the only problem with labor is money. Employers have paid wages that were too little to live on forever, now no one wants to work for poverty wages. So the answer is to import low wage workers? Calling immigrants migrants? Why not try paying a decent wage and accompany it with health care, paid vacation days and holidays and sick days. The USA has some of the greatest inequality in the world, maybe it's a good time to reduce that. 

Most people in the US make less in a day than it costs to pay a driver to deliver take out. And a huge number of people get delivered meals. 

We have such great inequality that our rich people live in a bubble thinking they are only middle class because servants in big cities cost so much, can you believe it!!! Our rich people call it protesting when our cities burn (not their section of town). How about eliminating that SALT loophole and paying American cities to rebuild those places that burnt in our billion dollar riots of 2020?

Yet Republicans are stating that there is a ""crisis"" at the boarder and a unprecedented number of immigrants are being allowed across the border. Both can't be true. I know for a fact, because of Covid 19 guidelines that the border is not open. And just because a record number are ""apprehended"" at the border, doesn't mean that they are making it in. To me, if record numbers are being apprehended, that means border patrol is doing their job. I actually agree that legal immigration and migration needs to take place, because Covid outbreaks will likely be with us for the next couple of years before it becomes endemic, but while this is going on, anyone allowed across legally should be required to be vaccinated."

We in the developed nations must reduce our consumption, our mobility, and our arrogance of superiority if we are to find a path forward for all life on this planet.

Now we're surprised that they seem unprepared to immediately step into the breach?

America needs to step on the gas to rebuild this country from the ground up.

Seriously, what companies want is to pay less in wages and benefits and if they can do this by importing workers they will do so. Why should they bear the expense of training local workers if they can import skills cheaply. If companies like Microsoft and Amazon spent as much money on training local black and other under-represented minorities in tech skills (like they do in Germany) as they do on H1-B visas, there would not be such a big shortage in these skills and it would help alleviate inequality. If I've learnt anything in 30+ years of corporate live, it's never to believe companies when they say, they're trying to do the right thing."

It does not make the country a better place for the country's growing poor population.

We blame the corporates and the underbelly consequences of capitalism.
We blame hard working immigrants for stealing our jobs or working for lower wages.

2021-11-23 18:55,"So, instead of paying workers more for the hazardous jobs (working with the public or in close proximity to others), the wealthy capitalists of the world would rather import desperate people from third worlds so they can continue paying poverty wages and continue reaping outrageous profits for themselves? 

Billionaires’ answer to the manufactured “labor shortage” is to discard the workers — who are taxpaying citizens of the nations that made them wealthy — and just bring in cheaper labor that they can abuse even more. 

Billionaires, who have become obscenely wealthy during the pandemic, would rather bring in desperate migrants who would create a  worsening strain during an economic downturn, creating greater hardships for everyone (the actual citizens and taxpayers) in the form of overcrowding and competition for affordable housing, medical care, schooling, transportation, food and social resources, not to mention eliminating bargaining power, protections and rights for working and middle class citizens.

Often they find themselves with no skills to continue, and must explore for themselves various job paths.   All kids should graduate high-school with a marketable skill, either to follow as a career or to support themselves by going to college.

Cyprus was the easiest, but you can’t get a work permit. But I am 60. I see that Europe, like the USA, makes it difficult for young entrepreneurs to get a residency permit and open a bank account.

Now, of course, we have excellent evidence that (shock of shocks) a labor shortage gives workers more leverage and, thus, wages have started to rise.

A better focus of attention would be thinking about how to disincentivize jobs that are non-productive so that more people would be available to do productive work (think of all the people employed to deal with health insurance claims because we don't have a single-payer system).

Another useful focus would be to see how you can help people be in the workforce part-time.

A third useful focus would be to ask, ""If Americans 'aren't willing to do the job,' maybe the wages and working conditions are not appropriate for the 21st century."""

The root cause is an irreconcilable difference within the Republican coalition. Organized Capital likes its cheap, unorganized, subservient labor just fine! American businessmen expect Americans to slave away under conditions so grueling, wages so low and benefits so lacking, that only an immigrant fearful of deportation to a desperately impoverished country would find it half acceptable. Queue the grumbling campaign that nobody wants to work.

Meanwhile, white Republican voters dislike immigrants with a passion far in excess of any rational motivation that’s worth indulging. Their anger is well justified but their target selection is off by 180 degrees. Organized capital has made one deliberate choice after another, to ship those jobs overseas and to staff what remains of the domestic labor force with wage-slave labor. The motivation is simply and obviously what American businesspeople deem best for their wallets.

The no-discipline school environment has created a generation of young men who aren’t useful or desirable, not without being majorly coached on what’s required to be a good worker. 

And free handouts for life may have had something to do with that too. Free housing, free utilities, free food - why should they bother working for a living when our liberal states will give them the necessities for free?

In our country, nobody will be unemployed (remember: worker shortage). Where is the problem? Shareholders, of course. They need the cheapest workforce they can get.

The schemes that are outlined in this article actually move to shift the cost of training workers from the employer to the taxpayer.  Employers get enough tax breaks as it is.  What is not expressly pointed out in this particular article is the fact that the taxpayers are being asked to bear the massive costs this entails.  These employers would not be so quick to whine for more workers if they, themselves were required to bear the full costs of foreign worker housing and education and health care.

The right thing to do in this world economy is to either compensate those lands losing their labor, or contribute in technology so they won't remain too dependent on predatory companies, perpetuating buying raw material and then exporting those same finished products.

All American workers should be getting decent pay .
All American workers should be employed, especially those in the inner cities 
All the homeless should have decent housing(even if it is outside of the cities they currently crowd in) alongside with a decent job.
A worker retraining program should exist.
Before any H1-B worker is recruited, the likes of Infosys and Microsoft should have canvassed every community college and university for talent. Only when they prove that they have failed to find any should they be allowed to import a migrant who should be paid the same as the local that they would have employed.
For every migrant they employ, they should sponsor a local and pay their college fee."
2021-11-23 19:54,"I am a naturalized immigrant engineer and came for the higher salary and opportunity that the USA offers compared to the UK. It worked out for me, but is not for everyone. 

USA is generally not an attractive option for most immigrants from developed countries. The immigration system is a mess (expensive, slow, complicated), the consequence of losing your job too high (no social safety net), health care is terrible (having left the NHS, I would gladly go back), low vacation etc

Solving the labor shortage for skilled and professional labor is not about paying USA workers more. For example, it takes decades to get a productive engineer, starting in K-12, 4yr degree, a few years of experience. If you start paying more now, you might have some relief in 15 years. By that point, the r&d centers in other countries will be up and running with more opportunity and the talent will leave the USA. 

This is a system problem as much as a salary problem."

There may be many immigrants today who are fleeing their homelands for political or safety issues. But the vast majority probably still emigrate for financial reasons. Work visas for even very low-skilled jobs may be the way to overcome much of the chaos that has plagued the southern U.S. border for decades."

In Demark we have become 20 percentage more people in 40 years with 9 of 10 as immigrants - with a huge pressure on nature and environment (it's no coincidence that some countries plan to demand a charge for the infrastructure-burden when people arrive).  
No mention of what to do when the next economic crisis hits, when the new laborers are not needed any more. But of course, naive economists think labor demand grows forever.
No mention of a more generalized (in)security concerning the nature of the future labor market - robots all over.
No mention of the negative effects of huge amounts of new immigrants with different cultures and religions - as we already feel it here in Europe in countries with traditionally old homogeneous populations."

They failed to make the point that, rather than seeking and welcoming immigrants that we desperately need, the US has tried to seal its border.  Much of the current problem in our economy can be traced to shortages of both skilled and unskilled labor.  The problem is only going to get worse in the future if Republicans continue to press for ever more xenophobic laws and restrictions.  Our population growth rate is at its lowest level in over a hundred years.  The census showed that all of the growth is occurring in the metro areas, and over half the counties in this country shrank in population over the past decade.  Demographics say that an aging population and young people who much prefer an urban lifestyle will only make this trend continue and accelerate.  Will the US make the same mistake on this issue that we have on global warming and find ourselves at the back of the pack in our ability to survive as a nation?"

Americans don't want to do that work at low wages and lousy benefits.  Exhibit A: The New York City department of Sanitation, i.e. garbage pickup.  A dirty, smelly, hard, and occasionally dangerous job (you wouldn't believe what people put in regular trash).  Despite all this, there is stiff competition for open positions, with many more applicants than positions available. And those applicants have to be either citizens or permanent residents.  So, why are they applying?  Because those jobs pay a decent wage (well deserved!) and have good benefits.  So, next time you hear or read ""Americans don't want to do that work"", consider our sanitation workers.  They do their job every day, and we value them for keeping our city clean!"

The Government of Canada has a web site titled “Hire a temporary worker through the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program: Overview” which says that farmers may bring in workers from certain countries to work each year for 8 months (now 9 months due to Covid).  Canada has an agreement with each of the countries that supplies temporary workers.  These countries are required to select workers who meet all of Canada’s and their own country’s laws.

<a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers/agricultural/seasonal-agricultural.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers/agricultural/seasonal-agricultural.html</a>

Our own country once had a program in which Mexican adults could come here to work for specific farms for a limited number of months each year.  At the end of these months/ the agricultural work year, they returned to their families in Mexico.  If they spent their earnings in Mexico, the migrant farm workers could buy much more there than they would have been able to afford here.

The farm workers’ families remained in Mexico, among their friends and relatives.  

Farms who hire migrants should again be required to do so through such a program."
2021-11-23 21:24,"The steadfast closed border countries like China and Russia have fewer refugees leaving and likely even fewer entering, Snowden being a unique case. For the present time the Middle East and North Africa are the hotspots with migrations seeking refuge in the richer nearest neighbors, Europe. These refugees are highly motivated to succeed wherever they land but need the skills, language, and training along the lines of the German apprenticeships. The refugees escaping political horrors or gangland tyranny will change geographical locations as countries continue to change leaderships and war on each other.

Think about how difficult it would be to teach someone how to be an American. I’m not sure what an American stands for any longer.  The right thrashes compassionate integration while the left waits for the ideal despite the cost of complete failure. So are we softies with couches for surfers or John Wayne wannabes with a side arm and snarl.

When I was a kid in the 1950s I would have said we were the best, most gifted country with the greatest natural resources and a rugged population of smart workers, doers and inventors.

2021-11-23 22:37,"Note the key criteria here: young and skilled.  Many countries are eager to get immigrants who have skills, either in the trades or in STEM fields.  They have a huge leg up if they are already conversant in the local language.  Nobody wants immigrants like the hordes showing up on the Belarussian border, or the US border, with limited education, few skills, and a bunch of kids in tow.  All countries are also looking for young, as in under 35 years.  Those over 50 need not apply unless they are literally rocket scientists, or come with a pile of money.  That means nobody wants most of the Americans struggling to find work that pays a living wage, because they are either unskilled or too old, and companies don't want to train the unskilled ones or insure the old ones.  For some jobs with little prospect of pay or advancement and often difficult conditions, such as farmworkers and nursing home aides, a guest worker program would make sense.  For all else, we should train our young or employ our older workers who still want (or at least need) to work."

As the Western world, especially, increasingly starts to be filled with people from other countries and appear quite different from expectations (e.g., London looking like Pakistan, Vancouver looking like Taiwan), fewer foreigners, especially those not desperate for a bit more money overall, actually want to study or work there. Having done so in these places also no longer carries the same prestige and respect back home as it once did."

The cap on people migrating to Australia will remain at 160,000 in 2021-22 as the government continues to focus on onshore applications and reducing the partner visa backlog at a cost of almost $300 million over four years.

Inward migration ought to be regulated under the law. And, in fact, most countries, even those allowing substantial inward migration for claimed labor needs, have laws that set standards and controls for inward migration of labor.

We no longer have enough of them for our own citizens.  It does not make any sense to give green cards to foreigners who come here to compete with our own citizens for the remaining low skilled jobs.  Poorly educated migrants just enlarge the labor pool so employers can get away without having to increase wages to keep up with inflation.  They also compete with our own citizens for affordable housing and for social services.  

Our 1965 immigration system favors foreigners who have someone in their extended family already living here.  If a foreigner has a niece or nephew or a sibling who has already moved here, then this person has a better chance of getting a green card than one who has earned a Ph.D from an American university in a STEM field.  This is true even if the person with a relative here has no high school diploma, no employable skills, and no knowledge of English.

Our system reserves 2/3’s of our annual (non-refugee) allotment of green cards for relatives of those who are already living here, without any screening for the applicants’ abilities.

Canada does the opposite.  It reserves 2/3’s of its annual (non-refugee) allotment for applicants whose advanced education would benefit the Canadian economy and who are fluent in English and/or French.

We should follow Canada’s example."

Until we start seeing more jobs increase wages and include fringe benefits, the call for increased immigration to the USA make little sense and mostly keeps wages depressed. 

In addition, the USA uses immigration as a crutch against one of the worst K-12 education systems in the developed world. Instead of increasing the pool of highly skilled American workers by fixing our poorly performing schools and bad parenting, we simply leverage the global labor pool for our high skilled work force.  This leaves us with large swaths of unemployable Americans."

Imagine in a town of, say, 2,000, how thrilled the local grocer, banker and school board should be to have 100 or so immigrants arrive and start working, shopping, sitting in class rooms, paying taxes.

Recruiting persons who can program a robotic assembly gear or CNC machinery can demand a starting hourly wage of $30/hr.  Experienced CNC programmers can demand upwards of $60-$75 / hr.   Swiss lathe programmers are in such demand here, there companies revert to poaching and offering upwards of $10,000 signing bonuses.
Those of us who utilize these technologies are desperate to find and retain this talent.  
Yet, our young folks here in the USA  are not interested in these careers,  why?  
It’s not glamorous and too hard to learn.  In China and Germany there are trade schools dedicated to developing young persons for these jobs.   
In our country we have abandoned the trade schools for the most part.

Less developed countries have a surplus of younger people without adequate opportunities for gainful employment.

Hopefully this will, at last, be the point where we focus our attention on getting past this for the long term. No more hoping short term restrictions will zero out cases, they won’t. No more calls to keep people apart, that ship too has sailed for so many, even most of the docs and experts here are apparently aboard. 

It’s time to accept that we won’t eradicate covid so we have to make it as trivial as we can. Thankfully the vaccines are great and, with now a booster when needed, letting us avoid serious cases to protect lives, healthcare resources, the at risk, and get past the worst of this.

2021-11-22 11:25,"Clearly, the *main* reason for the covid increase, yet another time, is transmission from to/ from all the anti-vaxxer zealots.  

Not only do they get covid at a higher rate (and often  get much more sick), but they also transmit it to others, even if they claim to be asymptomatic.  And the fact that the virus can spread this way, is a prime reason why covid keep mutating into other strains -- the Delta variation most recently.  

If everyone had been vaccinated, covid would be mosly old news as an ongoing pandemic and a major disruptor of the world economy.   That's what happened with polio, smallpox, and various other disease scourges where science essentially erradicated them -- thanks to strict rules for vaccinations and sane citizens complying for the greater good -- not to mention their own good.

Unless there's a strict regime of vaccination -- with stay-at-home lockdown for those refusing to be vaccinated, such as Austria has had to implement, covid could linger for years, killing people and disruption virtually every aspect of life."

The Delta variant is not fulling around. It is dead serious."

This has gone so far beyond any of the goalposts that we were initially fed “slow the spread”. Trying to stop a respiratory virus is just not possible you may delay it a tiny bit at the expense of destroying everything else. People need to stop letting epidemiologist make any more input into our future.
2021-11-22 11:47,"We are done with this.  We really tried.  There are still about 100 million who aren't vaccinated.  The virus is tearing through that population.  It will go anywhere there are vulnerabilities it can exploit.  

We see that the deep south is not experiencing as much virus as the upper midwest.  That's because so many were infected down south that some semblance of herd immunity has been established.  That's the hard way to do it.  Much cheaper, easier, and infinitely safer to just get the shot.  

Covid is now endemic to the human population.  We will never get rid of it.  It most likely will be treated like the flu, with annual shots.  Only about half of the population gets flu shots, so there will always be ample opportunities for Covid and its future variations.  

Now that the kids can get vaccinated, we will probably see mask mandates fall away soon after the first of the year.  Hopefully, the under five year olds can get their shots by spring.

We are no longer the nation that rushed to the doctor to get immunized.  We are a nation full of anti-science, anti-vax, pro-conspiracy, politically duped people.  This is our reality.  Protect yourself.  That's all you can do.  The rest will suffer and die.  I've had three shots."

There will still be suffering, but there always has been, since forever. I too will suffer one day, a least a little bit before I die. That’s life.

One thing is clear though, two-thirds vaccinations rates doesn't get us there."

We have masks — they can be worn in crowded, poorly ventilated places like stores to control the spread. We’ll soon have a powerful treatment medication. 

We really can’t afford to halt the economy again, and those Americans who are already up in arms (sometimes literally) about vaccines and masks are not budging in their ignorance. It’s terrible that their intransigence is exhausting our healthcare workers, but that’s not going to change.

The only drawback was that this study was done 224,000 health records.

With enormous overhead costs we pay for Healthcare, can’t we have a much bigger sample space for studies such as the one above, so that epidemiologists don’t use expressions such as “210 mph curveballs” when trying to understand COVID-19?

Yet at this point those adults saying no to the shots aren’t generally going to change their minds. I personally know several people who died of COVID because they wouldn’t take the vaccine.

Meanwhile Fauci extrapolated the data, saw Thanksgiving coming up and strongly promoted boosters already mid-August.  He was vilified, as usual, and accused of political meddling.  Nevermind the writing on the wall could not have been clearer.

Nonetheless, even Fauci knows that he cannot stop the holidays again this year.  He did all he could, to make them as save as possible.  It was the short-sighted and over-bureaucratic FDA that threw him and us a bad curveball here."

Health agencies generally define fully vaccinated as two weeks beyond a second mRNA vaccine or a single J&J shot.

One statement in the article hit me hard. ""You have to be humble in the face of Covid."" I am not sure how many people will accept that - without vaccination or no masks."
2021-11-22 12:41,"i was in Utah earlier this month, and in Alaska in July. sad to say, but it appeared to me that people in both places acted like either the pandemic was over, or there was no pandemic in the first place. when i wore a mask inside people actually either asked me why i was wearing one, or told me it wasn't necessary. 

as they say, we make our beds..."
2021-11-22 12:46,"Welcome to a world with endemic Covid. With an infectivity that approximates that of chicken pox, constantly emerging new variants, and eventually waning immunity among both the vaccinated and those with natural immunity, the virus will always find enough “dry wood” to spread and find new hosts, and thus create seasonal surges. this is the new normal for the foreseeable future. The event horizon is a lot further away than most people realize."
2021-11-22 12:49,"We have been ultra careful up to now.  I am having eleven family members over for dinner.  The seniors are boosted, the vaccinated middle agers are exposed through work, one sixteen year old grandson is not vaccinated by his choice, although the rest of his family is.  We are not testing prior to the gathering, except for the sixteen year old.  Masking is ridiculous when you are drinking and eating all day and then having dinner.  Outdoors does not work in Minnesota in November.  I will open a few windows, but that's about it.  I am somewhat worried, but I just can't skip another holiday."
2021-11-22 12:48,"I think Americans (and the world) have to just decide for themselves how to proceed with this. 

I’m vaccinated. When my kids are eligible they will be as well. At that point I’m ready to just go and live my life. I can’t control the unvaccinated but once I’m protected I’d like to feel normal again. 

My point is that we all need to decide when we are comfortable being out there maskless or just with friends and family. For me it’s when my family is fully vaccinated. For others I am sure it’s different. 

As for the unvaccinated. They are the least protected. At this point that is their choice. Our government is too weak to take the necessary steps that would force these people to make the best choice for all of us. 

In the absence of that leadership I’ve made my calculation. All the readers should as well. And we should stop wasting time and energy being upset over the unvaccinated. Let it go."
2021-11-22 12:50,"Why doesn't this article specify whether the hospitalized are vaccinated or not? Without that, this is a vague, uninformative, but alarmist article. News about surges by this time should be digging into whether those hospitalized in a given surge are vaccinated, boostered, etc, as well as their age breakdown. We can all see from the maps that there are surges, but the particulars matter."
2021-11-22 12:59,"Thankful to the Intensive care unit (ICU) doctors, nurses, pharmacists, Gilead, Regeneron, family and friends who contributed to my survival from severe COVID infection a year ago on November 22, 2021 when the second peak of COVID infection was taking shape, before the roll out of vaccines for the general US public. 

As a virologist, I am terribly disappointed that US and European COVID cases are ticking upwards once more. I envisioned that the vaccines and the antivirals would one day boot COVID out of our planet. Sorry to see my vision looks more distant than before. Luckily though for those who are currently hospitalized brush with death seems to be rare or less than 1%. Another sad thing is that many of the COVID positive patients are currently experiencing post COVID symptoms ranging from brain fog to suicidal thoughts due to torment of Tinnitus.

Despite over over 70% of US population considered ""fully immunized"" against COVID, after receiving 2 doses of Pfizer or ModeRNA or a single dose of Johnson and Johnson many are testing positive for COVID and are even being hospitalized and spreading infection. There are reports that the definition of ""fully immunized"" is about to change. Boosters are now offered to every adult currently as an admission that the previous vaccine doses are inadequate to provide full protection and that boosting antibody levels ensures better protection. 

There is an increasing call for second generation of vaccines closely simulating infection."
2021-11-22 12:53,"When historians look back at this pandemic, they will regard the lack of a government (federal & state) mandate for all to be vaccinated, with an exception for medical reasons, as one of the epic failures of American society."
2021-11-22 12:58,"I’m having a small indoor dinner party this week. I let people know I’m checking vaccination status at the door. There will be lots of ventilation.  Toronto Public Health let me know that private indoor parties of up to 25 are allowed and masking and distancing are not required in that scenario. The guests were reassured ahead of time. If rapid tests were available I would do that as well. But I haven’t got that far, maybe I should check into it. Add that task to the list of picking up flowers and getting to the salon. I have an app called Verify Ontario that checks for phoney QR codes on phoney Vaccination Certificates. 

Take care of one another.  :)"
2021-11-22 12:59,"Pandemic fatigue works both ways. People at large are frustrated by surges and outbreaks, and by pandemic response measures - lockdowns, and testing, quarantine and vaccination mandates. Health officials are fatigued too. Frankly, I don't know how Tony Fauci still does it - having predictions about ""when it will be all over"" extorted from him by the media, making those predictions conditional on people following testing, masking, vaccination, etc measures - knowing quite well that they wouldn't, having insults and threats hurled at him because his predictions didn't come true, and being extorted for a new round of predictions. Personally I'm way past thinking that we can have an efficient pandemic response short of spraying Paxlovid (Pfizer's protease inhibitor anti-viral) from crop-dusters. By now we have formed two tracks - those who have been vaccinated willingly and eagerly, and who welcome boosters to keep themselves safe, and those who actively resist this pandemic-driven incursion of science and rational thinking into their lives. From this point solutions have to be solely pharmacological. Fighting people on the Q train over wearing masks only aerosolizes virus particles and anger."
2021-11-22 12:59,The real question should be why is the FDA taking so long to approve the anti viral Molnupiravir and Paxlovid. Both have been shown effective.
2021-11-22 12:58,"The people who choose to remain unvaccinated must deal with the consequences of that. Unfortunately, I won't have much pity for them when they get COVID-19. You can only do so much to save other people from themselves. This pandemic was a very good illustration of why we have so many societal problems. It is so sad that we have so many illogical people in the world. This isn't strictly a problem in the U.S. a cursory glance at the news indicates that the same scenario is playing out in other countries as well."
2021-11-22 13:01,The unvaccinated should be banned from any indoor facility. They can live their life entirely outside where the risk of infecting others is minimal.
2021-11-22 13:03,"it's the tens of millions of people who refuse to be vaccinated.
Anybody who thinks this through sees numerous medical personnel, police and fireman, etc., etc. who say I have a right to not be vaccinated, no government can mandate it. You have your rights- yes- and now are increasing covid 19. How interesting people think, and yet they effect the rest of us adversely."
2021-11-22 13:08,"A radio news story this morning said that as of today’s vaccine deadline for the TSA, 40% are unvaccinated.

2021-11-22 13:12,"People around here are pretty much acting like the virus is over.  I live in a highly vaccinated area, but we all know that there are breakthrough cases.  Seniors don't seem to be particularly panicked about the rising numbers.  Restaurants are packed, fewer and fewer masks are seen, and our numbers are ominously ticking up.

It is hard to know what to think, or what to believe.  It seems that the virus has a mind of its own, and people are trying to ignore it.  It is a strange phenomenon.  I hope we aren't in for a dismal winter."
2021-11-22 13:13,I've had it twice now. I'm fully vaccinated and I still got it a second time. This second time seems more about my circulatory system. It's frightening. I think it's good to get the vaccine but I think we're going to see it's not a guarantee. They don't know alot about it still. Our health people are doing their best. The non vaccinated should not be villified.
2021-11-22 13:16,"We are vaccinated and we are back to life with no precautions, except mask wearing where it's required (like the grocery store or the sidewalk in front of my kids' school). I am absolutely not testing anyone in the family if they have no symptoms. 

Now, if you want to talk about the lingering mental health effects of pandemic life or the fact that the mental healthcare system has been over capacity for a long time, sure, I am here for this conversation."
2021-11-22 13:31,"I’ve had to work unmasked with other unmasked people for several months now in outdoor and indoor environments and after having my nose pillaged more times than I can remember not a single test has come up positive. 

I’m not saying covid isn’t something to be wary of going about your business but it hasn’t stopped me from daily living through this whole pandemic in one of the hardest hit areas. If I haven’t caught it from waiting in laundromats, waiting on supermarket lines, or being shoulder to shoulder on the subway with people who don’t wear masks themselves and going to concerts then I’m not sure what would make me catch it. I’m not looking to catch covid but I’m not letting it live my life for me"
2021-11-22 13:15,We are not allowing anyone from the South or Midwest into our homes and of course we would never go there. We are also requiring vaccination proof of everyone else.
2021-11-22 13:20,"Between colleges and the professionals, surely at least one million un-masked people sit close to each other in football stadiums across the US.

Ever since September when I watched Florida play Alabama in front of 90,000 I have been expecting to hear about an outbreak in one city or another because of one game or another.  This ihas been especially true in the Deep South where vaccination rates are the lowest.

Here and there some stadiums have required spectators to show a test to be admitted.  But I understand that such requirements have steadily dropped and may not even exist any longer.

Every morning NYT reports that Covid is ticking up again.  Yet still no word about any super-spreaders from any of at least 100 jammed stadium events occurring every single weekend.

Things that make you go huh?"
2021-11-22 13:17,"My husband, myself,  my daughter and her fiancé just tested positive for Covid.  We let our guard down and ate indoors at a restaurant.  I am pretty sure that’s how we contracted Covid as we have been very careful.  We  wear masks when we go out and shop.  We are all fully vaccinated and my husband and I recently got boosters.  But, here is the problem, one that is due to the amazing effectiveness of the vaccine.  We had no symptoms and probably would never have known we had Covid except that my daughter’s fiancé needed a Negative Covid test to return to Canada.  He tested positive.  We got tested and were positive too. We are quarantined for ten days and glad that we will not spread the virus to others.  But we could easily unwittingly infected others if none of us had needed a Covid test.   We all need to be very careful and keep wearing masks!  BtW, MA  has free Covid testing sites now, easy to set up an appointment and results within twenty four hours."
2021-11-22 13:43,"Thank you for this article. However, once again the focus is on hospitalizations and deaths. Could you please at least acknowledge that long covid is a very real and serious complication of milder and less symptomatic acute cases, and this pandemic will never end until we as a society get a handle on how serious and debilitating long covid poses to so many people. Yes, being fully vaccinated reduces the chance of acute serious illness, but with many unvaccinated people still, and the reality of breakthrough infections, we have to include long covid in the conversation."
2021-11-22 13:22,"Don't look now, but anti-vax, anti-mask Florida is now doing much better than the Northeast.  This virus is so contagious that the various precautions people take are almost useless, and it instead follows the seasonality of the region."
2021-11-22 13:38,"The persistence of high levels of Covid infections and deaths could have been predicted by reading the comments of parents quoted  by Jennifer Reich in her 2016 book, ""Calling the Shots: Why Parents Reject Vaccines."" The reasons are many but one stands out. One father, a cardiologist no less, said, ""It's not my responsibility to inject my child with chemicals in order for [a child like Maggie] to be supposedly healthy. . . . I'm not going to sacrifice the well-being of my child. My child is pure."" There you have it. Non-vaxxers, despite living in an interdependent society, maintain the fiction that they are responsible only to themselves and their immediate family members. Communitarianism to such people is a meaningless word."
2021-11-22 13:44,"During the shutdown of March 2020, I watched my neighbors have daily parties while my wife and I donned our PPE to go work at the hospital. No surprise when 4 months later, I lost my vibrant brother to COVID. We were doomed from the very beginning."
2021-11-22 13:34,"From a virology course I took over 40 years ago I was taught that Pandemics last 18 to 24 months before they burn themselves out completely or evolve into becoming endemic like the common cold.  Vaccines were never going to stop the pandemic, but help reduce the carnage as we weathered the duration of the pandemic.  It appears that Covid will become an endemic virus and will become less lethal over time, and to some extent epidemiologists have been teaching this concept that pandemics have a duration, but they do end, and if the pandemic portion of the virus’s journey ends in 2022 then it will be what I was taught so very long ago."
2021-11-22 13:41,"We are having a Thanksgiving gathering for 20, but all will home-test that morning. All are vaccinated. One of the 20 has had a break-through case. I’m sure we will be safe. People forget that the vaccinated are multiple times less likely to get it or transmit it than the unvaccinated. Our small group indicates that. My only complaint is that the tests are too expensive for most Americans at $12 per person. They are free in the UK. Why not here? Oh, yeah, big Pharma lobbyists."
2021-11-22 13:48,"Interesting juxtaposition ( seems to fit ) - returned to live Church yesterday for first time - our Congregation is older, must have been 150 of us in attendance -- no masking and the consensus seemed to be - I have had the booster so, about as safe as I can get. On the other side - my wife's hairdresser is in her 30's with a young child. The child brought it home and gave to my wife's hairdresser ( who was vaccinated but no booster ). At end of day, I guess caution is the order of the day"
2021-11-22 13:57,"Vermont has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country, around 80%.

But they now are getting almost 400 new cases a day. From this data it should be clear that the vaccinated are getting infected and are spreading the virus. 

This was predicted by the CDC and is why the vaccinated were told to wear masks, social distance and avoid crowds.

This suggests that we need a new virus strategy. Pitting vaccinated against unvaccinated isn't good public health policy, it's simply opportunistic politics.

The way to provide better protection for everyone is focus on the most vulnerable. Allow the full range of early treatment options, including the list of now a dozen repurposed drugs. 

Don't waste vaccines on those already infected. The data shows their antibody levels to be as good as the vaccinated and obviously longer lasting.

Recognize that with vigorous testing, early treatment and an intelligent deployment of resources we can flatten the curve, reduce hospitalization and case fatalities by about 80% and eventually the virus will diminish because it will have no more hosts.

And we need to show the public how to proactively strengthen their immune system. It is our remarkable immune system that kills the virus, not drugs or vaccines.  

It is hard to accept that many people will get infected along the way, but this is our new reality."
2021-11-22 14:01,"I eat sushi, rare steak and raw milk cheese, and ride in NYC taxis. Life is filled with risk. A life of hiding  from risk I could never endure. And so I’m in France, currently en route to Switzerland—two countries the US State Dept. advises against visiting due to covid. Wish you were here!"
2021-11-22 14:07,"Evidently the concept of sacrificing for the common good (by getting a vaccine) is so last century. 

No one can declare any longer that they were unaware of the vaccine. Nor can they declare to be unaware of  the potential repercussions to their own health or those around them. 

When one's mantra is ""me, myself and I"" coupled with the equivalent of a daily game of Russian Roulette, I find it impossible now to feel sorry for them. My sympathies go their loved ones and the people needed to care for the ""me, myself and I"" crowd."
2021-11-22 14:18,"If people who planned to have Thanksgiving dinner with elderly or other at-risk relatives made a habit of getting tested first, we could enjoy ourselves while sparing at least some of the inevitable consequences of family-centered holidays. 

There will be a surge after Thanksgiving and another after Christmas and New Years. There will be tens of thousands of hospitalizations and deaths that follow. 

Get tested before spending time with those at high risk. Also, Americans should have much better access to cheap rapid tests."
2021-11-22 13:45,"This virus  is not going away anytime soon.

Moreover -- it has brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles that will be visiting us soon.

Thanksgiving and Christmas will bring us large unmasked crowds sitting cheek-by-jowl with each other virtually in each other’s laps at football and basketball games to celebrate the Holidays

Vaccines and boosters notwithstanding, this thing is going to be with us for many more months, if not ten years.

If I was Joe Biden today, I’d call Dr. Fauci and ask him
to continue as my Spokesman-In-Charge-Of-Combating-The-Virus, along with a promise to him of a desk close to mine in the White House after my reelection in 2024."
2021-11-22 13:21,Ugh. My COVID holiday missing days are over.  Full stadiums restaurants malls store and theaters were all I needed. No one is listening any more. The lack of clarity and poor leadership on all levels has come home to roost. At the risk of sounding crass who cares any more?
2021-11-22 13:52,There can be no normalcy when fully one-quarter of the population has consciously chosen to remain unvaccinated as a way to foment chaos and widen the political divide.

2021-11-22 13:45,"Historical ignorance of vaccines is appalling. In the mid-twentieth century there were asylums that catered to polio and tuberculosis, measles and pertussis ravaged too many people, and the threat of smallpox is no-more. Lack of this historic perspective [among other simple educational topics] hamstrings too many now."
2021-11-22 13:46,"In a couple of hours, I'll be on my way to get shot number three,  my Covid booster. I wear a mask when required, this included my recent flights to and from Europe, as well as on every mode of transportation while there. However, I've about had it with the Covid restrictions. Singapore recently imposed a rule whereby unvaccinated people will have to pay for their treatment if they come down with Covid.  We should try something similar, how about if you're unvaccinated and come down with Covid, the hospital doesn't have to treat you and treatment will be between you and your GP.  Further, if your employee requires a vaccine and you don't get one, you can be fired. I realize the vaccine is't a guarantee of prevention but at some point, we have to let the overwhelming majority of us go about our lives without living as we're going through security at the airport.  Our economy is teetering as it is, shortages and inflation are rampant. It's time to go back to the pre Covid days."
2021-11-22 13:54,Everyone attending our Thanksgiving gathering is home-testing beforehand. While the adults are all vaccinated to the max the children are not. We want to keep everyone safe and our guests feel the same. Magical thinking (denial) is not helpful with this virus.
2021-11-22 13:45,"Some people just have to learn the hard way. I feel aweful for the front line workers who are put  at risk by the anti-vaxxers. But at this point those that are able to get vaccinated and choose not to so, and are putting the rest of us at risk, I have no pity."
2021-11-22 14:08,"It sure looks like all these precautions, masks, isolation, shots, are really helping, let’s do more of that. No, the virus is gonna virus, no way out of this until we all get it, we’re just delaying the inevitable in a very painful way."
2021-11-22 14:00,"Be smart, get vaccinated.  But also be careful and don't go anywhere with crowds without a mask.  Out here I frequent the supermarkets.  I am amazed at how many people do not wear a mask.  When I walk in I get numerous stares because I always wear my mask.  We have two grandchildren that we see frequently and they can not get vaccinated yet.  So I am doing what I feel is best for them.  They are all that counts for me even if they say young children do not get it or get it so slightly that they are ok.  It is the unvaccinated who are at risk and as far as I am concerned they should go the way Trump should go...lock em up."
2021-11-22 14:25,"Covid is not going away anytime soon, and there will always be those who refuse vaccination.

We need to really start exploring more treatments, like the pills by Pfizer and Merck that I hope are approved soon. Once a reliable treatment is accessible for all, it may change the trajectory of this virus."
2021-11-22 13:23,People have been acting like this is over.  Hardly anyone wears a mask anymore or takes any precautions.  These will be the same people who will be screaming bloody murder if we have to lock down again.
2021-11-22 14:19,"Colder weather in the north, large sports and family get togethers for the season, shopping for Xmas, holiday movies and shows and the desires to meet at the local restaurant or bar… hmmmmm, quite the opportunity for a thing that isn’t sentient nor alive, but can make you seriously sick and even die. 

We can be thankful this coming week and it’s holiday,
but it won’t be just the Grinch who will steal Christmas."
2021-11-22 14:14,"It's just not believable when journalists say, ""There is confusion around Corona-19 Virus"". The truth is vaccines work, masks, work, and distancing works, and we've heard it for over a year. I believe most people are capable of knowing this. Disregarding it a deadly practice."
2021-11-22 14:50,"Instead of focusing on our own personal risk, we should be focusing on limiting the stress on the medical system, on which we all depend, regardless of our Covid or vaccination status.   It's baffling to me how experts and laymen alike tend to fixate on personal safety instead.  When patients of all kinds can't get treatment, we're all at risk."
2021-11-22 14:50,It is my belief that the vaccinated and unvaccinated spread the virus easily. That the vaccinated are protected from illness but not from being infected. Is this possible?
2021-11-22 14:59,"My mom lives in an assisted living facility.  10% of residents tested positive in one day nearly two weeks ago.  All of them had 2 doses with the boaster scheduled for a week after that testing date.  They had more people test positive that day than in the previous 20 months combined.  

Covid-19 isn’t going away."
2021-11-22 14:39,"At this stage of the virus it is absolutely incredible that so many millions of Americans remain unvaccinated. The shots are plentiful and easily obtained. Yet for various reasons, many that stretch the imagination, people still refuse the vaccine. At the end of this year, after the holidays are done, it will be very interesting to see how high new cases have spiked. I hope I am wrong and that we do not see such a spike. But if many new cases arise, and if any of them are very severe, how many of these people will then start crying and wishing they got the shot today? Again, very hard to understand such mindsets. And absolutely incredible that millions of them actually exist."
2021-11-22 14:49,Before the Pandemic I vastly underestimated the numbers of ignorant people in our nation.   The volume of misinformation is beyond imagination.  The role of politics when it comes to public health is also unbelievable.  With all the data one would think that there would be a lot more intelligence in our nation.
2021-11-22 14:40,"COVID-19 aka novel coronavirus-19 aka SARS-2 aka COV-SARS-2 is neither benign nor malign in it's RNA genomic evolutionary fit quest to be fruitful and multiply.

COVID-19 is merely acting according to it's biological nature.

And so are the one and only modern DNA African primate ape species aka human beings acting according to their nature.

COVID-19 currently knows far more about to infect and spread among humans than we know how to deter,detect and defeat it."
2021-11-22 14:32,"What these articles in the Times don't do is present some context to the scarifying numbers they present.  Example: 
""In the last two weeks, reports of new cases have increased by more than 40 percent in Pennsylvania, by more than 80 percent in Massachusetts and by 70 percent in Indiana.""  Now, one reads this and says, wow, we must be doomed!  70 percent!  But then I clicked on the link to Indiana, for example, to discover that 70% meant 2,840 cases in a population of 6.7 million.  Among those cases, how many were the so-called ""breakthrough"" cases, how  many were among the unvaccinated, and more to the point, how many result in hospitalization and death?  As one commenter noted, they had symptomless breakthrough positive tests.  Just some thoughts to, perhaps, put things into context as this pandemic slowly rolls into endemicity."
2021-11-22 14:43,This whole covid thing will be used by the government just like the terrorism color coded threat level was used with Bush. They raise the level offers with the associated color. Covid warnings are used the same way To raise and lower the level of fear as they feel the need to. Fear is control. Control is power. If you're distracted by fear of those around you. You can't see what's happening with those above you.
2021-11-22 14:46,"This is so disturbing.  Tracking the NYTimes own data on vaccination and infection rates, we now can see for ourselves that states with a high vaccination rate are currently experiencing a surge in infections.  States with the lowest vaccination rates are, overall doing far better.

How can this be?

This phenomenon is also occurring world wide.  Check the stats for yourself.  For the average person trying to understand what's happening, the science seems elusive.  The media and government officials maintain that getting a large percentage of the population vaccinated is the key to ending the pandemic.

But, sadly there is more going on than even the experts understand.  The results of this study published on the National Center for Biological Information web site shocked me.  Not only is what we are being told incorrect, but even the scientists seem to be struggling to understand why.  

<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481107"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481107</a>/

My personal conclusion is that despite being ""vaxxed to the max"".  I'm continuing to wear my mask, avoid gatherings, and remain vigilant.  Better to be safe, than...well...dead."
2021-11-22 14:46,Please clarify vaxed  to the max does not prevent you from getting Covid or spreading it. Why do politicians and health professionals continue to lead people to believe and encourage them to act as if they are immune.
2021-11-22 14:41,"It’s open season for the virus on the unvaccinated and under-vaccinated.

Unfortunately, there will be a spillover to the vaccinated too: breakthrough cases, mask mandates, vaccine mandates and on and on.

Thanks to trump, republicans and the unintelligent among us, this virus has won and will be with humanity forever."
2021-11-22 14:35,"We could easily be at 90% fully vaccinated if it weren’t for three things:

1. The misinformation (and outright falsehoods) out there on social media and the airwaves. 

2. Politicization of public health measures by right wing politicians and media outlets. (Fox News is incredibly hypocritical in that they require employees to be vaccinated, plus masked when not on air). 

3. Anger and entitlement by right-wing voters who put their “rights” over the common good of the country. After all, the two reasons for a national vaccine campaign is to protect yourself, yes. But even more importantly to stop the disastrous spread of this virus to others who often less able to fight this virus off. 

This country is spiraling downward and it’s not due to the left. What Democrats are doing and have been for generations is trying to help people: paid parental leave, early childhood education, increasing access to healthcare, rebuilding our infrastructure, commitment to scientific research and education  - these are hardly destabilizing ideas. They are commitments to making life better for all of us."
2021-11-22 14:38,"So that's it.  We've given up.  We will never vaccinate enough people to get herd immunity thanks to the antivax movement, we will have another holiday surge as bad as last year or worse.  It's not because the virus is overpowering us.  It's because we never have, don't know, and never will really try to exercise the power we have against it.  We might as well reelect Trump in 2024, because his denialism fits the American public now more than Dr. Fauci's science."
2021-11-22 14:45,"When hospitals get filled with Covid patients, other medical conditions that need to be treated get short shrift. That means  people suffer and die from conditions that might have been successfully treated. We need to start publishing the numbers of deaths above the historical expectation, because this number is the true deaths caused by Covid.

I'm glad I'm no longer in medicine. I couldn't imagine dealing with a practice full of long haul Covid patients whom I can't treat, can't tell when or even if they are going to ever get better, and who would likely unload their frustrations on me.  It makes trying to treat chronic pain look easy.

I'm hoping the oral anti-virals work. But vaccines and boosters will always be required; we just don't know how often, yet."
2021-11-22 14:24,"The difficult truth of Covid is that there is no easy way now. Our UK vaccination rates are higher than in the US. In fact the US is in around 50th place on the global vaccination league table. So incentives there would help. 

But even in much more comprehensively vaccinated countries, there is still sometimes a surge in infections. In our case, and in several others, the question of whether to vaccinate younger children is key. They are more prone to almost symptom-free infection, and their risks from Covid are very low. It's hard to mandate for them when even the low risk from vaccination might be higher than from the disease.

The fact is that, for us after our boosters, we are close to a long-term equilibrium. And at this point restricting family gatherings just cannot make sense.

Maybe it will be necessary during infection surges to impose mask mandates, to restrict entry to potential super-spread events from night clubs to choir rehearsals, and sometimes to extend school holidays. 

But whatever we end up with needs to be depoliticised and acknowledged as the best we're going to get."
2021-11-22 14:46,"The story headline is that coronavirus. cases have ""ticked upward"" recently, a mild description in my estimation.  By the data posted in The New York Times,  the two-week rise is 29%.  If I received a salary increase of 29%, I would not call it a tick upward. Compared to the most recent minimum in the CDC's 7-day moving averages of cases on October 24 the current 7-day moving average is up 50% to over 90,000 per day.  That is nobody's idea of a tick upwards, as for example if the NYC police department reported violent crime in increased by 50% in the past two months. The story does not emphasize that the rise in new cases in the US, as in Europe, is primarily due the unvaccinated, ""tens of millions"" being that number stated in the article.  The actual number according to the CDC is 62 million eligible adults in the US are unvaccinated.  That's a huge pool for the virus to infect and cause havoc in hospital occupancy."
2021-11-22 15:04,"Voluntary vaccination didn't work. It didn't achieve inoculation in the high 90ies that would be needed to keep our health system from collapsing during a wave of infection.

Therefore, plan B now must be compulsory vaccination and boosters. We've had that before: Polio, small pox, measles. End of discussion!

We are heading straight into the  exact same catastrophe that Western Europe is finding themselves in right now. Except, our current vaccination rate is even lower than theirs, and our incidence rate is pointing upwards again from a much higher level than their base rate."
2021-11-22 15:11,"As unified a collective effort as possible is required, particularly with appropriate messaging being clearly issued from the CDC and the medical establishment, if we are ever going to get to the other side of this pandemic.  The disturbing fact that so many millions of people are traveling this holiday season without regard to the real risks they are facing, will no doubt play out in predictably higher and higher rates of infection and hospitalization. The booster shots have just begun, and now that we know how quickly efficacy wanes from the original two dose regimen, the outlook for this holiday season is indeed grim.  As far as those who are able to keep from getting severely infected and hospitalized, a third of those infected end up with long term symptoms.  As more and more Europeans protest Covid-19 restrictions, it seems unlikely that Americans will fully cooperate if and when similar restrictions are imposed due to skyrocketing case numbers.  Pandering to the impatience of the population for a return to normalcy is not rational or effective in the public health realm or any other realm.  But that train has left the station more than once.  It is time for the federal government to develop some leadership qualities and enforce the appropriate mandates no matter what holiday is upon us."
2021-11-22 15:18,"And we care about rising cases amongst the vaccinated because...?

What bearing should rising cases, deaths, and hospitalizations, overwhelmingly among the unvaccinated, have upon the vaccinated?

Everybody has their own comfort level with risk, perhaps some have a lower risk threshold than myself. But as long as I am vaccinated and wearing masks indoors in public spaces, then I don't see what else there is to do. We have to figure out a way to functionally live our lives with the risk of COVID."
2021-11-22 14:32,We are already hearing the anti-vax/anti-maskers blame Biden for the high levels of unvaccinated getting covid. It makes perfect sense.
2021-11-22 13:52,"When Dr. Olsterholm says this virus is throwing 120 MPH fast balls nobody saw coming, that is a concern. It's already defied many predictions and is persistently invasive in unpredictable ways. What's next? Pandemics of the past came and went. Some took a natural course and ended, some we wiped out with vaccines. This one defies both. It's more flu like, but worse, and there is such an unknown as to who it's victims are and why. No wonder people have fatigue over this. We can't ever fully understand it, nor fully guard against it. Is Mother Earth speaking to us? I know that sounds woo woo, but our mother is ill due to our treatment of her, and she may be responding. Something to consider at least."

2021-11-22 15:02,"First, if the organizations like CDC can't give Americans clear  instructions, they should be replaced by people who can.  Second, people who have not been vaccinated and/or do not wear masks should have to bear most of the costs of treatment when they get sick.  Third, we are giving our front line medical workers PTSD that they will pay for for the rest of their lives.  State and Federal government needs to deal with it now.  

We are at war with invaders that are as deadly as any military war we have ever been in.  Our defenses are wearing out and the invaders will continue to evolve in strength.  Our enemies abroad don't have to do anything.  They can just stand back and watch."

As you've sometimes reported -- we are now at a point where Covid is a ""pandemic of the unvaccinated"".

In many ways we have been lucky.     There is no way to interpolate trends from the graphs to predict where they go next.   That is to say anything is possible here today and all future scenarios are equally likely -- good, bad, moderate."

2021-11-22 15:32,"Now that people can protect themselves through vaccination, workplaces have tended to drop the social distancing measures in place last year to prevent spread around the holidays. I guess the assumption is that people will either protect themselves voluntarily or take on the risk willingly because they don't care about Covid.

I'm taking vacation days from work to social distance before seeing my elderly mother even though we're all vaccinated.  I would have liked to see my workplace promote remote work at this time, recognizing the special dangers of the delta variant for those who are vulnerable and the dramatic increase in cases, especially here in Michigan."

The average American doesn't understand epidemiological trends or statistical analysis. They only see how this all affects their lives and see it as the gov't moving the goal posts and interfering. The anti-maskers use these shifts in public pandemic policy as additional rationalizations to refuse masking.

2021-11-22 15:42,"The uptick in cases is not just because health officials that have largely stopped telling people to skip celebrations, but also because newspapers run what one commenter called “a cute, fun article” such as “We’re Having a Holiday Gathering. Are We Nuts?”

Of course the cases are ticking upward. We knew they would. We saw this last Thanksgiving. And last Christmas. And last New Year’s. We saw this the last time social distancing was lifted and mask mandates were lifted. We’ve seen this again and again and again.

2021-11-22 16:10,"Here in Texas we hear stories about younger people deliberately going out to get infected so that they can develop “herd immunity.” How true these stories are and how many of them there are I cannot say. But the idea that you are willing to risk long-term COVID with its lingering symptoms just so that you don’t have to get a vaccine that has been safely administered to millions of people who have not experienced any significant side effects — well, it is mind-boggling. I simply do not understand the mindset behind this notion. No one has ever been able to explain it satisfactorily or in a way that makes any sense. It seems as if quite a large number of people have simply surrendered to irrationality and ignorance about the safety of this vaccine. Microchips? Government tracking? Infertility? The vaccine itself causes COVID? Millions of people believe this nonsense? 

Every once in a while I imagine that this is all just one bad joke and that anti-vaxxers will pop up at some point and yell, “We’re kidding!” And then roll up their sleeves and do the right thing, so we can all get back to some semblance of normalcy at last."

For stats, visit John Hopkin/ Our World in Data(Oxford Uni) or ONS (UK stats office). They make chilling reading.

2021-11-22 17:04,"Folks “cases” “hospitalizations” “icu admissions/ventilator” and “deaths” connote vastly different things. 

In the NE we are seeing a spike of “cases” because although the vaccination rates are high, they aren’t nearly the 85-90% we need to stop the spread. We have a Republican Governor who is smart, understands the political landscape and follows science. We’ve had some pretty stringent rules and still require masks when indoors in public. We also have a public school mask mandate. But hospitals are not overwhelmed. 

Contrast this with Michigan, D Governor under death threats from anarchists and protests by angry white people, so … far fewer restrictions and hospitals are overwhelmed. I have an acquaintance in Grand Rapids (literally the buckle of the Bible Belt) who went to ER with dangerously high BP and had to sit on a hard chair in the waiting room for 7 hours. Why? Because the main hospital there (Spectrum Health) is overwhelmed with COVID cases among the unvaccinated >90%. >98% of deaths are among the unvaccinated. 

Breakthrough infections which require hospitalization are among the elderly, people with diabetes, or imunno-compromised, etc.

2021-11-22 17:01,"A pandemic risk mitigation response run by the American holiday season. The whole notion of it cracks me up. We rigorously adhere ( in some places) to the most stringent protocols : masks indoors, seeking vaccination, social distancing, avoiding crowds etc.,) but then a holiday is on the horizon and we decided ( routinely now) to drop all of that to socialize. I miss family gatherings as much as the next person but the notion that a holiday provides a ""break"" from risk mitigation is ludicrous."

With so many unvaccinated people, the initial pandemic response measures of masking and distancing are still necessary for the foreseeable future."
2021-11-22 16:47,Everyone has been offered a vaccine and can easily still get one for free.  Boosters are available.  Let's ditch the restrictions and live like we did in the olden days.
2021-11-22 16:59,"Yes, we can ""diminish covid"" but the reality is this won’t end until we accept that it doesn’t, in fact, end. last summer, the news media made the mistake of messaging that if you are vaccinated, you cannot get a covid infection. This was never the purpose of the vaccine, and the ongoing narrative of asymptomatic/mild ""breakthrough"" cases will make it difficult to move forward with a clearly defined goal in a highly vaccinated area like New England. The transition to endemic viral disease was always going to involve a difficult psychological step to acceptance. Many of us are still in the ""zero covid"" denial stage.
When it comes to mask mandates, social distancing, or any other covid restrictions, what is the limiting principle? Or, putting it differently, under what conditions can we get back to normal? Based on the public health logic currently in vogue, I worry that the answer is never and that we are entering a new regime–the tyranny of tiny risks as one observer said.
What is the goal here, exactly? If fully vaccinated people getting mild breakthrough cases is supposed to be the risk, what does safe look like? The last two months of public health messaging has served to terrify vaccinated people and makes the unvaccinated doubt the effectiveness of the covid vaccines. Political leaders need to find a way out of this box going forward."
2021-11-22 18:09,"In my family, all but the youngest have been vaccinated. The oldest hare gotten boosters. At this point, we have done everything we can to protect ourselves and others. We are comfortable. We will spend our holidays with no modifications  whatsoever. Traditionally, we all go to Fashion Island a festive outdoor mall suited for our climate in Southern CA. We will be attending Christmas parties with vaccinated friends. 
Are our risks zero ? No. But we have mitigated them to the point where we are more likely to get into a car accident than get seriously ill from the virus. That’s good for us.
Astonishingly, I have been judged by some who are far more risk adverse than me. Apparently, they want me to conduct myself so that they feel no risk from my behavior. Once I have taken all reasonable steps, I am no longer responsible for the fears of others. 
So, my family and I plan to have a good old fashioned extended Italian family holiday. I wish all others a happy holiday, however they choose to spend it."
2021-11-22 17:38,Cases heading up to where they were last year. Daily deaths nearly the same. Restrictions? None.  Based on these facts alone the post-holiday period could be quite rough
2021-11-22 17:28,"The real problem is that these vaccines aren't very good.  They don't block transmission, don't prevent you from getting the virus, and 6 months after you take them you need another dose.  If the focus was on improving the vaccines, instead of pretending they are so great, maybe we'd make some headway."
2021-11-22 17:50,"Several weeks ago I read in well-researched articles that vaccinated people with asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 can transmit the virus while shedding, just as easily as unvaccinated people.  It follows that vaccination does not stop transmission, and therefore unvaccinated children are at risk from vaccinated adults, and vaccinated adults can spread the virus to each other.  This risk factor, and how to mitigate it, is not mentioned in the article nor signaled by any of the experts.  

What am I missing?  Is the risk so insignificant that experts are saying, “go ahead, get a breakthrough infection, it probably won’t kill you or your kid?” Or have journalists just moved on?

Our family has grandchildren under 5, and vaccinated immune-compromised elders.  We are taking the same pre-vaccination precautions as last year, eating outdoors for Thanksgiving, and regretfully not celebrating with family members who have been mingling or living with unvaccinated folks."
2021-11-22 17:51,Countries need to finally realize that too many people are only concerned with themselves and will never freely make the right decision. Make vaccination a mandate for ALL.
2021-11-22 17:39,"The reason is very simple too many people are not wearing masks and too many are not vaccinated but are still out in public spreading disease. I recently traveled from MD to CA to return to my old home now that I am triple vaxxed. Along the way I wore my N95 mask and eye protection since I am in a high risk group. In place after place in red counties few people were masked indoors and in blue states many people were not masked. The data from around the world is now very clear. masks are effective at limiting the spread of this disease. Not perfect, but effective enough that combined with vaccination we could snuff out the pandemic. This fact if widely recognized would allow us to end the pandemic in a few months. It is time for stringent public health measures, mandatory vaccination and enforced restrictions on travel by unvaccinated people meaning no vax no public transportation. Any police officer or other public official in a contact job where a person MUST interact with the public, that official may not refuse vaccination and keep their job. If not vaccinated they are violating people's  Federal constitutional right not to be involuntarily subjected to serious harm by an officer. That means Federal law overrides all state objections and an officer who refuses vaccination cannot be allowed to serve. No matter what any State official says."

2021-11-22 18:37,"“This thing is no longer just throwing curveballs at us — it’s throwing 210 mile an hour curveballs at us,” said Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota. He said that the virus had repeatedly defied predictions and continues to do so.

This virus is not following a standard playbook because it’s not a standard virus. That said, there are many things that can be predicted, but those messages have not been well coordinated, nor are they popular.

1) Weather is a key factor influencing transmission. Extreme heat and extreme cold drive people indoors and limit ventilation options. If people don’t use masks indoors, which is unfortunately common with family and friends, transmission risk increases.”

2) The vaccines never have been, nor will be sterilizing. All the research on RNA viruses confirms this. It’s impossible to vaccinate against an RNA virus because of how fast and imprecisely they replicate. Go to Google scholar and read the primary research on RNA viruses, quasi species mutant swarms, and vaccine technology.

3) If you’re infected—whether vaxxed or unvaxxed—you can transmit the virus to others. There is plenty of primary research showing equivalent viral loads in vaxxed and unvaxxed patients. Since the virus transmits before symptoms arise, and only kills weeks after infection, anyone infected who doesn’t use a mask and practice social distancing will infect others.

4) Pandemic only ends when all chains of transmission are broken."

2021-11-22 19:14,"Dear NYT:

A mixed bag, indeed.  Note that while cases are rising in some areas, hospitalization rates and deaths are not spiking.

This trend demonstrates the following:

Vaccines are generally effective in preventing serious illness, even though people do still get covid after vaccination.  

The effectiveness of vaccines wanes over time, suggesting boosters are a good thing, especially for the J&J shot, which is the least effective.

Questions:  

1.  What if any effect does ""natural immunity"" play in driving this covid pattern?  Why isn't the CDC investigating this question?  Why is this question so partisan?

2.  Why are cases spiking in states that have continued much stricter measures, while Florida -- which has spurned lockdowns and mandates -- has the lowest rate of any state, and this success has continued for two months now?  

This suggests that the correlation between mandates and covid cases is weak, if it exists at all, and these waves of infection perhaps reflect seasonal changes, and a two month viral cycle, followed by infection elsewhere.

Thoughts?"

This isn’t a buffet where you choose what you like to do and implement it, it’s a recipe requiring all ingredients to produce the intended result. 

As for vaccines, they are preventing severe illness and death, but they are not sterilizing, so vaccinating without concomitant behavior change will never be enough."
2021-11-22 16:46,"There seems to be an inverse correlation between vaccination rate and infection spread. Countries with high vaccination rate like USA, most European countries, UK, Israel, Singapore have high infection rate despite vaccinating majority of their population. Yet the only prevailing narrative is blaming the unvaccinated. What if the vaccine is contributing to undesirable effect like antibody-dependent enhancement and increasing viral load and spread? There are certainly publications on this but we are living in post-scientific dystopia where every hypothesis that doesn’t fit the narrative is shutdown and derided.

As of last week, the breakthrough percentage is just under 1% (0.87%) of the 2.4M fully vaccinated people in CT. Of the 21,017 breakthrough cases, the percentage of cases in the under 65 age groups (not much use of boosters in these groups) is around 15%, pretty even distribution.  184 people of the 21,017 fully vaxxed breakthrough group have died.  This is a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.8%.  However, 133 have died in the >75 age group - this is a CFR of 6.4% (2,069 cases).  The recent nursing home cluster of covid cases here in CT had a case fatality rate of 12% - all fully vaxxed (reports indicate they had serious underlying conditions and had not been given boosters.)  For the entire pandemic here in CT, the case fatality rate for >70 years old is 17.9%.  Even with the vaccines and boosters, I think that the risk of death from covid 19 for people over age 70 is being radically underestimated by them as they consider holiday travel etc."

You may want to check those numbers. New York’s overall deaths per 100K are 292, close to Florida’s 284, not 13,784  (that is roughly NY’s cases per 100K). And by far the highest number of deaths per day in NY occurred between March and May of 2020 with a peak in April 2020 of almost 1,000 deaths/day. In the time before vaccines and most of those infections occurred before mask wearing and distancing were happening. Our hospitals were inundated, including the one where I work. Many of my coworkers were infected during that time period, and several died, along with some of their family members. Since that very difficult spring of 2020, New York’s deaths per day have not been anywhere close, with a high in January 2021 of ~193 deaths/day. 

Contrast that with Florida. In Jan 2021, Florida had 179 deaths/day, similar to NY, at a time when COVID was surging around the country. But Florida’s worst death rate occurred in September 2021, when deaths were in the high 300s/day. Also a time when vaccines had been widely available. I don’t know how many of those deaths could have been avoided with wider use of vaccines, masking, and distancing, but it’s safe to assume some number of them could have been. 

And back to your 13,784 number you cited. Yes that is roughly New York’s overall case number—13,741 per 100,000, as found on the NYT Covid-19 page. But Florida “beat” us in that, with 17,132 per 100,000. So

2021-11-19 16:26,"If the CDC wants more data on boosters, they should expand the V-safe database to include it.  I just tried to log in to the V-safe account I created for my initial Moderna shots, in order to record my booster experience yesterday.  Got a message that they would get back to me if they could find the account."
2021-11-19 16:36,"The sensible majority of Americans want their boosters, and in many cases are already receiving them regardless of the CDCs not having signed off on them. The CDC needs to sign off on the boosters if it has any regard for the country it serves. Otherwise it won't succeed in keeping them away from the people who want them, just in destroying its own credibility and arming the anti-vaxxers with more grist for their propaganda mills."

2021-11-19 17:19,"I've been a dutiful rule follower throughout the pandemic. I'm losing the plot on third-shot boosters for health young adults, though. I've spent far too much time reading blue-check experts and MSM news coverage on this question, and I still do not understand the case for boosting healthy young adults at 6 months, especially those who received Moderna. Do we know the 6-month interval is the right one? Is it possible the interval should be a bit longer for Moderna recipients? Does temporarily higher antibody status actually translate to more protection? How will either I or my community benefit from my getting a third dose?  How often are we going to need to do this, and how will it interplay with workplace vaccine mandates? And are we turning off the unvaccinated fence-sitters by constantly raising the bar to full vaccination?"
2021-11-19 17:17,"All adults in the U.S.  have been eligible  for months to receive a Coronvirus  booster   shot by walking into a CVS, Walgreens or any number of places.

I wonder how many Americans have died  or will die of COVID-19, have been or will be hospitalized , and have or will become 
""COVID Long Haulers"" while the F.D.A. and C.D.C.  ""experts"" 
 have dragged  , and in the case of the C.D.C, continue to drag  their feet ?

Israel discovered months ago that the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine waned after a number of months, and began boosting Israelis, starting  with those over a certain age, and those at high risk months ago.

Israelis began boosting  all Israelis  over the the age of 16 some time ago.

I knew that  I needed a booster shot as soon as Israeli scientists determined that a booster shot was needed.  

I don't know why the U.S. refused to rely on Israel's  data.
Had the U.S. modeled  it's overall COVID response on Israel, hundred of thousands of Americans who have died of COVID would be alive today.

The Vaccine Passports of Israelis who have not received a booster 
shot were invalidated some time ago. Israelis who have not received a booster shot  have been unable to  enter  restaurants, a number of other indoor venues, and have been unable to attend certain gatherings for  quite some time.

A number of other  countries  have been boosting all adults.

The U.S. was a world leader at one time. That is hardly the case now.

Don't wait for the CDC.  Save yourselves."
2021-11-19 17:34,"Based on some of the comments, it's clear that Coronavirus boosters won't be sufficient, given that no one has developed a vaccine that works  on know-it-alls who are certain that they know more than do experts."
2021-11-19 17:43,"The Oxford definition of a vaccine is ""Any preparation of immunogenic material suitable for the stimulation of active immunity in animals without inducing disease"".

Can we please stop calling the current Pfizer et al products for SARS Cov2 ""vaccines"" as they do not provide immunity. As described by Peter Doshi of the British Medical Journal, they are pharmaceutical drugs that must be taken every 6 months or so to be effective. It's not practical to keep injecting the entire global population with these drugs for eternity.

Those who are pro science should be pressuring governments for much better products i.e an actual vaccine, not temporary drugs that have caused major harm in many recipients with myocarditis, paralysis etc."
2021-11-19 17:54,"Two groups are the ""public.""  Group One is vaccinated and agreeable. Group Two are praying to get sick. Group One has not been informed when and how often to get a booster. CDC has implied that periodic boosters might be continuously needed, stressing the ""public"" who prefer health. One cannot go to Walgreen's and ask for a booster without stating a cause. One needs a cause to persuade Walgreens to administer a booster. This article set forth persuasion to Group One members but not a cause usable as currency with the people who have vaccine in their refrigerators or freezer shelves but need legal guidance as to whether to honor requests for jabs. ""Take this article to your pharmacy and ask,"" invites a goose chase. Goose chasing is counter-productive to vaccination promotion.

2021-11-19 18:21,"Once again, thanks to a  government bureaucracy, we are behind the 8-ball in this pandemic.  About a month ago I had to lie to the people at the vaccination site that my very elderly mother had an condition that left her immuno-comprised because, at that point, she was not eligible for a booster since her first two doses were Moderna.   Her age wasn't enough to, honestly, get her a shot.  All this should have been done in September, when it was clear these boosters were safe and effective.  Now that nursing home deaths are back, there needs to be a push to  get these people vaccinated.  Those folks should have had boosters months ago."
2021-11-19 18:22,"Good thing. We're seeing an enormous case spike in NH and VT, and the holidays are coming up fast. Wish they'd started sooner so more people would have been covered ahead of Thanksgiving with unvaccinated kids and intransigent adults."
2021-11-19 18:43,"Finally the bureaucratic machine has approved boosters for all  patients. But that means millions of people are now eligible for 3rd and 2nd doses of the vaccines. Over 190 million people have been vaccinated and how do we decide who should get them first? Which vaccine should they get since mixing has been authorized also? If doctors simply follow the CDC guidance, doctors are expected to figure this out base on risk factors and age. I have chosen to ignore the CDC recommendation against antibody testing and have used this as an objective way to prioritize or delay boosters in my patients. Their are studies now  that confirm the correlation with antibody levels and risk of break through infections. The CDC should have investigated the utility of antibody testing rather than declaring from the outset that they would not be useful--they are wrong. By simply checking spike protein antibody response in my primary care patients I was able to accurately predict results of the recent CDC study on breakthrough infections/deaths in June . My data suggested most breakthrough infections and deaths would occur with J & J , followed by Pfizer and then Moderna and the CDC study confirmed this hypothesis. If the CDC had studied antibody testing, they could have reached their conclusions regarding booster shot need a few months ago and may have saved thousands of American lives by making these authorizations sooner."
2021-11-19 18:50,What about those who took J&J more than 6 months ago? To begin with they only had one shot. Why are Pharmacies not allowing them to get a booster?
2021-11-19 18:44,"Wake up CDC-fully vaccinated now needs to mean three doses of vaccine, or two if J&J. 

We've got to stem the transmission of break through cases."
2021-11-19 19:23,"Finally, as data from Public Health England and the Israeli Ministry of Health have been telling us for months. For adults 60 and up, studies there showed this greatly reduces the incidence of severe breakthrough disease. For the hearty & hale, Dr. Fauci reminds us that symptomatic Covid isn’t fun. It’s never been a routine upper respiratory bug. Nontrivial potential for complications exists even in youth, with a protracted recovery after “mild” cases being common and a very high risk of spread to family or friends. The hospital crunch where I live is as bad as it was last winter.

We’re hearing objectors say the booster effect may prove short-lived. But that’s a bridge to cross when we get there. Or they say it proves the shots don’t work. That’s not true. The initial two-dose series still offers considerable protection to those who’ve had it, which the boost dose six months later improves on. The main idea isn’t an unrealistic expectation it will make the virus fade away; it’s that our healthcare system runs near capacity by design—and emergency Covid admissions put it over the top. We need our unvaccinated folks to get their initial series now, and those who did this last spring should think about the booster, especially if approaching age 60+."
2021-11-19 19:44,"They call it a ""booster"" but it's actually simply another dose of the same vaccine.

How long will it last? In Israel they're already giving people a fourth shot.

Since the existing vaccine doesn't prevent infection or spread of the delta variant, should we expect the same from the booster?

We've just started vaccinating children. Are they facing a booster every semester?

More importantly, what are the long therm implications of multiple vaccines over a short period of time?

Can you reliably test for that when the entire process from development to trial to market has taken place in less than a year?

I think it's time for a more open scientific discussion about these issues since we haven't really has one about these basic questions."

2021-11-19 22:35,"It's about time--indeed, long since overdue! The vaccines are fairly safe, and the FDA made a hash of things by not approving the various Boosters shots in on fell swoop. Simplicity and clarity is much better than having to pore through various contingencies, or dozens of varient rules, depending on age, or the brand of vaccine.

There is a gap of 10 or 11 Percentage points between eligible adults who have received their first dose, and those who have proceeded to get fully vaccinated. Many of those who are fully vaxxed will eschew getting their Booster Shots--at least, until they are required to update their Vaccine Passport, in their respective state."
2021-11-19 22:09,"""We know what the data are."" No we don't. This strategy reeks of desperation. Giving a third identical shot to already vaccinated people doesn't accomplish anything. The key to controlling the pandemic, if it's even possible, is vaccinating the unvaccinated, not vaccinating the already vaccinated over and over again. How about giving the rest of the world one shot first?"
2021-11-19 23:20,"If you haven't gotten a booster, go get one! 

The extraordinary efficacy of the boosters is the best news out of the pandemic since we first learned of the extraordinary efficacy of vaccines. Sure, the efficacy of the first shots wanes from extraordinary to very good over several months, but boosting your immunity to an (extra)-extraordinary level takes just a simple stop at the pharmacy counter. 

I don't think I'm being hyperbolic about these boosters; I had to do a double-take when I saw the results from the clinicals and observational evidence from Israel (<a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02249-2/fulltext"" target=""_blank"">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02249-2/fulltext</a>). 

No other intervention (barring fully authoritarian ones) has anywhere near the impact of vaccination. It was true for the initial doses, and now it's also clearly true of the boosters. Spread the word!"
2021-11-20 3:19,"A friend went to a family wedding a few weeks ago. All the guests were vaccinated. However, one guest had gotten a breakthrough and only showed symptoms two days following the wedding. Those who had gotten the booster were not infected. Those who had not yet gotten the booster and were more than 6 months out did get sick. All adults need to get the booster, even the young ones. A two or three-dose vaccine is not unusual. Scientists are learning as the data emerges about this novel virus. It's really not that complicated. Those who got sick because they didn't get the booster could have transmitted the virus to others."
2021-11-22 7:30,"I want to know when vaccinated people will be approved to have access to the Pfizer pills.  Yes, I know vaccinated people are less likely to be hospitalized, but it does happen.  So, if we get a breakthrough infection we should have access to the best treatment available, just like unvaccinated people.

Also, I called my doc to see how people can get either monoclonal antibody treatment, or the pills.  I was told you first had to go to an approved center to be tested, which could take 48 hours to get results.  That's already two days gone that could be used to treat the illness. Not what I wanted to hear."

2021-11-17 3:42,"It was clear in August that boosters were safe and effective, which is all that should have been required for the FDA and CDC to give them the OK for everyone to get them at that point.  I think they were putting on a show for the WHO in terms of limiting boosters.

 I went in for my booster last week, ready to explain my condition that would qualify me for the Moderna booster.  At the place I went, to they told me they weren't asking, they were giving the shots to anyone who wanted them.   Actually, if a person wanted to be deceptive, they could have gotten the shot when the immuno-compromised were eligible early on, since they weren't asking for proof for a condition. 

 Sorry to say, whether it was waiting for test development and approval early on, lack of information on mask wearing, discouraging the distribution of N95s, not recognizing the spread of covid through aerosols, not making monoclonal antibodies available, delays in giving the EUA to vaccines, and, now, delaying the approval for boosters the CDC, FDA, and medical establishment have let us down and cost lives."
2021-11-17 3:47,"While the CDC is meeting, perhaps they can undo the damage of their announcement last spring and call for a serious nationwide mask mandate.

2021-11-17 4:01,"Too bad the FDA did not get around to this earlier because Thanksgiving will certainly be a super-spreader event for many. And many at that point will be at the tail-end of their vaccine efficacy with the booster, if they can manage to get an appointment to get one, not yet providing them with full protection. Appointments will once again become hard to get for a while.

Based on my friends and anecdotes, though, many if not most already took advantage of the very broad interpretation of ""preconditions"" to get the booster."
2021-11-17 4:16,"Why did Pfizer only ask for approval of their booster for people 18 years and older? Their original vaccine was approved for people 16 and older. My child was vaccinated with Pfizer at 16, is now 7 months out from their second dose, and was turned away by our county health department when we went for booster shots today. I’ve read that teachers here, regardless of age or compromising health conditions, have been eligible for boosters for some time. Students need and deserve the same protection from Covid-19 via boosters as teachers."

So, now we are racing to get boosted, only 1/3 of the elderly are boosted and the conspiracy theorists have more ammunition.

Two months ago the mainstream media was excoriating Biden for creating ""confusion"" for calling for boosters for all by Sept 20th.  Of course, he always said ""subject to FDA approval"" but that was always left out.

Too many doctors were making up new claims about vaccines never before heard; that the sole purpose of vaccines was to keep you out of the hospital and from dying.  That sickness alone was not a reason to get a vaccine booster, especially since so many people in poorer countries had not yet gotten their shots yet.  And viruses mutant, don't you know.

Well, that claim by the doctors who said that would be news to the flu vaccine industry since many people get that vaccine to not get sick.

The claim healthy people don't need covid boosters because they will only get sick and probably recover is the greatest dereliction  of medical duty since doctors endorsed cigarette smoking as a cure for sore throats over 60 years ago.

I've read articles that said break through infections are reaching 20% of the fully vaxxed population.  At the time of the Provincetown Scare 5 months ago that number was about one percent.

It was reported last year during vaccine development that boosters would be needed.

I'm glad ""Dr"" Biden is on call."

The article notes: FDA’s outside expert panel (which previously voted 16-2 against) is not even being consulted (this is noted twice); government agencies would be acting “strikingly quickly” at the request of private industry; there will be a short meeting by CDC to approve; many have “taken the matter into their own hands.”"
2021-11-19 11:18,The best protection we have now is a vaccine shot and masks. To refuse this protection is to welcome the virus into your body. Sure there are people who get more problems. but they are very rare. If you don't protect yourself with a vaccine and masking you are extremely vulnerable to this dangerous disease. Who wants to die early if you have a choice that helps avoid death? I don't understand the people who are more afraid of vaccines than of Covid itself. It demonstrates a  very limited thought process. Get the shots and the booster and conquer illness and death now. And it's free as well. An easy fix. Protect yourself and your friends.
2021-11-19 14:31,"Not knowing the timeframe on booster expansion, I asked my pharmacy a few weeks ago if they were giving booster to the general public and they said yes. Sign me up. Done and boosted a couple of weeks ago. Just get it done. You can be sure another surge is on its way."
2021-11-19 14:34,The FDA should have done this long ago. So tired if their timidity.
2021-11-09 11:24,"Having lived in India for 2 years, (Peace Corps , Bhopal, MP) knowing how poorly the population was documented; the incredible populations just living out on the streets. I doubt any statistics about Covid 19 concerning, hospitalizations, inoculations or deaths would be accurate. We had nomadic families living just yards from the front of our home, who would move on in several months and a new family take their place."
2021-11-09 11:34,"They have a huge challenge ahead. They have done very well with other vaccines and have the work force to deliver 2 billion doses of vaccine. I hope they do. At least, vaccine hesitancy is lower than the USA."
2021-11-09 11:25,"Just shy of one third of the Indian population is below the age of 18 (about 400 million) and hardly any of them are vaccinated.  This is a large chunk of unvaccinated population and can easily cause many more mutants some of which might be resistant to the existing vaccines.

At this time only good news is that the second wave was so devastating that it resulted in immunity to a good number of people (herd immunity at the cost of millions of deaths)."
2021-11-09 12:06,"This is a huge win and restores confidence in political leadership, which India needs to confront Chinese aggression."
2021-11-09 12:20,"The vaccination drive in India has been an incredible feat. You have to give credit to the government where it is due. That said,  the risk of complacency is high. Because the vast majority of the country has not taken the second dose, it will not take much for another wave to sweep the land and bring it down to its knees (this is already happening in Germany for example). Yet, even today most schools and colleges in India are closed. A few are only tentatively open. Things are far from back to pre-covid normalcy."
2021-11-09 12:37,"“There is hesitancy for going for the second dose because the community thinks, ‘Do we really need it now?’” said Dr. Jacob John""
   India has 1.3 billion people. Next to China, no other country has these many people. China is an authoritarian government, able to vaccinate most of its people. That is an impossible dream for India. Modi’s government is now so confident that it will fully vaccinate all adults, some 900 million people, by the end of the year. Vaccines are available in India but people are hesitant. Even advanced countries have this problem. Only 58.4 percent of people have been vaccinated in the USA. This is a shame. According to the W.H.O, only 1 in 4 residents of wealthier countries have been vaccinated.
  India has a Herculian task. I hope Modi's government will achieve its goal but people have to cooperate."
2021-11-09 13:26,"Government of India has turned a leaf with regard to the vaccination campaign following the devastating second wave.
India’s robust grassroots vaccination effort has made possible the delivery of a billion doses of vaccine. This is also thanks to the relatively lower vaccine hesitancy in the population.
However, challenges remain in the form of people not returning for their second doses, lower rates in certain parts of the country, and overall decreasing drive. We shouldn’t become complacent.
I sincerely hope that the new door-to-door vaccination policy of the government brings us closer to herd immunity, thereby avoiding the emergence of a new deadly variant, decreasing hospitalisations, and achieving normalcy."
2021-11-09 13:32,"Yes but without accurate timely COVID-19 antigen and/or  antibody testing how can the Indian government know how much the nations infections and deaths have been undercounted?

And without COVID-19 contact tracing how can the Indian government know the status of the pandemic?

Moreover,  the COVID-19 dominant delta variant apparently mutated and evolved in India.

With so few of India's citizens fully vaccinated COVID-19 has another extraordinary opportunity to continue to mutate and evolve to become more RNA genomic evolutionary fit fruitful and multiply.

However,  COVID-19 is neither benign nor malign in it's quest.  COVID-19 is merely acting according to it's nature. And so are DNA genetic evolutionary fit African primate apes aka people acting according to their nature."
2021-11-09 13:48,"What articles like these miss is that there is significant antibody resistance to Delta, that will last for perhaps a year. Meanwhile, a new variant might emerge. Is it not smarter to preserve funding and efforts to vaccinate against that variant instead?

Countries like India don’t have inexhaustible funding to keep vaccinating against every variant even after widespread immunity. Waiting for the next variant to vaccinate the masses might actually be the smarter course!"
2021-11-09 14:48,"I am so happy that they are able to decrease the cases. Looking at the charts and seeing the numbers go down is amazing! We have a long way to go throughout all parts of the world, but seeing a country who has seen too much ruin  because of the pandemic dramatically reduce cases gives me hope that we will get through this!"
2021-11-09 14:56,"On July 20th the Financial Times reported that

	""An estimated two-thirds of people in India have Covid-19 antibodies, according to a new government survey that has raised hopes that the worst of the country’s pandemic crisis is over, despite a sluggish vaccination campaign.

The survey of more than 36,000 people in 70 districts across 21 Indian states found that 62 per cent of unvaccinated Indians had antibodies indicating past exposure to the virus.

The so-called seroprevalence study was carried out by the Indian Council of Medical Research in the last 10 days of June and the first week of July, just as a devastating second wave of Covid-19 infections was receding. Overall, more than two-thirds of Indians have antibodies, it concluded, either acquired from the vaccination campaign or past infection.""

In late June, early July, when the seroprevale stady was conducted, less tha 1/6 of the indian citizens were vaccinated with a single shot. Which means that a large proportion of people had been probably already infected.  Moreover, death rates have been falling dramatically since early June, when vaccination campaign was just beginning."
2021-11-09 14:52,"As this article mentioned, India's official statistics are an undercount by a factor of 10 to 15 at the minimum.
That means total infections about 400 to 600 million and fatalities in the millions.
That seems to be true given that during the delta surge starting April/May hardly anyone or their families remained unaffected. .
Whether this data fudging was intentional for image management or due to lack of testing and reporting resources, it is owed to those who lost loved ones to at least count them properly.
Their covid reporting is a sham, to say the least.."
2021-11-09 15:12,"The government with its vast bureaucracy, resources, administrative machinery should be on a war footing to convince hesitant population to get second doses if they already received the first. If it can conduct elections which draws people to vote in every nook and cranny in the country, I believe they can also conduct mass vaccination campaigns throughout the country."
2021-11-09 15:06,It will be depressing to find out how bad it was in India eventually . . . if we ever do.
2021-11-09 15:28,"I hate to be a pessimist, but I think there is ample evidence from experiences in other countries (think Israel) wherein sufficiently high proportions of vaccinated adult populations have failed to prevent localized or more general outbreaks of COVID. Here, given the low proportion of vaccinated adults, a sense of complacency and `lowering of the guard,' I fear a third wave is inevitable.  

While the pace of vaccination picked up in the last six months it will take perhaps at least a year for us to reach 60 to 70% vaccination levels of the entire adult population, which is more than sufficient time for fresh variants to emerge and new outbreaks to happen. 

We have a long way to go before we declare victory over COVID and I believe the ‘new normal’ of masking, social distancing and being vigilant will really have to continue for many more years to come. A silver lining is if we can make a relatively inexpensive tablet regimen for early-COVID,  which could reduce the fear factor and terror associated with the condition and boost overall outcomes in a vaccinated population."
2021-11-09 15:29,Do people actual believe the government's claim of 1 billion vaccinations?
2021-11-09 15:50,"Atul Loke's photograph at the beginning of the piece is truly wonderful. The brilliant colors and focus, exceptional composition and interplay among the people in the image create an outstanding image.  Thank you for publishing it, NYT, and thank you, Atul Loke."
2021-11-09 15:46,"Just in case some of us think that the poor rate of vaccinations in India is 'their problem', let's think again. If, for lack of vaccination a new and potentially more dangerous variant shall develop....than may, easily, boomerang to the rest of the world. And, yes, that includes America, another country defiant of accepting an effective and safe vaccine...for lack of solidarity."
2021-11-09 16:21,"It is fair to sound the alarms due to lower full vaccination rate, however sero positivity rate in high in the range of 75% range which means many were asymptomically infected already and have antibody present in the body. Kolkata had a big Durga puja festival back in early October with thousands thronging the puja venues, while covid rate went up afterwards it is no where near what was feared by some. I don't expect any more massive spike unless there is a new Delta like variant."
2021-11-09 16:42,"When India went though it’s second wave, I was furious with the Government for what seemed to be a callous and unplanned response to the pandemic.  The scenes of suffering in our urban centres, in particular the shortage of oxygen, seemed unforgivable. Infection rates were out of control and whole neighbourhoods were getting infected at the same time.

However, with the benefit of hindsight, we know that India was the first country to experience the delta variant, and no matter how well the Government had planned, immense hardship was inescapable. Much richer countries with much better healthcare systems are still struggling to deal with this variant.

What is also indisputable is that the Indian Government learnt many lessons from the second wave.  Since June, they have run an excellent vaccination program in difficult circumstances.  They have hammered a message of mask wearing and social distancing to a massive, under-educated and often ill disciplined citizenry.  And they have developed calibrated escalation plans which will be activated as and when infection rates pick up.

Of course, compliance has reduced as cases have declined to virtually nothing.  This is human nature and it’s unrealistic to expect people to lock themselves in their homes for ever when daily new cases are 1 in a million (as in Delhi) and hospitals are empty.

It’s easy to criticise as this article does, but it would have been good to also acknowledge the progress that has been made to combat COVID."
2021-11-09 16:44,"The second wave was ferocious and every one talked to mentioned a distant or near acquaintance that had succumbed to Covid.  Before vaccines, there was second wave.  After vaccines at 25% coverage, there is a 90% seroprevalence.  It is not surprising that people are moving on with their lives.  Students have to get back to classes and school meals."
2021-11-09 16:49,"Like in the US and elsewhere, Covid will be slow-burning endemic in India.  Unfortunately, in such circumstances, there will be a continuous mortality in the weak and immunocompromised.  If such a population is carefully targeted for vaccinations, it would help."
2021-11-09 15:56,"I'll never forget the photograph here in the Times a few months back or so, of bodies that were floating down the river, draped in sheets.  If that's not enough for them to at least try to beat this thing, they'll never get it done."
2021-11-09 16:08,"I had been fully vaccinated for over 6 months and had been religious about all the recommended precautions... masking, distancing, hand washing.
I felt confident that I was protected against Covid.

Then I forfeited my good sense and joined about 100 other maskless people at a wedding.  It was outdoors but there was a lot of people, hugging and kissing.  I came home with Covid. Several others did too. 

If you don't follow Covid protocols, you are not safe."
2021-11-09 16:28,There are many Indias operating simultaneously.  One is 100% locked to US and follows US much more closely than India.  One is 100% locked out of everything and this includes vaccines too.  The middle group is what votes for Modi and for whom Modi is responsible for; this group does not find fault with Modi and is willing to work with him.  Most of the suffering is for the locked out group.
2021-11-09 17:35,"Due to high ACE-2 affinity, high viral titers & rapid growth in cell culture, Delta is able to out-run memory B cells in the 4-7 days it takes them to start proliferating in a secondary immune response. Hence, Delta has to wait until antibodies in the population wane - even though memory B cells remain - and so the 6 months it takes for antibodies to wane is the approximate lag between successive waves.

India had little to no management interventions or widespread behavioral changes after its first wave, when an initial botched intervention caused a migrant crisis that then caused a relaxation of control measures. With few to no control measures in place, the first wave in India peaked at the correct deaths per-capita due to disease under the theory that the ancestral SARA-CoV-2 strain causes US-like populations to have cases peak at 1 death per 1,000 capita (instead of common estimates from the currently dominant but outdated theory that COVID cases peak at 6 deaths per 1,000 capita - we didn’t see that occur in a single unmitigated outbreak across the whole US). Consequently, India’s second wave can be seen as the first glimpse of endemic COVID outbreaks spaced 6 months apart & driven by waning immunity & an immunoevasive variant.

More importantly, media coverage based in the outdated theory causes mismanagement of low/middle-income country outbreaks, prioritizing expensive vaccines and control measures for outbreaks that have already run their course."
2021-11-10 2:23,"The article covered many points correctly. Many of the comments were made without personal knowledge of actual ground reality in India. The pandemic is unprecedented. All countries suffered. India's population size, social and political diversity are to be noted. The vaccination drive in the past months was massive and had positive impact. India has vast experience in mass vaccination drills and medicine production. Perceptions colored by prejudicial political views can not hide facts. It is apparent one always can pick up only some negatives and highlight them."
2021-11-09 17:08,"I worry about ageing family members who remain in India.  The Indian culture is strangely given to hubris despite thousands of years of evidence that hubris has been our downfall.  Then there is the glorious celebration of the completely irrelevant and unimportant (Indians hold world records on standing upright the longest, longest finger nails, and longest mustaches).  

Hubris?  Indians believe we are the smartest, most enterprising, most capable, most innovative, most super of powers, most resistant to disease, that we have all the remedies for all possible ailment (often involving a mix of godmen, potions, and spells), and everyone else is basically plain stupid to one extent or another.  

No amount of evidence that the reality is the exact opposite fazes anyone.  

This Covid thing is deadly; the population is already fighting an extreme levels of polluted air, water, and food, poor eating habits, malnutrition among many (to the extent growth and height has stunted) and obesity among many (to the extent that diabetes and heart disease are big killers). 

It is one thing in an advanced nation like the US, where the government and the population is strangely indulgent of the most self-absorbed irrational anti-vaxxers and has the president on down begging people to be vaccinated, it is quite another in a poor country (an average Indian is thirty times poorer than an average American) to go complacent.  In India, people will die horrifying deaths.  Hence I pray hard."
2021-11-09 19:08,"I live in a place where vaccine complacency reigns, right-wing crazies question vaccine efficacy, government officials in various parties peddle untested treatments and hospitals are overrun with Covid patients and people are dying left and right.

I dont live in New Delhi, Mumbai or Bangalore.

I live in Denver, Colorado where our Covid Numbers are soaring, surgeries are being cancelled and vaccination rates have plummeted. People are dying not just from Covid but from lack of access to health care due to Covid patients taking up hospital beds. I know this because I am cancer surgeon who has had to tell numerous patients that they cant have their cancer removed because the hospital is over run with Covid patients. 

Stupidity and complacency are not limited to developing countries. They fester right here at home as well."

I was quite sad that due to the COVID panic, the hospital that would have normally admitted him for his first heart attack had no beds available. Unfortunately, the nursing home he was admitted to was inadequate and he passed away in less than 48 hours of admission and due to the strict lock down and travel ban I was not at his side after his heart stopped beating.

2021-11-10 3:45,"Modi’s record in controlling COVID-19 is way superior to what happens in USA. In US, the COVID is still persistent because people do not want to get vaccinated. India is a country of 1.3 billion. So getting everyone to agree to get vaccinated is no small task. However government policies sometimes get off the wrong foot, as in USA. When the 2nd wave started Modi saw the grim picture and acted effectively to get maximum vaccinated at least once. Even the skeptical USA could not match the performance of India’s prompt effort. So I do not see why the article should suggest that complacency, that is mostly the fault of the people - because they are flouting Govt restrictions - could be a fault of the Modi govt. Nowhere Modi asked people not to get vaccinated. So why this Modi-bashing?"

2021-11-09 12:45,"Utter Pradesh is India's largest state with 230 million people. And it was initially one of the hardest hit regions for covid.

With a comprehensive approach to addressing the pandemic they achieved dramatic reductions in hospitalizations and case fatalities.

Their work was so impressive that they received special recognition from the World Health Organization.

But what neither the WHO or the NYTimes is willing to admit is that much of their success was due to the early use of Ivermectin and HDQ, along with zinc and asythromyasin. 

These ""Covid treatment packets"" were distributed by the millions. The instructions were simple and did not require trained medical personnel to administer.

The results speak for themselves. While American media went on and on about horse medication, public health officials in India actually followed the science and saved tens of thousands of lives.

Their work is documented in several studies or can be reviewed in brief at Trial Site News on Youtube.

Similar results were achieved in Mexico City with a trial of over 200,000 people.

Meanwhile we await new drugs from Merk and Pfizer that are supposed to do what Ivermectin has been doing, with one exception. They are unproven, have no safety data and are much more expensive.

We have made many mistakes in our public health policy. Fortunately, the doctors in India don't have to listen to our NIH or CDC and have demonstrated results through their own skill with controlling this pandemic."

This is not just a story about organ donations and a poor soul with long COVID.  It's a story about organ donations and someone who poisoning themselves, against all reasonable medical advice.

Maybe organ recipients should be warned about that, too?   Organs damaged by COVID, or by the frantic attempts to self-treat?"
2021-11-08 15:11,"Ms. Ferrer's death was a tragedy, and the impulse to help others from her death was laudable. But the science 'isn't there' yet. 

It is with Hep C. A Hep C positive donor goes into a negative recipient -- who is then treated for Hep C and cured of it.

It happens with, of course, informed consent. 

Soon, very soon, antivirals will be available for Covid. Perhaps then, the risk will be worth it. 

Perhaps a transplant team would be willing to pursue this, for now with Covid positive to Covid positive as a first step. I can envision lung transplantation in that scenario."

2021-11-08 17:14,"My sincere sympathy to the Ferrer family for the loss of Heidi and all they have been through. I know this situation has not helped and I hope they can someday lay the burden down- regardless of the eventual outcome, the recipients of her kidneys got some decent healthy time without dialysis, and probably will judge this to have been a good trade. 
Again, my condolences."
2021-11-08 17:46,"I think the doctors did the right thing. Donating organs that were in good condition to people on the verge of dying without receiving a new organ is ethically sound. Transplant patients know they will have immunocompromised systems from the anti-rejection meds they will be on, and it beats dying waiting for a ""cleaner"" organ. 

What a shame Ms. Ferrer desperately resorted to disproven measures (enough ivermectin to damage her liver, an odd diet) instead of finding doctors with more insight on long Covid who may have saved her before she destroyed herself. Condolences to her family. I hope they are all vaccinated."
2021-11-08 17:49,Should this even be a question. I personally think not. Why were 99.9% of COVID19 patients buried without their families being able to even view their bodies or give them private burials. Could it be because the initial deaths were minorities. This is the big elephant that is not being discussed out loud.
2021-11-08 18:27,My brother died of colon cancer. He donated his body to science. I would imagine that's what will happen with Covid patients.

2021-11-08 20:20,"This article would seem to imply that those with ""long covid"" still have the virus replicating in their body.  I thought the general consensus is that ""long covid"" (like other post-viral syndromes) is not an active infection but an inflammatory or autoimmune response that persists after the infection has resolved."
2021-11-08 20:45,@nyt thanks for the sensational article. You forgot to mention how the kidney transplant recipients are doing.
2021-11-08 20:48,"I remember instances where patients received transplants from donors that were HIV positive and they ended up contracting it and dying.

Scientists are still trying to figure out Covid-19. Until they figure it out and deem it safe, they should refrain from using donors who have contracted Covid-19, long termers or not."
2021-11-08 20:31,"Were the organ recipients informed  in advance  that the organs came from someone who died  of Covid?

If not, it sounds like a possible legal case in the making. 

Disclosure:  I am not a lawyer and therefore cannot offer legal advice. If you have received an organ or any other body part from a person with Covid without being informed in advance, you might want to consult a lawyer."
2021-11-08 20:54,"I understand that some will think what am about to say is cruel, but it appears to me that this woman had issues beyond long term COVID. She took a drug that is not only harmful to humans, but well known to be ineffective against COVID to a degree that her liver was compromised. She used other folk remedies hoping for a cure. While she apparently was very ill, and it is easy for me to say, she had only been ill for a year or so.

I had swine flu 12 or so years ago. I was so sick I hoped I would die, but I didn’t. Recovery took months and months and months. But I recovered. I didn’t use any weird, disputed medical treatments. Or folk medicine. I sat in the sun, got a lot of rest, ate as healthy as I could, did my required duties sparingly, and so incrementally slowly that I could not judge from day to day, I recovered. I am sorry she couldn’t stick it out, but, in my mind, she most likely would have recovered."

2021-11-08 21:14,"We do not know that yet, and until we do the answer is a resounding NO. This is a matter of scientific investigation and conclusion not of opinion. Mr Guthe is correct in his concern. 

And there is only one ethical answer in my opinion. There should be no organ donated from people who have been infected until there have been scientific studies or some kind of new knowledge regarding the longevity of COVID and its effect on the wholesomeness and functioning of human tissue and organ health over the long term."
2021-11-08 22:50,"Used to have myself down as organ donor on drivers license. Once I was diagnosed with lupus, my rheumatologist suggested I take off the designation. It's too bad."
2021-11-08 23:42,"I had long-term Lyme, and it did not consistently come up on blood tests. Not all tests are highly accurate. We do not yet know if long-Covid is the same, and thus difficult to test with our current knowledge.

I had been an organ donor, as listed on my driver's license.

To protect any possible recipients, I changed the status of ""organ donor"" on my license. I did not feel it was ethical to donate organs from a body that felt like it was dying and in awful pain & constant malaise. 

There were days during long-Lyme when I felt like ending it. 

Luckily I was recommended a Lyme-literate doctor who, eventually, healed me. I am now fully healthy and am again an ""organ donor"" on the ID.

It is unethical to maintain one's donor status if what we may be donating is suspect. But, when one is sick it is difficult to think of everything. It was up to the hospital staff to stop this donation.

And, my deepest sympathies to this beautiful family. The pain and shock is written on their faces. So many millions of us have lost our loved ones during this tragic pandemic.

Hopefully, ""long-Covid literate"" doctors will emerge, just as they have for Lyme."
2021-11-08 23:52,"She was never diagnosed with covid. When she claimed she was symptomatic, she tested negative. She had many tests run by multiple doctors, was offered diagnoses and treatment, but she rejected all of this. Instead, she proceeded to take many over the counter medications, vitamins, and other alternative remedies, months after her negative test. These include Benadryl, Pepcid, Tylenol, Ibuprofen, CBD oil, Ivermectin, Claritin, Vitamin D, and electrolytes. Misused and even used appropriately, some of  these medications can and do cause organ damage. It's obvious from her blog that she has very little medical knowledge, but is convinced that she knows more than the doctors. Even if she had covid, her behavior was completely irrational. If covid caused all of these issues, (no evidence it did) then treat the issues, but she didn't. Just because her husband indulged her delusions doesn't mean you have to indulge his. He is grieving and possibly simply in denial about his wife's mental health and true nature of her illness and death."

Should the organs that have COVID in them be transplated to an unsuspecting patient, or should they be duly informed and have the right of first refusal over those organs?  Personally, I would pass on those organs, but then again, I am not desperate for organs.  I think this is a shame that she is no longer with us, but that raises other issues relating to medical knowledge and technology.  My condolences to the family, who must be in deep grief over their loss."
2021-11-09 1:22,"Even the question should not be asked whether her organs should be donated to some other individual. It is like asking whether the organs of an individual dead of AIDS should be transplanted into someone else.

2021-11-09 1:33,"I'm curious about how a suicide ends up on a ventilator in a hospital. I mean the poor women succeeded in killing herself, right? I spent a lot of time managing patients in ICUs who signed up to be organ donors, most of them are already on ventilators and when they're declared brain dead we artificially keep the body going so the surgeons can harvest their organs which are receiving blood flow and oxygen. 
Interesting the article did not mention if Ms. Ferrer received the vaccine. I recall reading that helped many patients with long Covid. 
I'm assuming transplant recipients have gotten the vaccine prior to their surgery. The medications used to tamp down the immune system will hamper the ability to make antibodies, but it's better than nothing. Maybe treat them prophylactically with the new medication that's supposed to work wonders on preventing Covid patients from deteriorating? And we're not hearing much about antibody treatments anymore, whether monoclonal or poly. My experience working in emergency rooms says those treatments are really efficacious. Used it for things like rabies, tetanus, snake bites, and even more exotic viruses."

2021-11-08 15:50,"My husband had a liver transplant.  In this particular case I feel the organs should not have been donated due to the whole transplant experience being terrible.  I'm very grateful that my husband received a liver but the whole first year after the transplant he was in the hospital five more times and his was a good case!  Just the body getting used to ""new"" organ inside is a long and hard road in itself; just imagine how awful a covid damaged organ could make the experience.  Even with good organs some people have extensive trouble for years after transplant.  Not all organs are perfect, my husband will be on another pill besides the antirejection medication for the rest of his life due to that, but I wouldn't want to imagine what horrors a covid damaged organ could cause.  You know those organs are damaged because covid has been found in men's testicles, for heavens sake.  If I were this gentleman I'd be looking for an attorney.  She had made the decision to donate before she had covid and with the long haul illness she went through there's a good chance she would have changed her mind if she hadn't been so sick.  He knew her best."
2021-11-09 3:38,"I may be incorrect from my five minutes of Internet research, but Ms. Ferrer seems to have been a long-term alcoholic, which she detailed in public blog postings.

Of course it will ripple through the economy and of course there will be negative side effects of not keeping the economic engine rolling as it has been, but that economic engine has crushed people into jobs that don't contribute to a meaningful, enjoyable life. I'm glad to see workers worldwide reevaluating their priorities and not just eating the stale leftovers from rich executives who feel that the workers are lucky to be eating anything at all."

""It could mean a longer wait for Nike sneakers, Lululemon yoga pants and Under Armour tank tops before the holidays.""

I wonder what happens with last Christmas' sneakers, yoga pants, and tank tops. For example, Ghana imports massive amounts of used clothing from the US, UK/Europe, and Australia for resale in local marks. Most of what they receive is rubbish and immediately gets tossed to the bin where it winds up in massive landfills. Given synthetic fibers can take hundreds of years to break down, this is going to be a problem for generations to come. 

I also wonder how many of those shoppers that consider themselves to be in favor of taking action against climate change realize that taking part in our over-consumer culture is a big part of the problem."

Also, good for us. Most likely all of us have enough sneakers, tops, sweaters, you name it.

There are many possibilities if such a worker shortage becomes a norm not only in Vietnam but also in China (it's possible) and in other Asian nations where many of our apparel and footwear are made. One is that prices that we will pay will increase substantially, perhaps 25 percent, perhaps more. 

This will have little effect on the wealthy, but for the rest of us it might produce a change in our consumer habits. We might buy only items that we need. Really need. This might seem like a loss, but if most of us are in the same boat, it will lessen the sting."
2021-11-12 18:51,"A lot of people in the US are placing the blame for recent inflation numbers at the feet of American officials. But this article illustrates that inflationary pressures are broader and more complicated. In addition to all of the money sloshing around our financial system, in addition to pent-up demand that’s finally being unleashed, and in addition to issues with our ports and shipping containers, workers around the world are demanding better compensation for the risks they take and the work they perform. I’m fine with that. I just hope it becomes part of the larger narrative since it’s a very real ingredient in the economic situation we face."

No need to artfully tie climate change into this discussion. This is all a matter of profits using an altruistic argument that we're improving the economic lives of impoverished people. We're primarily helping stock holders, investors, and shippers who are  making huge profits while the consumers worry about petty things such as were can I buy 10 pairs of socks for $1 and similar garbage.

2021-11-12 19:12,"About 20 years ago we closed our little sewing and woodworking factory in Vermont. China, in collaboration with, Walmart, Target, Bed Bath and Beyond, Linen N Things, and even LL Bean decided to make our products off-shore. They weren't just picking on us, it was industry wide and many other small US companies suffered the same. We quickly made familiar with 'reverse auctions'... where the retailer put US products on a websites  and invited manufacturers from all over the world to bid towards the lowest price... The American Company was invited to join in the bidding, lol. US manufacturers never won unless they quickly opened a factory over in Asia. Bye bye American jobs.

So our workers with paid lunch, benefits and $14 an hour, working a 35 hour week with state of the art programmable sewing machines and custom designed, worker-friendly woodworking equipment were replaced by Asian workers getting $8 a WEEK (6 day, 50+hr week) working in sweatshops.  The resultant products were substandard but the US retailers usually kept the same price on the merchandise, with those new profit margins they could afford to take back any customer returns (which they deducted them anyway from the Chinese invoices, lol).

So now America (and a lot of other countries) have to figure out the next group of workers to exploit. Not to worry, It's a big poor planet. Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, the Caribbean, Africa.

At the same time, the different between the poorest people in these developed and developing countries are also becoming narrower while the gap between the rich and the poor within any of these countries are growing at an alarming pace. The corporate exploitation of both natural and human recourses are not sustainable.   

It's bound to affect global political stability in all these countries and the developed countries who historically enjoyed higher quality of life will suffer more.

But formerly Covid-free countries which opened up and let the virus in for sake of economic activity may regret having done so. Although mass vaccination will ease hospitalization & death fears, protecting the healthcare system, it has become obvious that this measure cannot stop community spread.

They didn't do that despite their pledges to be enlighten global brands.  
The local government in their zeal to attract investments fails to enforce labor laws and to timely and quickly provide social safety net and support to the workers after lockdowns.  The local contractors are just as too greedy and callous to their workers.
I applaud those workers who returned to their villages and refused to come back to toil in the factories for slave wages.  I've been to the Vietnamese countryside and villages.  Life is peaceful and much less stress.  Subsistent farming is much preferable to toiling 10-12 hours a day in a factory.

When finally given the chance to see their families again, they have reassessed their values just like everyone in the world who has been affected and decided that having time with their families is more important.

This is very good news.

The workers have the alternative of returning to farming or whatever else they were doing before they found factory work so much more remunerative. Good for them for having that option.

The environment will benefit from fewer factory machines using coal-fired electricity and from fewer boats burning bunker fuel while transporting containers around the globe. Western consumers will learn to live with less in the way of unnecessary items clogging their closets and unavailable truckers will not be hauling those containers to a big-box store near them.

All in all, this looks like a very good way forward into our collective shared future here on Earth.

While somewhat different, it really is the same here in America: workers quitting their jobs are doing every one of us a favor. And because America is richer that most of the rest of the world, many more of us can afford to simply stay home and stop producing. That is the biggest of big wins as we begin to confront climate change in a serious way.

Markedly fewer consumer goods (which are invariably produced using copious amounts of fossil fuel energy); dramatically less shipping via boat, rail, and road; and, fewer unnecessary shopping trips all add up to a win-win for all of the world's citizens."

We then discard or store these things forever as clutter when we are tired of them, or when they are no longer in fashion, only to buy some more things to replace them.

1. Consumers have the ability to stop corporations of turning the workers of the world into one big sweat shop. 

2. Every country should produce what its citizens need and want. What a country needs but cannot produce can then be imported. People must pressure corporations to keep jobs in the country and support citizens. 

3. When corporations move production of needed and easily made products to other countries, they are depriving their own countries’s citizens of income and their governments of tax revenue, which funds security. 

Our current laissez faire attitude toward outsourcing of jobs and private equity draining the pension funds of corporations must stop."

2021-11-13 1:44,"It seems to me most of these comments are missing the point. Before the virus all these workers were doing relatively well for standards in Vietnam. And Vietnam is as far I can tell a success story coming back from the war. They are one of our largest trading partners. I think workers of the world should unite too. But if all the workers don't unite than companies will just move production somewhere else. And that looks like what is going to happen. 

  These people are worried about safety. They are scared of the virus. They are also mad that some of the companies left them dangling in the wind when the pandemic hit. Hey I would love to stick it to Nike. I hated them since they used the 'Lord's Prayer' in one of their commercials. And they got a hold of the Beatles 'Revolution' (through Michael Jackson) & totally distorted that song. That was 20 years ago. Many of these companies do exploit the workers. But that is a different problem than the uncertainty that Covid has brought. What will happen to these people? 

 Yes who really cares if the well off consumers can't get their sneakers & sweats in time. I don't. But this is a tough choice these people face. They're not getting $500 a week in unemployment benefits. And these jobs are not coming back here. That you can be sure of."

Most consumers would gladly pay $5 USD more for their  running shoes for some objective credible  assurance that the workers producing them are treated with dignity."

Heck, we don't even make spools of thread in the U.S. anymore.
I really don't care if the Chinese and Vietnamese or anyone else doesn't return to the sewing factories.  I care about unemployed Americans who need good paying jobs and careers.

In 2015 when the former guy announced his candidacy for president he said some things that Bernie Sanders could have said. I thought he could be elected as the other party had a weak candidate. Their national committee was incompetent. The former guy is dangerous and a threat to our country. The opposition does take him seriously at their risk. At times I believe he will never be indicted as the beltway insiders also don’t want to be indicted. In the past forty years the middle class has been hollowed out by our money class.

The greater burden on businesses is workers quitting and  inability to hire because of covid.Also rising cost of materials,and lost business opportunity because of covid.Eradicating and containing covid is in the interest of all businesses and all commerce. The vast majority of workers do not want to work in a workplace made unsafe by covid.Unvaccinated employees not taking the shots is decimating businesses. Workers can get hospitalized and die after contracting the virus at the workplace,from an unvaccinated coworker or a vaccinated coworker who has transmitted the virus.

Moderna would be an unknown company but for U.S. government collaboration and support.  As a taxpayer, and for the benefit of all, I want the government to vigorously oppose Moderna's patent application as filed."

In many partnerships, the government has been the sine qua non of the great discoveries.

When I worked for the US Army Corps of Engineers I obtained a patent on a revetment block.   It was produced because of an identified need of the Corps' Pacific Ocean Division and at their request.   The patent was assigned to the Corps of Engineers, i.e., to the US Government.   Most employers retain the rights to any patents produced by their employees.   Because of the way patents are issued, they are issued to the employee, but assigned to the employer.   That is the way things are supposed to work."
2021-11-09 20:21,"I would bet significantly that Moderna is right on this.  Inventorship on a patent has very clear requirements, specifically that the inventor has to contribute materially to the specific, technically-stated claims.  It is highly unlikely Moderna would leave off an inventor because that is a sure way to have a patent invalidated.  Whether a scientist was in the lab at the time, or contributed to aspects that are important but not detailed in the patent, or what agency funded the work, has no bearing on who is listed as an inventor."
2021-11-09 20:30,"Claiming that the question of inventorship on a patent is a matter of “fairness and morality at the scientific level” shows a lack of awareness of the patent laws.  Getting the inventors wrong will invalidate the patent.

And it is curious that the people who think that Moderna will earn too much money from the patent are content with allowing licensing fees to flow to the government instead.  That is a political, not economic, preference."
2021-11-09 20:33,"Scientists are in a tough spot. Without funding from government and private sources,  they cannot do their research. But the work of the research itself is theirs-- their knowledge,  their skills, their efforts,  their late nights, etc. Their research also builds on research that came before, including and especially research that did not produce the expected results. Knowing what does not work is critical, yet no one wants to reward or publish efforts that reveal the wrong approach, of which there are many before finding what works.  Big Pharma and defense contractors make huge sums of money off of the efforts of all those PhDs, lab scientists and engineers. Some of those profits need to be returned to financial investors, including taxpayers, as well as to those who invested their talents."
2021-11-09 20:38,"Regardless of this particular patent decision, Moderna is going to lose in the court of public opinion.  mRNA technology is now out there and while Moderna has a temporary marketing advantage, in the long run the question is whether they have any technologic differentiation to sustain them.

Moderna accepted the help, and no doubt, money from the government.  It must acknowledge the taxpayers' and scientists' roles in the outcome."
2021-11-09 20:49,"The US government can file a separate patent with those inventors and inventions listed that it has inventor transfer agreements: employees and contractors.

In actuality, the US Government paid for almost all of the innovative research and development.  However, it usually does not require patent rights from employees of the organizations it had granted the funds.  This is offensive in pharmacology because a patent gives a right to monopolize to a company that actually did not even contribute any funding to the scientific research and such monopolies lead to deaths and untreated diseases.

If the US does have valid inventors who have or will assigned their invention rights to the government then it can use this separate patent for royalties to, at least, get its investment back."
2021-11-09 20:55,"American higher education and research system is broken since long. It's high time that US tax payers get their due when they fund more than 90 percent of R&D spending by US universities and other research organizations/companies and get almost nothing in return (general public do not care about publications.)  Grant review never held the professors and researchers accountable for not fulfilling their research objectives in terms of developing drugs, treatments, and promised technology that work in real world. American tax payers have legitimate right to take its stare when some grants do produce effective products/technology and generate revenue."
2021-11-09 21:02,"As a former technology transfer person this is a hot mess. If people who were not inventors for the patent  are listed on the patent OR if actual inventors for the patent are not listed on the patent application, either situation could invalidate the patent.

Moderna does not have the right to determine who the inventors are for this technology. The NIH better lawyer up with a bevy of highly specialized patent attorneys to address this. The problem is at this point, if the NIH scientists are inventors AND not listed the patent application can not be changed so financial incentives that would benefit the NIH equivalent to the NIH's scientists contribution to the patent would have to be agreed to.

Sadly, this is not a rarity. I was involved with a similar case for one of the professors at university where I worked and eventually an agreement was created that the university and its professor received financial compensation for the professor not being listed as an inventor on the company's patent."

Part of the reason the USA developed three effective vaccines (as opposed to, say, zero in almost all other countries) is because our system allows corporations to benefit from their risks. This is true of many of the life-changing drugs created in the USA.

Putting aside the overlaying controversy over whether Dr Gallo's Lab at NIAID had actually cultured the virus out of samples given them by the Pasteur Institute, that conflict had a relatively easy solution- the relevant patents and all their profits are vested in a non-profit foundation that splits the many millions of proceeds between the US and FRANCE."

If they didn’t need the government’s help to get the vaccine technology up and running as quickly as they did, they shouldn’t have taken government funding (read taxpayer dollars). 

Our tax dollars shouldn’t subsidize the Moderna investors. 

This was a joint venture. The profits should be sufficient to float both boats."

2021-11-09 20:12,Gimme a break ... Moderna got $10 billion in public funding.    But somehow critical patents are theirs -- and only theirs.    Could there be any more blatant exercise in socializing risk and privatizing profit?
2021-11-09 20:17,"While you are all focused on the correct assumption that if N.I.H. scientists collaborated, even forwarding vital data, another fact is that the Government effectively employed Moderna with 1.4 Billion Dollars to perform the service of developing the vaccine. That second point should be respected as giving license to the government to share the technology they helped pay for.

For years I've opined that Boston Business Schools and others are producing truly ruthless business people that are in command of our nation. What do schools teach of ethics, if not morality or do those fail to comply with the greedy profit goals of business?

After reading this, I find Moderna to be particularly greedy and ruthless, and the company is new and this is no way to build a reputation as a means of profit. I have written before that my opinion of big Pharma is one of ""Your Money Or Your Life"". I'm certain the scientists are likely humble beings in awe of this and it's the business leaders with a profit ethos, if you can call it that, that are silencing everyone."
2021-11-09 20:24,"I'm confused.

Unlike every other industrialized nation, our politicians consistently refuse to allow our government to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceuticals in order to benefit the public. Now, they're saying that allowing Big Pharma to make as much money as possible is somehow a bad thing?

So, what changed between last week and this week?

Or is it that pandemic vaccines are somehow 'different' than other drugs required to keep people alive, because their use has much broader political implications as opposed to just health related ones?

I suspect that Washington has been playing both sides of this for so long that they no longer know where they stand.

On the one hand, during the election cycle, they say, ""Sure, we want people to have access to affordable health care!"", only to turn around and hold out their other hand for massive kickbacks in order to prevent it from happening once the election is over.

Here's my question: why didn't they allow 'the market' to determine the price of the vaccine shots the way they do with every other drug? And I think the answer is obvious. It was to save their own political skins. And more importantly an economy which keeps them all fabulously wealthy.

The fact is, healthcare shouldn't be left to market forces. But our politicians are getting so rich off of keeping it that way that they've allowed our citizens to die in order to keep the gravy train running.

And now, with the pandemic, they have to pretend they cared all along."
2021-11-09 20:44,"Govt should fight tooth-n-nail, all the way to the supreme court over this issue. For far too long public investments have been treated as backdoor for private gains.

All of the basic technologies in all sciences have been developed upon funding by government. mRNA based vaccine delivery is no different.

I would love to see this debate get some public attention including the supreme court."
2021-11-09 20:57,"Two things: if the NIH scientists were indeed inventors and not named in the application, the patent is invalid. A court will determine this.

Second, the ""recipe"" is included in the patent. That is a requirement of a legal patent."
2021-11-09 20:04,With this much money even possibly at stake--a final decision will probably be decided  in the courts--  years from now.
2021-11-09 20:15,"Patent inventorship and ownership are two different things.  Inventorship depends on who actually invented the subject matter encompassed by the patent claims, and is determined as a factual matter, not contractual agreement. Ownership, however, can be assigned (or partially assigned) by contract.  If the government gave major funding to Moderna for the vaccine project, didn’t they reserve ownership rights by contract?  If not, why not?"
2021-11-09 20:16,Since Moderna said they are not enforcing patent rights and if indeed these 3 scientists developed this technology why can't they show other companies how to make this vaccine?
2021-11-09 20:03,"Wow. Nearly $10 billion in taxpayer funding and Moderna wants all the profit and proprietary rights for itself. Not a good image for the company.

Pfizer also opposed contract provisions for sharing its technology, but at least they have stepped up to a moral position allowing low cost production and distribution in poor countries. 

Why don't taxpayers get contractual protection for credit, patents, and use of products when we negotiate these deals? Are these additional Trump-the-dealmaker legacies? Is this the way military/private sector weapons and supply contracts are arranged?"
2021-11-09 20:21,"Big Pharma spends 14 percent of total revenues on research and development, yes 14 percent, look it up, google it.Big Pharma spends more than two billion a year on lobbying on every year, and many millions on marketing ie tv ads etc."
2021-11-09 20:58,"While you are all debating whether a patent application should include those who also helped the inventing process, the fact remains, the Federal Government employed Moderna with 1.4 Billion dollars expressly to invent the vaccine, therefore, the government is part owner and can license the idea elsewhere as they please.

But conversely, like all other typical federal power grabs, it appears this is a test case to win more power for the government. It's the slippery slope to Communism when the government owns businesses."
2021-11-09 20:00,"“The U.S. made a deal that was extraordinarily beneficial to Moderna and also beneficial to the United States,"" said Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University who has advised the World Health Organization and other international organizations on the Covid-19 response. ""But it negotiated a horrific deal for the world that in fact impeded the world’s ability to respond and end the pandemic.” ~Politico

Another GIANT mistake made by the short sighted Trump admin."
2021-11-09 20:00,Wait?! Big pharma only holds the interests of itself and the investor class??!
2021-11-09 20:07,"Moderna was a small company that the US help fund to the covid vaccine. The company officers have made billions, yet this isn't enough.

The question is simple which is more important?
 Greed or the public health of the world.

Which is the true American way? We shall see"
2021-11-09 20:15,"Oh gods, more of this (where ""This"" is both patent silliness and companies taking credit for inventions by others who did the dirty work and make the mistake of even TALKING to said companies)?

First of all, how disappointing from the company that made the shot I got; second of all, the NIH put OUR tax money into the vaccine, so it ought to get at LEAST a share of the credit.

But it's clear the very concept of the patent is irreparably broken.  Even if it weren't CREATED to deliberately hinder the desire to invent and innovate it claims to advance, that's exactly what it does—programmers fear infringing a patent and so wait until it expires or just leave the field; non-lethal energy inventions get bought out and snuffed by fossil-burner megacorps with an interest in continuing their dinosaur business model; inventors are de facto forced to ""assign"" their inventions to employers, who get all sorts of control[1] over them; ""intellectual property""-ists conflate and combine the patent with copyright and other powers to use as a bludgeon that takes MASSIVE legal fees to attempt to fight,[2] even against a vague threat with no ""there"" there.

It's either evil, or captured by evil interests, and the sole meaningful remedy is to just put it, and us, out of its misery.

END THE PATENT.  NOW.

2021-11-09 19:54,As usual in our country it all boils down to money and in the case of healthcare it will be in the billions.
2021-11-09 19:58,So in less than two years Moderna transforms itself from government beneficiary to big pharma monopolist? Seems outrageous to me. I'm sure they are already making big campaign donations in order to increase their chances of getting away with fleecing the chumps (ie. taxpayers).
2021-11-09 20:11,"I got Moderna shots in Jan/Feb and a booster a couple of weeks ago a day after it was authorized.

To whomever invented what:

My profound thanks for me and my family and for humanity.

But that being said,  I’m going with Fauci as to who did what to the spikey proteins in the virus.

And it’s a really bad pr look for Moderna to drag its feet on world wide distribution. 

Execs there on the launch of Moderna will be rich beyond their wildest dreams even if they show beneficence to the desperately poor."
2021-11-09 20:13,"Maybe they could've done it alone, but I can't imagine that Moderna would've been able to bring this to market so quickly without the financial and technical support of the federal government."
2021-11-09 21:00,"Is it any wonder why more Americans despise ""Big Pharma""? Greed during a pandemic, greed in general. Moderna would be nothing today had it not been involved in the development of this vaccine. 

We...the taxpayers, US Government entity, contributed to their success. Their request for a patent should be immediately squashed."
2021-11-09 19:58,"In our zeal to kill the golden goose, let's remember that the US - and not any other country with publicly funded healthcare, a social democratic government, etc - developed this.

2021-11-09 20:15,"Hubris and greed on Moderna's part. A new company with so much promise and so much public goodwill and they went straight for the worst PR they could have given themselves in validating every argument against empowering Big Pharma. 

Maybe Dolly Parton could shame them into honoring the Federal employees who helped their vaccine succeed."
2021-11-09 19:53,Wish I had known about this before receiving the Moderna vaccine.  I would have chosen another manufacturer who wasn't seeking to deny a share of profits to the government and its citizens which made it possible.
2021-11-09 20:07,"You take money from the government to develop the vaccine, the parent is the government’s, that is, the taxpayers, that is us the people.
 
End of story."
2021-11-09 20:13,"I am worried if Moderna loses, the U.S. government will turn the manufacture over to China and India and we will lose any control over how the vaccine is produced and any related profits. This seems like a battle started by the progressive Democrats to further their agenda of giving everything something for nothing. There are plenty of less inexpensive drugs like Astra and Johnson to compete with Sputnik and whatever the Chinese are producing."
2021-11-09 20:15,"But isn't this the way it works in this country? A company markets a drug developed under the auspices of the NIH or some other taxpayer-funded agency, and then gets to sell it at sell it at whatever rapacious price the market can bear, reimbursed by that same government? It's not just like being robbed, it's like actually paying someone to rob you."
2021-11-09 20:55,Do like China share the technology with labs in other countries to help mass produce the vaccines and make it available to all in the world as fast as possible.
2021-11-09 20:50,"If NIH has a claim that two of its scientists were co-inventors, it should absolutely assert its claim to the fullest extent of the law and use the full weight of the US Gov to do it. Moreover, since public messaging is a important part of litigation, the US Gov should absolutely point it out if Moderna is failing to live up to its civic duties. To say , as some commenters do, that there is no role for civic duty in this dispute are being myopic. Of course Moderna's failure to act with public spirit matters. Why should we give major for-profit corporations a pass when they act the way Moderna has? 

As for commenters who knee-jerk assume Moderna is right. Why? Moderna is acting like every other politically powerful corporation: Take anything it can whenever it can from the public fisc, and resist giving anything back at every turn. If questioned, rely on narrow legal argument. When all else fails, unleash the Trumpists and threaten to take down the whole system.

The Biden Administration shouldn't be required to fight with one hand tied behind its back."
2021-11-09 20:26,"How disappointing but not surprising. I know one hopes these corporations do the right thing for humanity’s sake, but they’re legally required to make the most profit…

No wonder Americans generally hold a very negative view of pharmaceutical companies because they squander the good publicity they’ve built on making sure their shareholders squeeze every dime."
2021-11-09 20:18,"Had the NIH not invested $10B in Moderna's efforts, would Moderna's scientists have expended their efforts in this vaccine initiative, or would they have been working on other projects instead? Methinks the latter... because everyone knows that in science, unfunded work is work that doesn't happen.

So even if Moderna could rightly claim having performed 100% of the scientific work that led to this innovation, their financial backers have a legitimate claim to share in the patent. Had Moderna been funded by a private entity rather than a government agency, wouldn't they be sharing the patent with THOSE backers?

Moderna is having a banner year, with next year looking equally profitable. Their ingratitude -- esp. at the expense at the American taxpayer -- is unseemly. Glad I had three doses of Pfizer, which has been more generous than Moderna about global distribution of its product even though it funded its product with no government contribution."
2021-11-09 19:55,I'm old enough to remember making money wasn't the point.
2021-11-09 20:03,"The fact that Moderna applied for a patent before consulting with their NIH colleagues says it all. Obviously, money before fairness.

Since Moderna is only willing to share it's life-saving vaccine technology ""in the post pandemic period"", it is time for President Biden to call it's billionaire CEO, Stéphane Bancel, and threaten to nationalize Moderna until the pandemic is over.

(The best we have gotten from Moderna CEO Bancel so far, is “it is sad”)

The moral weight of the White House, Congress and the whole World needs to rain down on Moderna until they change course.

Why? Because a few thousand deaths won't seriously affect the economy, but a million will, and these people run their elections in large part on the strength of the economy. Not to mention the value of their individual stock portfolios.

So, why negotiate and/or make the coronavirus vaccine a public property, but not others? That's easy. The others don't affect their chances of re-election.

2021-11-09 21:13,"Kudos to the NY Times, to Sheryl, Rebecca and Kitty.  This covers a *very* complex topic with an extraordinary panache, accuracy and nuance.   It is a huge achievement to educate a non-professional in patent practice in the challenges, options, remedies and implications.  For a piece of this length, you've hit it out of the ball park.  Well done.  If there is a follow up (which I keenly hope), you may want to focus on improvements to the system that could greatly improve the public outcomes from patenting, through  statutory increased transparency (e.g.) of recordation of ownership, and of licensing and licensees of publicly funded work.  

 Educating the public (and indeed policy makers and business people who are not patent professionals) about the enormous potential for 'teaching' the practice of patent-disclosed inventions outside the scope of the very limited monopoly rights, is one of the other great impacts your journalism could assist with.   Where and when a patent is not in force (and most are filed in only a handful of countries, so enforceable only in those) and under the scope of the claims (if well examined these can often be much less than the broad claims often filed by counsel), can be recipes for legal and ethical business. The bargain that my eponymous  founder of the US Patent system required was open, enabling teaching the public how to make and use the patented invention in exchange for limited (in time, scope and jursidiction) rights to exclude."
2021-11-09 21:40,When the US govt lends money or subsidizes research for medical research the agreement to do so should automatically include a clause giving the govt a financial interest in whatever is developed from the research it financed or helped develope. Universities also should require that they participate financially from any product developed in their labs.
2021-11-09 21:43,"Moderna, a private company, was given millions in public $ to capture private profits. This is nothing new. Much of the pharmaceutical industries profits post ww2 have been achieved with the discoveries made by at NIH and is a result  of grants made by N.I.H. to public and private colleges and universities. Our government has too often been remiss in in providing some of the financial windfall from these discoveries to improvements in public health and to the reduction of drug costs and medical procedures. No wonder that there is a serious disconnect between public health here and the profitability of a mostly private health care system. The Biden administration has an opportunity to redress these imbalances, starting with the Moderna vaccine."
2021-11-09 21:14,"Moderna may be the most effective vaccine based on stringer dosing, but it’s also turning out to be another greedy reflection of USA capitalism run amuck. Taxpayers deserve more when we help to fund these companies.

2021-11-09 21:10,"Of course, Big Pharma has a long track record of using taxpayer-funded research to springboard its products to market, all too often for its exclusive profit. This parasitic paradigm is not right and it has to stop, especially given the relatively low taxes the industry pays."
2021-11-09 21:12,Moderna is being disingenuous and uncharitable AND downright greedy.  Sounds to me like they don't believe they will ever be able to invent another successful product.  My first instinct was to side with Moderna but the more you read the less good it looks for them.  And people please stop obsessing over crediting the correct inventors.  Rosalind Franklin discovered DNA almost singlehandedly and she barely gets a mention in the history books.  Moderna got $10 billion to do their thing.  It don't matter if all the NIH did was stir the sauce into the pasta one day.  That's enough.
2021-11-09 21:38,"Seems Moderna wants their cake and eat it too. I have issues as to whether or not Moderna would've even had the financial resources to develop the vaccine absent the billions in taxpayer dollars. 

And if the government played a significant role in developing the vaccine, then by all means the government should have say in the licensing and any revenue that is a result of the vaccine and the patents. 

We've (the taxpayer) has been handing pharmaceutical companies the rights to sell drugs that the taxpayer funded the development of for decades. In fact over the last decade some 200 new drugs were funded by taxpayers.

Once again taxpayer dollars were funneled to Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, and once again they want to take that drug and essentially control it, eventhough they risked nothing. Remember Moderna doesn't have one product other than their Covid Vaccine. 

Frankly I'm all for the government going to court to protect their right to be named on the patent as one of the developers of the vaccine. Moderna's interests are purely how much can we gouge the U.S. Government for each shot. Because in countries where they have single payor healthcare the per-shot price will be negotiated far below what patients in the U.S. pay. 

And that amount wont change whether your health insurance pays for it, like the flu shot, or whether the government pays."
2021-11-09 21:40,Private corporations with armies of lawyers and lobbyists need to stopped from fleecing and extorting from US tax-payers after tens of billions of public financing. Moderna's claims need to be challenged vigorously!
2021-11-09 21:14,"Yes and the US government serves as a charity for other industries as well. The US govt builds roads into national forests and since the law allows that loggers must be profitable, the US govt might have to charge the loggers nothing for the expensive roads. That means that the logging companies get taxpayer welfare money to exist, while the cut down forest no longer take up atmospheric carbon to stabilize our climate. Pretty pathetic that the US cannot come up with viable jobs without the taxpayers paying welfare for them. These NIH giveaways are just part of the same thing of the taxpayer helping otherwise lame American industries to be profitable. Nothing new here, move along."
2021-11-09 21:16,"I am confident that self interest played no role in Moderna's ""good faith"" decision that it owns the vaccine and that no government scientists helped develop it. 

Of course, I also believe in the tooth fairy and Santa Claus.

Or not."
2021-11-09 21:25,"I blame the lawyers for the government who oversaw these deals between NIH and Moderna. Who gives one party billions of dollars of taxpayer money with no strings attached? Such as the very things they are arguing about now; which have tremendous consequences for millions of people. Lives are at stake; this is not about manufacturing the best golf club! It seems we go down this misbegotten path time and again. We bailed out the airlines recently with no strings attached for protecting the consumers from usurious fees and smaller seats; we poured billions into Afghanistan without rooting out the corruption that led to the failure of the Afghan government to garner the support from its citizens and ultimately the Taliban takeover. I could go on and on.  In the case of Moderna, where were the minds of those writing up these agreements? Here’s our money…..now here’s what we expect down the road…..all written out in clear language. Anyone would fire a lawyer who didn’t act with due diligence in creating a contract. Moderna knows what they need to do……the right thing. Perhaps public pressure can achieve what high paid legal minds failed to do; it’s not rocket science. But these three scientists are brilliant and deserve the credit; and the resulting ability for our government to make sure this vaccine can go where it needs to go, in the volume needed, to make a difference around the world. We all benefit when the world is healthier."
2021-11-09 21:30,"Not to be cynical, but let’s just call this what it is: Greed. Maderna gets offered billions of dollars to develop a vaccine from NIH and taxpayers. It benefited from the four-year research deal with NIH scientists and perhaps others. Now that they’ve made their mark, the story slowly changes….

Now it all belongs to them, it’s their golden egg. It’s typical chicanery that many large pharmaceutical companies get away with far too often. It also brings out the worst in what the USA is supposed to stand for.

We have a good system of collaboration and development but our capitalistic dreams always get the best of us. In the end it’s those least able to afford a loss - in this case poorer and underdeveloped nations - who wind up paying the ultimate price. 

Of course our sense of moral duty in this country is also slipping away as well (in a geopolitical sense) and has been declining for awhile now.

Thus, we have the age-old contradiction: our lives are with more than money they say - just not for everyone."
2021-11-09 21:16,"Sounds like Moderna wants the usual benefit: private profit, public risk. These drug companies are completely unneeded in the first place. We need vaccines that are 100 percent government created, sold at cost. We can do that easily. The only reason we don't is that too many people want a chance to dip their hands into the profit stream, and not enough people actually care about saving lives."
2021-11-09 21:23,"Billions of dollars in future profits. 
Hmm. If memory serves didn’t we the taxpayer pay for the R&D for one or two of these vaccines, and if so, I would say we the people own those patents."
2021-11-09 21:23,"As other commenters have stated, this is a beautiful example of corporate welfare -- externalize the costs of R&D and internalize the profits. The NIH absolutely should take Moderna to court. In fact, since 5 million lives have been lost and there is no end in sight, the government should confiscate the technology and construct production facilities all over the world. Profit for one company should not have precedence over millions of lives. That is the height of immoral predatory capitalism."
2021-11-09 21:24,Look into those perfectly timed press releases occurring the day before a scheduled stock sale by company execs.
2021-11-09 21:47,"The discovery of how to use messenger RNA to make COVID vaccines is shared by at least two companies:  Moderna and BioNTech.  The BioNTech vaccine was marketed in conjunction with Pfizer.

This represents a significant advance in vaccine technology.  The technology not only provides COVID vaccines for the here and now, but also a mechanism to provide rapid development of new vaccines in the futures for variants of COVID and new diseases not yet even identified.  BioNTech lists ongoing clinical trials for COVID and flu and pre-clinical work on Malaria, HIV and tuberculosis.

According to this article,

""[Moderna] seeks to patent the genetic sequence that instructs the body’s cells to make a harmless version of the spike proteins that stud the surface of the coronavirus....""

Is that really true?  COVID comes in variants and each variant has its own genetic sequence.

There is a complicated network of biotech companies that support the new mRNA technology, including companies like Oxford Nanopore in the UK that track changes in the generic sequences between different variants.

And to the question of distributing the latest technology to the third world, consider the following:

The US government considers the old technology of J&J vaccines to be perfectly fine for Americans.  Why do third world countries deserve something better?

The mRNA vaccines mostly likely saved hundreds of thousands of lives in the US and elsewhere.

Why penalize the inventors of the new technology?"
2021-11-09 21:50,"Great reporting. I’m looking forward to the follow up.
It’s unlikely the Moderna scientists shared their technology with the NIH without having established ownership. Small laboratories are careful to hold onto their intellectual property. It’s an essential aspect of delivering product to their investors.
When a small company is ready to ‘scale’ the trials up to humans, they need a bigger partner. In this case, Moderna chose the NIH as its partner. 
While I’m certain NIH scientists worked in tandem with Moderna scientists to tweak the technology during the human trials, they are probably not the inventors of that key technology."
2021-11-09 21:37,What a disgraceful greedy leadership obviously exists at Moderna.  Get to court if you have to stop this greedy grab for even more money.
2021-11-09 22:10,"Determining who are the rightful inventors is a legal/scientific process. The decision around who they are is not Moderna's alone. If Moderna insists on excluding rightful NIH inventors from the patent application, and the Patent and Trademark Office agrees, the application can be denied, or if the patent has already issued it can be ruled invalid. In the U.S., corporations are given enormous power over who profits from intellectual property - inventions - that result from  foundational research funded by the public, which is most basic research. Usually the imbalance is kept under the radar of the public and rarely challenged either by our elected representatives or the corporate media. A glaring contrast may be found in Cuba, for example, where 5 vaccines were developed and produced by Cuban researchers in institutes with neither the demand for enormous profits by private corporations nor billions paid to CEOs. Two of them have moved forward to successfully vaccinate Cuba's entire population. It's a different road for us to drive, but we don't need the Pfizers or Modernas to ensure a healthy population."
2021-11-09 22:10,Hard to know the actual contribution of public and private minds and funds. I developed software that now makes close to 7 figures yearly. I used trust fund money and off campus offices and privately owned equipment to for all development. The University still tried to claim a 75% ownership. I documented and they gave up. If they had made my time and life easier for development work I would have been happy to share but they contributed nothing but threats from their lawyers. If someone gave me 10 billion dollars to my work I'd think they owned something.
2021-11-09 22:29,"Readers who dismiss the NIH claim to some ownership of the Moderna COVID19 vaccine miss an important distinction. NIH grants to investigators to pursue their pre-existing ideas carry no ownership claim, if that research produces a breakthrough or a product. 

But in the Moderna dispute, three NIH scientists (Drs. Mascola, Graham and Corbett) at the Vaccine Research Center, collaborating with Moderna for several years before the Wuhan event on developing mRNA vaccines against several pathogenic coronaviruses, provided vaccine design insight and expertise. Specifically, a key modification to stiffen the coronavirus glycoprotein spike so it’s more effective at inducing a high proportion of antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus and preventing infection, came from a previous patent awarded to Barney Graham for his prior work on another coronavirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus. According to the article, Pfizer and other companies accessed that patent and modified the spike sequence in their vaccine design, but I was disappointed to learn that Moderna is attempting to deny the impact of NIH patent on its utilization of the same modification.

The SARS-2 glycoprotein sequence provided by the Chinese was the essential first step in creating a vaccine, but the stiffening mutation used by both Pfizer and Moderna are likely responsible for the fact that these two vaccines are still remarkably effective against the delta variant."

2021-11-09 22:03,"So to summarize. The R&D costs for the covid vaccine have been   borne by the taxpayers,  Yet Moderna brazenly insists that all resulting intellectual property belongs to itself, so that it can earn obscene profits.

Pasteur and Fleming probably saved the humanity and our planet as we know it.  How much did they make for their unbelievable deeds?  

Taxpayers funded research is the people's.  You award Nobel prizes or their equivalents is enough honor to last several lifetimes.  

In our capitalistic societies, reward means billions or even more.  

My favorite mathematician of all times is Grigory Perelman.
He refused the Fields Medal and the Clay award of 1 Million Dollars that was his to take for proving Poincaré's conjecture.

For the last 20 years or so, public organizations have been very good at identifying/enforcing their rights.  Sadly, the only way to resolve this conflict will be once Moderna tries to file patents for the technology, is to engage in litigation, which is definitely not a great experience for anyone.  Prior art will also be very important in determining the scope of rights of Moderna vs the NIH, so Pfizer may also become involved in the battle."

That technology holds the promise for many other drugs and anti-cancer treatments.  Moderna has ""in the pipeline"" a number of new innovative drugs that will likely revolutionize the treatment of many diseases.

When the COVID-19 virus came along, Moderna was able to shift gears and devote much of its efforts to the development of a new type of vaccine.  Consequently, Moderna has saved many thousands of lives.  In the future it will save more lives that would otherwise be lost to other terrible diseases.

We must recognize an article's tone, and wonder whether it is a hit piece.  In this instance, given the many errors made by government agencies in connection with the COVID-19 epidemic, we should be very careful before attacking the people at a company like Moderna, who quietly worked for years without making much money, and who, by hard work and sheer happenstance, became the right people at the right time to successfully fight a deadly virus.

2021-11-10 2:21,"There is major confusion between foundations and applications when asking Moderna to pay for fundamental research.

One has to distinguish fundamental research and applied research. Major countries fund fundamental research, precisely because it is not profitable. By definition of ""fundamental"", that research is NOT for profit. A profit motive would mean, by definition, a shorter vision, thus defeating the search for foundations. 

Aerospace companies in the US (and overseas) profited from NASA research. None paid back NASA. Institutions similar to NASA, or NIH, or NSF, NCAR, USGS, DOE, DARPA, DOD, HHS and their foreign peers have to depend upon government funding to guarantee their will to foundational research. French government financed scientists discovered optical pumping (lasers!) and mRNA. There was no pay-back.

To insist on a payback for fundamental research is to guarantee a switch from foundational research to for-profit research, something which defeats the mission.

The most expensive government research adventure is ITER, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, financed by 35 governments (including US, EU, China). No pay back required in cash: the discovery itself is the compensation. Europe's CERN, a fundamental physics organization has 39 participants (including Russia and the US).

Moderna is running the risk of having their patent invalidated if they exclude true inventors and their technology may then enter the public domain.  That could be a bummer for them.
If NIH collaborators truly did not contribute to the patentalble aspects of the technology then Moderna is not only within its rights to exclude them from being named inventors but should not do so.

The priest said don't worry get on the boat and once we are on the boat, you can pay me. Half way to the other side the priest names his price and it is ridiculously high. My father had 2 options either pay the priest the amount he was asking for or jump off the boat into the fast flowing Ganges and hope to survive swimming across. Instead of submitting to the extortion my father said why did you refuse to answer my question as to what the cost will be to be ferried across. The priest realized that he met his match and agreed to accept 10% of the asking price because he figured the last name Kotwal, referred to a police chief of a village police station.

2021-11-10 5:34,"I think this article, and the scientist giving their two cents, reveal a lack of understanding of US patent law. The US is pretty unique in the world in requiring that the inventors be listed and provide an oath. But this matters little from a practical aspect, because except for mostly individual inventors, all employees at these companies (and even universities) are obligated by contract to assign their inventions to their employers. 

If you go to any US patent by a large company, then you will see the assignee listed. And it is the assignee who owns the resulting patent, not the inventors.

In this particular case, whatever agreement the Government and Moderna had most certainly included clauses regarding intellectual property resulting from the agreement, and the property of the patents will depend on those clauses, not on whether government employees are or not listed in the patent. Further there are laws regarding intellectual property when it comes from government investment. 

Further, Moderna's legal counsel is correct. If the claims of those patents define an invention in which those government employees took no part, whatever their other contributions to the vaccine, it would be against the law to list them as inventors. Conversely, not listing them if they did have a meaningful contribution is also illegal."

After all, We The People are paying for the government scientists who worked on the vaccine.  Moderna had the benefit of those funds which derived from tax revenues of We The People."

Hopefully it will result in a little wider taxpayer awareness of the extent to which ‘private’ corporate inventions have actually been funded by their tax dollars.  And how the process of ‘collaboration’ between public and private institutions is usually just a hidden form of massive subsidies to certain industries.

The pharmaceutical industry in particular has been the beneficiary of countless billions of dollars of federal grant funding to its ‘research partners’ at universities over the years.
The scientists at those universities perform early stage research for the industry, funded by taxpayer grants. And in the event of a breakthrough of practical relevance they are usually able to take the invention into private personal ownership because most universities allow (or even facilitate) faculty to retain at least partial or majority ownership of patentable IP.

Taxpayers have been getting nothing back from their vast investment in research for decades, and it is about time there was a clear (partial) public ownership policy in place for all publicly funded or supported work."

2021-11-10 10:04,"As the patent lawyers here have mentioned, there are specific rules for determining who is an inventor. You don’t include names gratuitously as you would a scientific paper. In fact, incorrectly naming inventors (either by exclusion OR inclusion) is potential grounds for invalidation of the patent. 

I am sure there are many patents around the Moderna vaccine. I’m guessing based on what’s hinted at in the article, this patent deals with the sequence of the mRNA or the composition of the vaccine. From the publications of Graham and Corbett, they did not contribute to this. They did the work on the effectiveness of the vaccine. But that is not the patent, not what is being sold. It is the composition of the vaccine itself. 

Let me give a more relatable analogy. Moderna scientists were the lyricists and composer of the work. The NIH were the arrangers and musicians of the work. Yes, they helped give the music life and a particular sound, but in the music world they don’t get royalties.  The composers/lyricists do."
2021-11-10 10:12,"It is truly unfortunate that the grant contract to Moderna, worth billions, was not written by someone with a little savvy.

The original grant should have included legal language that gauranteed government employees, who participated in inception, would be on all patents.   

Then, the very first dollar that Moderna collected would have resulted in a legal right for the named co-inventors at NIH to be on the patent.

This is what happens when government lawyers don't do their jobs.

Also, the scientists involved in approving the grant should have written into the grant approval a legal right to be on patents that resulted from the grant.

Inventorship of a patent has nothing to do with fairness and morality. These three government scientists either materially contributed to one or more claims of the patent or not. If yes then Moderna has to include them by law. If not they have no right to become named co-inventors. Just by advising and/or helping Modrena doing the work does not entitle them to become named co-inventors. Patent law is very clear on this."

2021-11-10 12:23,"For me, this boils down to one quick question - was Moderna EMPLOYED by the NIH to work collaboratively on a way to handle covid19 pandemic. 
It seems that the company was COMMISSIONED to focus on a coronavirus vaccined19, and two grants for $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion respectively were the fee which made this possible.

As a follow-on from the above, Moderna was also CONTRACTED by the Govt to deliver doses of the successful Vax result, and was then paid another $8 billion or so for doing so. The vaccine never ""went to market"" in any general sense.

It seems to me that if a University can claim ownership of patents generated by ""employees"" or contractors working for that entity, the parallel points to a whole new way for defining legalities in regard to the role of taxpayer funding - ie Govt as employer - ie commissioning agent and financial facilitator, with ""inherent source"" ownership of patent rights."
2021-11-10 12:27,"Skimming through the comments indicates a fundamental ignorance by commentators of the relevant law. 

1) Patent inventorship is determined solely by the intellectual contribution to what a patent application is *claiming* and not merely what is *disclosed* (two technical terms that must be understood to comment intelligently on the subject). Intellectual contributions to what makes the particular *claimed* invention novel and nonobvious over the prior art are what determine inventorship. Sources of funding are irrelevant.

2) The Bayh-Dole Act (<a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayh"" target=""_blank"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayh</a>–Dole_Act) addresses government rights in inventions developed with government funding, as do provisions in any agreement between the government and the grantee."

I can't understand the attempts to vilify them when it sounds like to me they have adhered to their contracts and done the best they could to produce and deliver vaccines in accordance with the signed contracts.

How can we trust a federal agency like NIH to oversee vaccine safety when its employees have a financial interstate's in the product?

Similar issues abound at the CDC where top scientists and administrators routinely review the work of pharmaceutical companies and then go and work for them.

The FDA is supposed to provide a safeguard against these obvious conflicts of interest by appointing independent safety panels to review the agency's data.

There's only one problem. The FDA didn't appoint those panels for any reviews either for the EAU submission or the application for full certification by Pfizer.

Those regulations depend on strict criteria about actual inventorship, which is a lot different from just having been involved in the work or having funded the work. The whole patent can be invalidated if the inventorship as stated in the application is found to be erroneous. It's not hard to see in this case how the whole thing can get pretty murky. I'm not aware of its ever having come into play, but government-funded work does give the government the right to utilize patented inventions, regardless of inventorship, in the case of situations where public health and safety are at issue.

If they continue to balk at doing so, or stop production or delivery of vaccines in protest (allowing more to die or suffer infection), they should be nationalized and their chief executives charged with a criminal conspiracy to defraud the government and criminal negligence in permitting this dispute to interfere with addressing this pandemic. Or, they should be required to repay every penny of US government support and banned from securing any future gov't funding. To wit, one should throw the book at them."
2021-11-10 19:17,"The tone of this article, and of many of the reader comments, is unfortunate. They are convicting Moderna after a kangaroo trial. Let me speak in Moderna's defense. 

I've been a patent attorney for 30 years. Not a regular patent attorney, who prosecutes patents, but an M&A attorney who helps companies with their international patent strategy. Thus, while I don't know Moderna's particulars, I can make an educated guess. 

My guess is that Moderna is in the right here. The Biden administration is trying to get around an agreement negotiated by the Trump administration. Moderna developed a product, while the NIH did science. 

The Moderna patent application covers Moderna's product. If the government were to be a joint owner of the patent, it could license the world to produce Moderna's product. (And that's what the government seems to want to do.) That would be a killer blow to Moderna. 

That's a simplistic explanation of a complex issue, but I think it is more fair than what those condemning Moderna are saying. Moderna is a young upstart fighting for a place against big, powerful giants. We should welcome the competition they bring to an industry that has big barriers to entry. 

Get the Moderna vaccine. Support a company that still has a tough road to travel as it tries to build a broader portfolio of products that will help us all."

By comparison other vaccines with much more limited benefit (Pneumovax, Prevnar, Shingrix) are considerably more expensive (some 10X!).  In addition, billions of dollars invested in other vaccine and therapy companies produced little to nothing.

Parents decide to let their child own a motor scooter or a gun or or they decide its ￼okay to allow their daughter or son to attend a party.  Bad things happen sometimes.  Why would you not consult your private doctor about allowing a vaccination and trust that is the best option?  Did you stop and think  that by refusing the shot, that's a decision, too, which might have horrific consequences?  Can you live with that if your child gets COVID and develops a life-long health issue or even dies?  Which is the greater risk?  I remember my sister telling me once that the day your child is born and you hold him or her in your arms, you realize that you are more vulnerable than you have ever been and you have to accept that will be the case from now on. I pray all parents consider all angles and make the best decision."

Barring a medical waiver from a board-certified medical doctor, parents should have no choice on whether or not their child is vaccinated against Covid and all other vital vaccinations such as the one for measles."
2021-10-30 16:26,"My kids are getting vaccinated ASAP. I’ve seen kids in the ICU. It isn’t pretty.

Our kids have to wear seatbelts. They have to bike with helmets. They wear life vests when we go kayaking and they wear masks at school. By amazing coincidence they’re also healthy and well adjusted and have vastly better coping skills than the anti-vax parents my kids think are from another planet."
2021-10-30 16:26,"I don't have much hope that we will get out from under this Covid threat for a long time. With so many people not getting vaccinated, regardless of age, and so many people not vaccinated around the world, will more variants arise, perhaps worse/more contagious/more potent than Delta? We have a long ways to go I fear."
2021-10-30 15:59,"To Ms. Gauch and other reluctant parents: note that you are focusing exclusively on one side of the equation, which is the risk -- scientifically shown to be extremely small -- that your child will have a severe adverse reaction to the vaccination. You neglect the other side of the equation, the known and much higher risk of your child becoming ill, possibly moderately, but also possibly more severely, from COVID. You can rest assured that by choosing to vaccinate, you are doing the best thing for your child."
2021-10-30 16:08,I’m experiencing a very different reality than what this article describes. Vaccine appointments for 5-11 opened up yesterday in our school district to pre-book spots. All were taken in the first 15 min. More were released in the afternoon and all were taken as well. Most parents are chomping at the bit. Of course there are kids who come from families who are hesitant or anti-vaxxers and agree with what was said in the article— those kids will not be invited to play dates.
2021-10-30 16:08,I'm comfortable with giving them apple pie.  It's proven safe.  But I have my doubts about cherry pie. Have we really examined the possible complications for the long term?
2021-10-30 16:16,"Look at what is taking place in Russia, which has a vaccination rate of 33 percent. This is not good. Another article in these very pages says that in Russis there is a general distrust of government and of vaccines. Very instructive. 

I vaccinated my two teenage boys as soon as I could. If I had younger kids I would do the same. I respect parents' choice, and do not think it ought to be mandated, but I also would encourage all parents to vaccinate their kids."
2021-10-30 16:26,"For many parents I know, the issue isn’t reluctance. It’s that they’re not in a rush at all, knowing how low the risk is to children, and knowing that adults can now protect themselves with vaccines.

People often make comparisons between the covid and measles, mumps, and polio vaccines. But those latter illnesses were terrifying to parents, their effects severe and noticeable on children. Severe effects from covid are so rare on young kids that most parents don’t perceive it to be an emergency. That doesn’t make them anti vaccines."

From the perspective of her personal health, it's a simple equation: I don't know how it's possible to look at the data and conclude that the vaccine is more dangerous or unpredictable than a Covid infection would be. 

From the perspective of raising a child who exists as part of a society, it's simple too: she's healthy and would probably (probably!) be fine if she got Covid, but I don't know that that's true for every child in her kindergarten class. We need to raise our kids with the understanding that they should care about other people."

But if American parents are so dumb at this stage to keep kids from getting a life-saving jab to help get us out of this mess, then I hold no hope for the USA’s continuing decline into self-imposed mediocrity and failure.

But it's pretty heavy with anti-vaxxing opinion and I'm curious on how it affects the readers.  Why does the news, even the New York Times, write and print these articles that steer towards the negative.  Why can't the news present the information and data that has been diligently researched and studied by the scientists and leave it at that.  These articles do nothing more than stir up more opinions which leads us the politicizing of this vaccine.  The reason why polio and smallpox is under control, is because it was seen as a threat to all and the vaccine was administered.  It's news articles like this that bring in the questions, the hesitation, the opinions, resulting in the never-ending COVID saga.  It's exhausting."

The result is that Dr. Cobb’s and one of the twins’ health is ruined by lingering respiratory illness. As an asthmatic, I can attest that this is the kind of thing that can ruin your life. Because these cases and others like them aren’t represented in the hospitalizations and deaths statistics, we don’t know the extent to which Covid has degraded the national health. Only 700 kids have died but how many have lingering health problems? How many adults?

So I will sign up, but somewhat reluctantly.  I’m 3x vaccinated and got mine the minute it was available to me. However at that time, the vaccine had been out a few months. I wanted to vaccinate my child in time for the holidays but was hoping to wait a week or two.  I think someone like me is willing, but do we want to be first in line? Probably most of those hesitant want to wait at least a few weeks.  Our town vaccine clinic decided otherwise though. So we can be your guinea pigs."

The children who get vaccinated first will start enjoying any benefits from the vaccine sooner, and they will also serve as real-world guinea pigs to demonstrate the safety of the vaccines. As other parents start seeing that there’s nothing to be afraid of, they will increasingly feel safe vaccinating their children too."
2021-10-30 16:49,"@MPS 
Your comments are superb, but the equation you explained in excellent detail is actually incomplete. To complete the equation, all of us need to consider the risks we pose to others. That is frequently missed.

I believe it's admirable that Ms. Gauch did a very rationale risk assessment. However, one needs to consider the risks that unvaccinated people pose to others.

In all candor, I've been guilty of the same thinking. For years I declined to get a flu shot. My reasoning was that I hadn't been sick in almost 50 years--and I wasn't worried about catching the flu. I neglected to consider the risks that posed to my wife (and others). My wife has underlying health issues, so my decision was short-gighted--and wrong.

More broadly, I think the attorney general of Maine basically explained why mandates are needed. Exemptions will be made if medically warranted. Ms. Gauch is making a good faith effort to make that assessment. However, I belief that at least 95% of individuals making a risk assessment are overestimating the threat to family members and underestimating (or ignoring) the risks posed to others as well as the public at large.

Millions of people--including police officers, health care workers, and members of the military--have the right to be concerned as well as the right not to be vaccinated.

However, it all boils down to this: No jab, no job."
2021-10-30 16:50,"The article portrays this as a black and white issue. In fact, even at the public FDA meeting it was clear that the issue is not that clear cut. For young boys, the risk of side effects is larger in scenarios when overall Covid rates are relatively low. This would easily be the case if all adults would get vaccinated. Therefore we put the onus on children to protect society which should fall to the adults.
In fact, several experts on the FDA panel were reluctant to endorse a binary decision and would have rather had the option to recommend vaccination for certain groups of children. But of course these details get lost in the desire to arrive at a 'moral' obvious choice.
In any case, for a healthy child, covid is a very low risk as has been documented in this very same publication, not zero to be sure, but comparable to other every day risks. If we were concerned about health outcomes for children, the same energy could be spend on other issues with greater impact. Furthermore, as noted, the studies used to show the safety of the vaccine were rather small, I believe about 1500 kids got the vaccine. There was no severe outcome either from the vaccine or from covid in the control group. Therefore my advice would be to vaccinate children that have either commodities or are in the low side effect group (e.g. girls) but for parents of young boys it seems wise to wait a few months and see what happens to the larger test group that vaccinates their children first."
2021-10-30 16:42,"If we look at the broader arc of benefit of vaccines, if the vast majority of kids get vaccinated and through this we dramatically lower the hold COVID has on society, (socially, economically), it will directly benefit the child as well in a huge way.  The benefit is not just protection from COVID, but protection from the stress and upheaval created by COVID in our lives."
2021-10-30 16:57,"My personal polling on this is of course antidotal but I don't know of any parents who do not plan to get their kids vaccinated. I do know a lot of parents who can't wait to do so.  Somehow I don't trust the polling behind this -- what little polling there is. 

Nevertheless, what surely will happen is school districts will mandate these vaccines for children just like a slew of other vaccine mandates for children attending public schools. And we'll have another round of fighting over it in the end only to do the right thing."
2021-10-30 16:43,"Not one word about the actual statistical risks of morbidity and mortality in children, just the uninformed conclusions of random parents.  Good job, Hoffman."
2021-10-30 16:53,"Vaccine resistance has been around since Edward Jenner’s time. The claims then were the same as now: it’s my body and you can’t make me, I don’t believe the doctors, vaccination is against my religion, etc. 

I tend to think that there’s some primal instinct at work here, and that in some people, the message it sends gets magnified when other members of their tribe sound the alarm. At this point, that message has hit a resonance frequency. 

Mandates are also as old as vaccines, and they seem to be the only way to stop the resonance. People object, get angry, and protest, but in the end, the vast majority get the shot and quickly discover that they weren’t harmed. 

Objections to vaccination aren’t rational. Smallpox, diphtheria, tetanus, and Covid maim and kill. Vaccines tend to make your arm sore or make you feel kind of icky the next day. 

I understand that it’s hard to see past the fear when someone is about to stick a needle into you or your kid. When my kids were little and needed their shots, I always had a small concern that one of them might have a bad reaction to one. But I was way, way more afraid of what tetanus toxin or the measles virus would do to them. 

Not everyone has the benefit of education, psychological makeup, and/or an environment that lets them avoid the resonance frequencies of irrational vaccine fear. 

And this fact is why we need mandates. They save us from ourselves."
2021-10-30 16:56,"Once again, the Times and journalism in general, fails to do it's job.

The story is primarily about a concerted right wing propaganda campaign. Not misinformation, intentional disinformation. One can not accurately cover this story without explicitly stating these facts and a throwaway mention of a partisan divide won't do it. 

Journalists can not actually do their jobs by pretending that clearly partisan and intentional attacks on truth and democracy can be covered as if they are not clearly partisan. The right wing has been screaming about media bias for decades and the media has responded by retreating from the truth... and the right has responded with more claims of bias because the strategy is working in their favor. It's far past time for journalism to step up and do their jobs."

2021-10-30 17:02,"Reading these comments is mind-boggling. Person after person saying that COVID is not that dangerous for kids, so the benefits don’t outweigh the risks. Did we not all just live through Delta together? IT WILL MUTATE. 

I am the parent of a 5 and 7 year old and a pre-school teacher. The longer we allow COVID to circulate in an unvaccinated population, the less time I have before my kids’ lives are at risk. IT WILL MUTATE. I know the article said scare tactics don’t work, but this is not a scare tactic, it’s just how viruses work."
2021-10-30 17:06,"I am rejoicing to finally be able to vaccinate my child under 12 and we can travel and not have to quarantine to go back to school.
Sadly, Nefarious Russia and FB and social media have created this world of misinformation.  When everyone (rest of under 12 set)is able to get the vaccine we have to learn to live with this as Covid as it will not go away. At that point we must let us go unmasked as our children deserve their childhood. Unfortunately, to those who don’t want to get vaccinated they can take their chances??? The rest of us who are doing the right thing need to stop being punished."
2021-10-30 17:17,"I am a retired physician. I started warning friends and family in October, 2020 about Covid. Most blew it off as a hoax. I became a pariah. After all, who knows more about disease that rural folks? Several months ago family members went to a live concert with nary a jab between them. Amazingly almost every one came down with Covid. Unfortunately my ten year old grandson who didn’t go got Covid. He ended up being flown to a pediatric medical center with MIS-C, a rare and deadly complication of Covid in children. Ultimately he recovered. 

Had a vaccine been approved he might have completely avoided becoming Ill. At least he should have experienced an attenuated reaction to the virus. We are at a point where citizens need to vaccinate children and stop hand wringing about imagined complications of the vaccine. Public Health sometimes requires what may be considered a ruthless approach to controlling a disease. Our wishy washy approach to Covid is prolonging the outbreak and allowing variants to develop. 

No one ever asked me about the Salk Polio vaccine. We were just lined up and shot. Air injector hurt like hell. Then later we got the Sabin sugar cube. I finally was allowed to go to a public swimming pool. The Salk vaccine was not without problems. A defective batch caused several hundred thousand cases and 200 people died. A small price to pay for eradication of the disease. The moral: Shoot first, ask questions later."
2021-10-30 16:17,I’m so tired of these armchair virologists. They know nothing. They’re also putting my child and by extension my other family members at risk by not vaccinating their kids. They can stay home forever if they don’t vaccinate.

The obvious progression and mutation of this deadly disease is that it will extend to killing children due to community spread.  Children need to be vaccinated to stop the spread and mutations.  This is how vaccines work.  Every vaccine was new at one time.  Science has progressed massively with ways to protect the human race.  Vaccinated people carry lower viral loads and are far less likely to pass them virus on.  FACT.
2021-10-30 17:09,"A Harvard virologist, Michael Tsai, recommends only at-risk younger children get the vaccine. He says if your child is going to get one, do just one shot of J&J, or one shot of Phizer or Moderna, and not the second shot. Another possibility is one shot of Moderna or Phizer, followed by one shot of J&J. He said if you do want to get two shots of Moderna or Phizer for your child, wait four months for the second shot, and ignore the pharmaceutical manufacturer recommended guidelines for the second shot."

With a bit of (legitimate) research, it should be clear that the latter present the greater threat. I no longer blame misinformation campaigns for these misunderstandings. Being a parent means being responsible for someone’s well-being other than your own. Why wouldn’t you educate yourself properly as much as possible? I don’t doubt their love, but I do judge their parenting approach. That being said, I have friends who are like this with their own health and their children’s.

It's a long list. When their classmates don't wear masks or get vaccinated--the first is an inconvenience and the second is very low risk--just going to school can be life threatening.

In reality, we are flying at Christmas to visit family we haven't seen in two years. Many are elderly, one very much immuno compromised. We will aim to have the 9 yo fully vaxxed before the trip, and will be wearing masks while visiting the immuno compromised."

An action that, statistically speaking, is far more risky for her child (and everyone he comes into contact with) than getting vaccinated.

I'm sad that she does not understand this, and I'm anxious because her lack of understanding puts everyone at risk."

2021-10-30 17:52,"My adolescent kids got the 2 shots this summer. 

I think the problem is that most parents today have not lived through outbreaks of infectious disease: polio, diphtheria, tuberculosis and so on.

For those saying covid isn’t a big deal for kids, did you know that around 97% of infected people with polio survive without major disability or death?
So yaay for natural immunity. 

It’s the other 3% that causes thousands of deaths and disabilities and burdens of care for families and communities for many years. 
That’s why we vaccinate as close to 100% as possible."

If the pandemic had occurred when she was a child, I would have had her vaccinated as soon as the vaccine was approved for her age group.  Some parents do not want to be forced to get their child vaccinated with a vaccine they do not trust.  On the other hand, I am sure there are other parents who do not want their children to sit in the same classroom all day with unvaccinated classmates when a vaccine becomes available.  Perhaps, the schools should provide the option of children being separated into various classrooms by vaccination status with the immunocompromised ones being allowed to be in the vaccinated class, if their parents so choose.  It would be a logistical challenge for schools to implement such an arrangement, but it would be a way to cool down the angst and hysteria over this issue."

Since August, we've been having deaths of people in their 30s to 50s at almost as high a rate as those older and recently we lost a 16 year old high school student.  These deaths are causing some of the hesitant to get the shot and we're now at 49%.

Ms. Gauch, the myocarditis, if you son gets it, goes away on its own. But ""a"" side effect of not getting your 9 year old son could be a crippling case of Covid with lung and other organ damage followed by long Covid.

2021-10-30 18:22,"Fear is a powerful thing. My son got the MMR vaccine later than scheduled because I read that it causes autism. I’m an otherwise rationale person but went down a rabbit hole of fear-inducing information and “testimonials” on the web. His pediatrician lost patience, told me I was being irrational and it would be my fault if my baby got measles while I diddled around. Did it work? Nope. I got a new pediatrician. She gently waited but not too long. Gave me a firm date separate from his other shots as a compromise. Listened. Answered questions. Said I wasn’t the only one with that fear and didn’t shame me for having it. Overcame my reluctance and broke through what was almost a cult like fear of an ordinary vaccine. 

So I understand other parents fear and reluctance. More fear (saying Covid is worse) won’t help. Shaming won’t help. Patience and support helps. Unfortunately we don’t have time for patience in a pandemic.

The same goes for the refusal to employ proven methods to prevent contagion, such as wearing masks in public (that includes in school).  A health insurer should deny coverage for the costs of a resultant outbreak that is due to the parent's or child's intransigence, ignorance, and stupidity that exposes not only the child but family members, healthcare providers, and others to contagion.  Also, state and federal law should permit persons who are infected in such a circumstance to sue the unvaccinated, the parents of unvaccinated children, and the perpetrators of Covid-19 lies for damages due to their personal injury and the denial of their civil rights to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"", as well as those who have been denied a much-needed hospital bed due to preventable over-crowding caused by the unvaccinated.

Merck will be coming out with an anti-viral pill fairly soon, and some existing drugs have shown good results in trials.   In developed countries like the US, the Covid epidemic will probably be under control fairly soon.

As we continue to live with covid-19 and the number of cases of ""long haul syndrome"" and other permanent medical conditions caused by the virus come to light I expect fewer parents will make the choice to not have their kids vaccinated. Hopefully their choice to wait won't backfire."
2021-10-30 20:03,"Everyone needs to do their part to fight the pandemic.  Everyone.  That means that if your children are eligible for the vaccine and not allergic to it, they should take it.  Young adults should also take it, because it is the best thing to do for the entire society.

My father was a child during WWII and he spoke about the sacrifices his family made during that time.  His father went to war and was away from his home during much of his childhood.  They had rations for food and even clothing.  Tough times call for sacrifice.  Sometimes to do things that aren't comfortable.  Maybe some are little uncomfortable giving the vaccine to their child, but it's been proven to be very safe, so it's not a huge sacrifice.  

I wish our society would understand that this is not just about their family or even their children.  There are many, many people dying in our country and this is the best way to protect the most vulnerable and to stop the spread Covid. Vaccinating your child can save someone's life."
2021-10-30 20:11,"I don't get it. Vaccines do *not* provide immunity to Covid. They decrease the seriousness of illness should someone contract Covid. Vaccinated people can still ""get it and spread it"". That has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. Why do the media continue to state that getting everyone vaccinated brings us one step closer to herd immunity? Why are people thrilled that children can get vaccinated when they have by far the lowest risk of experiencing a severe outcome? The risk of myocarditis from contracting Covid may be higher than getting it from the vaccine, but what is the risk of getting Covid in the first place? That is probably impossible to say. The studies in children have not enrolled enough participants to actually see if rare side effects from the vaccine, like myocarditis, will show up. So perhaps we don't really know the vaccine risks based on the small numbers of children enrolled in the studies.  I completely understand why parents would be hesitant to have their young children vaccinated. There appear to be no upsides from what I can tell."

Some people do their own research to make decisions and there is a reasonable outcome, and the judgement does not flow the other way towards those who wanted to do what they perceived as the best thing for the community or to reduce their immediate risk of harm. That was a justifiable stance, but it is true those individuals have a much greater risk of infection now until getting a booster, and that is not net beneficial to the community. There is room for independent thought and not the us vs them mentality."

In wealthy countries, it’s a shame it’s being rejected outright by parents. 

My kids are older than 12, and have had both doses. 
A lot of their friends haven’t had the vaccine at all. 

It’s apparent that covid will drag on and there will be outbreaks and hot spots. It means people will be reticent to fully participate in the economy. 
Especially retiring baby boomers who would have spent a lot on travel and recreation. 

Businesses will be cautious about investing and spending.

2021-10-30 21:00,"It's curious how people evaluate risk and reward. I imagine the parents who are reluctant to vaccinate their kids don't give a second thought to putting them in the car and driving them around. In a typical year, 600 kids 12 & younger die in traffic crashes, with more than 90,000 injured. It seems parents are happy to take their chances with a known danger (vehicles) but fear the unknown effects of a vaccine. We need better education for adults."
2021-10-30 21:02,"I understand how scary is is to get your child vaccinated.  Actually the vaccinations for childhood diseases are much more prone to side effects.  While our son is fully vaccinated, we waited for the measles shots until he was 13.  Fortunately there were no measles epidemics, or we would have needed to quicken the time-line.  With chicken-pox, we thought immunity would last longer if he got the disease; while he never attended ""chicken pox"" parties, he played with a child who came down with the chicken pox that night, and still did not get the disease, so we opted for vaccination.  The Pfizer shot is less dangerous I hear than all the childhood vaccines we regularly give kids.  Just give the vaccine, with a month between when he/she had the last vaccination, and your child should be fine."
2021-10-30 19:10,"Fine. Don't vaccinate. Then stay home, too. 

Schools should not allow unvaccinated students to attend if their only reason for failing to get vaccinated is a ""hesitant"" parent. This is an approved vaccine and there are already rules about vaccination requirements for school attendance at most schools."

2021-10-30 20:35,"I think we're well past the point of needing to hear ""concerned voices"" of vaccine resisters, whether for themselves, their children or their state. Instead, I think the media can set up easy-to-follow graphs that compare vaccination to non-vaccination results.

For kids 5 to 11, 8300 hospitalizations out of two million infected translates to 1 in every 240 kindergarteners to 5th graders who catch the virus go to the hospital! Virtually everyone not vaccinated leave themselves wide open to infection. But the vaccine slows transmission, and reduces chances for illness much more effectively than natural immunity can.

Looked at that way, it's easy to see the ratio makes a big difference for kids and their families. The hospitalization rate without the vaccine is far higher than for contracting myocarditis from the vaccine. Instead of answering hesitant parents with a hand-holding article, answer them with an information chart."
2021-10-30 19:11,"Great article, but I'm not sure you can call it a vaccine if booster shots will be needed every 6 months. it becomes more like a flu shot which is not mandatory. Vaccines prevent illnesses, like polio or chickens pox. Current covid vaccines don't prevent, just make cases milder. Big difference."
2021-10-30 21:06,"It is far more nuanced for children. Pretty much the only vaccine kids get for community well being as opposition individual protection is rubella. Covid in kids probably similar or even less risk than influenza.
Modelling suggest lower the R value of reproduction by 0.1-0.2. Not a lot but it adds up.
Bottom line, vaccination really important for adults and mandated justified. Kids not so much."
2021-10-30 19:18,"My parents made sure that I got what was then a new vaccine--the polio vaccine. Some kids who did not get it in time were hit by this incredibly contagious virus and suffered paralysis of legs or an arm, for instance, the rest of their lives. Some lost their lives. Family members and friends look back on that era and don't understand the anti-vax attitudes of today."
2021-10-30 19:25,"This week, a neighborhood 11-year-old came down with raging symptomatic Covid, and now we are all scrambling.  If the vaccine had come only a few weeks earlier, this could have been avoided.  His dad is heartbroken."
2021-10-30 19:01,"As a triple-vaccinated mother, I am not sure I will vaccinate my children. It is not because of some conspiracy theory I read about on Facebook, and I’m not even a republican. No, it is because my kids have had Covid in the past 6 months and barely had any side effects.  Also, we do not know the long-term side effects of the vaccine. It has been subjected to thorough testing, but long-term impact testing requires - wait for it - time. 
Finally, schools keep moving the goal post with masking and testing, even in low infection rates areas like where we live. Until states and schools actually articulate a data-driven metric which clearly determines masking/testing or not, there is little incentive for people in our situation to vaccinate children. 
To those who argue that it’s about community spread reduction, please use the same argument to advocate for the loosening of restrictions. If vaccines truly reduce infection rates in a community, then remove restrictions materially once people are vaccinated.
Masking has become so politicized that even just bringing up the topic will make some accuse you of being a Trumpist or a murderer. Science ignores politics, and risks are all around us. Aiming for the full elimination of risks and eternal life is unrealistic."
2021-10-30 19:13,My question to is this. Why would it harm them more than COVID?  Any issues from the vaccine likely would be magnified without the vaccine if they are infected.
2021-10-30 20:20,"I don’t understand this. Didn’t these parents vaccinate against things like measles and polio? Almost 800 kids have died from Covid in the US and many more have symptoms of long Covid or have dealt with MIS-C. My kids will be the first in line to get their vaccines next week! As a nurse, I have spent the last year and a half terrified I would bring Covid home and make them sick. I may cry tears of joy when they get their vaccines."

And now COVID-19 vaccines are available, scientists again have use their knowledge and the latest vaccination techniques to develop this vaccine, the advance of science have facilitated this, knowing and understanding the human genome have been revolutionary in the treatment of many illnesses, and developing treatments and vaccinations, how fortunate we are. Completely understand the worry many have, but this is a worldwide pandemia, and vaccinations are the best tool to fight COVID-19.  Yes, side effects can occur, just like any other vaccine, millions across the globe have been vaccinated, proving efficacy. Let’s trust science, let’s trust those who are dedicating their lives to this endeavor.

It's really a sad comment that even professional people, an engineer was noted, cannot think critically about probabilities. A covid infection is very probable (highly transmissible delta variant), quite possibly with long term disabilities. A covid vaccination has a very, very low probability of harmful effects. When your child is involved it would seem like a no-brainer to get the shot."
2021-10-30 21:04,"I don’t get Ms. Gauch’s logic. There is no evidence that the very few people, older than her son, who get I’ll from the vaccine have lasting effects. Yet her son can spread the virus or get it himself. Why pick on this approved vaccine?"

Medical professionals and government officials putting on so much pressure and manipulating and hiding data that supports only their agenda.  To force a perfectly healthy individual or child who may not be severely affected if infected with COVID because they do not share the co-morbidities of those who are severely infected is heinous.   As far as spreading it to others or  giving the virus a host in which to mutate no longer holds much validity if the vaccinated are able to contract and spread the disease.

They call their mandate not to abort ""Prolife"".  Ignoring public health has never been considered a halthy prolife option. Of course just about all the covid19 deaths when we didn't have vaccinations and now that we do have been the unvaccinated. A pro death decision? They tell us abortions are."
2021-10-30 20:27,"Given well-established waning immunity from the Pfizer vaccine for adults, the likelihood of Moderna’s 5x more mRNA shot being approved shortly, and the low prevalence of C19 in the Bay Area, I have concluded it makes sense to pass on Pfizer for now for my healthy 6 and 8 year olds.

If that, to you, is child abuse, it’s fine. I would prefer greater protection and a little more real world data. I personally have had two shots and the booster mix and match and my wife is scheduled for the same. We are not anti-Vaxx zealots"
2021-10-30 19:37,"By the way, the people telling you that only 0000x-whatever percent of infected kids get really sick don’t actually know any such number, because we don’t actually know how many kids have been infected in this country. 

We haven’t done the testing.

What we know is that kids stand a good chance of infection if we keep fooling around like this, that so far several hundred have died, that tens of thousands have ended up in hospitals since Delta arrived, and that over 100, 000 have lost a parenter.

We also know, for sure, that they can and they do pass on this virus to far more vulnerable people."

When they get sick with Covid, they want the monoclonal antibodies to get better, or worse may be willing to take livestock drugs."

Was there this much hand-wringing and angst when these parents went to the pediatrician to get their children the standard vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, etc)? I don’t remember anyone storming the schools when we had to register our kids for school and had to present vaccination status. We trusted our doctors and their knowledge. We are entering a really scary stage of ridiculousness."
2021-10-30 19:27,"Vaccines reduce transmission. Therefore, anybody that is unvaccinated is a vector for passing the disease around. If children are asymptomatic, it means they have the virus even though they appear healthy. A super spreader, is someone who infects a lot of people."
2021-10-30 19:30,"So these parents are worried about the side effects of the vaccine but aren't worried about possible long haul effects of them getting covid, such as lung or heart disorders. Amazing."
2021-10-30 21:43,"I work in a small office where we each have our own rooms with windows and doors. 

Two weren’t vaccinated. 

One of them brought COVID into the office by coming in when they didn’t feel well. 

Of the rest of us in the office, the only one who got COVID from the first person was the other unvaccinated person. 

Get your shots. They work. 

And if you are worried about your children, go ask their pediatrician, not your neighbor or the parent at pick up from school. The risks from COVID are higher than the risk from the shot, as your pediatrician will tell you."
2021-10-30 21:16,"My friend's son became symptomatic  with Covid  last Friday, which was  the child's tenth birthday .

Eighteen children in the son's  mask-wearing class had been diagnosed with Covid-19 by that point.  The  school was shut down .

My friend's  child has lost the ability to taste.

The father  had  gone into Acute Respiratory Distress due to Covid-19 on March 13, 2020 and had been rushed to the hospital gasping for air.  He was hospitalized for severe Covid and Covid-19 pneumonia. He  had to be put on supplemental oxygen. He became delusional. He was  hospitalized three times, but has no memory of one of the hospitalizations. He had Covid-19 pneumonia for over four months. He has continued to suffer
from difficulty breathing, debilitating fatigue, severe headaches,
""Covid-Brain"", and has developed asthma, and more.

My friend had been a healthy forty-four year old  who had no predisposing conditions before   going into ARD due to Covid-19.

Those who intend to refuse to vaccinate their children might want to consider the effect on the children if the children go on to infect the parents, including if the parents are vaccinated. Some of the parents who refuse to vaccinate their children will end up in the hospital, dead, or with Long Covid. 

Some  of these children will end up in the hospital, dead, or with Long Covid, because their parents failed to protect them with a lifesaving vaccine.

Responsible parents won't endanger their children and others by refusing to vaccinate."
2021-10-30 21:41,"From a public health perspective, vaccinating all young children against COVID will mean avoiding several hundred deaths in children in the U.S., and thousands more in other countries. It isn’t just an individual choice. As with other rare but deadly diseases, vaccination against COVID should be part of the general set of inoculations given in childhood from here on."
2021-10-30 22:04,"Calling this particular shot a vaccine is a misnomer; it's essentially a COVID-specific immune system booster. It confers an immune response against COVID-19 for a certain amount of time, unlike the polio vaccine, which provides lifelong immunity.

You can be exposed to an infinite amount of polio virus after your shot and it won't make any difference. That's not the case at all with the COVID-19 shots. And before you start talking about mutations, people have gotten reinfected with the same strain of COVID multiple times, so the talk of ""mutations"" isn't relevant.

Is it worth it? The data over the last year from multiple countries show that elementary-aged school children generally don't spread the virus and tend to be asymptomatic. Are there benefits for high-risk kids in this age group? Yes. But for the vast majority of kids the benefit just isn't there, especially in areas that are following COVID-19 protocols.

We'll see how things are next year."
2021-10-30 22:08,"The U.S. population continues to amaze me in all the wrong ways.  We have some of the best trained scientists and clinicians in the world- think Stanford, Johns Hopkins, etc.  But people with a high school diploma know more about immunology and disease than our experts. Ignorance is bliss and social media is now truly accepted as fact.  We are truly living in dark times."
2021-10-30 22:15,I am returning to normal. Vaccines are now available to all who are at risk. The risk is on them. The chances of a vaccinated person infecting a child and causing serious illness is vanishingly small. Enough.
2021-10-30 21:28,"s there a possible causal susceptibility for myocarditis in certain young people (predominately boys) between those that might get myocarditis from COVID-19 and those that might get myocarditis from an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer)? Are they somehow part of a sector that is prone (immunologically, perhaps) to developing myocarditis? Why do these few boys get myocarditis either way while the vast majority don't? An answer might relieve the concerns of many parents reluctant to getting their children vaccinated."
2021-10-30 22:17,Getting a vaccine to protect older adults who have lived full lives already? I'm 75 and resent this kind of thinking. Sounds like she doesn't have any grandparents around.
2021-10-30 22:20,"My hypothesis is that vaccinating 5-11 year olds won’t make much of a difference.  The reduction in risk for that age group is real, but very, very small; in one scenario the FDA considered the vaccine actually increased risk, but it remained very, very small.  We know the vaccine protection against infection wanes over time while protection against significant disease remains robust.  Thus, vaccinating this group will probably reduce transmission in the short term, but not necessarily preclude the quarantines and missed school days as these kids get infected - that’s less likely with the vaccine but it was already unlikely.  The Yellow Fever Vaccine is approved for children 9 months and older, but is not recommended except under certain circumstances.  This vaccine is approved now for kids 5-11, but I can argue that the emergency is behind us, those kids are at very low risk, adults who are vaccinated are similarly at very low risk, and the urgency that we all felt to get vaccinated last winter/spring need no longer be with us."
2021-10-30 21:58,"Even the doctors on the FDA panel had concerns that recommending the vaccine for this age group would lead to school mandates which they are against. Mainly because the test group was so small, and kids in this age range do not suffer serious side effects from
Covid. I’m pro vaxx, I follow the science. Therefore I will not be vaccinating my 6 year old until more data is provided for this age group. A trial of less than 3000 children will determine vaccine rules for millions. No thanks.!"
2021-10-30 22:12,"I was eager to get my 15 year old vaccinated as soon as he was eligible… but he was the one asking me to check NY State’s website to see if he was eligible every day until he was. Turns out (aside from my feelings about it) that while he was lucky enough to go to school in-person last year, losing sports, drama, band performances and easy after-school meetups with friends was a powerful inducement to do the right thing for himself and for the community. Beyond that, we have friends and family some of whom have both died of covid and others who have had mild-to-severe side effects from the vaccine. He’s only able to ask one group of them about their experiences now. He gets it."
2021-10-30 21:38,"I'm a doctor with a background in immunology. To put it like a millennial, long-term side effects from vaccines are not a ""thing"".  We have had vaccinations for many decades, and there is no credible evidence of any vaccine having adverse effects show up years later.  Vaccines are not like drugs that are given on an ongoing basis, where it is more plausible to expect some problems to show up with chronic use that were not evident in pre-approval trials.  When people say ""but they don't have long-term data"", mostly they are just knocking down a straw man, and of course this tactic allows the goalposts to be moved back indefinitely.  Does anyone really expect that the anti-vaxxers who use this argument will change their minds and get vaccinated once the vaccine is 5 years old or so? Of course not.

Also, regarding the newness of mRNA vaccines, it's not like mRNA itself is a new invention. Every living cell has used mRNA for hundreds of millions of years. These vaccines simply use an elegant technique to get the recipient's own cells to manufacture the antigenic protein without a viral vector.  Sure, anything is formally possible, but I'm not about to lose any sleep over the 3 doses I received of an mRNA vaccine."
2021-10-30 22:21,"They like being part of a club. They don’t care about the science they just like being stubborn. Their kids suffer.
Thank goodness the young parents in my family are standing in line with their children waiting for the vaccine."
2021-10-30 21:36,"I wish you would write an article about how ""adverse reactions to vaccines"" are actually TESTED FOR and are part of the vaccine approval process. IF these reactions occur they happen within weeks of vaccination. W e are NOT seeing them on a broad scale hence the safety of the vaccines. Why not elevate the voices of those who trust the science instead of fanning the flames of hesitancy? Once again, we have an article published by this paper that makes people more afraid. It's shameful given the number of deaths this virus has caused."
2021-10-30 21:14,"This pandemic isn't being prolonged because there are too many people getting vaccinated. It isn't spreading in our schools because too many parents want their kids to get vaccinated. It's spreading because too many people - including too many parents - are allowing their hesitancy, their preference for misinformation, the credulity they give to unsubstantiated harangues, and their ignorance to prolong this public health disaster. 

Although it is true that no vaccine is perfect and that rare adverse consequences can occur from vaccination, it is foolish to think that those risks even begin to compare with the risks of being infected with Covid, or the risks of prolonging the suffering by refusing vaccination. 

The disease, not the vaccine, is the killer."
2021-10-30 21:19,"Children may have better immunity, but are they super spreaders without the vaccine?"
2021-10-30 21:05,"Once again for the people in the back: There is no such thing as long term side effects for vaccines. It simply does not exist and never has, for any vaccine ever invented."

2021-10-30 21:44,"Vaccine decisions have not been “personal and complicated “ until one political party decided to make them a part of their chaos campaign. There have always been fringe anti-vaxxers, but they were the tiny minority. Responsible and logical people just got them. And your headline should make it clear that it’s a minority of parents that are reluctant to consent, or even better, the majority of parents are making the best decision for their kids and will have them vaccinated."
2021-10-30 22:07,"If even vaccinated parents are having second thoughts about their children get vaccinated, that is proof that antivaxxers have somewhat won. They don't need to be right, they just need to sow doubt. So disheartening to see that."
2021-10-30 22:14,"Here is an exercise for all the folks out there who are reluctant to be vaccinated for COVID.  First, go to the CDC website and look up death rates for:
Polio, Measles, Mumps, Whooping Cough. Diphtheria, Smallpox, Flu, Pneumonia - all of which, until vaccines were developed, killed untold thousands/millions of people. All of you who are adults, or at least most of you, are alive because you were vaccinated as a child and hopefully keep up with your booster shots. And your children are alive because they have been vaccinated. 

And add Shingles to the list - you don't want to get it . . . it's a horrible disease  . . . and there is an effective vaccine for that as well. 

And now add COVID to the list. And then look at the tally of folks who are dead because they became ill before a vaccine was available, or they didn't wear a mask, or ignored warnings about crowded places and the quite efficient aerosol transmission by the virus. There is LOTS of evidence that masking and vaccines have put a huge dent in deaths. Almost all the people or children dying now refused to get vaccinated or parents refused to allow vaccination. And may have given COVID to people around them.  There is mountains of evidence that the vaccines are effective, and next to none, other than lies from deniers, that there is  danger in getting the vaccine. 

So. . . Do you really want to die? Or kill your nearest and dearest, including your children?  Your call . . ."

2021-10-30 21:18,"This will be an enormous uphill battle. If even near 50% of kids get vaxxed, I will be amazed.

With 50% of otherwise (considered to be) sentient adults refusing a life-saving vaccine for themselves, c'mon, do you think they're going to line their up their kids?

I don't have children myself -- yes, a huge qualifier -- but I have siblings and nieces and nephews, and they have kids, and they all got their childhood immunizations along the way ... up until now. 
(Even the last 5, 10 years, one got hints that the anti-vaxxers were not doing standard innoculations, and sidestepping public school requirements by putting kids in choice or religious or private schools to accomplish same. Which seemed incredibly reckless to me, but again ... it was small areas and outbreaks here and there and I thought, well, good luck to them).

But CoVid, as a global pandemic, is an entirely new ballgame. 

I'm starting to wonder if the lack of deadly epidemics during most later Boomers' and beyond lifetimes' has made them just deaf, dumb and blind to the risks of refusing vaccines? 
Were the horrors of everything from smallpox to polio not taught in their science classes over the years?

I understand Ms. Gauch's fear about 'debilitating side effects,' -- but long-haul CoVid, that saps her young son's lungs of their ability to function as well as they could have, for the rest of his life, due to NOT being vaccinated, is also a terrible potential outcome.

    An analogy is the increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria.  

     ""Could some vaccines drive the evolution of more virulent pathogens? Conventional wisdom is that natural selection will remove highly lethal pathogens if host death greatly reduces transmission. Vaccines that keep hosts alive but still allow transmission could thus allow very virulent strains to circulate in a population.""

The USA lag in vaccination and ongoing covid spread places us with some of the worst places on earth.  Just look at the Times' daily covid map!  is that where you want to be?

Your consciences are ok with that?"
2021-10-30 19:29,"Unfortunate but true that the possibility of rare, life-threatening side effects cannot be eliminated from vaccination. It does, after all, stimulate the immune system to recognize and deter a foreign invader from our bodies, and the immune system is a double-edged sword that sometimes attacks us by mistake. Even the widely-used MMR shots have risks. There’s a chance, roughly comparable to that of suffering in a commercial plane crash, a child will be seriously injured by this vaccine, and yet we require it anyway because measles is still endemic in some countries.

Covid can be dangerous to kids. The pediatric Covid vaccine is here, and optional for now, as it should be. I hope we are gentle on parents, encouraging them to have their children get it as we allow space for acceptance to build.

It may be required for school attendance one day, perhaps after full FDA approvals and a certain amount of post-marketing experience. Unlike the MMR, the Pfizer Covid shot doesn’t use live viruses—or even dead ones, for that matter. The major potential side effect, inflammation of the heart muscle, has been observed in adolescents ages 12 to 15, up to 40 cases per million shots delivered for boys, and 4 per million for girls.

2021-10-30 23:40,"“If I make a bad decision and he ends up with some debilitating side effects or lifelong adverse reaction, I don’t think I could live with that,” she said.

The logic of the above statement, made by a concerned well-meaning parent, is seriously flawed.

Life is inherently risky. We can be careful and prudent in making decisions. We can try to minimize exposure to risks, but, ultimately, we are NOT in control.
Imagine a well-structured, professionally, repeatedly-run study leads a skilled team of first-rate pharmacologists to conclude.
“If this vaccine is correctly administered to 1,000,000 appropriate patients, ALL of whom are assumed to be repeatedly exposed to the pathogen afterward:
(The resulting report that would follow would be lengthy and complex. Many sentences. Math. Statistics. Probabilities. Let’s focus on two of the report’s statements.)
1. Estmated lives saved. 15,650. Without the vaccine about 15,650 of one million people would have died.
2. Patients likely to experience a lethal reaction to vaccine. 4 to 12. We can expect 4 to 12 out of a million people to die from extreme side effects.”

The numbers are entirely made up by me, but they’re based on the excellent coverage this newspaper has devoted to the pandemic.
I’m nearly 70 years old. The probability that me getting an injection of vaccine will save my life is THOUSANDS of times as high as is the probability a vaccine side effect will kill me.
I can’t control risk, but in this case. The answer is obvious."
2021-10-30 23:45,Why doesn’t this article deal more fully with the risks of Long Covid in children? Parents who are worried about unknown long-term risks of a new vaccine ought to consider the increasingly well documented risks of Long Covid—referred to in the example given in the last 3 paragraphs of a 10-year-old who is still having breathing difficulties 3 months after a bout with Covid.

We briefly considered lying about my older child’s age, but are afraid she’ll need the proof of vaccine somewhere down the line, so we shouldn’t use an incorrect birthdate. Please hurry up and get the young kids vaccinated, so we can move onto the babies! I’ll feel so much more at ease once mine are fully vaccinated."

My husband and I are vaccinated, as is our 17-year-old. We will wait to get our 10 and 13 year-olds vaccinated. This IS NOT polio or smallpox. Our local children's hospital which serves a 3 state area, said they are only seeing 5-10 cases of Covid daily which isn't much more than an average flu season. The risks of both the vaccine and covid are extremely small."
2021-10-31 2:22,"Many parents are leaving their young children at increased risk when they think they are protecting them.  Unvaccinated people have almost 30 times the risk of vaccinated people of developing serious illness and hospitalization due to Covid. For example, the chance of developing myocarditis due to a Covid infection is higher than the chance of developing myocarditis following Covid vaccination."
2021-10-31 2:22,"These kids should get vaccinated unless their MD advises against it. However, this is different from adults. A 10 year old unvaccinated kid is at less risk from serious Covid than a vaccinated 50 year old. I have not seen data on kid to kid transmission rates but cases in schools are low and none are vaccinated. We should not mandate for this age cohort - data doesn’t yet warrant it … as we follow science that could change. If there are no at risk adults involved then the parents can reasonably wait and risk they may miss out on some play dates. They should not be shamed but are responsible for telling other parents that their child is unvaccinated. The article implies the risk of these children dying of Covid are ~ 1 in 165,000. Not to be callous but, assuming the vaccine is less risky, it’s a simple math problem like so many health decisions."
2021-10-31 2:36,IN 1965 I was in the first grade.  My classmates and I all received the polio vaccine.  My parents were informed after the fact.  My mom was relieved.  Times have changed.

2021-10-31 1:49,"Any child who has caring parents is one lucky child. Parents know their children best because they know their child or children through out their lives. It is a human right of every child to be provided education or medical care only after parental consent (PC). 

Several childhood viral diseases have been almost eradicated thanks to receiving immunizations based on CDC guidelines for age appropriate vaccines. Many of the childhood vaccinations that are required before entering KG have been successfully evaluated for decades. The COVID vaccines have been only rolled out for general public use since the beginning of 202. Not even a full year has passed. Even though COVID shots are a GO from the FDA for vaccinating 5-to 11-year-olds, there is no way they can be administered without PC.

Erin Gauch of Middletown, R.I knows her 9-year-old son David better than anyone else in the world. If she is reluctant to consent then so be it. Why should she be forced to have a leap of faith. Obviously she will have to think for herself and make an informed decision. Adverse effects of vaccines and drugs could be real and anyone who does not take into account the risk benefit analysis is negligent in their due diligence.

I have survived 3 pandemics without being vaccinated and been vaccinated against several viral and bacterial diseases. I have been taking a wonder drug that works wonders, baby aspirin (BA) until 2 different doctors said you have to stop BA. I get it decisions can be hard."
2021-10-31 2:07,I do think there’s not quite enough information to decide if the benefits outweigh the risks for healthy children with no risk factors. Thankfully though the risk for BOTH vaccine and covid are very low for this group.
2021-10-30 22:12,"It’s perfectly reasonable to take a wait and see approach with our children.  This vaccine was just “approved” and nobody really knows the long term effects. Besides, the FDA will not be winning any awards for trustworthiness."
2021-10-30 22:19,There is nothing to be afraid of. The vaccines are safe and effective. Any parent who does not get their kid vaccinated ASAP is committing parental malpractice by putting their kid’s health and even life at risk FOR NO GOOD REASON!
2021-10-30 19:59,"The data from the very beginning of Covid has been consistent — healthy children are at essentially zero risk from Covid. In fact, children who get Covid asymptomatically or with mild symptoms might very well have strong natural immunity going forward. So while I completely understand and support mandating vaccinations for adults, I don’t even understand the logic of children with no underlying conditions being vaccinated."
2021-10-31 10:00,"This article states that over half the newly eligible children are people of color, many in rural (agricultural) communities. Public education policy is and has been that schools enroll all comers. These children are vaccinated in clinics devoted to getting them into schools and summer supervision support programs that exist to for rural ag workers. Are all the adults in these family circles also ready and willing and available for vaccination? Are school systems and hospitals and children, especially in rural areas where everything is ag powered  and schools are also often dominated by anti-mask and/or anti-vax and/or anti-science miltants--are these communities and kids and their frontlines ed and health and service providers sitting ducks for covid because public education policy and practice and public health policy and practice do not operate in tandem? Ask the highly trained and skilled professionals who are idled in hospitals that have been shut down due to covid surge bed shortages triggered by ""vaccine hesitancy"" plus political la la and doohdah.Hurry now! Before they all bolt for a better shot somewhere, anywhere else at doing what they do.And before public education takes any more hits."
2021-10-31 3:46,"I have been vaccinated and so have my young adult kids. I would, of course, vaccinate them if they were children simply because I see no downside to it. Vaccines do not prevent transmission or infection. But they significantly reduce the risk of serious disease and death in all age cohorts. Side effects are very mild: I had none, and only one of my sons had a headache. Serious side effects have lower probability than being hit by a car when you cross a street. However, I can understand a parent who shrugs when being told that vaccination is a “service to the community”. I would not endanger my own or my children’s health for other people’s sake. Explain to people what they can gain from being vaccinated and they will consider it. Try to force them into accepting vaccines by shaming them for “being selfish” and they’ll rebel. There is no worse tyranny than the tyranny of enforced virtue."
2021-10-31 4:58,"Parents are going to worry about the longer term effects on their kids. As there are not yet any data on long term effects, many parents will choose to err on the side of caution with their children, aware that the virus rarely harms kids. This is a rational response, not the only rational response, but I’m going to guess the one that the majority of parents choose. If we want to drive transmission as low as possible we will need strict legal mandates for kids to be vaccinated in order to attend school. Or we decide to live and let live and accept more transmission."
2021-10-31 5:14,"At present, the likelihood that an unvaccinated child will get seriously sick is relatively low compared to the probability of an unvaccinated or immunocompromised adult getting seriously ill. However, let’s please not forget that every time the virus infects another person (adult or child), it is presented with another opportunity to multiply and mutate into something that may be far more virulent and deadly to children, their parents, grandparents, etc. And at that point, the vaccines we currently have, that mostly protect against severe infection and hospitalization, may be rendered ineffective."
2021-10-31 9:52,"Good thing parents in the 50's didn't wait for more ""information,"" or experience with the vaccine, before getting their kids vaccinated for Polio.

Nowadays, however, the experts have lost sway and freedom to make unwise and socially irresponsible decisions reigns supreme.

""Expert hesitancy"" is the new normal, though when the chips are down most drop their insistence on ""more research"" and gladly accept what medical science has to offer, including recent developments such as monoclonal antibodies."
2021-10-31 4:05,"How nice for parents who want to ""wait and see"" that there are some who are prepared to get their kids vaccinated based on clinical trial data and a sense of responsibility to their kids and their neighbors.  Needless to say, we cannot all ""wait and see.""  

I'm baffled by the kid glove approach that some experts are taking to these parents.  For months we have been told (correctly) that clinical trial results supporting FDA approval were enough to provide a compelling justification for adults and adolescents to get vaccinated.  But now, for no good reason, suddenly it's understandable that parents want to wait for more data.  This makes no sense, and it implicitly undermines the case that public health authorities have been making for universal vaccinations among adults."
2021-10-31 5:01,"The argument put forth by the vaccine hesitant that ""the trials were too small"" is just more evidence that we should teaching statistics instead of calculus in high schools.

Sadly, we are a nation which doesn't understand basic math and science. This makes us vulnerable to hearsay, superstition, and anecdote."
2021-10-31 3:36,I would love for someone to write an article examining vaccine hesitancy among physicians. It would be difficult to simply dismiss as mis-information the reasons that so many physicians have chosen not to be vaccinated.
2021-10-31 4:07,"My two sons had Covid over the summer.  One had a high fever on the first day (when I was very worried), then reduced fever and cold-like symptoms for 4 more days.  The other tested positive but was asymptomatic.  I was fully vaccinated in May but I caught Covid from my younger son in August. (So did my fully vaccinated wife--our cases were worse than the kids, but no hospitalization needed.)  Remember that the vaccine does not prevent infection, only reduces the probability of infection some, until its effectiveness wanes, when a booster becomes necessary."

And parents lined up to inoculate their kids against polio when that vaccine was new.  Maybe if Covid left kids disabled, more parents would be willing to vaccinate their kids.  Apparently, protecting their kids against severe illness, protecting their teachers and classmates and family members, keeping our schools open, keeping our economy going, none of that is important enough to get your kids a vaccine that is proven to be safe and effective.  Sure hope these parents at least insist that their kids be masked in public.  Something tells me they don’t."

“Just a little pinch. No tears. You’ll never ever get polio.”
That sunny fall day was all positive. No one worried. No conspiracy theories. One of the brightest days of my childhood.

a) Healthy kids have negligible risk from covid.
b) Within 8 months, booster shots are made available for adults. And data from Israel showed covid recovered persons have better immunity than shots. And nobody knows how often booster shots are needed. 
c) There are no long term study on the impact of vaccines on kids. People can give other explanations, but simple matter of fact is there are no long term study on kids. So why take the risk for negligible benefits,  as there are documents concerns (myocarditis and pericarditis) to male children.

So it is better for healthy kids to get covid and to gain natural immunity. i could argue this is also  socially responsible as it provides better long term immunity and help stop later mutation of virus (very few people will be willing to take annual covid shots anyway). I read somewhere upto 40% school kids might have already exposed to covid. The number maybe over estimated , but I believe atleast 25% might already have. 

This is not to say parents should not get covid vaccines for children. They should, if they prefer it. But also respect others who don’t want to vaccinate kids.

But please, if someone have morbidities, please take vaccines (both adults and kids)."

Physician here - please note that the term myocarditis simply refers to inflammation of the heart muscle, not necessarily weakening. In fact, a recent NEJM article (link below) found that left ventricular function, a kind of surrogate for heart strength/weakening, was normal on admission in 71% of patients, and the mean at discharge was similar to the mean at presentation.

Before the vaccine was available, Tyson leadership refused basic measures like providing high quality masks to staff, mandatory testing, improved air quality, and paid sick leave. How does a company prevent spread of this disease when they can’t be bothered to provide paid sick leave to their hourly workers? Their chicken is cheap because it’s paid for by their workers’ lives."

There have never been so many instances of people assaulting flight attendants on airlines and creating disturbances at public venues — often over mask mandates but sometimes just because they can — that we’ve started accepting it like we accept widespread gun deaths.

Have you taken a drug test when you accepted working in your company? 
Where were you at the time ""My body my choice"" slogan? Do you wear your pants or special clothing, like head covering or mask to perform your duties? 
How about if company shuts down for a month or two due to mass covid cases. 
Do you blame company, your coworker or yourself when you did not pay your bills? 
You accept to work in a company, you follow their rules. Your choice to continue or quite when the rules goes against your will. Welcome to capitalism!!"
2021-11-04 12:16,"Tyson was right. They saw a need. They worked with the plant Union. They reached out to their employees. They had a multiday meeting with their management team and outside experts in the health arena. They looked at, and understood a possible financial impact. then, they negotiated with Stuart Appelbaum, one of the most progressive Union leaders in the field. An agreement was reached, implemented and Tyson is now a National leader in how to handle a delicate danger."
2021-11-04 12:24,"A personal decision? 
More like ignorance or even stupidity.
And now she’s relieved that the company made the decision for her and she has been vaccinated.
I’m sure she had been vaccinated against polio, measles, chickenpox, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and maybe other viruses and pathogens before she went to school as a child. Covid-19 is similarly infectious, contagious, and deadly.

There are skeptics. There always are. The vaccine has been proven safe and effective but nothing is absolutely risk free. The alternative however is getting sick, infecting family, friends, and co-workers, and spreading the disease to make it even more difficult to stop. And causing death.

Do these statements come from upbringing? Poor education? Misinformation spread by others, including a major news network? 

Maybe getting vaccinated should be part of the civics classes we all take in elementary school."
2021-11-04 12:35,"Every company that is dragging its feet on mandates needs to read this article.  It is always the same:  announce the mandate, see horror stories about how everyone will quit, then move to articles about how so many essential personnel will not be available, and then the end result is 98 or 99 percent of people get vaccinated.  Probably some of those people were disenchanted with the company and planning on leaving anyway.  Vaccine mandates work."
2021-11-04 12:36,"Wouldn’t it be helpful if other businesses learned from Tyson. Education can quell fears. This anti-vax is a phobia of sorts, and the only way to deal with a phobia is to expose oneself in steps to that which causes the fear. I have been treated for other phobias and it works. It’s like recovering from the fantasy world you’ve been living in.
I think the religious excuse, and all the other excuses are a cover for fear.
During the polio epidemic none of this political polarizing existed. It’s an artificial contrivance. If I don’t get the vaccine, I’m a true…whatever you believe. Bogus values."

2021-11-04 12:47,"What appears to be missing in the idea of vaccine hesitancy is the concept of the ""common good."" 

Those employees who resist receiving the vaccine are only thinking of themselves rather than the effect of not receiving the vaccine on their family, co-workers, and society in general."
2021-11-04 12:50,"I work for a large automotive dealer group that hasn't quite gone full vaccine requirement they did early on require masks. 

Then after several of our dealerships in Florida had to be shut down because of Covid outbreaks. One dealer had 19 employees test positive for Covid. The company instituted a proof of vaccination policy along with mandatory masks and test for those who were not vaccinated and all new hires have to be vaccinated. 

Not having any vaccine protocols cost businesses money."
2021-11-04 12:51,A deep south company plays hardball. That should be the headline. Any entry level finance major could assess the cost/benefit of closing down a business or losing part of its workforce. Finally a ceo read his own research. This anti vax effort is monetized ploy to stoke fear and anxiety. History will judge unkindly those who are playing a dangerous game.
2021-11-04 12:53,"Bravo,Tyson, for both mandating vaccines, but also for the way you listened to your workers, you brought in experts from their communities to talk to them, and, yes, you offered more financial benefits to them!  Attention, other large companies and corporations: Be and Do like Tyson."
2021-11-04 12:57,"We really do live in a divided world I guess.  Most everyone I work with, am related to and socially interact with is vaccinated.  We all traded our stories about how fast we became vaccinated and discussed whether or not to get boosters.  I have not heard one story about any adverse effects from any acquaintance, other than the immediate reaction that goes away in a day"
2021-11-04 12:59,I need to correct Mr. Millers statement. Lots of of good workers didn't lose their jobs. They chose to quit. A condition of employment was to be vaccinated. They chose not to. No one took anyones job away from them.
2021-11-04 13:10,"“...took the burden off of me making the choice.”

This worker sums it up perfectly.

We can lead horses to water but can’t make the drink, unless of course you’re the wrangler and ‘force’ the horse to drink and make the decision for him/her. Typically horses that drink are satisfied, happier and will ride for longer distances.

Humans aren’t much different."
2021-11-04 13:10,"""All of its 120,000 workers would need to be vaccinated...Since announcing the policy, roughly 60,500 employees have received the vaccine, and more than 96 percent of its work force is vaccinated."" Maybe check your math or explain ""work force"" versus ""employees."""

2021-11-04 12:23,"""Tyson agreed to offer more benefits for all workers, like paid sick leave.""  So, Tyson hadn't been offering paid sick leave before to all workers?!  I can't help but wonder what percentage of their workers had been/are 30 minutes under the weekly hourly minimum to qualify for lofty benefits like paid sick leave.  Seems the heart had been just a sticker after all."

2021-11-04 13:04,"Not mandating vaccines simply adds fuel to the fire for the resisters. It validates their illogical position. To say, you have a choice, vaccination and your job or no vaccination and no job makes it plain and simple.
You cannot drive without a license. You can't buy alcohol unless you have proof that you're 21. Just throw in there, you can't work for a major corporation unless you're vaccinated. Easy!"
2021-11-04 13:11,"An excellent article that I will use in my undergraduate classes to discuss ethics in work safety and health. Profit or health is a false dichotomy, as Tyson ultimately acknowledged."
2021-11-04 13:12,"Our family scrambled to get the vax when it first came out, driving three hours to an area of Maryland that wasn't taking vaccination seriously and had a surplus. We all have boosters now.

If you don't trust the science behind the vax, how can you trust science to treat you once you get it?

I would have an easier time understanding Martians in Martian than antivaxers."
2021-11-04 13:15,"Great article. If nearly all of Tyson’s workers were willing to get the vaccine rather than lose a job that, to me, would be pretty awful, I don’t think we need to worry about Biden’s mandate for all companies with more than 100 employees."

2021-11-04 13:23,"Given ongoing lack of clarity at the official level a year+ ago by those paid to know, ie CDC, you can understand the company's being slow to react. Without some direct experience with the fog of war or uncertainty associated with any crisis, it seems easy to be critical, especially in hindsight. The five stages of grief apply to unfolding disasters, with denial hitting immediately followed by anger and an attempt to bargain away the threats. They don't work. It takes massive training to be able to react. As a pilot, Army SSG and EMT, I've learned to apply problem solving tools as soon as possible. 
What none of us had back then was any credible central entity providing education, explanation and guidance. It was, after a while, finally masking, distancing (as used 100 yrs ago) and wait for the vaccine. Then when the vaccines arrived no one appeared to have the courage or conviction to mandate them. 
Even now the ""or testing"" alternative is offered when in fact that is an inferior, late and ineffective barrier to the bug. Leadership; I'll know it when I see it."

Meantime kudos to Tyson for their proactive decision."
2021-11-04 13:29,"The Biden mandate hopes to accomplish nationwide (in companies with 100 or more employees) what Tyson has accomplished more locally. 

People like Calvin Miller, who plans to leave Tyson over the mandate and find employment elsewhere, may be shocked, SHOCKED, to find that a vaccination mandate will, in very short order, apply in every ""elsewhere"" he can imagine."
2021-11-04 13:35,"Interesting words the company ""took the burden off of me making the choice"" Many are held back from vaccination by the fealty they owe to their families or friends who may be rabidly anti vaxxers because of political brainwashing.

2021-11-04 13:41,"The ""right of people to make a personal choice"" on whether to receive vaccines seems to  clash with the right of companies to hi re and fire according to personal choice.  If companies like airlines and food processors can fire employees for  (for instance) showing up drunk or dirty or out of uniform, surely they can fire them for not getting prescribed health care.  People whose ""personal choice"" causes them to reject such care have only themselves to blame if their choice causes them to be fired."

But as vaccination rates rise nationwide approach the critical rates needed, the virus will decline. Restrictions of many sorts will be lifted. This will mean a return to many freedoms once taken for granted. Isn't that better than the freedom to say no to the vaccine and the freedom to die in a hospital on a ventilator."
2021-11-04 13:48,"I suspect that peer pressure is a big factor in vaccine resistance among factory workers.

For some, a mandate may provide a face-saving route to vaccination"
2021-11-04 13:52,"Mentioned, but under-emphasized, is that most shoulder-to-shoulder line workers are immigrants, predominantly from South of the border; whereas most of the workers elsewhere in the plants (dry storage, administrative coordinator) are more likely multi-generation Americans.  The immigrants appear more open to trust the vaccine after respectful education and their own life experience; however, as reported here, there is more distrust of the evidence from the born Americans, which becomes their problem because in the long run high-trust groups outperform low-trust ones."
2021-11-04 13:52,"Let's face it.  The only reason most people aren't getting vaccinated is that the Democrats are making them do it.  If Fox and Trumpist propaganda did not exist, a miniscule percentage of the population, maybe some hard core antivaxxers mixed in with some Christian Scientists would refrain. I have a friend who just says I'm not doing it because I don't want ""them"" telling me I gotta do it.  Insane thinking, from many of our friends and family members out there.  My husband and I feel we need a support group for people like us trying to walk on eggshells around the people we love."
2021-11-04 13:55,Thank you for this uplifting story. It’s made my day.
2021-11-04 14:11,"These numbers don't add up. How is it possible for more than 96% to be vaccinated if they have 120,000 workers (first sentence), but 60,500 employees have received the vaccine?? Something is misleading or poorly communicated here."
2021-11-04 14:12,"When I started working in municipal public utilities we regularly entered dangerous confined spaces and worked in deep unstable trenches without any protections, I had many close encounters with situations that could have turned out badly. Over time we implemented numerous safety precautions and the risk declined. Surprisingly the most resistance came not from management but from the employees themselves. Covid vaccinations are about mitigating risk, both personal and public, we aren’t told that enough. Vaccine requirements for work are about mitigating risk, for both the employees and the employers. It’s a condition of employment and its a reasonable one. I’m not a fan of Tyson for a variety of reasons including their poor employee safety record. But beating them up for requiring vaccinations, nope, for that Tyson gets a thumbs up."
2021-11-04 14:20,"Kudos to Tyson for doing this. The more shots in arms across the board, the sooner we have control of the pandemic.  This is no different from making workers wear PPE to reduce work place accidents and deaths."
2021-11-04 14:21,"Why would you launder the reputation of a company which willingly put workers in harms way? 

Many companies have vaccine mandates, and the vast majority of those companies also don’t treat their workers as expendable livestock, or make bets on their employees’ survival. 

So why praise Tyson? Who paid for this piece?"
2021-11-04 14:21,"Even though I abhor factory farming and this industry and have boycotted Tyson for years, this is good news, and I hope it sets an example of good corporate governance. Some of the big meat packers in the Central Valley here in California should take heed as they forced sick employees come to work during the height of the pandemic last year."
2021-11-04 14:22,"Until vaccination became politicized by Trump reflexively to cover for his massive shortcomings in every respect, resistance to vaccination was an underground cultural phenomenon that had little real effect on public health with rare exceptions like occasional measles outbreaks at amusement parks. There’s not a single well documented case that anyone who received either of the RNA based vaccines died as a direct response to the vaccine. There’s a reporting system for vaccine adverse effects reporting (VAERS) but based on the numbers one can make an equally compelling case that chocolate ice cream is as deadly as the vaccines.  Due to the vast numbers of vaccine resistors, the only way forward is to force the remainder of vaccine resistors to get vaccine to protect themselves and those around them. Tyson made the right call in the interest of their business and weeded out their least intelligent employees as an unintended bonus."
2021-11-04 14:26,This seems to be an example of the phenomenon Dr. Tufekci identified in her column: mandates serving as a face-saving way to climb down from political or ideological resistance.
2021-11-04 14:29,"Does anyone else find this statement repellent?

“This was a business decision,” Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. “There isn’t enough of a supply of workers to take the place if a large number of workers are getting sick.”

In other words, if management could have found enough workers to replace those who fell ill or died from Covid, there would be no mandate. And Stuart, a union president, was OK spouting that?

This is a good example of how unfettered capitalism views ""labor"" as just an expense item with little regard for the fact that these are people. And these people do buy chickens.

The company pays their entry employees 14 bucks an hour while the top 6 executives made $38.5 million or an average of $3,183 per hour (6 people at 252 workdays per year and an 8 hour day.)

2021-11-04 14:34,"i think it is relevant that Tyson is enforcing the vaccine mandate.

BUT ehhhh, I think this story is missing a lot of unforgivable history on management's part-very much a part of the pandemic story. The former president deemed workers ""essential"" so they had to continue to work in close quarters with others--so bad that by July 10,000 of its workers had covid. Were they given sick leave? There were lawsuits for wrongful deaths.
This story needs a re-write: how bad was problem for the workers in the early days of the pandemic? How many died?  There are wrongful death lawsuits related to the company's handling of the pandemic-what is their status? When the USDA allowed Tyson employees to become inspectors (instead of using USDA inspectors) who was monitoring the chicken coop? The foxes. 

These reporters failed to provide readers with the full context of this company's poor management during the pandemic."
2021-11-04 14:34,"Workplace COVID-19 vaccination mandates work and save lives.  Just like hard hats, safety goggles and other workplace mandates, the COVID-19 vaccines have been proven to be safe, life saving tools in this pandemic.  Two of our older grandchildren work at a local Navy shipyard.  Both work in close contact and confined quarters with other workers.  Fortunately, both our older grandchildren were inoculated with a COVID vaccine in mid June, 2021.  Both grandchildren experienced very mild breakthrough COVID infections despite the inoculations in late August.  Both grandchildren are alive and well today because the vaccines did their job.  One of the older grandsons has two children ages 2 and 6.  Neither of these children were infected by our older grandson.  The vaccines protect both the person, their family, and their friends.  I know because I have directly witnessed the miracles of these vaccines on a very personal level."

Saving your worker's lives isn't the right thing to do? And how about your local community? How many people died that didn't have to? I recently visited Saranac Lake, NY home of the Saranac Laboratory Museum for TB research. There were no vaccines. People suffered and died.

His irrational barrier is so high he refuses even to be tested, much less hospitalized. He is quite ill, and I worry for his life. When I read stories about dying people in hospitals denying with their last breaths that it was Covid killing them, I thought they had to be hyperbolic exaggerations. Hopefully my pal will pull through, but I now have witnessed and been confounded by how real this set of beliefs is with some people."

And Calvin Miller, he felt “betrayed” and wants our sympathy too.

Hey y’all! You know what? I feel disgusted by these people’s behavior and selfishness."
2021-11-04 14:58,"What is so hard to understand here? Whether you oppose or welcome mandates it seems pretty clear that how 'mandatory' they truly are per individual, like so many other things, is dependant on social class and privilege.  And empowering private employers to make this decision only amplifies the inequity: people who have few other employment options are more likely to comply with mandates.

The sooner that we can all disabuse ourselves of the notion that corporations care about people generally and their employees specifically, the better off we will all be. Tyson has done nothing laudable here - they are simply protecting their profit with mandates. Just as they protected their profit during the height of the pandemic by declaring themselves 'essential' and forcing their workers to work shoulder to shoulder before a vaccine was even available.  Meat processing plants are notoriously awful to work in not just because of the inherent unpleasantness of the work but the brutality of their working conditions and heartlessness of their management. 

Did any of you catch what the Union traded to Tyson in exchange for the Union's support of vaccine mandates? PAID SICK TIME FOR WORKERS. That's right, the union had to negotiate for that. Even though workers coming in sick because they can't afford to lose a day's pay is exactly how disease is spread. So no paid sick time AND a wage so low that a day without pay will break you. 

Excuse me if I don't give Tyson a round of applause here."

2021-11-04 14:54,"Mandates do work to protect everyone from the ravages of Covid19. Regardless of the attempts by evil politicians to put their political agendas ahead of the health and well-being of their constituents, mandates can overcome the ignorance of those who believe the word of evil-doers on social media apps and right-wing broadcast media by forcing people to get vaccinated against their ungrounded fears and for their own health as well as the health of all with whom they come into contact. Anti-vax promoters should be prosecuted for their treasonous behavior."

2021-11-04 14:03,"“It was just something personal,”-- says a formerly resistant employee. What does that MEAN? It's an empty statement, without thought or reasoning, a knee-jerk reaction. And so many people still say the equivalent of this. I can't wrap my head around it. It's an unthinking response by someone without the mental energy to actually THINK or analyze. It's what students get away with in schools, when never challenged to use a critical argument to defend a position. It's lazy and deadly these days. Why don't people think anymore? They just feel, believe. It's not the same thing. Look at the schools first.

They do a sober business analysis and conclude the  obvious -- mandating vaccines for employees is profitable for the business.  It really is more a comment on human nature than politics that Trump and the anti-vaxxers were able to get so many Republicans to self-injure.  Even while Trump was the reactionary right were screaming about how horrible vaccines were, they themselves made sure they were first in line to get the Pfizer, and even before vaccines, people like Trump were being monitored and tested every day so they could take full advantage of the cocktail of miracle drugs available only to elite, rich people."

""...She now thinks that, considering the stakes, her resistance had been “selfish.”

One of the biggest problems facing America is the *epidemic* of selfishness and self-centeredness in people. Too bad there's no vaccine for that. I know they've changed what's taught in schools a lot since I went, but when did they add ""It's all about you"" to the curriculum?

""My rights are being violated!"" ""You're infringing on my freedumb!""

News flash: You would have no rights, nor any real freedom if millions of people before you hadn't given up some of theirs for the greater good. And what's even more infuriating is that most of these ""freedumb lovers"" calling themselves ""true patriots"" who love the flag and our armed forces! Really? Millions of truly brave men and women have put their lives at risk, and tens of thousands lost their life or suffered serious injuries so that these ""sunshine patriots"" could be free and continue to whine about their rights being violated.

It's a nasty looking long needle (which actually just causes a quick little pinch).  Even people like me who got the shots as soon as they were available and aren't particularly needle phobic couldn't help but shudder a little bit at those never ending needle punctures.  There is a lot of nonsense out there justifying vaccination hesitation or avoidance.  How many of those people yapping about Freedumb are really just terrified of needles and are further discouraged by seeing them every night on the local news?  It sure sounds like the woman who had ""personal reasons"" to avoid vaccination might just have been scared of needles but was more scared of becoming jobless or getting sick.  As for the guy who quit rather than get vaccinated, there is always the old saying ""You can't cure stupid"". There is way more stupid in this country right now than ever before and most of the worst of it is being encouraged by the cult that is led by Trump and pushed by his slavish followers in the Republican Party."

Plant workers died of covid waiting for her deeply reported story to be published by NYT, and instead of a narrative centering the deficient labor conditions of vulnerable workers we get this industry puff piece. 

Loss of local newspapers is only half the story of what’s wrong with our media - just as important is the consolidation of power in institutions like NYT that renders them unwilling or unable to challenge power themselves.

The former president deemed meatpacking workers ""essential"" so they had to continue to work in close quarters with others--so bad that by July 10,000 of  Tyson's workers had covid. Were they given PAID sick leave? There were lawsuits for wrongful deaths.
This story needs a re-write: how bad was problem for the workers in the early days of the pandemic? How many died?  What is the status of the wrongful deaths? When the USDA allowed Tyson employees to become inspectors (instead of using USDA inspectors) who was monitoring the quality of the food distributed to Americans??????  
This story makes me so annoyed--why start a story about a company that was a horror show during lockdown with a pitiful comment about the sleepless nights of  its new corporate head pondering a vaccination mandate.
These reporters failed. And where were the biz editors to set them back on course?"
2021-11-04 15:28,"If the Tyson employees had followed the science and medical recommendations, Tyson wouldn't have had to effect a mandate. There would have been enough of the employees vaccinated to reduce the infection rate. It was their intransigence that led to the mandate. Good for Tyson for looking out for the employees as well as their bottom line. More employers should understand that a healthy workforce leads to more productivity."

Second, they ended  up giving out more wages increases and benefits due to obtaining  union support, which is what they should do always.  But most importantly protecting jobs,  the  economy,  the health care system from collapse, life in general and the economic machine IS the purpose of vaccines. That's why everyone needs to get it, and it is  why Biden  is forcing it, and why Republicans didn't want lockdowns, which now   they can't fight if they would just accept the alternative and  get a  vaccine."

Tyson only acted to protect their bottom line not the people working on the lines.

“Instead of addressing the clear indications that workers were contracting the coronavirus at alarming rates due to conditions in meatpacking facilities, meatpacking companies prioritized profits and production over worker safety, continuing to employ practices that led to crowded facilities in which the virus spread easily."""

Once the media got ahold of the story, Tyson (who does not want cameras and newspeople poking around their processing plants in the best of times) made a push to be the responsible corporate citizens they should have been from the very beginning...how noble. It's like the Triangle Shirt Waist Factory owners putting in sprinklers after the devastating fire then proclaiming they are the champion of worker safety.

I agree. I'm no Tyson fan myself, the I think the company has much to atone for from its early pandemic days. But that misses the main point of this piece, which is to use Tyson's success -- for individual workers and the company alike -- with an employee vaccination mandate as a possible template for other companies to follow. In all probability, the other entities needing to implement similar measures are not angelic either. 

United Airlines likewise has a vaccination mandate, as do many hospitals and healthcare systems -- all with significant uptake, despite different worker demographics. On the other hand, some public sector unions are resisting mandates.

His inexplicable decision to, not only to fail to provide the nation with competent medical advice, but to denigrate it instead, was not only heinous… but led to his re-election defeat! Scant solace to a first-world nation brought to its knees. 

This debacle from a President who supported the development of the vaccines necessary to end the pandemic… and who could have justifiably claimed credit, yet who chose to denigrate them instead endangered his own minions, prolonged the pandemic, and ultimately led to his own defeat. 

The depths of Trump perfidy have yet to be fully plumbed as he and his Party ask the nation for yet another chance to drag the nation into deeper distress… as if his past term wasn’t lethal enough!

He contracted COVID-19, was airlifted to a government hospital, pumped full of newly developed expensive antibodies, recovered, airlifted back to the White House… all at government expense. Then he ripped off his mask and proceed to deny, deny, deny. Oh yes, don’t trust the government that did all this for ME!

Trump did prove one thing… there is a large group of citizens bereft of common sense, virtue, or both."
2021-11-04 21:43,"Kudos to the Tysons of this world. They have discovered the intrinsic value of solidarity. Not new but still. The 'Three Musketeers' already claimed it via their celebrated ""all for one, one for all"" mantra. And it works beautifully! Just ask Covid-19, left wanting for human sacrifice at its disposal (as they say, stupidity remains in ample supply, especially nepharious when politicized 'a la Trump')."

2021-11-04 22:54,"Good news, as the decline in daily new cases is leveling off and looking to head back up again, from a much higher baseline than we saw in June. The behavior of this virus is hard to predict, with no indication of when its aggressive spread might abate. We’re lucky it’s not more lethal than it is; but it’s dangerous enough that a worldwide effort to get incidence back within reasonable bounds is in order, which means vaccinating here and abroad. I don’t know if health officials have established whether outright resistance to getting the shots, or just people having heard so much about Covid that they begin to view it as a routine presence they needn’t worry too much about, is behind the slack demand. The activism of last year wouldn’t have suggested it."
2021-11-04 23:35,"The quote from the woman who said she was relieved the company was ""taking the burden off of"" her making the choice says it all.

The minute you use the word choice, people will question whether to do something. We don't beg people to make the choice to buy auto insurance or wear seatbelts, and the vast majority of people don't give it a second thought, even if it's a pain to do both.

2021-11-05 0:30,"In a paragraph about people not getting vaccinated we read: ""part of it is, ‘I just simply don’t want you telling me what to do.’”

But yet employers ""tell you what to do"" all the time. It's part of being an employee. Sure, maybe certain aspects are negotiated, but basically, when you work for someone, they're telling you what to do."
2021-11-05 1:45,"""It was just something personal.""

That's rich.  Refusing to get a vaccine during a once-in-a-century pandemic is ""personal"" . . .  and I live in a state where women are forbidden from having power over their reproductive organs.  

Tyson made the right decision here.  But it's also true that the corporation practices wanton cruelty every day, putting innocent animals to death in horrific conditions.  I have not bought commercially raised meat or poultry in years.  If you want animals to die for your plate, at least pay for them to be raised and slaughtered in the most humane way possible."
2021-11-05 3:46,"I'm glad this mandate encouraged so many Tyson employees to be vaccinated. As someone who advocated for employees here in Eastern Washington during the beginning of the pandemic, I'm having a hard time admiring their stance. In the first wave, they were hesitant to protect their employees here as COVID spread through the employees and their families. Locally, they put ads in the paper bragging about their sick leave policy, while initially paying only 60% of an employee's wage for sick leave, and requiring the employees to navigate a complex path to apply for the funds in a short-term disability scheme. Not sick leave, as middle class professionals expect, at all. They briefly increased the percentage they paid, but also paid an attendance bonus that encouraged folks to work sick. These employees are/were refugees and immigrants who need this work and whose lack of English made the whole situation both more difficult and dangerous. Not a fan of Tyson's corporate citizenship."
2021-11-05 1:20,"Amazing.

2021-10-28 13:29,"I agree that the ""no Covid"" policy in China comes at great cost.  One point not mentioned in the article:  China has completely wrecked its international tourism industry.  It's not likely to return for many years, if ever.  Look at the extreme restrictive measures it requires of participants for the upcoming Olympics."
2021-10-28 13:34,"Two take-aways:

1. By holding to this zero policy, Xi is training Chinese to fear and obey without question the government.

2. This policy will continue to wreck havoc with supply chains and production.    Hopefully, this continued supply problem will compel democratic nations to be serious about forming trading blocks with enforced rules."
2021-10-28 13:39,"""Xi Jinping, China’s leader, has repeatedly pointed to the country’s success in containment as proof of the superiority of its governance model.""

2021-10-28 13:42,"The irony of the country of origin for this pandemic being the one which is still trying for zero Covid and has had probably the most successful program to minimize the impact of the virus. Take from that what you will but one can see how conspiracy theories would become prevalent on was this an accident or intentional, was it natural or done in the lab when the country where almost all seem to agree it started is the one which has been least impacted by it based on cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and hit to the economy. Personal freedoms really do not count because any freedom citizens have is it at the discretion of the government."
2021-10-28 13:46,"China can afford the huge cost of lockdowns.  Surely, since they can afford it, rooting out covid19 and its variants is the best choice.

2021-10-28 13:48,"One question I never see asked by reporters such as yourself, is -- if China is keeping everything locked down and managing this virus so well, how can cases keep popping up in various areas around the country?

You've either got it under control or you don't. The continuing presence of the virus makes it clear that there is an undercurrent of infection in China that is either going untracked or unreported to the outside world.

Push back against their PR and ask some real questions."
2021-10-28 14:08,"""The government has staked its political legitimacy on controlling the virus better than other countries"" -- Too bad they weren't thinking that way back in December 2019 and January 2020."
2021-10-28 14:04,"Naturally, there are substantial costs with the current policy, and its justification diminishes with increased spread of vaccination through the country, but several million Chinese are alive today precisely because of ""zero covid"".  Trillions of dolllars of production would have been lost versus the billions due to targeted lockdowns and other health measures.  Western eyes see what they want to see through the lenses of sour grapes."
2021-10-28 14:09,"In the end vaccination is the only reasonable way out.  Lockdowns, hygiene restrictions and efforts, and mass quarantines where meant to be a bridge to effective vaccinations not the final solution.

Also this policy will probably hasten the movement of  critical manufacturing/finance/business out of China.

So there is a silver lining."

The Free World, of course, does not possess that dictatorial power. Therefore, the Chinese are going to claim superiority over the West in inhibiting the Covid virus. If you are Chinese that arm twisting probably does not give any pleasure, just psychic pain at their loss of electoral freedom."

2021-10-28 15:29,It stands to reason since it started there. It mysteriously and certainly wasn't contained in late 2019 and was even attempted to be covered up. We should be cautiously skeptical of any data that comes from there as well.
2021-10-28 15:48,"We've only seen Delta yet. There may be more virulent strains down the road. China knows how hard it was to keep things under control. It is wise to be cautious about it. The only thing it is missing out on are foreign tourists and tourism is a net outflow for China so they are in no rush to open up. 

The only thing I hope they do is to open up the HK border already. Unlike China, HK is a tiny place and the cost of border controls are much more severe."

This article fits the author's pre-conceived narrative of: ~you have to choose between human rights or covid control~ and ignores the real world reality that there's a vibrant democractic self governing island just off the coast of China that has done even better than China at Covid control without sacrificing human rights. Taiwan may not say they're are persuing covid zero, but that is definitely what they have achieved. Population 23 million, deaths under 1,000, cases under 20,000, no significant local transmission for almost the entire pandemic, and no major lockdowns or restrictions of freedoms.

China government has hid more than 30,000 deaths just in Wuhan, according to the same sources of the Wuhan funeral homes. So what about everywhere else in the whole country?

2021-10-28 15:30,"This entire article accept on its face the Chinese statistics.
China covered up the initial outbreak; greatly under-reported (based on serological tests) the number of infections in Wuhan alone. And based its approach on a variant of martial law.
Yet the article has little in the way of balancing its decriptions of the Chinese ""miracle."""
2021-10-28 15:33,If this happened in America no state would ever work in tandem with the federal government to lock up journalists and scientists reporting on an emerging novel virus wiping out thousands of people and refusing to notify the international community in a timely manner. Even if you don’t want to believe the lab accident theory (which it totally was a lab accident not some wet market lie that China sold to the world initially) the virus had been spreading internally in China for months. The global community needs to hold them accountable by working together on applying pressure on the regime from all angles .
2021-10-28 15:36,Would be nice if they put in half as much effort in preventing it from happening in the first place.
2021-10-28 15:32,"One thing about this pandemic: it's provided a fascinating real world experiment in political science. We have gotten to see the strengths and the weaknesses of every system from totalitarian autocracy to socialism to rip-roaring capitalism. So far - and it's not over 'till it's over - autocracy started strong but began to wheeze in the backstretch. Unfettered capitalism fell on its face in terms of controlling spread but made a comeback  with effective vaccines, and socialism is still in the lead. Right wing ""populism"" shot itself in the head. That means you, Brazil and Montana."
2021-10-28 15:52,"The Chinese have a lot more potential risk with its mega cities, high density and uneven medical care.  If China had suffered the US death rate, they would have seen nearly 3 million deaths.  Small cities in China are bigger than most US cities.  They may have had to take extraordinary efforts.  With that said, I would not want to live under totalitarianism whether its dressed in Chinese Red or Confederate Grey.

The USA approach to a national emergency was a sad story of unforced errors.  A free society made up of ""rational"" people could have taken aspects of the Chinese approach and reduced its death count from 750,000.  Unfortunately, the lack of trust in anything approaching government prevents the USA from getting anything done except a run on horse medication.  750,000 deaths was a disaster and a failure."
2021-10-28 15:10,Except Taiwan has done better than China and any other country for that matter over the course of the past two years. No government lockdowns required.
2021-10-28 15:14,"It's pretty simple. China has the ability to force everyone to get the vaccine. They can force people to mask or stay home. They can track people, and they can imprison anyone who doesn't comply for as long as they want."
2021-10-28 15:35,"Though the Chinese government is awful in many important ways, one does wonder if all countries had taken this extreme approach back in spring of 2020, would we have knocked this disease out right then, and not be dealing with alpha, beta, gamma, delta (!), ... variants?  4 or 5 weeks of major inconvenience, might have prevented years of inconvenience along with so many deaths."
2021-10-28 15:00,"""Zero Covid"" simply must be the goal.  It is much harder to achieve now because of the stupidity and denialism entrenched in the US and, to a lesser degree, in other parts of the world.  Also, a lack of international trust and an abundance of corporate greed have dampened the global response at critical decision points.

On a per-capita basis, even accounting for China's PR obfuscation, their outcomes still put ours to shame, so ""zero Covid"" is more than a propaganda tool.  Human beings, and Americans in particular, are notoriously bad at quantifying problems and assessing risk.  We are talking about a disease that, in less than two years, has become our third leading cause of death.  It is not just another flu strain.  No one argues for a goal of ""some measles"" or ""just living with lung cancer,"" so why is Covid any different?"
2021-10-28 15:47,Taiwan is at zero COVID right now
2021-10-28 15:55,"Why China is World's Last 'ZERO COVID' holdout? 5 reasons

1) China was better prepared for COVID because it had institutional wisdom from handling SARS-CoV-1.
2) China's brief lock downs were strictly enforced. China could scale up its quarantine and hospitalization facilities on a short notice.
3) China after SARS-CoV-1 enforced temperature checks at all entry points into China.
4)People of CHINA uniformly wore proper masks properly during the pandemic and well before the pandemic.
5) China's approach to infectious diseases has been multi-pronged and included traditional Chinese medicine. In short China did everything possible to boot COVID out of China. 

Too bad it landed on every continent and surprised unprepared inhabitants around the rest of the world. 

I have visited China 6 times during this century and once towards the end of the last century and I saw a big difference in observance of common sense safety precautions in this century. Not only does it have an outstanding business infrastructure, it has also built a reasonably stout health care infrastructure. I happened to see some dark spot in my eye after visiting Shao Lin temple a few miles from Zhengzhou in Henan province, the birth place of Kung fu and I flew to Shanghai and felt that I needed to get my eyes checked to rule out a detached retina and luckily there was a hospital nearby and it had a qualified ophthalmologist who promptly examined me.

China's one party rule does a lot to stake its legitimacy."
2021-10-28 16:28,"Part of the problem, however, is that some of China's policies are illogically strict. 

For example, Chinese citizens trying to return to China from abroad are treated as if they are unvaccinated (even if they have actually been vaccinated), because the Chinese government does not want to acknowledge that western vaccines work better than the Chinese-made vaccine. 

So Chinese citizens who want to return to China are being forced to quarantine in a hotel room for 21 days even if they are fully vaccinated. 

And that's keeping a lot of Chinese citizens from coming home."
2021-10-28 16:42,"Even if they lock down international travel, there still are a hundreds of foreign workers arriving daily in sea ports and airports.  How do they contain the spread from these travelers?"
2021-10-28 16:59,"New data are emerging that suggest that people in the US that had received multiple flu vaccinations in the past had some protection against Covid-19 infection.

If this is confirmed, one corollary is that populations that have experienced a broader  range of coronaviruses over time likely have some protection also.

This would explain why China, Australia, the Philippines, and Japan all show covid numbers well below the US/Italy/France.

it doesn’t line up with economics, public health infrastructure, genetics.

It doesn’t mean that lockdown and monitoring have not helped in these places also.  But the t does mean the scope of the problem was different to begin with."
2021-10-28 16:12,"If the Chinese government had not been engaging in negligent and irresponsible behavior, the entire world would have had ""Zero Covid"" for the past 2 years. As a matter of fact, Covid would never occurred."
2021-10-28 16:12,China is a kleptocratic dictatorship. How are we to trust ANY figures it presents regarding pandemic performance?
2021-10-28 16:16,"This entire piece is predicated on reported Covid statistic coming out of China.
Reliable numbers were the first in lockdown.
Here is why:
• If you are a factory manager and report cases of Covid you will lose your job because it is your fault. 
• If you are a public administrator - municipal, county, provincial government official and report cases you will loose you job and all your privileges.
• Anybody who comments negatively regarding the response gets a knock on the door.
The CCP manipulates economic and population data to suit its own needs. Even the population numbers are inflated. The 2020 census figures were about to show a decline in population until the CCP cooked the numbers to show slight growth."
2021-10-28 16:22,"Zero COVID is a fantastic news and it is doable provided the peoples are disciplined willingly or by force. In democracy, the citizens can not be forced for their wellbeing even. The whole world is shocked to see American anti Vaxx aggressive movements. After the death of more than 700,000 Americans, we refused to learn anything. This is our stupidity and denial to the facts. Anti Vaxx peoples doing harm to themselves and to other peoples around them and they do not have the right to harm others."
2021-10-28 16:32,"I guess here in the home of the brave and the land of the free, we'll be living - and dying - with C-19 forever. (With a cohort of about 30% anti-vaxers) Total C-19 deaths in China: < 5,000. In the US: > 741,000 and counting. 

Freedom ain't free..."
2021-10-28 16:37,"Many things: 1) The virus started in China, likely in a lab, and was covered up, because in Mainland it's more important not to offend or create ""instability"" (i.e., any comment against authority) than to deal in facts; 2) We will never know the real death rate in Mainland, based on the previous point; 3) That said, they have done a good job of controlling things through lockdowns and a public that follows directions; 4) The US has been an absolute disaster, in large part due to poor education standards, strange beliefs about ""freedom"", a poorly devised and dysfunctional health care system, and the politicization of illness by a total moron and his party; 5) If the US had simply taken the virus seriously through certain true lockdowns and universal masking, there might be a few thousand dead instead of 700,000+, an inexcusable number--being in the US for the last few months, I can see that few people still take it seriously--the US has an inability to learn; 6) Meanwhile in Hong Kong, where I work, insane quarantine rules are in place, whereby when I return to HK I must pay to isolate in a single hotel room without an opening window for 21 days. This does nothing to contain the virus. Around 98% or more cases have been caught within 3 days of quarantine. This is part of the reason that so many people are fleeing HK, along with the move toward authoritarianism. People are still wearing masks everywhere when there's effectively no Covid."
2021-10-28 16:16,"This is easy to understand.  With 1.4 billion population, China is a densely populated country.  In a way, it is like city of New York that people are everywhere.  Social distance is difficult. Any virus occurrence will result in fast spreading and costly to track potential infections. Small and local lockdowns may become necessary.  Productions will be affected and most likely reduced.

In addition, China is not a rich country compared to many other developed countries.  It costs a lot to vaccinate the majority of population.  Additional booster shots will add more. China prefers not to have the third shot for its people. We can print money to pay for these expenses, but the Chinese government doesn't like to do that.  They prefer stop the virus spreading for good.

Lastly, Beijing will host the 2022 Winter Olympics.  They don't want to have another Tokyo Olympics that causing problems to people and athletes.   They prefer world class  athletes can compete in a good, safe and comfortable environment that true winners will emerge."
2021-10-28 16:28,"This article considers that China's vaccine might not be as effective as others, which could be a reason they haven't relaxed the lock downs.  The Times article linked below was interesting on that point.  If indeed having a poor vaccine is the reason the lockdowns persist, then China would have to choose either to re-inoculate everyone with a vaccine that works, or continue their lockdowns.  Either way, China would normally be looking for someone else to blame or a way to distract their people from anger at the government.  How they accomplish that distraction is cause for concern.  Review their past history when leadership changes, which is probably a mild example of what could be next.

2021-10-28 16:29,"If there's ever been an argument for China's authoritarian approach to covid management, it's America's failed ""live free, die stupid"" approach. However, I would argue (as does this article) that it's time to step away from the draconian city-wide lockdowns. Contact tracing I'd keep. If China wants to most benefit from authoritarianism, they need to switch to draconian vaccination drives. Imagine this: every year, America spends $10b dealing with localized covid breakouts and China spens $0b. 

Assuming, of course, that China's confident in its vaccine. . . ."
2021-10-28 16:47,"respectfully- Prof. Ong’s comment that “the regime thinks…”  is not helpful.  A “regime” can’t think.

Who are the deciders in a given city or province?  I’m guessing this is understood and should be shared.

Seems like Xi has been grading his regional leaders by their covid infection numbers and they are imposing lockdowns in an attempt to keep their jobs.  I’m not sure that the opinions of people on the street enter into it at all.  It’s pretty clear that the city and regional leaders have no problem personally attacking anyone who disagrees with their actions on this - so assuming that they are in any way “following” public opinion seems unsupported.

The situation in China is getting progressively more draconian- 
- internment camps for anyone who seems to be thinking for themselves 
- business leaders disappearing for extended periods and returning subdued and fearful
-  demonstration of any kind crushed and the participants given long sentences in a brutal penal system 

Add to this a populace that is holding on to it’s money tighter than ever, slowing growth of the economy and a looming ￼real estate bubble …

Does this equate with Xi feeling more and more secure in his position?"
2021-10-28 17:39,"In every dystopian book or movie the ""downfall"" began when the authorities used a legitimate emergency or situation to apply methods and practices that people even in China would not easily stand still for.

2021-10-28 17:18,This article certainly works hard to find every conceivable negative word it can to describe a country that admirably fulfilling its duty to protect its own people from the ravages of a deadly virus.
2021-10-28 16:42,"""But experts — both in China and abroad — have warned that the approach is unsustainable."" 

First of all, there are no real ""experts"" as nobody really knows. What we do know is that COVID has devastating consequences for many and that each infection represents a chance of producing a new and worse variant. At least in China, it isn't like it is here in America where every fool with a vote is an ""expert"" and where 700,000 people have died. 

They don't have to sustain what they are doing forever. They want to buy time. We would all have benefitted from that approach but many places, especially the US, didn't have the fortitude. Time allows for the development and administration of vaccines. Time allows for the development of effective treatments. Restrictions can be gradually relaxed once COVID can be tamed. This is the way to save human lives. This is the path that China has chosen. A government that cannot, or will not, protect the lives of its' citizens is not a legitimate government.   Yes, the CCP under Mao did a pretty awful job, but that was then, this is now. Here in America, my government can't seem to get people masked and vaccinated or, for that matter, guns out of the hands of the insane."
2021-10-28 17:17,"I wondered what today's article demonizing China would be. Here we have it. This is getting really worrisome. Over the past few years, the efforts of the NYT and other Western media outlets to demonize everything China does seems part of a concerted propaganda campaign. A few months back, there was an article on how people in China were attacking Western reporters for focusing on the negatives in the country's response to recent flooding. It is not hard to understand their frustration. A truly objective evaluation of China would examine the many amazing accomplishments of that country over an incredibly brief period of time, as well as the real costs of such enormous economic and technological achievement. The Communist Party of China has been very effective at raising the standard of living and the possibilities of a good life for hundreds of millions of people. At the same time, it is not averse to using force to achieve many of its goals.

But a truly honest comparison would note the many ways in which Western states - especially the US - resort to violence and breaches of international law in their foreign policies. Such a comparison would also note the many ways in which the US is a corrupt and failing democracy. I don't expect any such balanced reporting from the NYT, but I am disheartened by what I see as clear efforts to create a new Cold War by obfuscating and misrepresenting the other side."
2021-10-28 17:15,"I am so tired of the endless China bashing that our government and media has engaged in. It is counterproductive at best and dangerous at worse. By focusing on scapegoating China, we have on both conscious and unconscious levels reinforced the perception of China as ""other"". I believe that this has been part of the reason that our response has been so delayed and inadequate. Remember the ""relief"" when this hit Italy because then we would get some ""real"" information and see how a modern Western nation could successfully deal with Covid without resorting to the ""draconian"", ""totalitarian"" and ""Maoist"" strategies employed by China. Then to our astonishment and horror, we saw this thing literally steamroll Italy. Oops. It really doesn't matter what China publicly said, they gave us a step by step playbook of how to handle this. What they did to contain and mitigate was literally visible by satellite and based on sound reasoning and science. If we did not see them as ""other"" we would have appreciated the severity of the threat sooner and would have followed their, now proven, strategies. We are blaming them for our own failures and continuing to do so will jeopardize the global cooperation that is required to deal with this and future pandemics."
2021-10-27 11:27,"This could easily become the next ""Chronic Lyme Disease"" conundrum, which eventually devolved into more of a philosophical dispute than a medical one. 

It is very difficult under SSA to establish a physical disability on the basis of symptoms alone."
2021-10-27 11:24,"The ssa is barely functional anyway. As the American population aged, and applicants grew, both parties whittled ssa staff down by ten percent. This country has to get real about how it has destroyed its bureaucracy, before it complains about that bureaucracy, as the right always does. I pity the long-covid applicants to a broken system. This would not happen in Europe."
2021-10-27 11:24,"“With no direct medical evidence of her condition, she has been turned down for disability coverage twice. Even a note from a prestigious post-Covid clinic in the Mount Sinai hospital system, attesting that Ms. Taveras “continues to experience daily symptoms and is currently unable to work,” was not enough.”

I don’t understand why this is possible. I know this agency must be careful not to award benefits without justification. But a letter like this should have been enough. Disability is awarded only for a year at first, then reconsidered. How is someone who can barely function supposed to live with no income at all?"
2021-10-27 11:35,"I also have long COVID. It is awful, but  I am very lucky as I did get a positive COVID test and have other medical tests (cardiology tests) that prove it. For almost 9 months I could barely do anything, walking up stairs was exhausting and I was a very fit young women who biked to work each day, played in a football league and did yoga twice a week. After COVID I lost all of that. It was very depressing and only now 18 months later have I been able to even think about exercising again. I still have an irregulat heart rate and POTS symptoms and I have no idea, if it will ever go away.

I am lucky as I have a research position now and it requires no physical effort and I can work from home. I am lucky since I do not have bad brain fog (I had it before but not as severe as others). I am lucky since I live in Europe and have free healthcare.

I am lucky that I had an unusual rash due to covid and hence doctors believed me and I talked my way into the very first long covid clinic and into seeing the best lung specialist. They were able to find the cause for my ongoing symptoms by heart rate issue. I am on meds for this but they dont work.

I am lucky that I can still work and that I work full time, despite long covid.  

But so many people are not so lucky. We must advocate for them. We must fund and research long covid. 

NYT- can you tell us where to send our donations for long covid research, advocacy and support for sufferers?"
2021-10-27 11:39,"Without a lawyer, chances of getting Social Security disability benefits are close to zero. Lawyers typically get 25% of past benefits, which cover at least a year, because that's how long it takes. We should not need ;awyers to get what is our right, and if we do, the government should pay their fees."
2021-10-27 12:00,"A good friend of mine (55) is struggling with ongoing fatigue and a nasty cough 10+ months after his Covid infection. Another friend's son (18) is struggling with ongoing fatigue, brain fog and chest pain a year after his asymptomatic Covid infection. And a coworker (60) has such severe fatigue nearly a year after her infection that the slightest bit of physical exertion leaves her utterly drained. She says the vaccinations helped her  brain fog and fatigue somewhat. It's a big problem. Long Covid is scary. I wish all sufferers well."
2021-10-27 11:59,"The American system is unique in its cruelty. If you’re sick, it’s all your fault. Even kids who got cancer. Since care is not guaranteed, it’s easier to blame the person than actually try to help them. All the wars fought. All the trillions made here. To get us what exactly? These are uniquely American choices. One of these women lost her home and entire retirement savings. The other woman was clearly hanging by a thread before Covid. 700,000 dead and it still hasn’t changed anything about the industry. Long Covid is here to stay. This shouldn’t be so hard. Americans are some of the hardest working folks in the world. What do we get for our efforts?"

Good luck. And good luck living on $1200 month. America.  Yay."
2021-10-27 12:45,"Perhaps people with difficult to diagnose diseases such as long Covid, myalgic encephalomyelitis, fibromyalgia, and so on be awarded federal disability protections and benefits without the assumption they are trying to defraud the government. Then if the government believes an individual has, with intent, applied for benefits falsely the government must prove it. Isn’t that the standard use when corporate executives are suspected of defrauding the government?

Said differently, in the case of long Covid the requirement to prove something that is very expensive and difficult to prove is pushed on to people who lack the means and ability to prove they are disabled. On the other hand when fraud is suspected to have been committed by corporate executives, lawyers, politicians, and so on the burden to prove intent to defraud is shifted from the individual to the government. 

It is clear in this country the wealthy and powerful are given the benefit of doubt while working people, such as those with long Covid, are suspected of trying to commit fraud if they apply for benefits.

So it goes in the land where laws and regulations are intended protect the rich and connected while assuming anyone applying for disability benefits is intending to defraud the government."

2021-10-27 12:15,"Unfortunately, people with long Covid are discovering what many people with chronic illness have known for a long time: qualifying for Social Security Disability is a frustrating process designed to initially reject applicants and usually requires applying several times before getting approved. It's a broken system in desperate need of reform.

And I won't even get into the 2 year wait for Medicare after finally getting approved for Disability."
2021-10-27 12:53,"One of my brothers is permanently disabled. 

He suffered a stroke several years ago, in his 40s which paralyzed his right side, damaged his vision, and caused major memory loss. 

He only managed to regain very limited use of his right leg and still cannot use his right arm or hand at all. 

He also has a long and well documented history of schizophrenia, which left him unable to work for years before his stroke. 

Clearly he's disabled and will never be able to work again. 

It took a full year for him to be approved for SSI, despite him residing in a nursing facility the entire time. 

The system truly is broken."
2021-10-27 12:39,"I have Environmental Illness and am receiving disability benefits, so I know more than a little bit about the difficulty these people are having with getting their condition recognized! What is needed for Long Covid, as well as for other long-term undiagnosable medical conditions that have system-wide symptoms, is a shift in thinking. We need to widely recognize that there are many mysteries relating to human health that we simply cannot explain yet. How about a code, like CUBBS - Chronic Undiagnosable Broken Body Syndrome? Then the unlucky sufferers won't receive the additional injury of being insulted as malingerers, on top of being ill, impoverished, without useful employment, and unable to move around normally in the world."
2021-10-27 12:46,"Comments appear to be shaming long haulers for their pre-existing conditions.  I’m unclear why the lack of compassion for anyone affected whether or not they were headed for trouble. At some point, all of us will have a pre-existing condition that causes death. It’s called life. We’re in a pandemic and if we could show each other humanity, it might help solve a lot of ills and get us out of this mess."
2021-10-27 12:35,"As someone recovering from long covid, it goes without saying how frustrating it is to continually come up against institutions that continue to deny what this disease has the capacity do to those stricken with it. From the onset of the pandemic when no one even spoke publicly about post viral infection as a real and serious outcome of this disease to people still assuming that pre existing conditions are what is triggering a post viral reaction to covid (nearly one third of people who get covid will get long covid studies suggest. And like myself many of those people were in excellent health prior).  

Why does the general public and institutions deny needed assistance and support to those who are unlucky enough to experience this illness? Why not provide the support necessary for their recovery? Biden has already acknowledged this condition and it shouldn’t take much for institutions and employers to follow suit. The effort it took for the last administration to deny that there was even a pandemic/that covid was an issue…..should lead us all in a new direction… To end this pandemic and champion the research and push institutions to help us recovering from this illness. These bigger philosophical questions should be asked of everyone, if we are actually going to provide the care and resources necessary to help others."
2021-10-27 13:08,"This is a road that should not be taken by the US government.   To prove COVID disability would be almost impossible unless a person was hospitalized.   What about the tens of thousands who weren't hospitalized 
due to lack of testing or lack of available beds and staff during the darkest times of the pandemic?  Doctors would have to take employment into consideration when evaluating people for disability.  This suggestion must wait until another day.  Biden has too much on his plate now working to get this country going again."

2021-10-27 13:28,"I feel sorry for this woman, but I think we need to draw the line on allowing disability payments based on long Covid, otherwise the system will be swamped with millions of requests. There have been more than 45 million COVID cases in the US, and that number will continue to grow. The symptoms of long COVID are so general that it would be impossible to distinguish between someone who is actually impaired to the point where they can’t work and those who aren’t. Lots of people are tired, but they still go to work. I’d rather see that money go towards finding the causes and cure for long COVID. Even before Covid, the number of people in this country applying for Social Security Disability has grown tremendously over the past 20 years. We need another solution than to just dole out more disability money."
2021-10-27 12:40,I'm shocked by the judgmental and unkind comments about people's weight. Would you have empathy if the people in the pictures were skinny?
2021-10-27 13:48,"Disability and retirement payments from Social Security are both based on how much you paid into the system while working. That’s why the yearly payments are limited, especially for low to middle income workers. Also, applications for disability are complex, computer based and many pages long. Medical documentation has to be precise for rapid (six months) awards. A tangled bureaucracy without adequate staff makes it worse. No easy solutions here, except for more money for workers that isn’t likely to happen anytime soon."
2021-10-27 13:00,"Diseases can initiate other diseases. Reiter's syndrome (reactive arthritis) is commonly preceded by a bacterial infection. Celiac (auto immune) disease appeared in me after contracting H1N1 from my brother years ago. My brother had autism and schizoid personality disorder; he wasn't able to get Federal disability until the work program he was in released him as unemployable. He received less than $1000/mo in disability and $75/mo in food stamps. It was a lot of work keeping him from being homeless; I didn't realize there was a law from the 1970's that stated a person on disability couldn't receive more than $20/mo. Anything more than that was owed back to the govt. He was honest about what I was sending him (thankfully for years, not the decades) so when he died he owed the Federal Govt more than $12000. I had to fill in hardship paperwork so that he only had $5/mo taken from his disability, not a much larger sum. The homeless and a lot of disabled people are invisible and dismissed."
2021-10-27 13:16,Thank you for continuing to shed light on the struggles of Long Covid. I have been diagnosed with PACS (almost a year now) and appreciate news sources continuing to tell the struggles that many of us are facing. Moving on from covid simply isn’t a reality for many.
2021-10-27 13:59,"Boy, it sure is a good thing we have a broken, dysfunctional health system.

2021-10-27 14:07,"The situation for those suffering long Covid is another illustration of our need for universal coverage.

2021-10-27 13:33,"This is a problem that people suffering from chronic disease of all types experience. My husband died of Multiple System Atrophy, one of the many neurodegenerative diseases no one’s heard of.

2021-10-27 14:26,"It is so sad to think that the majority of recently contracted Long COVID cases could have been prevented through vaccination. But not enough people are being vaccinated. This argues for urgent mandates, including for example a vaccination requirement to board an airplane, or dine indoors, or go to a concert. Otherwise, our medical system will continue to be stressed well into the future and corporations will see a substantial decline in productivity going forward."
2021-10-27 13:30,Yes that problem is widespread through all these government funded “help” organizations. Case in point is my late wife’s 9-11 victims compensation claim. After years of maneuvering through bureaucratic road blocks and moving goalposts all designed to discourage you and run out the clock a decision was finally rendered. For instance my wife got approved for free healthcare two weeks after she passed away. I then became the petitioner and the first thing that they say is we have a new attestation form so you have to fill out the form again and you can copy your statement word for word from the old form With great difficulty we tracked everyone down again and got them to redo their statements. Well that was months ago and now just resounding silence from the compensation board.
2021-10-27 14:02,"SSA changed the “physician rule.” It used to be that SSA gave deference to your treating medical provider’s opinion about your abilities. The new rule says that an SSA doctor who sees you one time has just as much power to determine your disability as the doctor you’ve seen for 20 years.

This is producing tragic results in the disability field, as this article evidences. A long-Covid specialist’s opinion about you has no more weight than a doctor SSA chooses to examine you. I’ve seen SSA contract with a doctor who was charged with defrauding the SSA/Medicare program and who paid a $1 million fine. This guy’s opinion trumped my client’s medical records. 

SSA needs to bring back the treating physician rule. Long-Covid is a perfect example of why claimants desperately need the rule revived."
2021-10-27 13:23,"Lessons Learned

Here is a brief history of my seven year battle for disability benefits with a private disability insurer (Insco)

Keep a diary of daily activity and have a partner keep one.
Note medications.

Note cognitive problems, they are often overlooked.

If you are ignored, get a lawyer. Start a legal action.
This means that the Insco will have to pay your legal fees
when you win. Most cases are settled out of court.

Inscos typically wait two years before they decide if they will
pay benefits.

Important reference

2021-10-27 15:21,"The problems for long covid sufferers, and I believe they exist, is two fold:1. Insurance companies don't like to pay out money when they can avoid it. Ask anyone who has tried to collect on a long term healthcare policy. Their policies are skillfully written to avoid payouts. 2. the lack of universally accepted criteria and objective findings in most of the conditions cited besides long covid ( I dissent on including Rheumatoid Arthritis in that grouping. It has a specific test positive in 50% and objective physical and lab findings). I believe ""brain fog"", I believe weakness exists in long covid but these are subjective symptoms, not objective findings like atrophy, hot joints with fluid in them ).

The similarities of long covid to chronic Lyme disease is painfully obvious. Both in terms of symptoms and lack of quality care or insurance coverage. 
I am an athlete and extremely health conscious with zero other Health issues. Yet when I had multiple ongoing symptoms that were unexplainable by Drs I was dismissed. My clinical presentation was Lyme disease symptoms but blood work for Lyme is so inaccurate and the CDC denies long term Lyme disease even exists. Totally corrupt system.

2021-10-27 14:43,"Thank you for this informative article. All aspects of our society and culture need to explore solutions to these long term consequences of illness. Of note: the medical community, in trying to study and treat prolonged symptoms after acute COVID 19 infection, have redefined the syndromes. Long COVID (or post acute COVID syndrome PACS) is defined as symptoms for 3-12 weeks after acute infection.  Chronic COVID is greater than 12 weeks. Just as an FYI"

I can tell you that there are MANY people fraudulently claiming that they are disabled, which raises the bar for people who really are disabled. The SSA has to insist on objective tests proving long term disability to weed out the fraudsters. If a long hauler is truly disabled, it should not be necessary for them to prove that they are permanently disabled."
2021-10-27 15:10,"This article raises an issue that has long been under reported regarding the abomination that is the disability process.  The process is designed to deny people the first time, as a lawyer advised me the first time I applied, after suffering an anomalous health crisis in 2015 that caused loss of my income, my very physical, people heavy profession, union job, benefits and marriage.  It is demoralizing and stressful on top of all of the other doctors’ appointments, tests, nightmare loads of bureaucratic paperwork and physical weaknesses, cognitive deficits, fatigue and emotional changes et al.   I worked 2 jobs most of my teenage and adult life for 28 years, paid off 2 educations and I paid into social security!  Despite loving support of friends, I still was harassed with judgements from so called friends & ex colleagues.  My health crisis is the worst thing that ever happened to me, for which I am still trying to rebuild my life and survive financially.  My union stewards, union biz agent and HR director (no surprise there) did ZERO to help me.  I did win my appeal for disability in 2017 nearly 2 years after my health event. It saddens me how disability is a downward spiral to poverty.  When CoVid hit the unemployment payouts were $2,400/month — more than I receive on disability. My payment is too high for Medicaid and food stamps.  Disability needs a major overhaul that is more humane, dignified and the payments need to be greatly increased!  Shameful in this country."
2021-10-27 17:25,"Covid symptoms have long reminded me of symptoms related to mutltiple sclerosis. Sometimes it is a matter of seeing the right specialist at a particular time, such as a flare up, and getting tests done at the right time. 

I had  MS symptoms at an early age but back then even MRIs were considered a new source of testing, they didn't get used more until the late 80s early 90s. Later MRIs would verify the disease but my first  real proof was found by an opthamologist and I found this happened with other MS patients. He found damage to my optic nerve.

In a demyelinating disease progression may not always be visible in the brain or spine in the early stages but the suffering is very real. Unfortunately many people do not have insurance that will cover the specialists they need to see or the yearly testing  they need to track their progress. 

I would say we need a Covid fund like we had for 911 but I am tired of all the niche coverage for selective groups. We just a national public option plan that everyone pays into and covers everyone."

Countless patients report fatigue, aching and general malaise after receiving the standard treatment for Lyme, which is one or two rounds of antibiotics. Anyone further requests for treatment are met with ""sorry, we've provided the prescribed treatment - nothing else to do here.""
Because extensive treatment is required for long-covid, patients will not receive it only because it is too expensive to provide. The health insurance industry strikes again."

I had followed all CDC recommendations.  I remained on our property as much as possible.  I often washed my hands and when I had to go to town, I wore a mask and even took a Clorox wipe out of its container in the truck of my car and took it with me when entering a store.  We stopped visiting friends and did not invite them to our home. 

Sadly, I still got sick and I was sick for about six weeks. Covid is exhausting but I was lucky, I was not hospitalized.  Since then, I have gotten three Moderna shots, including a booster this week. 

Why go over this?  I am a long-hauler.  I recovered in every way but my sense of smell.  The entire world now smells like a stall ashtray and I'm not even a smoker.  I cannot get rid of the smell.  It is something I have learned to live with but I know the earth smells better than what I am smelling and I hope eventually this goes away.

For those who have not gotten vaccinated.  Please do it.  What I am going through is nothing to what many people have gone through but it simply is not worth the chance of getting Covid."

Reasonable is subjective...but everyone has to agree there needs to be some standard."

My child had something like long covid for a time after some minor unidentified virus.  It wasn't easy, and without medical support, schools treat you like dirt and your child like a truant.

Doctors, often lousy statisticians, are probably more supportive now that post-viral issues are in the press. But they probably need some better guidance. It is not the case that tests always show us the answer - they only show us what was tested for.  

Good luck to all who are suffering."

But because she wasn't visibly disabled, didn't have anything that was testable, and therefore couldn't prove that she couldn't work, she was miserable and depressed about being tired, tired, and exhausted all the time.  

America is not kind to the chronically ill  who cannot work, those who need medical care they cannot afford, those who are caretakers, or those in need of care.  It's not a bug in our system.  It's a feature."

In the advertising business we call this: bait and switch. Promise them something wonderful then give them a far more inferior product at jacked up prices.

Bait and switch has one long term side effect: buyers remorse. This buyer has plenty of  remorse right now, so do millions of others and the democrats are about to see it avalanche onto them for at least 4 election cycles."

2021-10-27 17:39,Will getting vaccinated prevent long COVID if you get infected?  The answer is nobody knows for sure. But logically if you up with severe illness which is much more likely to do if your unvaccinated you are going to be more likely end up with long-term adverse effects like long COVID ( if you survive).  I have a few patients suffering long covid symptoms and are still miserable.  It is better to be vaccinated.
2021-10-27 14:25,No proof of long covid.  Disability requires physical proof which tests don’t confirm for her.  She can apply for welfare payments. Benefits need to have requirements which she doesn’t fill. Imagine letting anyone claim they are unable to work with no proof.
2021-10-27 18:01,"Disability is a spectrum, so the real question is where do we draw the line? I see patients who have had a minor foot injury and want to be declared disabled for life. Others have severe injuries or illness and are proud to go to work every day. There are multiple determinants of disability, one of them being job satisfaction. Some would rather get a meager disability check than work at a dreary, demoralizing job.

The cases presented here are clear cut. But how does the government decide who of the potentially hundreds of thousands of Americans should qualify. There's not going to be an easy answer."
2021-10-27 18:06,"The implications of ""long term COVID"" will affect the health care systems of the US and Europe for decades to come. The only solution, I am sorry to say, is that those affected die off sooner than normal. This is *not* a good situation for civilized society, but the world needs to take this seriously and find some way to come to terms with it. In a similar case, I suspect that the wave of  ""morbid encephalitis"" in the 1920s was a result of long term of the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic."
2021-10-27 17:50,"People are commenting that being weight is their own fault, and if they are overweight then long COVID is also on them. This is both cruel and untrue.

I am not fat or poor ( as many commenters here suggest is the problem with the people in this article who are still struggling). I can’t spend longer than a trip to the grocery store in a mask without an asthma attack.  I do not know how to go back to work where I would need to wear a mask all day. All the scans, xrays, breathing tests etc say I’m fine though my Dr agrees this is long haul covid. Super frustrating."
2021-10-27 17:55,"Before we pass judgement on individuals who appear to be suffering, we need to understand the demographics of people who are experiencing long covid. What age group, what co-morbidities, what economic strata, and if possible what ethnicity. The latter because there might be a genetic propensity towards problems from covid. No point in either presuming that these folks have long haul covid or not without clear studies. I sure hope other better organized medical systems ( not America) are recording such problems. Then perhaps we can address them here and actually help folks before anything chronic sets in."

2021-10-27 19:09,"I feel sorry for the people who are truly suffering and I hope there will be medical studies on how to separate those who are legitimate from fraudsters. 

There was a time people with multiple sclerosis were put in mental institutions because of the way symptoms presented. Later  when the disease was identified with distinct symptoms there were people who would mimic MS symptoms to get disability. Thanks to medical studies and distinct characteristics identified by advances in medical technology it is almost impossible to do so now. 

There is so much we don't know about this virus and that makes it worse. Hopefully future studies will help but I hope it won't be tool late. I know I owe a lot to those in the past who had MS and participated in studies that helped me and why I later did the same.  This is why funding science and medicine is so important."
2021-10-27 22:43,"My late husband died of  metastatic cancer, earlier this year. His employer's private disability policy approved disability payments fairly quickly. 

 Shortly thereafter, the disability provider hired another private56 firm to help him fill out and process his application for Social Security disability. It flew through and was approved.  Now some categories of illness are considered more dire than others, but these firms make their money qualifying people and rapidly getting them onto Social Security Disability.  Needless to say, the payment we received from the private disability deducted the social security payments.  But all is not remotely equal in evaluating and approving disability payments."

2021-10-27 14:25,"The problem with non-Covid is the question of does it even exist. There is too much secondary gain to these patients to just collect all sorts of government benefits. The concept of increasing disability payments, increasing benefits, increasing housing supports increasing food increasing everything other than work requirements is the problem. There’s absolutely no reason why these people feel they should go back to work. The easy solution is to cut benefits and all of a sudden Long Covid will disappear.￼"

Or maybe my understanding of caretaker of a quadriplegic needs updating?

2021-10-27 16:00,"Can't help but notice that the two pictured here are visibly overweight, which can exacerbate these issues.  A problem that not enough doctors are willing to confront their patients on because they fear losing them.  A few years ago I lost a lot of weight, not through surgery.  My mood improved and I felt sharper and with fewer physical complaints.  I know this is something that people don't wanna hear but it's supported by research, not just a few articles but dozens and dozens I found on PubMed."
2021-10-27 16:25,"I am always skeptical of reported symptoms that can't be supported by real data.  Numerous medical tests can't find anything out of the ordinary.  A relatively young woman is sleeping 15 hours a day; could this be depression?   Mental and physical health go hand in hand, we need basic healthcare that treats both."
2021-10-27 13:56,"Has no doctor suggested the two obese women featured lose weight?  There are many unknowns about long Covid but there is substantial evidence that obesity exacerbates many diseases and medical conditions.  For example, Type 2 diabetics can reverse or reduce the severity of their condition by losing weight.  I am surprised the women have not tried this relatively simple action to see if it works.  Exercise is impossible for them now because of breathing issues but surely they can reduce their caloric intake."

I'm 5'5"" 125 pounds and have ME/CFS, chronic Lyme and a brain injury.  All disabling conditions and all invisible to others and I've never been over weight.  Catch yourself when judging something you know nothing about and have never experienced and be glad for the health you have.

2021-10-28 1:31,"For all those that want to deny benefits to the unvaxxed, I would like to point out the obvious logical fallacy of this view. If we are going to deny people benefits because of their choices in life, then we can make the same argument for all sorts of people. Why should fat people get benefits? Why should smokers, or drinkers, get benefits? Why should a man who didnt wear a seatbelt and got in a car accident get benefits. In fact, why should a man who ate a lot of red meat and had a heart attack get benefits. Didnt he know that a vegetarian diet was better for his heart health? This desire to see the unvaxxed suffer is callous and not morally supportable."

2021-10-27 15:53,"Well done Merck! Without worldwide cooperation pandemics become endemic. Forgoing profits now in this way will prove beneficial for the company brand, not to mention all humanity, in the long run. I hope their example is repeated a lot and big pharma becomes slightly less odious in their capitalist tendencies (opioids) at the expense of public health and regularly enhances it beyond the bottomline like Merck has done here."
2021-10-27 16:01,"Yes, this is good news, but do please take note that Americans will be paying through the nose for their doses at $712 per course, an enormous, enormous profit for Merck. Merck could cut that price down quite a bit and still make a ton of money.  We need pharmaceutical price regulation in this country and Medicare should be able to negotiate drug prices.  Americans continue to subsidize drugs for the entire world by our current ""system"".  I am thankful Merck is licensing this drug for countries around the world and it is an important step in combating COVID, but there is more to be done, including forcing the vaccine manufacturers to do likewise with those vaccines."
2021-10-27 16:05,How well can developing nations actually manufacture a safe drug that is not contaminated by a dirty factory or unchecked employer/employee practices? I have had multiple personal experiences with antivirals and antibiotics that made me sick when they should have made me well. Me and docs baffled for months. Finally started researching drug companies and where they manufacture their pills. All were made in India. Switched to a specialty pharmacy and health outcome changed drastically. I’m not saying all pills from India are bad but I’m done with them. Other countries less developed than India will make these antivirals? Scary to think how this will turn out. I’ll keep masking.
2021-10-27 16:17,"“From a scientific point of view, industry have done a really brilliant job — firstly, providing the vaccines, and now providing treatments.”

And let’s not forget the billions and billions of dollars invested by middle class tax payers in many countries through their taxes that made all this possible.  The decades of research, the battles with the ultra wealthy to cut funding for government funded research, the funding for universities, the education of researchers, the funding of the regulatory structure so treatments don’t kill people rather than cure them, and the fighting tooth and nail against the drug industry to regulate them and enforce standards so they don’t kill people (because it’s cheaper than following regulations).

And for all our money, billions across decades, across middle classes everywhere... do we get 

1) any acknowledgement that without tax payer money, the drug industry would be nowhere (the majority of R&D is expensive and not profitable so only governments will do it - ie our tax dollars)

2) a thank you from the drug industry for our massive contribution 

3). A share in the massive profits (which should be our return on investment for our tax dollars).  

Do we, the middle class of all countries get any of the above?  No.

It’s just yea!  Industry is so brilliant, so magnanimous, so innovative.  

Without the massive investments by the middle class of many, many countries we would have no vaccines, no treatments, no COVID pills."

  This drug halves the rate of hospitalization and deaths. That is great, also laboratory studies show that this antiviral pill is likely to be effective against known variants of the coronavirus including the Delta.
  This drug, Molnupiravir does not target the spike proteins of the virus, unlike the vaccines. So it should be equally effective as the virus continues to evolve. The drug instead targets the viral polymerase, an enzyme needed for the virus to make copies of itself.  
  The cost of this drug for poorer countries is going to be less than 20 dollars for a five-day course"

It makes sense that costs should be lowered / subsidized for poor nations.  

The problem with ALL pharmaceutical drug sales is that the US consumer pays infinitely more than other peer countries.

Either the wealthy developed countries pay the same high price for drugs as the USA does or the USA price is lowered to match that which is paid in other countries.

If a wealthy country refuses to pay, then supply should be cut."

2021-10-27 18:26,"As shareholder in Moderna and BioNTech, and as a physician myself, I would want to believe MRK is striking a balance and keeping the unfettered greed we’ve seen with the vaccine makers in check. 

However it’s worth noting that Molnupiravir is a prodrug of β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931), which has been under development for over 50 years. Merck has already entered into licensing agreements with five Indian manufacturers, several of which were independently investing the parent compound NHC. I believe Merck has a patent on only the method of synthesis rather than the prodrug they licensed from academia. The cynic in me believes that leadership has decided the patent will be very difficult to enforce and has decided instead to at least score some positive PR."
2021-10-27 18:28,"Merck announced a licensing deal that will allow the drug, molnupiravir, to be made and sold cheaply in 105 developing nations.

This also holds true in Middle Eastern countries. I’m sure there have been brilliant minds produced in all civilizations, in all generations, so all these cultures should be way ahead instead of being “third world” and needing the support of the wealthier, younger countries for their very existence. It’s wonderful what Merrick is doing with the Covid pills but the real question is why is it even necessary? Why haven’t these countries grown up over the thousands of years to be more enlightened, stable, healthy and advanced in a myriad of ways?"

That's OK by me, but unfortunately we are being ripped off by the drug companies on many other drugs they sell at much lower prices in other places, but in the US we pay highly inflated rates for drugs."
2021-10-27 21:09,"The cost of drugs in the U.S. is indeed very high compared with other developed countries, whom we are subsidizing. Nonetheless we are getting our money's worth. Life expectancy in the U.S. in 1960 was 69.77 years; in 2019 it was 78.79 years. That's a 9 year increase in life expectancy over less than 6 decades. Much of that increase is due to major advances in pharmaceuticals."

  Need to raise prices per their corporate karmas
To turn a good profit, super handsome I say,
  To cure patient ailments with a handsome outlay;
  A cure-all or not, but a fine how-dee-do,
Not cheap at the price, and there’s no one to sue."
2021-10-27 21:43,Finally! Conscience over profits.
2021-10-27 21:48,The covid pill has one function and as a result it has a finite lifespan and makes sense to share.  mRNA technology has more uses and infinite lifespan hence why should not be shared with the likes of China.  Simple.
2021-10-27 21:53,"What about the United States?  When will we stop paying so much for pharma?  When will drugs be affordable for Americans? It's great that these drugs are made available, cheaply for other countries, but to do that, pharma must charge high prices to Americans. You're subsidizing the drug market in other countries."
2021-10-27 21:58,"Considering that molnupravir is a mutagenic ribonucleoside analog, which effects on the human cells have not been studied (e.g. incorporation into human RNA, misincorporation into human genomic DNA, interplay with ribonucleotide excision repair by RNase H2, etc), the value of this gesture is questionable. So far Merck did nothing to ascertain the mutagenic potential of this nucleotide in humans, but quite conspicuously removed from clinical trials not only pregnant women, but demand that both male and female participants agreed to two simultaneous forms of contraception or be surgically sterilized (per inclusion criteria, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04405570). Indeed, pregnancy would provide a clear and fast readout of mutagenic potential, while in adults mutagenic signature would pop up in cancer GWAS years later."
2021-10-27 21:59,"As a PhD scientist with 34 years in industry and 8 years in academia, I offer the following comments for your consideration.
1) What do we Americans get from federal taxpayer funding of research? We get new technologies that no one else would have funded and we save lives by greatly increasing the speed of development. Plus we get taxes paid by on the companies' profits and their employees' salaries. Yes, some people and some companies make a lot of money off the health industry. That's a problem that needs to be dealt with another day.
2) Moderna's technology does not belong to the federal government because we helped pay for it. They are a private company that would not exist without profit motive. Furthermore, they do not own the technology of the suppliers' components that go into the vaccine. If the federal government nationalized Moderna and forced them to give away their technology, it would destroy them as a company. mRNA is their entire technology platform and the COVID vaccine is their first money making product.
3) Americans have provided billions of dollars to accelerate development of the mRNA technology and the 60,000+ volunteers who participated in the clinical trials, including my wife and me. I support maximizing assistance to other countries but first, I want my family to survive this pandemic."
2021-10-27 22:07,"Good for them. The world could use a lot less, ""I'm-gonna-grab-what-I-can"" and way more ""we're-all-in-this-together.""  

Withholding life saving medicine in order to maximize profits is immoral and a betrayal of humanity.  Sharing it and saving lives is a mark of honor."
2021-10-27 22:17,"Merck will profit significantly from this as it should.

Merck will share its formula with developing nations to enable them to distribute it widely, as it should.

One right action plus another one that ought to be replicated across the board."
2021-10-27 22:17,"How about china foot the bill? Seems the least they could do. Then again, They’re not above stealing intelligence so If they don’t have it already, it’s only a matter of time until they get it."
2021-10-27 22:25,"Merck did not do the research or develop the drug Molnupiravir.  Emory University did the work financed by $35 million of taxpayer grants.  Emory licensed Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to do the clinical trials.  Then, Merck bought the exclusive rights to sell and manufacture it all over the world.

The taxpayers put up the seed money.  The Government gave a $1.2 billion contract to Merck for advance purchases of their product.  The contract has an upper limit of $3.7 billion.

The taxpayers have the privilege of paying Merck $712/treatment even though they are able to provide it to other countries for $20/treatment.

In Biden's people investment bill, the Democrats do not even have the votes to include a provision that allows medicare to negotiate drug prices."
2021-10-27 23:03,Big pharma finely shows some humanity.
2021-10-27 23:28,"Absolutely. Overdue. 
Let India and others manufacture billions of generics - this is like Fe and death."
2021-10-28 4:08,"Subtext, possibly on the PR release. This was discovered by Emory and Ridgeback came along later to finish development. Then Merck came to manufacture and market to rich countries to make some money off it but Emory had a clause in the licensing agreement to give it cheap or free to poor countries.

Am I wrong? not to be cynical but I know the licensing business. No private or public company is that magnanimous."
2021-10-28 4:10,"Merck has a respectable tradition- for example, in 1987, Merck CEO Dr. Roy Vagelos announced Merck's commitment to donate Mectizan - as much as needed for as long as needed - with the goal to help eliminate river blindness.     And in 2007, Merck committed to donating 3 million doses of GARDASIL (vaccine, for the prevention of cervical cancer caused by certain HPV types) over 5 years to support vaccination programs in the world's lowest-income nations."

2021-10-27 19:54,Finally. This should have been done with the Pfizer and moderna vaccines too. Good on Merck
2021-10-27 19:57,Noble to do so.
2021-10-27 22:09,Bravo...may they set a trend....

2021-10-28 14:15,Yay for Merck!   It's the Krystoff effect!
2021-10-28 7:01,On the matter of cheap availability of vaccines. From the start the Covid vaccine produced by the Astrozenica-Oxford partnership was predicated on an at-cost arrangement. This was to be delivered as I understand at about USD4 per shot. I wonder how all that is going. The NYT seems not to know.
2021-10-27 0:51,"I'm not normally an emotional person but I may just shed a tear when my little boy finally gets his shot. He has been struggling so much and said that this will be his Christmas present. 

I can understand why. After all, what toy can ever beat this gift of protection that signals our long awaited return to normalcy for so many kids like him?"
2021-10-27 1:01,"While children may not seem to be at high risk for severe disease, they improve herd immunity, which can slow down the spread of disease across all age groups, a needed step to end this pandemic.  

Much like the generation who lined up for polio vaccines, when these kids grow up, they’ll be able to talk about how when they were in elementary school, they got vaccinated to protect their friends, family, community, and themselves from getting sick."
2021-10-27 1:10,"I am raising my glass of Champagne along with all the fellow parents out there who have had much burdened lives as a result of parenting young children during a pandemic, while doing all their best to shield their families from the virus. We deserve a collective Nobel Price for dedication, shared with all medical staff and crews.
And I am sending my love to all the kids out there who have had to make a lot of efforts. I am so proud of you all."
2021-10-27 1:07,Excellent.
2021-10-27 1:08,"The coronavirus vaccines are incredibly safe and effective....except to the reality denying community.

The vaccines have been proven safe by hundreds of millions of people.

Stopping the spread includes vaccinating children who help to spread the virus.

This is a good day for making America healthy, in spite of many Americans who still insist on risking illness and death instead of taking a very safe common sense vaccine."
2021-10-27 1:21,Seems like the vaccine is treating peoples (not even the children but for example their parents and teachers)  fears more than scientific realities.
2021-10-27 1:53,"First of all,  'herd immunity' is a dimmer,  not an on-off switch. Regardless of man-made thresholds thereof, the higher the percentage of population vaccinated,  the slower the disease spread is. This applies to every disease.  There's nothing new,  different,  or special with Covid.  

Vaccinating children markedly reduces the chance of their getting sick but also of passing it on to other people.  

The benefits clearly outweigh the risks here. There are no actual issues to discuss.  Love your kids? Get them vaccinated.  End of story."
2021-10-27 1:52,"COVID seems to be decreasing, but it has a nasty tendency to flare up when nobody is looking.
The key is getting to herd immunity, which requires vaccinating almost everyone, including children.  
This requires 3 things as soon as possible:
1)  Widespread availability of the vaccine for children.
2)  Widespread availability of booster shots for the elderly and vulnerable
3)  Widespread adoption of vaccine mandates in jobs and schools.
Otherwise, more virulent variants will spread in the winter and spring, starting the cycle over again."
2021-10-27 2:04,I don’t understand how the dosage is decided. So a kid 11 years old gets 1/3 of adult dosage and another one couple months older and turned 12 receives the whole adult dosage? Is 12 a magic number?
2021-10-27 2:19,"To all the naysayers who question if kids really need the vaccine or not, my question is why would you want to risk the health and life of your own kid? I for one will certainly not risk it…it’s not the kind of lotto I’m looking to play. Only lottery I’m interested in winning is the mega or powerball, not Covid. Getting kids vaccinated is another step towards some sense of herd immunity."
2021-10-27 2:31,"This is such good news!! My elementary school kids will be vaccinated as soon as possible. This will protect them (from the virus, school closures, extended quarantines, trumped socialization) and help us overcome this deadly pandemic as a society."
2021-10-27 2:56,My eight year old can't wait.
2021-10-27 3:15,"There have been over 1,000,000 child cases, 4000 hospitalizations and over 120 deaths in the last two months.  The main concern with the vaccine is for Pericarditis and Myocarditis which may effect a few hundred children and may causes a few hospitalizations and likely no deaths.  How are these similar?"
2021-10-27 3:45,"I hear a lot of vaccine naysayers using the argument “if your child is healthy they don’t need this vaccine!”….but how are we all so certain that our precious children don’t have a hidden disease/defect/etc? My 9 year old son had a strep infection as a toddler and we recently discovered it has weakened his kidneys. A neighbor’s daughter was suddenly diagnosed with severe asthma last week. Another friend’s young son was born with a repairable heart condition and is doing very well, but how would he react to a Covid infection? How many other children are living with undiagnosed or undiscovered co-morbidity that actually place them in the higher-risk category? The sneaky thing about Covid is that we don’t always know we are high risk until we contract the virus. The same may be true for our children as well."
2021-10-27 3:40,"I wish doctors would fire patients who have  refused to get the shot.
'As a health care professional, I have failed to convince you to get the shot.   I can no longer treat you as I have failed professionally.
  I have found a doctor that will treat people who have not gotten the shot.  So there will be an unbroken line of care.
The doctor is two states away and has had their licensed suspended, twice.'"
2021-10-27 4:34,"I am extraordinarily glad for this. 

Kids are low risk, but not at no risk from COVID. This will be one more tool in the arsenal to reduce risks, spread, and put grater comfort in parents' minds

That said, I do hope that this can put us back to the path to full normality. With this approval, virtually any school age kid will be able to get vaccinated. Any higher risk adult has been able to get vaccinated, or a booster (which are insanely effective). 

At this juncture, my patience for continuing on with restrictions to protect anti-vaxxers wears thin"
2021-10-27 5:28,"The article mentions the Biden administration sees the vaccinating of children as crucial to keeping 
schools open. This reason is rarely mentioned, however, either by critics or supporters of vaccines for kids.  Think about it, the same parents who object to vaccinating their kids also largely object to their kids wearing masks in schools. Adults (teachers and staff) could get breakthrough infections, also with no symptoms, infecting adults in the outside community who themselves have refused vaccinations. This untenable situation could lead to many more hospitalizations and deaths. Teachers have already been quitting in droves. Lack of teachers, as well as the spread of disease could completely close schools down again, forcing kids and parents into the same scenario we faced before, which set kids' education back a year or more, not to mention their ability to function in a classroom. In the past experiment with online classes, in many cases, there was no parental guidance at all, with you tube and Facebook as nannies. Teachers were expected to somehow teach to that.
Since the vaccines are safe, why are parents willing to risk this appalling situation that could so easily be corrected?"
2021-10-27 4:57,Odds the democrats mandate it and disenfranchise more voters?
2021-10-27 3:06,"Parents should read the entire FDA report. When you do you will find some starling facts.

Testing vaccine safety for children normally takes 5-7 years. Pfizer claims to have achieved those same safety standards in only weeks.

Pfizer specifically tested for myocarditis in 5-11 year olds. But the most recent reports indicate that myocarditis appears mostly in the 13-24 year old range.

Pfizer specifically stated that their goal was to prevent virus transmission among 5-11 year olds.

But in August, Dr. Walensky, the Director of the CDC stated that the same vaccine for adults could not prevent infection, nor could it prevent transmission.

So who should parents believe? The CDC or Pfizer?

The VAERS system already has thousands of vaccine injury reports for those under 18, many severe. And it appears that some medical personnel have already vaccinated very young children, two of whom have died.

No comment from the FDA panel.

Kids with pre-existing conditions and prior COVID infections were not included in Pfizer’s study. Yet millions of kids have conditions such as asthma, diabetes and childhood obesity. 

There is no safety data at all for these kids or others with significant co-factors.

However, I suspect that the media will simply report that ""the children's vaccine is safe,"" even though there were numerous factors that were intentionally left out of the trials.

There is no covid crisis affecting kids. No mandates, press the pause button and do more studies."
2021-10-27 7:24,"Many commenters reference the low number of deaths in children with Covid, and conclude that the low risk of death doesn't justify vaccination. But death isn't the only issue. Long-haul Covid is very real in kids, and we still only have short term data on that. Given what we know about multi-system effects of Covid infection, I certainly don't want to run the risk that a preventable infection could cause lifelong neurological, respiratory, cardiac, or immune problems in our daughter. The vaccine seems a MUCH safer bet."
2021-10-27 8:05,"Pretty sure it was a Times article last week plus a similar one up here in Canada (probably the Globe and Mail): 

The gist of both features was that a hefty percentage of fully vaccinated parents may well bide their time in allowing their kids to be jabbed.

One reason being the intense messaging by health authorities, for so long, that children either were not at risk of getting sick or would only get a mild case. Bottom line: Although authorities have lately changed their tune, their earlier messaging against vaccinating children imprinted deeper into parents’ psyches.

One of the articles also theorized that the currently falling case rates and hospitalizations in all age groups is leading to a ‘moral calm’ rather than a ‘moral panic’ regarding the vaccination of children. This may lead many parents to conclude they have the luxury of time to wait and see if there are significant negative side effects for kids getting jabbed."
2021-10-27 7:52,"One day Democrats will finish vaccinating every mouse in the country and run out of COVID talking points.

When that day comes look out, they'll actually have to face the multiple fiascos they've created in less than a year."
2021-10-27 6:43,"Will children be expelled from schools if they don't get vaccinated? 

Will the parents be fined? 

What will be the next decision by an unelected government agency that will be imposed? 

Is there any possible danger to giving that kind of absolute power over citizens' lives to such a government agency?

I am no Constitutional expert but I do believe that courts have judged over and over that laws are to be enacted by Congress .... not agencies."
2021-10-27 6:23,Parents will make their own decisions. 400 children have died from Covid and many parents will want to avoid that risk.
2021-10-27 6:13,If they are vaccinated can they stop wearing masks?
2021-10-27 9:31,"Many parents and others around the country who are skeptical about the Covid vaccines are NOT skeptical about vaccines, in general.  This is somewhat of a propagated myth.  These parents have very rational concerns about the use of new, emergency-approved vaccines and vectors for low-risk, long-term applications, i.e. their children.  Some have doubts that are more intuitive; others have explicit and specific concerns.  For instance, it isn't reactionary to question the necessity of genetically instructing our cells in a nonspecific manner throughout the body to manufacture viral protein subunits that have been modified to appear foreign to our own immune system in order to generate immune responses to a pathogen that poses highly variable risks to us and our children, depending on our ages, health and conditions for its transmission.  Also, many people feel unsure about the forces driving the promotion of the these new, highly lucrative technologies.  Some of us wish that our country had options for more conventional vaccine approaches (e.g. inactivated whole viruses), like most of the world has utilized for this pandemic... or just some discussion on the matter."
2021-10-27 10:06,"This article and the one yesterday by Dr. Beers seem one-sided. They both underplay the unknown risks of LONG TERM side effects from these FDA-emergency approved lipid nanoparticle/mRNA vaccines, which are of particular concern for children. They also do not make it clear that nearly ALL pediatric Covid-19 deaths involve children with pre-existing medical conditions. Also, their argument for vaccinating children, namely, ""... the risk of developing myocarditis after a Covid-19 infection is much higher than the risk of developing myocarditis after the vaccine"" seems to make an unfair comparison. This heightened risk, anywhere from 7-37X (over baseline), depending on age, presumably pertains to only the small fraction of children who develop (symptomatic) Covid-19 infections. The risk of developing myocarditis after the vaccine, though less than this by about 10-fold, pertains to EVERY child getting vaccinated. If so, the frequency of myocarditis (and even MIS-C) may change little or even go up if every child in America gets vaccinated, including all those who have natural (and strong innate) immunity from previous exposure. The high natural immunity and low viral transmission efficiency of kids also limits the social value of them being vaccinated.
IMO, the new mRNA vaccines (especially their second doses) would have more favorable benefit-to-risk ratios for adults in underdeveloped countries than for healthy kids here. But I guess this would be far less lucrative."
2021-10-27 10:10,"As one of the medical authorities stated, does every child in this age group really need the vaccine or limit it to those at high risk of severe COVID-an easily identifiable group with underlying conditions such as obesity or other risk factors.  If this is so easily identifiable, why then when the number of children or adults who die from COVID are reported, why isn't their BMI and age also reported.  This is the statistic the medical authorities hide in their agenda to vaccinate the entire population.  They say healthy children or adults can also die, but define healthy.  Is a person with a BMI over 30 considered healthy?  By all means vaccinate the most vulnerable but don't coerce and mandate shots for adults and children who don't suffer from these underlying conditions.  Yet, given the manner emergency use authorization has morphed into mandated or required shots for institutions receiving any type of federal funds  why not just be honest and mandate shots for all school age children which will eventually happen any way."
2021-10-27 10:43,"The data are clear that Covid is a problem for those > 65, and/or with serious comorbidities.

Children carry a very low risk

So why would children have to take a vaccine which has under a year’s data to protect someone else?

Thalidomide was approved; the risks only became apparent over time

If you are at risk, you do not have the right to demand children protect you when you can wear your mask and stay isolated until this pandemic has passed.

Of course, with cases now down 65% and falling, it’s clear where we stand on the pandemic

Pro tip: Florida is #50 in cases right now."
2021-10-27 10:38,"I teach in a large suburban high school where the majority of parents have opted not to get their teens vaccinated. If you saw what I see every day in classrooms and hallways, you would get your student vaccinated ASAP. Mask wearing? Not all are compliant, not by a longshot. Social distancing? Forget it. 

Pretty much every day, we get a ""Notice to the Community"" announcing that yet another student or students have tested positive.  Any close contacts in those students' classes who are not vaccinated now have to quarantine, and parents get upset about their child's learning loss while stuck at home, watching class online. We've had a pregnant teacher, unvaccinated,  who had covid, ended up delivering her baby early, and spent a week in ICU. I have a student who gave it to her grandmother, who got more seriously ill than my student. Kids are allowed to do sports ( think wrestling,  maskless) with no requirement for vaccination. The entire student body eats lunch at the same time, spread out across the building....pretty much a daily super spreader event.

As a parent and teacher, getting my teen vaccinated would be  a no-brainer."
2021-10-27 11:46,"“It just seems to me that in some ways we’re vaccinating children to protect the adults, and it should be the other way around,” he said. “I do believe that children at highest risk do need to be vaccinated. But vaccinating all of the children to achieve that just seems a bit much for me.”

This pretty much sums up the pandemic. Kids made huge sacrifices, including over a year of lost education, to protect adults. In this FDA meeting five scenarios were run. If Covid rates had stayed where they were in June 2021, the risks of vaccination for 5-11 year olds would have outweighed the benefits. Thanks to delta and a significant portion of the US population who won’t get vaccinated, now kids need the jab."
2021-10-27 11:56,"The family across the street from us all had COVID at Christmastime last year.  Little Rosie, a second grader, included.  One of the older brothers contracted the disease from innocently participating in school wrestling.  They were all very sick.  

I’ve watched little Rosie for a year and a half now, donning a mask like a trooper, but no other little girlfriends over there, wondering if/when she’d get “sick” again, and worried about this pandemic and the mysteries of what just might happen next.  

What really must kids think?  They didn’t do anything wrong, but yet they had their school attendance taken away, they had their grandmas and grandpas taken away, they could not play with their friends in their homes, no birthday parties, no holidays with cousins under the same roof.  

Rosie, I know your mom has done everything in her power to protect you - but maybe, just maybe, the rest of this country will be able to give you something that will help you, too.  It’s about time."

How many kids will have adverse or fatal reactions to the vaccine? Are we risking our kids to protect the at-risk unvaccinated adults? Why is no one talking about this risk assessment? If I don't agree to this will my child be denied education? New York Times do your job and ask the hard questions. This should be all anyone is talking about. These questions should be answered unequivocally before this is rolled out nationwide. Don't use children as a shield for adults who refuse to vaccinate themselves or refuse to take care of their health."
2021-10-27 1:24,"""Covid-19 was “the eighth-highest killer of kids in this age group over the past year,” said a C.D.C. official in favor of broader authorization.""

Yes, and I'm sure that car crashes resulted in far more deaths among kids in this age group than Covid. 

You wonder why there are so many skeptical parents out there? Unless your kid has other health conditions (which account for virtually all the deaths in this age group), there is no reason to rush and get them the vaccine. None."
2021-10-27 1:59,"Of course no mention of the fact that of the 73 million American children in the under 18 age group, 700 (1 in 104,000) have died of Covid. It is estimated that 95% of the 700 had other health conditions, indicating that only 35 healthy children died (1 in 2,008,000). 

And that's why 70% of parents will take their time, or never get their kids vaccinated."
2021-10-27 14:45,"A giant step forward on beginning to control a pandemic that has gotten a lot of help from narcissistic reality-denying so-called leaders, and parents who despite all the evidence that getting the disease is much worse than getting the vaccine, who if left to their own devices will deny the life-saving vaccine to their children....

I say mandate the vaccine for all school age children 5 to 11 and older."
2021-10-27 16:27,"We all agree that Covid poses some risk to children in this age range.  And the vaccine poses some risk, too.  We can disagree on the magnitude of those risks and how to weigh them.

But a parent's decision to vaccinate their child should always be guided by a consideration of the child's safety and health.  The safety of adults or the safety of the ""public"" should not be a determining factor in this choice.

Children should not be regarded instrumentally, as a means to an end.  I feel like some commenters are edging towards that dangerous proposition.  There is a reason we do not send children to war."
2021-10-27 19:02,"We're in a pandemic with a rapidly mutating virus. A lot of unknowns. All we can do is the best we can with the data that we have, because it's impossible to eliminate risk. There's risk to not taking the vaccine, and risk to taking it. And it's not just an individual risk. There are risks and harms incurred by our collective failure to do what it takes to contain the virus. My daughter and I are fortunate to live in a community with high vaccination rates, mandatory masking in schools, ventilation/air filtration in every classroom, and voluntary surveillance testing of students. The school district started preparing to offer pediatric  vaccination clinics when Pfizer applied for EUA. And when the vaccine becomes available, my 5 year old will be in line to get the shot."
2021-10-27 20:01,"I’m all for it. Children must be vaccinated to enter kindergarten. Parents who are opposed (anti-vaxxers, anti-mandates) seem to have forgotten the slate of shots their parents made sure they received. It’s time to end this pandemic."
2021-10-29 16:35,"The priority has to be getting every willing child vaccinated as quickly as possible. This isn't like early in the pandemic; vaccine stockpiles are more than adequate for the job. The hesitant can come later or whenever they're ready. I'm concerned that trying to enforce equitability by race or class could slow down distribution by forcing some groups to wait on others, or by allocating doses where they will not be used due to hesitancy. Let's just keep it simple and get going. As many as possible, as quickly as possible."
2021-10-29 16:37,"It would be fantastic if you could be explicit and consistent in the headlines regarding clearance, approval, authorization of vaccines. This is mysterious to the public and can be confusing, which leads to misinterpretation and everything that comes with it. Maybe even have a footer that re iterates the difference."
2021-10-29 16:37,"So much fear-mongering that the ""advantaged"" are going to be first in line. Recent polls suggest that only 27% of parents of 5 to 11 year olds intend to get their kids the vaccine when it comes out. Another third plan to take a wait-and-see approach. (The rest aren't even interested in getting it.)

Let those who want the vaccine for their kids get it. Then let the data accumulate so the wait-and-see third gets the data they need to make an informed decision.

The biggest problem our country has right now is LOW uptake of the vaccine. Please stop with the pointless shaming of those who are eager to queue up."
2021-10-29 16:39,"I will be crying grateful and happy tears the second my 7 and 9 year olds get vaccinated. What a long, exhausting almost 2 years it has been."
2021-10-29 16:53,"I hope that this good news means that masks will be optional for school kids come the Spring or Fall of next year. 

Obviously, we have to see where we are with case counts, but once all teachers are vaccinated and students have the option to be, it's high time to start having that conversation in a reasonable, objective way."
2021-10-29 16:55,"I'm glad for the kids and families who have been awaiting this news, and plan to vaccinate my own young children. But the biggest problem remains unvaccinated adults."
2021-10-29 17:33,"This is good news. What is the situation on trials for kids age 2-5 and 0-2? No doubt there are many parents who would like to vaccinate their youngest children as well.  Also, can you report on why these trials seem to be taking so long? Do we need to finish trials at 12-18 before starting 5-12, and likewise to trial in the 2-5 age group? Why? Certainly children live in proximity to adults, including grandparents, and their vaccination can help slow inter-generational transmission of disease."
2021-10-29 17:10,"Sarcasm alert. What surprising and unexpected news! Really, we knew this 3 months ago. What took so long? Abundant precautions or bureaucracy?

There is cost in delays. Two children age 5 to 12 succumb to Corona daily in the United States. Perhaps a negligible number, but likely much more than due to the side effects of the vaccine."
2021-10-29 17:41,"While the benefit of the covid vaccine for kids very likely outweighs the risk, Pfizer should have still done a larger trial. Especially because a 5 year old is not the same as an 11 year old. The problem is they knew they didn’t need a larger trial. Public pressure would force clearance of their vaccine. 

Moderna’s trial is a least a bit larger than Pfizer’s."
2021-10-29 17:17,"Children make up third of Covid cases in the UK. Will parents in the US get their children vaccinated? In this country, Republican governors are outlawing mask mandates, paying police officers from other states not to get vaccinated, and now paying unemployment to workers not to get vaccinated. How many levels of stupidity exist in this country? Even some military are refusing vaccination! Do they refuse all the other required vaccines when they deploy? I recommend that field hospitals be set up to handle Covid patients who refused to get vaccinated. Staff them with all the people refusing vaccines. People are afraid of Covid - i’m fact many are terrified - the anti- safety stance of Republicans are a form of terror. Their iron fist reminds me of the Taliban leaders - anti- women’s rights, in favor of draconian punishment, and have a stranglehold on their members. Trump admitted them so much he wanted them to come to Camp David!"
2021-10-29 17:47,"We have so much lost data here :(

The Pfizer clinical trial used in the 26 October VRBPAC meeting examines about n=4500 participants (a batch of 2250 and a second batch of 2250). There, we have robust safety data.

But many many parents already got their kids of various other ages vaccinated after the August Pfizer full use authorization (with a cooperating MD writing a prescription). Where are the safety data from those kids? They got a much higher dose than what has now been EUA'd -- how are things working out for them?"
2021-10-29 19:33,"As soon as it's available here, my 5 year old daughter will be getting her vaccine. This has been a long time coming and is another important step in returning to normalcy."
2021-10-29 19:29,"It might not be popular, because some of my fellow faithful use religious exemptions to avoid their social responsibility and get vaccinated, but I must say about this news: thank God, thank God, thank God!"
2021-10-29 19:48,"This is wonderful news!  
Together with boosters for the elderly, these vaccinations for children may prevent a resurgence of COVID this winter, and enable the US to return to normal in the spring.
The next step is for the US government to mount a major PR campaign to encourage parents to vaccinate their children.
After that, we can start to vaccinate the rest of the world, so that COVID can be defeated worldwide."
2021-10-29 19:40,Overjoyed that this is finally happening. My 8-year-old will get it ASAP.
2021-10-29 18:33,"Most vaccines we receive are in childhood - HiB, varicella, Measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, influenza. It is part of the reason most lay people have never heard of most of these diseases, let alone know anyone who has contracted it. It is part of the reason life expectancy rose in the 20th century like never before in human history.

Not sure why there is a portion of our population that acts like giving vaccines to children is some new and crazy idea."
2021-10-29 19:29,Excellent. I have daughter who is under 11. Fabulous news and will look into it now.
2021-10-29 20:07,"This is wonderful news. While most of the country has gone post-pandemic since spring, kids have been as defenseless as ever but with a more dangerous variant hunting them down.

I can't wait for my daughter to get vaccinated so she can play with other kids without the fear of this viral monster stealing her breath."
2021-10-29 20:17,"Why not distribute permission slips?  Any kid who returns a signed permission slip gets vaccinated at school.  No health equity issues:  every kid who goes to school has the same access.  Roll it out at inner city schools first if it cannot be done at all schools at once.

Why does the parent need to be there?  If the child isn't comfortable getting the shot without a parent, then don't return the permission slip and get the shot at a drug store when the parent can take the kid.

But this would cut out all the excuses (I don't know how to sign up, I cannot take time off from work, I don't have transportation . . .)."
2021-10-29 20:38,An incredible milestone for ending this pandemic for families with young kids. We spent a year taking extreme measures in order to “protect the elderly” only to watch so much of this country throw caution to the wind once adult vaccines were made available. Now families who have spent 9 extra months being careful and isolated will be able to rejoin society safely. Our kids will be first in line here.
2021-10-29 20:43,"When I enrolled my step children to local elementary and high school (in Illinois), it went without saying (rather strict school nurse) that we have to fulfill prerequisite to attend public school, namely to proof that they are vaccinated according to department of education rules.  This was in 2018, before Covid.

Now, it´s a mad world as politics in is mixed into this.  I recall (it is not so distant past...) that if we did not want to get kids vaccinated, we would look like bunch of crazy weirdos.  Are the anti-vaxxers realizing that they might look exactly like crazy weirdos?"
2021-10-29 20:37,So happy for my neighbors and their 9 year old daughter!
2021-10-29 20:30,"Protect your children.  Protect everyone else's children.  Take them to get the shot.  The sooner everyone is vaccinated, the sooner we can get rid of these masks.  The sooner life can return to normal.

The virus is in decline primarily because of the numbers of vaccinated people.  Deliver a knockout blow and let's protect the kids.  They have a greater chance of getting hurt riding in a car than from that vaccine.  Over 700 little kids have died from Covid.  Don't let your child be one of them."
2021-10-29 20:44,"At last! My six year old can get vaccinated and we’ll know we’re all doing our part to protect the immune-compromised 4 year old. 

The 4 year old was in the ICU in March 2020, the week the world shut down, when he came down with effects of a rare immune condition. COVID has been like a bad dream, with him being immune suppressed to stop his disorder. This finally makes it feel like there may be an end on the horizon for our family."
2021-10-29 21:13,I think I'll sleep a lot easier once my kids get their shots completed; their safety has been a huge concern for me during all of this
2021-10-29 21:26,Such wonderful news that our kids will soon have another layer of protection.
2021-10-29 21:57,"""But whether it will help substantially to curb the pandemic is unclear.""'  In thereafter focusing on Covid's comparatively smaller risk to children, this article overlooks the main benefit of getting 5-11 year olds fully vaccinated -- it much reduces the risk that they will be vectors for infecting others, such as their grandparents.  In short, it unambiguously and substantially helps with herd immunity.  I therefore worry that this article risks confusing the main point of getting children vaccinated -- not simply to protect them but rather to protect others."
2021-10-29 21:29,My children will be first in line as soon as we get the green Light it’s about protecting each other
2021-10-29 22:29,"Why not vaccinate children at schools? That way, parents don't have to take time off work, the school year isn't disrupted, and low income neighborhoods can get the same quality of service that well off districts get.

Plus, you can vaccinate hundreds at once, instead of hundreds over the next weeks and months."
2021-10-29 23:39,A pretty cautious emergency authorization with a range of opinions expressed by the committee members making it available but stopping short of recommending it for all children let alone mandating it. Proceed with caution based on individual risks and circumstances.
2021-10-30 0:10,Once everyone has the option to be vaccinated I hope masks will be optional at school. I’ll vaccinate are my kids and I would prefer they did not have to mask all day.
2021-10-30 0:11,"I watched the entire FDA expert panel discussion:

1. Members widely opposed a vaccine mandate, citing insufficient benefit-risk ratio in this age group, particularly with lower rates of community transmission leading to higher incidence of myocarditis then COVID hospitalization. Several were specifically concerned that their vote would lead to a vaccine mandate.
2. Many members voiced concern that the binary question they were given was too black and white. They felt that there were a small number of children in high risk groups who needed access to the vaccine, but that the question as posed did not permit them to reveal their caveats that the Yes answer didn’t necessarily apply to all children.
3. The Yes votes were to permit ACCESS to vaccines for children in this group—not an endorsement of widespread benefit.
4. Myocarditis is a significant concern that was not able to be assessed in this small cohort. They indicated the adverse event reporting would be monitored closely, but no data was available from this trial to appropriately model incidence in this age group. Some members anticipated that the incidence would be lower than adolescents and young men based on known links with testosterone.
5. No one endorsed vaccinating this age group to protect adults. The abstention member specifically voiced concerns over the ethics of suggesting this. Additionally they noted no data actually demonstrated reduced rates of transmission after vaccination in this trial."
2021-10-30 0:58,"Although my child is a fully vaccinated adult, this is a good decision. I do hope that most school districts mandate this vaccine. In another New York Times article, young people account for a significant percentage of the current cases in the United Kingdom. Vaccines are the best way to bring an end to the severity of this pandemic. Although children under 12 are not getting sick at a high rate now, if the virus has no place else to go, it will mutate to infect younger people eventually if they are not vaccinated."
2021-10-29 23:51,"The comments from a voting member for the FDA Panel, Dr. Eric Rubin , is chilling: ""We're never gonna learn about how safe the vaccine is until we start giving it.""

Based on Canadian Data - the average age of death from  COVID is 85Y, average age of hospitalization is 70Y.    I can't tie the Dr statement with the risk data."
2021-10-29 23:54,"Back before the vaccine, a family I’m friends with had a “safe” gathering with another family. The father and one of their kids got Covid. Both recovered after isolating. But the daughter, then 10, has emerged with permanent lung damage. They are struggling to understand and deal with a radical change to her capabilities and future. 

People are far too cavalier about the risks kids face. Death is a terrible risk, but it’s far from the only one."
2021-10-29 22:29,"As a parent of two children under 5, I’m furious that we’re again being told that the data is still a few more months off. We’ve been told this so many times now. No other drug or vaccine has been given this level of scrutiny for this age group. It’s completely unreasonable of the FDA to keep pushing this back by requiring new and excessive data requirements."
2021-10-30 0:28,"The kids bore the brunt of this pandemic. Schools were closed while bars were open. No one really ever considered any other large scale strategy than virtual schools. When the vaccination came, adults rejected it when we could have wiped this thing out. Kids died. Kids spent another summer masked up. Summer camps closed, youth sports curtailed. My kids didn’t complain once about any of this. Unlike the adults who complained about everything and failed them profoundly."
2021-10-30 2:19,"Vaccinated people do get infections when they are exposed to the virus that they are vaccinated against.  That’s true for most bacterial and viral diseases that we have vaccines for.  
Body gets exposed, virus enters body, person tests positive for the infection as the body’s immune system swings into action and overwhelms the viruses before they can gain a foothold, and the body recovers quickly from the infection.  That’s how vaccines work.  They prime the pump of the immune system, so that symptoms of infection are often not even noticed. 

The rates of hospitalization and mortality are now and have always been extremely low in in children under age 12.  That has never changed, thankfully. 
The vaccines seem very, very safe. I’m hoping that schools are never closed again as this pandemic goes on however it goes on. Kids need to be in school, they shouldn’t be isolated."
2021-10-30 3:13,"I think the addition of this age group to vaccine eligibility is a major step forward.  In my county, the case rate per capita has been highest in the 5-11 year old category for the last two months.  But the people who could add the most protection for population at large continue to be the adult refuseniks.  Sadly, I believe we will have another significant surge this winter as far too many remain unvaccinated and the time frame for attaining immunity by winter is closing fast."
2021-10-30 7:28,"The catch-22 is that in order to obtain the vaccine for their children under twelve years of age, parents have to bring their children to the United States, through crowded airports and aeroplanes which present a heightened risk of infection on the way to obtain the vaccine.  And there seems no other option if one wants a vaccine; India, the European states, the UK and others aren't vaccinating under-twelves.  So there is this nail-biting choice between the risk of staying put and the risk of travelling."
2021-10-30 8:14,"Longest week of my life - the time from approval to access.  3 disrupted school years, 2 years of lost play time,  play dates, indoor activities, sports, music lessons, birthday parties.

And then there was venom at school board meetings, avoiding restaurants,  uncertainty with close outdoor play, disrupted family holidays.

Masks going off in the summer, which meant no more grocery store trips for my son,  even with his mask. 

At this point,  I don't care who is vaccinated and who is not.  If the delta wave wasn't enough to convince the skeptical, nothing will be.  

I just want my 6 year old son protected, finally."
2021-10-30 10:51,"It is a shame that children are taken care of last when it comes to vaccines. Every time it is the same story. After keeping children away from school, sports, and thriving life and subjecting them to no vaccination for all this time the cure for them is always the same. A lesser dose of the same adult vaccines is always prescribed. 

Children must be vaccinated when vaccination starts for adults."
2021-10-29 22:03,"This is such great news, because Pfizer is guaranteeing that they are going to be able to help lower the death rate from Covid among children, from almost none to almost none..."
2021-10-30 2:49,"At last there is a light at the end of two years living essentially sheltered in place. 

I’m prepared that at some point we’ll get a break through infection but at least there’s less risk of icu and death!

Thank you scientists :)"
2021-10-30 5:36,"Cautiously optimistic that the light at the end of the tunnel is near as we approach the 2 year mark of the pandemic. Unfortunately the same adult anti vaxxers will extend their belief to their children. 

Getting more shots in more people’s arms will definitely put us on the road to normalcy."
2021-10-30 5:04,"First, thank you so much to the parents and children who offered their arms up for these clinical trials. Three cheers, for you volunteers.

Second, thank you, again."
2021-10-30 5:24,"I see this step as a progress to contain the virus spread in total. This should normaly convince more and more people upto now not willing to get vaccinated to think about. Overhere, e.g. in Germany, case numbers are rising currently again, hospitals get worried about the situation in winter. The vaccination is a help not to end up in hospital in case you get the virus."
2021-10-29 21:09,"One small step forward for the reality-based community; another step sideways and backwards for the Flat Earth Society anti-vaxers.

Onward."
2021-10-29 20:23,"It was reported today in the Times that while proving robust protection against severe disease in adults, the vaccine doesn't materially diminish someone's likelihood of transmitting the delta variant.  Given that kids without underlying conditions are highly unlikely to get very ill, and will spread the variant regardless of vaccination status, vaccinating them makes very little sense.  Pass on my kids."
2021-10-29 19:50,"Yay!!!!!

Now if we can just put a lid on all the anti-vaxxers who believe a chip will be injected into their children’s arms."
2021-10-30 2:23,"With a N of about 2,500 children in the 5-11 trial, I am going to wait and see what the outcomes are before I vax my kids. We will continue to mask and test and take precautions. Other countries are not rushing at vax kids. Feels a little like guinea pigs."

2021-10-29 22:36,"In a related NYT’s article, experts state “even given a low rate of Covid infections, they said, the benefits of vaccination could outweigh the risks because the virus could lead to more serious health consequences than any side effects.”  That’s a lot of “coulds” for a new technology - I hope they know what they’re doing.  Note - I’m not anti-vaccine but a trial of a few thousand kids seems rushed."

2021-10-25 20:08,"Science was never my strong suit, but explain again how the law of averages means we might have a worse flu season, and how using fewer covid mitigation measures than at the height of that pandemic--but still more than ever in any flu season (save last yr's)--means we might have a bad season.  This article doesn't do that job for me."
2021-10-25 20:40,What is the PC thing with pregnant people? I was always taught that women alone can get pregnant or are pregnant.
2021-10-25 20:56,I'm guessing that masking when out in public (along with--of course--vaccination) is contributing a lower level of influenza.
2021-10-25 21:32,"Let's be realistic and acknowledge that last year, as the USA was getting a handle on Covid, varying percentages of 'flu numbers were assigned to Covid as the cause. 

There is just as little evidence that 2020 was a ""light"" 'flu year as there is that the Covid numbers in that tumultuous period were as heavy as they were reported."
2021-10-25 21:59,I get my flu shot tomorrow morning and it's supposed to be a doozy because this coming flu will be bad. This underlines what this article talks about. Interesting that the medical profession has collectively decided that a bad season has to follow a mild one. It seems a bit like hocus pocus but we'll see.
2021-10-25 19:30,"Interesting that the Flu vaccine is made within a chicken egg! If you are not the rare person who is allergic to eggs, an egg is a perfect food for choline and protein!"
2021-10-26 1:26,"I'm all for vaccines, but the influenza vaccination industry has such a poor track record (many years with effectiveness less than 50%) that I no  longer prioritize an annual flu vaccination. Last year the health professionals were practically begging people to get a flu jab (for fear of a double pandemic) and I got it. Then it turned out there was practically no flu season at all. You just can't win.

There was a report that new vaccine production technologies will obsolete the use of eggs in production as well as decrease production lead times by months. This should lead to generally more effective annual vaccines. If that is accomplished, then I'll be back in the annual flu vaccination line."
2021-10-26 2:45,"May we also have ""those who are pregnant"" and/or ""pregnant women and people""? I fully embrace the inclusion of those trans and non-binary who are pregnant by the use of the phrase ""pregnant people,"" and surely English is capacious enough not to only arrive at and use one phrase. Complexity and diversity exist in life and in language."
2021-10-26 3:34,"With so many wearing masks when out in public spaces (like myself) and also using sani-gels, it will be another mild flu season as the last two flu seasons were.  Curious how the experts never say this to the press though.  My worst case of flu was on the Amtrak train when there was standing room only and a person coughed on all of us for 3 hours from NYC to Boston.  24 hours later I was as sick as I have ever been in my entire life -- fever chills and it took weeks to recover.  I wonder if a mask would have helped in that scenario.  Masks are a good thing with infectious diseases."
2021-10-26 3:45,"I had a nasty case of the flu in 1970, when I was 18 and every year since then I've had my shot.  And I haven't had the flu since, at least as far as I can tell.  Nothing that was severe or came on fast and had a lot of body aches and fever like my 1970 experience.   I've just had colds.  I'm inclined to think that while flu shot immunity wanes with time, it doesn't completely go away and while the shot you got most recently might not be a good match, the overall immunity provided by all the shots over the years works well.

The flu shot is primitive technology and I'm kinda surprised that animal rights people don't complain about the treatment of the chicken embryos.  I personally expect they're suffering and I'll be glad when we finally move to the 21st century with flu shots."
2021-10-26 3:15,Are oral detergents and injections a good treatment for the flu?
2021-10-26 8:13,"Looking for bright spots: A positive outcome of mask wearing and social distancing has  greatly reduced ""regular"" flu season severity.

What a shame that as many as one-third of our population cannot bring themselves to participation in what could be a major health breakthrough.

Another bright spot: The stunning effectiveness of the various vaccines in preventing infection and beyond that in reducing serious illness and mortality.

One part pandemic dissolved in an aqua regia like brew of misinformation and malevolence has led. in the US at least, to much unnecessary illness and death."
2021-10-26 2:22,We get less infections and the flu season is “ milder” because we’re wearing masks!
2021-10-26 11:19,"Why is the nasal flu vaccine only recommended for people from 2 to 49 years old. Does it seem less effective for babies and older adults? Or are there risk factors? More side effects? Babies already get so many shots that it seems  worthwhile using something else if possible. And not all older people appreciate repeated injections, either (needle phobia).  Would it be acceptable to give adults and parents the full information and let them decide which is right for them?"

2021-10-26 13:55,"Long waiting times in doctors' offices contribute to the spread of flu. Despite avoiding crowded, closed off areas, and still having food delivered rather than shopping eat the grocery store, I had to wait an hour and a half past the time of my appointment in a pulmonologist's office. Although distanced by a seat or two, many patients came into the closed room, some recently discharged from the hospital. Others were allowed to sit unmasked because they claimed they could not breathe with a mask on. A recent transplant to Miami from Idaho complained that she had waited nearly two and a half hours. Although signing in via list, there appeared no order regarding which patient was shuttled in next. Several days later, I found myself sneezing, with runny nose and low grade fever, despite having had the flu shot. (and booster)"
2021-10-26 14:08,"I give you credit  for being honest re the relative ineffectiveness of the flu vaccine vs the ground breaking success of the covid shots.

When I took my last flu vaccine six or seven yrs. ago it was only 19% effective after the fact. To boot I either (yes, yes I know flu shot buffs, you can't get the flu from the shot) got the flu waiting in the clinic with people coughing all over me or had a bad reaction from the shot. I had a 101.5 fever for two days.

That is an issue with our de facto criminal health care system. It is like the boy that cried wolf ie when we have  ground breaking covid vaccines many people don't believe it because of all the needless shots, procedures, pills etc. that our de facto criminal health care system pushes on us."
2021-10-26 14:13,"Back in the late 60s, as a college student, I remember having a really nasty case of the flu.  I did in fact lose my senses of taste and smell for a time and dropped about 10 lbs. as I had no desire to eat.  So not sure saying taste and smell loss is not a side effect of flu is correct."

2021-10-26 14:51,"After graduating college in the early 70's, I began a long career in various fields of health care.  My first job was in a hospital and although not required, flu vaccines were highly recommended as protection for ourselves and our patients; I've gotten on every year since.
Whether by chance or due to the vaccine, I've never had the flu and the only reaction I've suffered was a slightly sore arm at the injection site now and then.
I have always been a prodigious hand washer and public surface sanitizer whenever possible.  I've wondered why public spaces haven't copied hospitals in installing leg operated sinks and automatic or handle-less doors which significantly reduce passing germs by removing the most frequent carrier....human hands.  In my opinion, installation of hand dryers is nothing more than a giant germ spreader.  I never use them.  
I will continue wearing masks along with sanitizing practices.  I carry wipes to dry my hands and sanitize any common surfaces.  It may seem alarmist but it's kept me cold and flu free for decadesm."
2021-10-26 15:02,"My family was lax about flu shots for several years. Once we went to a family holiday even in my dad's assisted living after we had not been feeling great, and next thing we knew it had a flu outbreak, very dangerous for its elderly residents and miserable for everyone involved.  We did not know if it had to do with us but I did wonder. Then there was the time visited Nana, in her 90s, when we were getting over something or other, and the following week she was in the hospital with pneumonia.  In neither case were we sure of the causes, but we finally got our act together and now we are careful to get our flu shots in October and to take illness seriously when visiting the elderly.  Covid shots too."
2021-10-26 15:16,"Years ago as a 20-something, I caught a virulent case of influenza on a flight to Germany. It resulted in me passing out in a hotel room in Mallorca, where my fall was arrested by the leg of a large and ugly carved-ebony desk. 

Fortunately I missed my nose by a whisker, but had a technicolor black eye that lasted for weeks. I also got no vacation; I was in bed in the hotel room, being fed boluses of paracetamol washed down with bitter orange juice brought by my poor husband, who didn’t get sick—because he had been immunized. I thought I was going to die, then wished I would. Already thin, I was a light-headed reed afterwards and I coughed for nearly a month. 

Suffice it to say I have had a flu shot literally every year since. (I was also in no need of convincing to get vaccinated against Covid.)"
2021-10-26 15:52,"I got a flu shot last year for the 1st time in I can't remember. It was to protect my wife's very fragile health. We also got all 3 of the Pfizer. Neither of us got any reaction to any of it - except for a very sore arm.
I just got my flu shot a few weeks ago. Much different this year.
Felt really rotten for about 3 days. Woke up one night with monumental night sweating. I'm no stranger to sweating at night but this ?? Whoa.

For 18 months our immune systems have been on the sidelines, careful to avoid any contact that could keep us from playing again. Now we find a lot of new competition out there. Microbes didn't stop evolving while our bodies stopped paying attention.

A lot of people will get sick. Not Covid-sick. But they're going to be out-matched by the usual contenders, colds and flu, until their immune systems get back up to speed. Last year lots of us were surprised at how few colds there were. There's no free lunch. It's pay-back time."

2021-10-26 18:46,"Let’s hope that almost two years of COVID precautions have disabused people of the attitude that’s it’s okay to come to work or school if you’re sick.

For years, faculty, administrators, staff and students have dragged themselves to our college when they should have remained at home in bed. 

As a result, every winter I’ve been waylaid by 2-3 bouts of respiratory illness and at least one round of “stomach flu.” 

Working remotely has been a wonderful respite from this annual siege of avoidable sickness. It’s the main reason I dread returning to campus in January.

We get sick leave for a reason, people. If you are ill, please stay home and keep your bugs to yourself!"
2021-10-26 19:53,"I expect we will see flu patterns pretty similar to COVID-19 patterns.  In areas where many resisted vaccines, masking, social distancing, flu is likely to be higher than in areas where many took the vaccine voluntarily, mask at least in doors, and are still cautious about where they go and how close they are to others in crowds. Larger cities that rely on crowded public transportation may see higher rates (not sure the subways are back to capacity ridership tho.) 

That said, I wonder how the return of school and and 
 professional sports spectators will affect the flu season, as well as the possible next wave of Covid? Especially the inside sports? No social distancing, lots of shouting and yelling (with dispersal of droplets), and who is going to give up an expensive ticket/seat due to a bit of a cough???"

I rarely get sick, and as an adult I don't recall ever running a fever.

That flu virus! I was bed ridden for over a week, completely knocked out and barely able to help myself. I slept and ""lived"" in a separate room from the rest of my family. I vaguely recall my son being upset that we couldn't play.

One night, around 3 am, I was awake but completely exhausted and feeling like I had no options left. I was sinking into a state of less awareness, and thought of calling 911 and then going out on the porch to die, but I didn't want to wake up my family. There is nothing rational about any of this. My sense of judgement was also gone.

Looking back, I don't know what kept me alive -- probably the thought of who I'd be leaving behind.

It took me several days to get back to ""normal"" although it really took a few weeks for my body to forget what it went through.

I just went in for a shot of this year's bet. I'd gladly take a shot once a week to avoid ever going through that again."

I figured I'd take my chances (had flu once in my early 20s and it was heinous, so I know the risk).

Then Covid. I was vaccinated the very day my age group became eligible (lucky fluke of timing). But I still don't want the flu vaccine. I clearly have a blind spot and am operating on some Krueger-Dunning bias, but can't identify the emotion that's attached to it. Odd."

Where is she getting this information. I cannot understand why she wants to believe some yahoo rather than a legitimate source such as the CDC. She seemed to be a reasonably intelligent woman once upon a time.
2021-10-28 15:31,"Overall a decent article, but I think he should have devoted more attention to the antivirals. (I am a retired physicians associate with 40+ years clinical experience.) Flu vaccines are not 100% effective; a few years back, the vaccine was only 34% effective, so getting a shot is no guarantee of preventing illness.

So what to do if you do get influenza? The medical literature, especially the CDC guidelines for physicians, stresses starting the antivirals ASAP, preferably within the first 48 hours. The longer the delay, the less effective the medicine becomes. So, the key message is get on the stick! If you think you have influenza, get tested ASAP and if either the test is positive or the clinical picture strongly suggests influenza, start an antiviral. The medicines are safe and well tolerated.

Nursing homes or assisted living facilities require special attention. The antiviral Tamiflu can be given to PREVENT the flu. So, if a senior is exposed, it is good practice to start everyone in the facility on Tamiflu ASAP, to avoid life threatening cases. Again, check the CDC guidelines.

I agree with the comment below; the article is wishy washy. I expect better from the NYT."

When a disease is serious like covid with over 700k Americans dead in a short time and they have a proven vaccine for it, it will be foolish not to take it.

I am fully vaccinated.

With the flu shot our de facto criminal health care system comes in.

It is notoriously ineffective with some yrs. at 10% due to so many strains.

I stopped taking it 7 yrs. ago when I either caught the flu waited in the clinic or got a bad reaction from the shot and had a 101.5 fever for two day. I later found out it was 19% effective and said to myself why am I taking this to make big phrama richer?

Neither vaccine has caused us to grow extra limbs, improved our cell service, made us magnetic, or caused us to glow (see also ""luciferase"", the new paranoia).

I still plan on masking in public.  I've liked not getting sick during the last year and a half.  I was a hand washer and sanitizer long before COVID hit, though maybe not as intense as what COVID required.  

It's all about taking the preventative measures you can.  Getting sick isn't a badge of honor.  If people are taking meds for other conditions (cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.) then I don't understand why this is any different.

In normal times, the kinds of decisions these people make can and should wait for perfect information; in a pandemic, where distribution and uptake of vaccines takes time, not so much.  I also find it alarming that their largest concern for the downside of approving boosters is that it will make people think the vaccines are ineffective - surely after the mask advice fiasco they would have learned that announcing policies in order to manipulate the beliefs of the population is inappropriate and frequently backfires.  If the truth is (1) Most people don't actually need the booster but (2) the boosters cause no harm, it would be far better to simply be honest and transparent."

If there are none or limited, then giving boosters (even with limited evidence of further efficacy against hospitalization or severe illness) seems prudent.   We know that boosters do boost immune response, and therefore might prevent the long-haul Covid consequences that may occur in mild or asymptomatic infections."
2021-10-25 13:21,"There are two sides to every argument, pro and con. Either the vaccine booster is needed or it’s not. Data from Israel has indicate that it is, and our own studies have shown that post-vaccination immunity wanes over time. And let’s remember that millions of Americans refuse to mask up in crowded places, refuse to practice social distancing, do not wash their hands frequently, and haven’t accepted vaccination against Covid, leaving those who have been vaccinated with little choice but to take the booster shot, if only to better their chances against the unenlightened dissenters. The process of decision-making and precedence-setting by the FDA and CDC, though, is so complicated and involves so many panels that confusion seems to be their main output. Too many people, too many voices, too many opportunities for conflict. The buck has to stop somewhere, and the public has to regain confidence in the centralized medical community. We need more authority and fewer authoritarians. Decisions must be made based solely on medical facts, and the fact is that the vaccines help and the boosters are needed. Period."

Their ability to live safely is unusually high, and they probably have the wealth to weather a six-month illness recovery.

As a 50 year old teacher who spends my days with over 100 students whose vaccination rate is one of the lowest in my area, I am very grateful for the opportunity to booster.  If I become sick for a short time, there are no substitutes.  My colleagues just have to cover my class and push more planning and grading into overtime.  If I become sick for a long time, I risk losing my home and my retirement income.  

The health care and education industries are already losing staff at an unusually high rate.  Some are leaving because they believe the lies Fox News and Facebook tell them about the vaccine.  Others are leaving before their mental and physical health are damaged irrevocably by the stress, pressure, and abuse inherent in our jobs.   Others couldn't leave healthily, and they died or became disabled on the job.  For those of us who want or need to stay, it is unconscionable to expect us to absorb the risk of long COVID in order to maintain consistent vaccine marketing messages."

Preventing ONLY so-called ""severe"" disease, hospitalization and death is not sufficient when many of those who contract only ""mild"" disease go on to develop long Covid, and/or miss several weeks of work or school, spread disease to those who are unvaccinated through no fault of their own or who are otherwise more vulnerable to the disease. Apparently the effectiveness of the first round of vaccines against infection and mild disease wanes significantly in six months -- of course people who want boosters should be allowed them."

2021-10-25 13:33,"If the CDC and FDA have been thoughtful about a single thing related to Covid its been their reluctance to endorse universal booster shots. 

Covid has been and continues to be a virus that kills the elderly and sick. Of 720,000 fatalities less than 50,000 have been people under 50 years old (out of a population of 210,000,000).     While more vulnerable 50 - 64 year olds only account for 129,000 deaths. The vast, vast majority of fatalities have been people over 65 (population 40,000,000) with 550,000 (196,000 over 85). 

Boosters for people with specific health issues under 65 and universally for those over 65 makes sense but for those under 65 makes little. 

For folks under 50? It really starts to look like the only people with something to gain work for pharma companies."

2021-10-25 13:42,"When is evidence perfect?  When is imperfect evidence sufficient?  In the face of a pandemic that has ravaged the world, we don’t have answers to these questions. And we have certainly learned that this virus will take advantage of our hesitation. 

Science is about measuring uncertainty. There is uncertainty surrounding who needs boosters to prevent severe disease and death, but is that the defining decision point?  In our fractured US health system, many people have no idea that they have underlying conditions that put them at grave risk if immunity wanes over time, no matter their age. Or that their loved ones do. This uncertainty is overwhelmingly difficult to measure. Protection for these people and those they might infect is paramount."
2021-10-25 13:48,"Boosters really work.  The best documented case is in Israel, where Delta flared up in a mostly-vaccinated population, but the Pfizer booster brought it way down again.
Widespread boosters together with vaccines for children can create herd immunity, and prevent another outbreak of COVID this winter."

Too many policymakers and administrations and media are beholden to profits and shareholders first—citizens, consumers, and workers second, if at all.  It is no wonder that both right and left wing thinkers have little faith and have to scramble to figure out what to do."
2021-10-25 13:57,"I'm equally concerned that the FDA's review panel process encouraged bad decision making, as the article points out. They are not charged with determining the best course of action, only with an up/down decision on what a manufacturer chooses to submit. 

There is some very weak evidence from Israel that Pfizer shots may need a booster for maximum effect. That is likely to result from Pfizer's use of a 3-week spacing between shots, vs. 4 weeks for Moderna. There is absolutely no evidence that a Moderna booster is needed. Yes, it raises neutralizing antibody levels from ""plenty high"" to ""wicked high"", but it's T-cell and B-cell (long term) immunity that really matters from a vaccine (neutralizing antibodies are expected to fade), and that is not fading. They probably should revise Pfizer's approval to require 4-week spacing but Pfizer didn't ask for that.

The Janssen vaccine was sold as one shot, where it is good but not great, but the two-shot results for it seem much better. So that should have a booster, but again Janssen didn't ask to have its original approval changed to two shots (at 2-month minimum spacing, per the evidence), so it's now ""one and done but please get anything as a booster later"". Which is confusing."
2021-10-25 13:57,"I think it's time to stop talking about severe illness, hospitalization and death and start focusing on keeping Americans from getting even moderately sick with COVID, as Dr. Fauci. That's also the approach other countries around the globe have taken.

The US has suffered many more deaths and debilitating COVID illnesses than just about any other nation because of our slow initial response. Let's not do the same with boosters. Delta Plus is now surging in England. 

Let's protect the American people. After all, they paid for vaccine development with their tax dollars and they deserve to be protected.

Thankfully, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson boosters have now been approved."
2021-10-25 13:57,A cursory investigation of the life of a vaccination to prevent viral infections shows that their efficacy is limited over time whether it is a flu shot or a covid shot. Getting a booster gives another layer of life to a vaccine.
2021-10-25 13:58,"This article show how muddled the thinking of many public health officials is.  You can see panelists trying to play nine-dimensional chess around how approving boosters would affect public perception of vaccine efficacy, never mind that there is no actual evidence of an effect either way.

Moreover, the argument that vaccines should only be authorized to prevent severe illness doesn't historically hold water.  Chickenpox vaccines were authorized despite ""only"" preventing about 100 deaths a year.  And public health officials recommend adults of all ages get seasonal flu vaccines, despite the fact that younger adults have a very low chance of dying from seasonal flu (probably comparable to a double-vaccinated individual of the same age from covid)."

2021-10-25 13:59,"Infection presents an opportunity for mutations.  Until enough people in the world are vaccinated to truly create herd immunity, we need to prevent infection - even in those healthy adults who do not become ill.  Boosters are the way to do this.  

The debate about boosters is a question of limited production and supply to vaccinate third world countries versus boosting the wealthy nations' population.  It does not have to be an either-or decision if the manufacturers are required to release the patents which would dramatically increase supply, in my opinion."
2021-10-25 14:00,"FDA makes a decision based upon the data, safety and otherwise, that the vaccine companies submit.  Sounds like many of the panel felt that data was not sufficient. 
Sounds like Pharma and political influence played a large role in boxing the experts into a rushed decision."
2021-10-25 14:00,"[t is no wonder that there is such refusal to be vaccinated for the first time. The confusion, created by media, local, state and federal spokesperson is surreal.  Why is there not one, definitive voice in this nation who clearly, scientifically and without political, financial or self serving interest guide the people of this country to a safe place re this deadly virus."
2021-10-25 14:06,"If there is a reasonable chance that boosters would give additional protection, why recommend against them?  Surely that would be the prudent choice - the possible harm seems to be on the side of not giving boosters.

Of course this assumes that there is enough vaccine that no one is deprived of the initial shots, which presumably provide the bulk of protection.  On an international scale this is certainly not true - many countries do not have enough vaccine.  But international distribution may be more affected by the profit motive than decisions by the US health panels."
2021-10-25 14:07,"In the absence of ""I donate my scarce booster to a developing nation,"" which isn't on offer, the only valid critique of the boosters is not ""do you really need it"" but ""there are greater safety risks from the booster than from potential breakthrough or asymptomatic transmission to the unvaxxed,"" and no one is willing or able to actually offer that critique in good faith."

2021-10-25 14:12,"So here is the reality in one part of the country. New York City has opened up again. Children are back in school. Many people who were allowed to work from home last year are back in the office. Subway ridership is up. And let’s be honest. As more companies go back to the office most workers will have to rely on the subway for transportation to and from work. Many in the city work in open floor formats (no walls no private offices). We are heading into winter soon. All of these things increase risk of exposure. Even if you are not in a high risk profession or at high health risk for severe infection. One of the main public health goals should be to prevent mutations because if we allow more mutations to develop our current vaccines may not offer protection. 

So. In my mind, anyone who feels the need to get a booster should have access to one based on their own determination of risks. 

Prevent spread. Allow people to take extra precaution if they want. It is those who refuse to vaccinate that are the problem. Not those who willingly take a booster"
2021-10-25 14:16,"I'm 61, work every day in a dairy processing plant, we have s mask requirement that isn't followed or enforced, and only a little over 40% of my co workers are vaccinated.  You'd better believe I have an appointment for a booster this coming Saturday.  My getting a booster is depriving no one, and the holdouts wouldn't get vaccinated no matter what I do.  Enough of this already."
2021-10-25 14:19,"This is a debate at the margins, and it detracts from our ability to focus on the real issue:  people should get vaccinated unless they have a medical issue that precludes it, and should wear masks in congregate settings until case counts are very low.  But it’s hard to sell newspaper or TV ads, or generate clicks by repeating this common-sense message."
2021-10-25 14:20,"Colin Powell may have been a recipient of Moderna or Janssen/J&J as primary dose(s). One wonders if he had been allowed to get his booster a few weeks earlier -- as Pfizer recipients were -- before his fatal exposure to the virus, he might still be with us today.
   
This is the price of the regulatory rigidity of the FDA and CDC in insisting upon perfectly apposite data for critical decisions which if delayed may cost lives. 
   
Protecting public health sometimes requires tough decisions using relevant biomedical knowledge, experience, and wisdom when data is limited or absent.  
   
For example, there was absolutely no data that the initial spread of the new COVID-19 virus would be mitigated by masking, but the decision to recommend them was life-saving."
2021-10-25 14:21,"But if we look at what currently is happening in the UK, that has a higher vaccination rate than we do, the indicators are clear that the protection is waning because the infection numbers have gradually been going up. Indeed the Brits are clearly worried about another winter wave and struggling to get booster shots now."
2021-10-25 14:22,"With so many reports of the vaccine waning and rise in infections in places that were quick to vaccinate, surely boosters are needed.
If it cannot harm you, and there is no shortage, it seems a valid precautionary measure while scientists work it out!"
2021-10-25 14:23,"I am 80,  have some co morbidity issues.
I am planning to go to Egypt in March.
I discussed the booster.  Together we decided there was no urgency to get the booster now and I can wait until December.
The reason for waiting is because NO ONE seems to know how long protection really lasts from the first 2 vaccines.
No one has any idea how the booster shot will work or how long it will increase antibody development by the human body.
I want the increased production to be as close to my departure as possible, thus three months before I depart. 
And Egypt is NOT on the do not travel list.  In fact, it may be safer to go to Egypt than some parts of the United States."
2021-10-25 14:23,"The whole issue of booster shots once again shows the lack of a coherent public health system in the US. What I mean by that, is as other commenters have stated, they cannot afford to take time off to deal with a covid case at home, while most of the discussion and cautiousness by the board appears to be about hospitalization. Once you factor that in, it makes more sense to allow booster shots for any group that is in close contact with large numbers of people. 


Alternatively, and I know this might sound crazy, maybe the two Senators holding up family leave and sick pay (you know who they are) could get off their high horse, pass the bill, and provide some safety net for workers. If you did that, then boosters would be needed less."
2021-10-25 14:26,"A vote of 9 to 6 is not “squeaking by.” That said, more evidence with a more thorough review is an excellent idea."

2021-10-25 14:34,"I get the flu shot every year, like clockwork, and have done so for decades. I’m 60 now, healthy, and it has never once occurred to me that I might be staving off my own death or hospitalization. I get a flu vaccine annually because I don’t want to get laid up sick, equally because I want to do my part in limiting the spread of the flu to help those more vulnerable to it, and also because it’s easy, relatively painless (even though I usually experience some side effects), and extremely safe (albeit not without some risk … as is nearly everything in life)."
2021-10-25 14:37,"As an under-65-year-old, I do not understand the insistence that the vaccine confer only enough protection to keep me from dying, and no more. If a booster shot will help me avoid getting an infection in the first place--and all the suffering and potential long-term symptoms that may come from that--why on earth shouldn't the scientists want me to get it? These scientists appear to be actively working against my best interests. I am grateful for sensible people like Walensky and Biden who can see the forest and not just the trees."
2021-10-25 14:37,"For twenty years in R&D I helped develop vaccines and medicines working for Pfizer and Sanofi R&D. I understand we don’t have a definitive DOI (Duration of Immunity) at this time. We all need more time to see when vaccine protection wanes. What I don’t understand is what are the risks that lead some experts to not want the public to access a booster? If there’s a safety issue, I would understand but that’s never been mentioned. So what’s the harm in allowing boosters?"
2021-10-25 14:37,"The ""booster program"" was launched during Biden's Afghanistan debacle. It was launched in an effort to get that debacle off the front pages--pure and simple. It was a blatant political act by the current administration."
2021-10-25 14:38,"If America had the capability to provide massive (that is, accurate) antibody testing, then people could make better informed decisions regarding whether they need a booster. Sadly, we do not."
2021-10-25 14:41,"Since retirement from the world of engineers and scientists I can certainly say that I DONT MISS IT. 

Here you have a situation with three primary solutions to an issue that is able to mutate with time and a population that is not uniformly acceptant of the remedy. 

Add to that the apparent lack of foresight and control of the experimental design !!!

Finally, you have a group of scientists, some of whom cannot see in the dimmer light of experimentation. We don’t always get ALL THE DATA WE MAY DESIRE, there are more often then not holes in the stat of more questions raised by that data that is available, but it’s the ability to make correct inferences from the available data that separate great scientists from the rest. 

Oh how I don’t miss the meetings with those who needed their favorite slippers, their pillow fluffed just right and soft music for their precious ears. Always the nay sayers who needed more data, more time, yet still couldn’t make a decision. 

It may help if these folks go off their bottoms and engaged in the experimental design up front so that they MAY have what they desired at the end."
2021-10-25 14:45,"I think we need to face the fact that covid 19 shots will probably be offered on a yearly basis like flu shots.  And just like flu shots, some will get them and some won't. And this will go on until the next pandemic......................"
2021-10-25 14:45,"It seems some of these experts are splitting hairs and then trying to thread a needle with it to satisfy their personal moral standards rather than addressing protection of the US population, which in this case is the issue.  Boosters in the US are not depriving other countries of vaccines.  The 65 year and the 16 or 18 year old cut off are arbitrary.  We don't know all the underlying conditions that might make a covid infection worse.  As someone who is vaccinated and has just spent the last week and a half dealing with family members (also vaccinated)  immunocompromised enough to get frighteningly ill and now personally suffering from so-called ' mild' symptoms, just stop it.  Stop muddying the pool.  Same goes to the NYTs."
2021-10-25 14:49,They said follow the science but these commenters are no different than the anti maskers. They just want “more immunity” whatever that means and more “safety” even if there is no real justification.
2021-10-25 14:50,"I work on a hospital healthcare setting and boosters are available to us now, but this is precisely why I am waiting, conflicting opinions and evidence as to whether this is necessary at this time. I personally feel protected while working with covid patients with the ample PPE we have available as well as the 2 dose vaccine I have already had. it is also worth noting that the third dose has been a doozy for a number of my coworkers who also had reactions to dose 2 (Pfizer). Everyone is fine now, but if you are going to get dose 3 plan for some down time! (I had hoped having some good time between doses would reduce side effects but apparently not)"
2021-10-25 14:52,"While we say, ""follow the science"", the reality is that the science is unclear and so there should be no surprise that there's no unanimity.  There was a vote and the majority agreed to go forward.  I see no reason to beat a dead horse.  Let's move on rather than add to the confusion."
2021-10-25 14:52,"Since when did we learning the voting totals of health commissioners?  Information is normally good, but details detract the focus from the directions.  Practically no one commenting here has any ability to evaluate the opinions of dissenting officials.  I have multiple minds on mandates, but I arguing about the quality of high tech medical products is not in our lanes.  If the FDA et al approve, then we go with it."
2021-10-25 14:54,"I think getting too may bustiers could make it difficult not to get more, sooner than otherwise necessary. We could then unwittingly build up a tolerance to the bustiers and that would be bad because we think we’re immune but we are not. They should have once a year bustiers like they do for the flu."
2021-10-25 14:56,"So scientists, vaccine experts and medical professionals who are sitting on various advisory committees for FDA & CDC are:

= afraid to express dissenting options so as not to present ‘mixed messages’ or ‘confuse the public”,

= they felt they had to vote to approve boosters because the President had already promised them,

= they felt uncomfortable with the quality of data being presented by Moderna and J&J but still voted to approve boosters.

Most commented anonymously.

The most telling statement: “The door just got bigger and bigger and bigger, it got wider and wider with each step,” Dr. Offit added. “The companies got what they wanted, the administration got what they wanted.”

These aren’t Blue state uneducated, you-know-who-supporting conspiracy theorists.  They are experts in the field of vaccinations and virology.

The experts aren’t comfortable with much of the data being presented but still vote to tell the public what politicians and pharmaceutical companies want so the public can have what it believes will make them safe.

Still wonder why there is vaccine hesitancy out there?  Still wonder why some of us don’t trust Big Pharma?"
2021-10-25 14:59,"If this piece were properly done, the authors would have noted key information about some of the people they quote. For example, as a supporter of the “Great Barrington Declaration”, Cody Meissner is far outside the norm of public health scientists no policy makers. He has been widely discredited and has no legitimate place on the committee ( or on Tufts faculty ). Others cited are quite credible and raise reasonable and important points. But in all cases, more context is critical. These are not normal circumstances and, unfortunately, decisions need to be made with less than complete data. Judgement and discernment are critical as people die every day."
2021-10-25 14:59,"The Biden Administration has a credibility problem named Dr. Fauci, a holdover from the last 10 administrations including Trump's. Fauci lost all credibility with me at least when he first advised against masks and then did a 180 and recommended not only wearing one but two. And the gain of function at the Wuhan Lab and his financing of it it's not clear yet.

And BTW, there is a Director of the FDA and a Director of the CDC plus a Secretary of Health, Xavier Becerra who seems to have been muzzled. So nobody needs to see Fauci on TV anymore. He should resign or be asked to leave."
2021-10-25 15:00,"There is no question that COVID is much more deadly than the flu, and more likely to result in severe illness and hospitalization, or death. I don't worry about dying from the flu, though it's possible -- I get the annual vaccine because I know that with a bad case I will be in bed, burning up and very unhappy. And I really don't worry about being hospitalized or dying from COVID.

But what truly upsets me about this ""debate"" is the myopic focus of the dissenters only on the potential for hospitalization or death. Per the article: ""Much of the dissent in recent hearings sprang from one central contention: that the coronavirus vaccines ... should be used to prevent illness severe enough to require medical attention, not milder infection."" Really, how about the potential neurological damage and potential for ""long COVID,"" which can occur months after mild or even no symptoms.

As the article confirms, the ""advisers"" know that ""the bulk of the evidence ... demonstrates only that the original immunizations were waning in potency against infections."" ""Only?"" A Northwestern study earlier this year found: ""Eight-five percent of patients reported four or more neurological symptoms, problems such as “brain fog” (or attention and memory problems), loss of taste or smell, headache and blurred vision.""

Thanks for looking out for me, dissenters. You are like the blind men with the elephant. Which is widespread in medicine. Just ask Ross Douthat and read his piece from Saturday."
2021-10-25 15:02,"I'm sorry, but this sclerotic process is simply not suited for the kind of pandemic we're currently facing. The disease spread like wildfire while months of safety and efficacy data were gathered in a tiny set of people. Anyone willing to give it a try should have been allowed to, on the condition that they consent to follow-up monitoring. The minimum age to participate should have been decreased gradually, rather than treating 5-11, 12-17, 18-64, and 65+ as distinct groups. And for boosters, unless there's clear evidence of a problem, let people make their own decisions; it's been clear for some time that boosters confer some reduction in breakthrough infection risk, which will help society reduce the reproduction rate."
2021-10-25 15:04,"The booster decision, like EVERYTHING else, was rife with politics. There is a complete void of authenticity in our culture."
2021-10-25 15:07,"I got the booster and had a terrible time for a few days, including fever, and an occasional shortness of breath. The side effects from the third shot were definitely far worse than the first two, and I almost considered going to an emergency room. I was basically first in line for all of my vaccination shots, but I would say that unless one is at risk, the booster may cause a lot of anxiety and anger in the general population, and is probably not the best idea. I know several other people who have reported getting pretty sick from it. If it is going to save your life, yes, but the side effects may be more serious than people realize."
2021-10-25 15:08,"As someone who suffered troubling  side effects from my vaccine shots I’m not even remotely interested in a booster. While there may be some older and immune compromised individuals who could benefit from boosters, I firmly believe this 3rd dose should be a personal choice. 
Doctors should be available to discuss with their  patients the risks and benefits of boosters based on their individual health profile and make decisions  from there.
 The fact that doctors disagree with the necessity for boosters should give everyone reason to proceed with caution."
2021-10-25 15:12,"After two days of 101 plus fever, and the sensation of one hundred pound weights attached to every limb, I think I have had enough of the Pfizer booster - this latest my third....I agree that with each successive vaccine my reactions are getting worse...even with my risk factors - COPD and being a public school teacher..I will be rethinking booster #4..."
2021-10-25 15:14,"I’m 72 and got the Moderna booster on Friday. By Saturday I had a slight headache but other than that I was fine. These people who refuse to get vaccinated are literally walking petri dishes allowing the virus to grow and mutate. They are the reason we cannot finally get past this. I’ve seen them on TV trying to justify their reckless behavior. They claim they are careful about what they put in their bodies but by the look of them, they’re not very careful about the food they put in their bodies. And when they get sick, they are willing to put unproven animal medication into their bodies. Attempting to reason with them is fruitless. Attempting to appease them is dangerous. This has gone on long enough. If we can’t force them to get vaccinated they should be shunned. They should not be allowed to work, travel or leave their houses. And should they get sick, they should not take up a hospital bed that could be used to treat someone with a serious condition that was not voluntarily acquired. Let Darwin’s theory of survival of the fittest play itself out. Our country will be better for it."
2021-10-25 15:15,"I happily got my Moderna booster last Friday and experienced the same side effects I had after the 2nd vaccine dose last February - same sequence of side effects, just a little shorter in duration. Given all the unknowns about the long term effects of (even mild) Covid cases, I'll happily take my chances with the booster. There will never be enough data to satisfy everyone, and the media will certainly find the dissenters who, after a unanimous decision, find doubt in their hearts. Life is full of risks and, to me, there's far less risk with the vaccine than with the disease."
2021-10-25 15:17,"This is helpful. Boosters for those over 65 was very well supported, but the data available to the committee isn’t generating much compelling evidence for everyone else the vaccine has been authorized for. The vaccine message is and should still be get everyone unvaccinated vaccinated because that offers more protection than boosters.

Also the studies and their methodologies and results need to be available to the public as well."
2021-10-25 15:21,The closer is magical quoting Dr Offit however I recall his interview with Dr Topol where he was more cautious than this article represents. Has an honest analysis of the safety data changed his view?
2021-10-25 15:24,"I happily got my J&J booster this past weekend. Day after symptoms were body aches and low-grade fever. I stayed home and watched football. I feel great today and have a lot less stress about whether my vaccine is adequate protection against a virus that would most likely kill me. 

My only complaint is I had to drive to the next county to find J&J since Kroger, whose pharmacy put the J&J vaccine in me in the first place, has decided to no longer offer J&J vaccines."
2021-10-25 15:27,"This article reinforces the hunch I have that the “experts” are making it up as they go along when it comes to what advisories to give to the public.  That may sound like a condemnation, but I don’t see how it could be any other way given the uncharted nature of confronting Covid.

I’m not quite 65, so I’ve never had any real sense of urgency.  At least not until I heard about comparative efficacy levels among the three vaccines – and learned that the J&J dose I was administered came in third.  That’ll stir up your anxiety, and could send me running to the nearest Moderna for a boost.

But I think I’ll wait instead.  The Covid symptoms I experienced early during lockdown left me with a sense that antibodies were keeping me safe.  That in combination with the J&J made me feel like I’m covered.  I still feel that way.

At least until the next news cycle undermines my confidence."
2021-10-25 15:28,"What I would have liked to hear more about is what the exact reasons are that made those advisors have misgivings about making most of the population eligible for booster shots.  Was is that they believe that the possible harm (from the rare, but existing reactions some people have to the shot) outweighs the possible benefit?  Or is it more that the reason behind the booster shots is different from the one that most vaccines are given for (reducing the risk  of more severe or deadly illness), vs. the rationale for the boosters, the prevention of even mild illness and becoming a carrier/vector  ?   I also like more information how having good immunity affects the likelihood of one both getting and then spreading COVID.  At least with the regular vaccinations, the data suggest that immunized people are much less likely to spread COVID even if they get infected. 
I got my flu shot last week, and have decided to get the booster for COVID as well.  Unfortunately, many of my fellow citizens have NOT gotten vaccinated for COVID at all, and thus the risk of encountering people spreading COVID remains high, especially with Delta going strong."
2021-10-25 15:33,Kept reading until the end to see what the downside of getting a booster shot was. Never found it.
2021-10-25 15:34,"Always the emphasis on individual opinions and the CDC.  You would think there were no other institutions dealing with the data (and some of them probably better than CDC).  Good grief, there are all kinds of effective vaccines that need boosters, such as typhoid, so what is this undermining stuff?"
2021-10-25 15:37,The experts are willing to let the ‘worried well” get infected- that will be how those at less risk are boosted. I bet these experts are going to get a booster. Long Covid is no joke.
2021-10-25 15:40,"Many Democrats, like me, have been appalled by the intellectual dishonesty of the Republican Party.
I think it's only fair to ask: What would we be saying if a Trump administration had handled boosters this way?"
2021-10-25 15:41,"Like sausage making this article makes a good argument why we should not be seeing the votes of advisory committee members but rather final recommendations.  Science like all other human endeavors is “messy” especially in an evolving pandemic.  We are not trying to describe the unchanging orbital mechanics of a celestial body but rather the behavior of a virus and a host locked in an evolutionary struggle of fitness and evasion.  Of course there will be unknowns and doubts along the way, but I remain grateful for the fact of vaccination that tips the balance in my favor because I think that I still have something to offer to my society, children and grandchildren.  And Dr Fauci’s views and advice will change right along with the dynamics of the situation just as I hope my physician’s would if I were dealing with any another potentially deadly disease, say an evolving malignancy.  His view of my health needs of a year ago would have much less relevance now."
2021-10-25 15:57,"The most striking comment to me is that medical advisors felt compelled to vote for boosters based on the way the federal authorities framed the questions.  This is such a key point.  If they can frame questions to compel answers they want,  can't they also manipulate the data to reinforce their point of view.  A good case in point is the latest rancor, "" only unvaccinated people  are ending up in hospitals.""  What they do not tell you are the underlying conditions that affect this group of people.  One medical professional stated on NPR that severe outcomes if infected with COVID are inextricably linked to obesity.  Wouldn't it be more informative to say of the unvaccinated who ended up in the hospital X percentage were obese and X percentage were over a certain age.  What is more heinous, based on the manipulation of the data, the break through cases they say are to be expected and the uncertainty even around the issue of boosters, that they can then mandate certain groups of people to get vaccinated, other wise they may lose their job."

2021-10-25 16:00,"This article talks about what Pfizer and Mdoerna wanted...and what the administration wanted...but what about what the PEOPLE want ???

My parents who are both over 100 years old wanted the third shot and were first in line to get it....I work in a high risk setting and with the effectiveness of my initial two shots waning I was very eager to get my third shot and got it this past Saturday and after one day of extreme fatigue and confusion feel great again.

I am a little frustrated that when a third vaccine is clearly beneficial even if it is just on a margin that bureacrats are dictating whether we can get it.  

We deserve our personal freedom to be part of the decisionmaking process here on something so important."
2021-10-25 16:01,"More confusing/contradictory information from CDC, FDA, government, individual experts. I’m now retired with a medical background, my husband is a retired physician, many of our friends are doctors. You best believe we will be getting a booster shot. The overwhelming information supports older individuals getting one, although information on which is the best choice is sketchy at best. It is contradictory and confusing for people with medical/research backgrounds. How must the average citizen with little to no science background parse thru all this conflicting information? So they rely on the media (Fox?), family and friends, and hearsay. And that is one major reason there is so much resistance to getting these vaccines: poor, inconsistent messaging to the public, resulting in citizens making poor choices."
2021-10-25 16:02,"Pfizer One January - no reaction. Pfizer Two February - couple of days of flu like symptoms. Pfizer Boost a week ago today - side effects set in within two hours and I just felt well enough this AM to fold laundry. Redness, swelling and pain at injection site, loss of appetite, flu like symptoms and feeling exhausted constantly. Everything I checked said strong side effects mean immune system is good and side effects may last a 'few' days. Nowhere could I find a definition of 'few'. I'm over 75 and have some underlying conditions."
2021-10-25 16:04,"A lot of confusing info here, so I read less than half of it. I'm getting my booster in 2 hours, and I'm not planning to change my mind. It helps that I'm over 65."
2021-10-25 16:04,"I'm 42.  It's been 7 months since my second Pfizer shot.  I am a middle school teacher.  I have 2 young, unvaccinated children at home.  If I didn't have kids of my own, I wouldn't get the booster, but I'm considering it because I don't want to be a vector for my family."
2021-10-25 16:05,"This really angers me. Those ""experts"" who have misgivings because they are concerned that recommending boosters might convince people that they are ineffective are living in a fantasy world. People who have chosen not to be vaccinated by now don't need any additional ""proof"" that their paranoia is justified.

As for the argument that the vaccines are holding up well against severe illness (defined as requiring hospitalization of death), that's just a definition that needs to be retired. At least one third of all infections result in long term symptoms that result in diminished quality of life. There is also no way of knowing what prior infection means to a person's long term health. Several studies have shown people infected, even with mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, experience mild to significant cognitive decline and MRIs show measurable loss of grey matter in the brain.

I'm not interested in what these ""experts"" consider severe or mild. I want to do everything I can to avoid infection."
2021-10-25 16:06,I'm getting a booster. I'm on chemo and since there are anti mask ant vaccine muscle heads floating around I need to reduce my risk.
2021-10-25 16:06,"Well, since a lot of commenters are offering anecdotal evidence, I'll jump on the bandwagon. I'm 55, in excellent health, with a congenital heart defect, and I got my Pfizer booster last week. Side effects were about the same as Pfizer #2. Some significant arm ache, and about 36 hours of sluggishness. I feel fine now, and a bit less apprehensive about becoming infected or infecting someone else. But the next time this booster question arises, I will reach out to my cardiologist for guidance."
2021-10-25 16:07,"Having difficult time figuring out where the bar is being set for 3rd shots for under-65. I am assuming (hoping!) that if it improves chances of surviving an infection significantly, the extra shot would be approved. But what about avoiding getting infected at all? Are we OK with letting the virus do some long term damage to brain, heart, or lungs, but not so much that it kills you? Or would reducing chance of passing infection significantly good enough to approve shots? A mean, it is being approved for health workers, so that suggest that there is belief they have benefit when you are exposed to virus. Impression I am getting is that overall experts saying most vaccinated people are unlikely to die and that is good enough. But of course, no one is willing to come out and say that."
2021-10-25 16:07,So we can't trust the experts? Who would have thunk it?
2021-10-25 16:10,"The front screen of this newspaper reports the daily total infections and trends. Not hospitalization; not deaths. Total infections. And this newspaper is not alone—it's the metric everyone from Johns Hopkins on down uses. 

Given this—you cannot expect public confidence in just ""prevents hospitalization and death"" when total cases has been the pandemic's measure for soon-to-be two years. 

It's unviable for scientists to discourage boosters because they're not needed to prevent hospitalization while the public remains focused on infection-at-all."
2021-10-25 16:12,"If the booster shot is weighed in medical cost/benefit comparisons: one opportunity cost of the US boosters is they may have a larger marginal utility and higher ROIs for US residents if they were used in other countries with very low vaccination rates, instead.   

For example: the Sept. 15, 2021 website for Nature states that: for low-income countries only 0.6% of the population has been fully vaccinated, and only 10.3% of lower-middle- income residents have been fully vaccinated, with 49.5% of upper-middle-income countries' populations fully vaccinated, and 54.8% of upper-income-countries' residents fully vaccinated. 

The latest data from the Times reports that 57% of individuals in the US have been fully vaccinated as of Oct. 22, 2021.

Since the source of mutations is the evolving virus, and these lower-income countries provide pools of genetic material feeding into new cases and often new genetic variations that in the past have often shown to be more infectious and morbid variants, it is an international problem we face. And, with the data clearly showing the importance of being fully vaccinated in increasing resistance to the illness, how to globally best ration our limited resources to maximize their ROIs from targeting the virus is critical.

2021-10-25 16:13,"This confirms my suspicions about the booster recommendations - that there is evidence to recommend boosters to those over 65 and those with some specific immune issues, but little data that a booster would meaningfully change outcomes for other populations. 

I am pregnant now and know that pregnant women are a group eligible for boosters. I won't be getting one unless there is data showing one of the following:
(1) Higher rates of moderate or serious infection in healthy young people previously vaccinated with Moderna.
(2) Vaccinated pregnant women with break through infections fare meaningfully worse than vaccinated non-pregnant people. 
(3) A surge of antibodies from the booster would provide greater protection to the newborn baby than my existing antibody levels would.

I haven't seen any of the above data, so will hold off on the booster for now. I know these vaccines are generally low risk, but there is still some risk, and if there is no benefit, why would I do that? (For the record I've had my flu shot and will get my TDAP booster - both of which have proven benefits to pregnant women / caregivers of babies!)"
2021-10-25 16:17,"It is apparent that “following the science” doesn’t necessarily lead to the same policy decisions.  It really depends on the public health goals of vaccines and the pandemic.  If the desired public health outcomes for vaccines are a reduction in death, severe illness and hospitalization from Covid-19, then limiting boosters to the most vulnerable individuals makes sense.  However, if the goal is to reduce virus transmission and the overall COVID caseload then a broader use of booster shots makes sense.  There really is not a “correct” answer to the policy decision.  That is why countries are enacting different policies on vaccine booster shots.  As mentioned by others, Israel is requiring booster shots for its vaccinated population."
2021-10-25 16:20,"Bottom line: Absent a solid consensus one way or the other, it's good that we have a choice. I have every intention of getting a booster, and as soon as possible. Originally had Moderna, and will stick with that if I can. I am over 65. The anti-vaxxers, nutty as they may be, will probably not have their minds changed, not matter what they hear or read. Sad."
2021-10-25 16:21,"The questions never answered with specificity in these comments from the experts are, first and foremost what the boosters, eg Moderna, do for the person’s response level, and then what harm if any does the booster do even if the response level is not raised much or at all.

These two questions are never addressed with the specificity by these doctors or Big Pharma.

So what are the answers?"
2021-10-25 16:22,"I just got the Moderna booster and I felt the same way I felt after the second dose-a sore arm and very slight headache for two days. I know someone who was fully vaccinated and healthy and he got a breakthrough case of Covid and pretty quickly died-so I am not taking chances. I wear a mask everywhere and I got a flu shot, as I do every year."
2021-10-25 16:24,"A lot of people have the expectation that the vaccine is good enough that at least completely vaccinated people can freely associate more or less as normal without cumbersome mitigations.

The waning efficacy of the vaccine seems like it puts people at a much higher risk of infection.  The statement that it's ""still highly effective against severe illness, hospitalization and death"" doesn't seem to mean much.

To some degree, it seems like the ""health and scientific authorities"" have moved the goal posts on what the vaccine can accomplish long-term and boosters sure sound like a way of regaining their value.

There's also a sense that opposition to boosters was some kind of zero-sum issue because it at least had the optics of denying vaccines to impoverished places, and the booster's value was being reduced for reasons other than its effectiveness against disease, and instead because it was somehow harmful to less developed people.  This may be right (I would challenge much of the argument on logistics grounds in impoverished, often tropical locations), but its always been a losing argument to tell Americans they should suffer more for someone else's benefit."
2021-10-25 16:27,"Since I am 70  and got my second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine 8 months ago, I scheduled my booster for the day after the final approval. However, I would prefer that more effort and resources be considered for routine testing for the virus and, if practical, the antibodies. I would like to take a rapid test at home before or after going out to crowded public places. I'd also like to be able to get my antibodies checked when I have an annual physical or at specified intervals. Just getting a booster is a relief, but without evidence may be a waste of a dose that could go to someone not yet vaccinated."
2021-10-25 16:28,"As others have mentioned, what exactly are the members of the committees concerned about when they say there’s a lack of data? Other than the political and ethical issues, is there a potential longterm side effect of having three shots?

I’m on the fence about getting a booster. I had two doses of Pfizer last March and am around 60. (I’m eligible to get one.) Quite a few vaccinated people I know have gotten Covid recently - most with “minor” symptoms, but nevertheless pretty icky ones. So I don’t want to get it, or long Covid. 

But I also don’t want to set myself up for longterm health issues from three shots if that’s a concern due to lack of data. The articles about this need to be more specific about these experts’ concerns."
2021-10-25 16:30,"If the media weren't reporting on this like it was a sporting event -- covering all the play-by-play action -- people wouldn't be confused.

Not too long ago, the media simply covered what the FDA or CDC recommended and that was it. No confusion. No second-guessing. Just the recommendations.

I don't think covering the pandemic like it's a football game is beneficial if clear and accurate reporting is the media's goal. If the goal is clicks, then I guess the football coverage works."
2021-10-25 16:31,"And then wonder why science has become political....blaming on one party when our once free lives are now fully political without regard to science. 

The vaccinated still spread Covid just fine, complete with waves occurring after mass vaccination.  Death after vaccination is still a thing for the old and those with unhealthy immune responses.

But at least Pharma and Biden are happy their cronyism lifted their boats."
2021-10-25 16:31,"If sufficient immunity is attained for most with original doses shouldn’t the booster doses, aside from those already designated, be used in the worldwide fight for herd immunity? Or is that totally given up on? Without cross-border and trans-national cooperation COVID and the next pandemic (and the next) will make these politics and dithering over mass vaccination seem either quaint or nauseating to future generations, that is if the species survives. Coming waves of formerly localized animal viruses will continue to jump to humans and spread along the human global supply chains they have taken full advantage of with COVID. Makes it seem like humans invented international travel and trade specifically for the benefit of viral evolution, transmission and procreation. Are humans just another evolutionary construct, simply hosts, in the ongoing dominance of microbiology? They evolve at light speed compared with their mammalian carriers. When seen this way it’s logical to conclude the virus, rather than the human, is the most successful example of known living things on this Earth, despite what their unvaccinated hosts might claim on their way to the ICU."
2021-10-25 16:34,"Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between replacement advice, which is issued when research improves on advice that came before it, and a full reversal, which comes about because a common medical practice got ahead of the science and never actually worked or even caused harm.

The truth is ...what may seem like a good idea today may not be so good tomorrow."
2021-10-25 16:38,"What is this, ""in our hearts..."" ? Does not seem very scientific to me.

Either the booster has long-term side-effects that are undesirable or they are ineffective.

If neither, and the boosters are approved for categories including the vague ""increased risk"" not to do with age, immune status, then the Fed Advisers should stay mum and stop muddying the waters."
2021-10-25 16:39,"Wait a darned minute.  Is the NYTimes questioning the conventional wisdom about booster shots?

You had better be careful.  Twitter and Facebook are likely to ban links to this article."
2021-10-25 16:40,"This article should have never been published. It is a first draft that requires a public health specialist to review and get the information necessary to contextualize what these panel/committee members are saying.  

At the same time, no specialist serving on these panels and committees should be speaking in this way. They have a responsibility to vote based on their knowledge and the current conditions of the pandemic.  If they feel they can’t do this, they should quit.  Qualification entails not just credentials but also maturity.  

Finally, I have now read three different accounts  published in the same newspaper of the vote on  Pfizer booster regarding 18-49 yr old people who work in places with high exposure.  The US does not have a public health strategy or infrastructure to handle crises - and unfortunately this includes qualified media outlets."
2021-10-25 16:41,Do the boosters stimulate production of both B cells AND T cells?   Does anyone know?
2021-10-25 16:42,"“Much of the dissent in recent hearings sprang from one central contention: that the coronavirus vaccines, like nearly all other vaccines, should be used to prevent illness severe enough to require medical attention, not milder infection.”

Funny, could have sworn that vaccines were meant to prevent the spread of COVID.  Mild cases spread illness and keep the virus mutating.  Has the goal moved?  Who moved it and why?

As for “mild” cases, the distinction between mild and severe COVID is pretty bogus in a country without affordable universal healthcare coverage, where even people with insurance can go bankrupt from bills following hospitalization.

Just because people stay home doesn’t mean they aren’t severely ill."
2021-10-25 16:44,"I was fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine in May, and I caught covid recently. I was very, very sick for almost two weeks and still have lingering symptoms. I’m 37 and very healthy. The vaccine surely kept me alive and out of the hospital, but the illness itself was unlike anything I’ve ever had. It was horrible. Let people get boosters for goodness sake."
2021-10-25 16:47,"This hand-wringing and finger-pointing is why we got our booster shots at the end of August, before the agonizing and turf wars began. Our local Health Department gave us - we are seniors - a full-dose Moderna booster, no questions asked. 

Two weeks later, the disputes reported in this article had begun, and the door had closed on Moderna boosters. (Pfizers remained available, albeit with restrictions.)

Limiting hospitalization and death means limiting severe, life-threatening illness. We have learned of breakthrough infections that, while not requiring hospitalization, caused fevers of 103 to 105 degrees, with lingering symptoms that lasted for weeks.  That is not tolerable; I'm sorry, that is not a ""mild"" illness, particularly in an older adult. 

As for Dr. Offit, who believes that it is unethical to give Americans boosters when poorer nations don't yet have access; the US and  pharmaceutical companies are indeed sending vaccines abroad, for humanitarian reasons and to prevent variants; and you have no right to weigh my health against your principles.

Waning immunities would seem to require boosters. Israel provided boosters to everyone over age 12. The Delta Plus variant may prove even more contagious - transmissible - than Delta.

This after-the-fact agonizing does, in fact, muddy the waters. The real world forced the scientists to respond, despite imperfect data; what is wrong with that? The real world is where we all live, and get sick."
2021-10-25 16:47,Israel from the beginning agreed to be a real time country wide lab for the widespread use of vaccinations. The research reveals that a third vaccination is absolutely necessary and the country is well into the third round. Before too long a booster shot may be necessary for tourists who want to visit Israel.Here in Canada I hope that the third jab will be mandatory soon. At least for the 65+ crowd.
2021-10-25 16:52,"Busy bees buzz. 

Those trained in classic public health vaccination are doing trade offs. 

The big classic trade off is only vaccinate to stop serious hospitalizations. And even that goal is a trade off metric set statistically. Science in the way the rate of inflation is science. Measure and choose your trade offs based on inadequate data. 

Should the United States vaccinate to try and bring covid to minimal levels in the US? The classic public health people say No!

Should the United States vaccinate the world to classic public health levels of no serious hospitalizations? The classic public health people say Yes!

But so what. This isn’t science they are doing. This is the trade off value judgment of classic public health vaccination. In case you haven’t notice those days are over. 

Is there a net gain in public health if everyone in the US has three Covid vaccination shots? Apparently the answer is clear. Absolutely there is a net gain. 

But the old school has misgivings about this since they are loyal to higher gods and so busy bees buzz. 

Same crowd that said

N95 masks are scarce so you can’t have one you civilian you. 

That said

Covid isn’t spread aerosol wise. 

That said

Load isn’t related to infection. 

All dead wrong to the tune of over two hundred thousand dead."
2021-10-25 16:52,"Since the side effects of vaccination is weak and the risk is very small why wouldn't one get a booster, at worst a shot with no benefit and at best it will prevent serious or non-serious disease.  However, if we wanted to preserve vaccines to ship around the world these dosages could be questionable.  It depends upon criterion to be used.."
2021-10-25 16:56,"There's lots of differing opinion here, and the article is simply pointing this out. 

I got 2 Moderna in Feb-March of this year. I'm a teacher. I'll get the booster before Xmas. 

If I wasn't in such a person-filled workspace, I wouldn't get a booster till next Easter."
2021-10-25 17:03,Can they just vote based on what is best based on science and now how they imagine ppl will interpret their recommendations?? plz just let me know if it is safe for me to get a booster.
2021-10-25 17:10,"Thanks for helping us understand the messiness of these decisions. I’m grateful to the doctors and scientists who shared the complex nuances of their deliberations and the many factors that played into their votes. Expecting clean-cut decisions with 100% certainty is as naive as expecting vaccines with 100% efficacy. 
This article points out some missteps by the administration and the President in their messaging around boosters, flaws in the way questions were presented to committees, and difficulties in assessing limited data in the midst of an ongoing health crisis. But I do not see in it any cause for hysteria, panic, or conspiracy-mongering. Even more shocking to me are the comments arguing that the NYT and these experts should not have published their views, at all! We are in a tough situation, and we don’t have all the knowledge we would like to have; but the answer to that is not to reject valid information, nor to shut down the rational, critical thinking of experts in the field."
2021-10-25 14:39,"Why do these doctors think that it's OK to get Covid as long as it doesn't kill most people?  I got J&J.  Whether it kills me or not, I want to minimize my risk of getting covid.  I'm getting a Moderna booster on Wednesday and I am happy about that.  J&J recipients have been left dangling in the wind for months."

2021-10-25 14:49,"To the author of this article:

As soon as I saw the byline “In our hearts…don’t quite agree… with booster shots”—

I thought it was probably Paul Offit, and I was right.

Why do you keep quoting Paul Offit in your articles, often at the beginning and the end? He’s known to be outspoken, but that doesn’t mean you should quote him repeatedly.

And in terms of why the confusion with the booster shot, we can turn to Joe Biden who prematurely pounced on booster shots as a “catch up” device after badly missing the ball in his response to the Delta variant crisis."

2021-10-25 16:45,"There are a disproportionate number of pediatricians on that committee. Maybe add some Infectious disease doctors who treat adults. Also, the whining and backstabbing of these folks, after the fact, is petty."
2021-10-25 16:58,"First off, this is pretty much the same advice—and the same dissents—that were being reported as coming down the pike a month or so ago. I don’t get the surprise, and I certainly don’t get what’s such a mystery about the way that medical science (and science in general) works: a consensus develops, there’s disagreement, things get hashed out, better data comes along, andaway we go.

What I DO get is that most of the public confusion is self-inflicted, a combo of politics, willful ignorance, ignorance of basic science, and just plain taking counsel of one’s fears. With a whole bunch of quacks, anti-vaxxers, and reps from Big Health Food throwing gas on the fires.

First we all yakked about whether this was even a thing. Then we yakked about gee, what about a mask and washing my hands? Then it was screaming about where are the vaccines. Then it was aiieeee, here come the Satanic Vaccines. Then it was gimme Pfizer, it’s two percent better. Now it’s gee I wish I got Moderna, it’s better. And so on.

And to advert to what this article’s about, first we yelled about how CDC won’t tell us straight, then yelled about how CDC was repressing dissent. Now it’s the CDC’s telling us straight, and how come there’s this dissent?

The docs are mostly doing just fine. It’s us I worry about. 

This ain’t complex. If you’re over 65, or in some cases immune-suppressed, the risk of a bad breakthrough case probably outweighs the very small risk of a booster. Big whoop."
2021-10-25 17:14,"Thank you for this article.
I have been wondering what the science was behind the booster recommendation."
2021-10-25 17:14,"New technology but old thinking.  We could protect people against cold sores and genital herpes with mRNA vaccines if we wanted to, maybe even strep and salmonella.  If your goal is only to prevent hospitalization, then I don't want you as my physician, and I'm glad Biden represents me by overriding you.

After Covid, work on a better flu vaccine.  We already had the technology before mRNA vaccines, but the same experts who ignore Covid for anything less than severe disease have told us that we need less effective flu vaccines to keep costs down and availability high.  Sometimes you can get a quadrivalent flu vaccine, but the experts won't let anyone make a vigintivalent flu vaccine because it wouldn't be fair to those who can't afford it.  We could have a flu shot that would do more than slightly shorten the duration, but we let the tail wag the dog instead of finding funding so that everyone in the US can get an effective flu shot."
2021-10-25 17:14,"I went and got one on Friday as soon as they made the announcement, but I was skeptical about the need for one. I am in a riskier profession in healthcare and some of my coworkers have stubbornly refused to get vaccinated. Otherwise I am healthy and no r over 50. I really wasn’t sold on the booster. But I also go out a bit and sometimes don’t wear a mask, but I felt I was well-protected. I don’t think I would have gotten the booster if I’d read this article first! It made me feel chilly sick all Saturday and I still have a bit of a headache today Monday. I am not really sure it was necessary! I really hope it doesn’t cause me long term problems!!! I was doing well with the two doses, I run a lot etc. it may turn out to be a good idea, but I am not sure it was really necessary. It seems like the companies are really trying to make more money!"
2021-10-25 17:14,"The question of whether severe illness or hospitalization is unlikely without a booster is the main issue for those who voiced dissent.  But for me, the prospect of getting infected with waning efficacy although vaccinated earlier this year, having no symptoms, and getting an unvaccinated person infected is a big issue.  And is the better question for the broader public health goal.  If lives can be saved with a booster then do it. Period. Immune responses are better, fewer vaccinated people get infected, and the spread to the unvaccinated population is reduced.  I do not see the dissenters as looking at such a big picture.  So, what am I missing here?"
2021-10-25 17:15,"I have read several comments here about illness after breakthrough infections post-vaccine, but none about breakthrough infection post-infection..natural immunity.  Covid passports in Europe allow for proof of prior infection..in NYC, you don't even have to be fully vaccinated..go see the Knicks if you had one dose in February 2021!  Why does The Science in Europe take into account natural immunity , but not here?  Anyone?"
2021-10-25 17:17,"I am so, so happy.

Here, the worm turns and researchers are dealing with all their hard and fast research rules.

I say this as a researcher who, in training, was endlessly frustrated by the methodological demands of attempting to draw meaningful, reliable, valid data from humans, the most challenging research topic in all of science. Tthough social research is not, strictly speaking, considered real science by the great minds that are subject of this report.

Here they are, whining, complaining, boldly objecting to surveys in which they have to answer the questions asked of them.

It's called Forced Choice, and it's how we do things.  N, Doctor, you do not get to explain your reasons, we don't care.  If we did, we'd find a way to ask.

You don't get to answer ""Mostly I kind of feel like a five on this one but there times I get really close to a four, ... although I have had six moments recently.""

 Or, ""I'll say five, but I feel pretty bad about it.""

Keep it to yourself, Doc.

We social scientists have all we can do squeezing ourselves into your methodological boxes to maintain funding and some modicum of professional respect.  There's only so far we can go to get into The Real Science Guy Club.  You already won't show us the secret hand shake.

If you're really that concerned, we designed interesting ways you can tell us what you think, and why.  On a sample or population basis we can even approach validity, if consider Construct Validity valid."
2021-10-25 17:23,"Why aren't antibody levels being checked? We do that for hepatitis B. Is it possible that some people respond less robustly to the vaccine and that's why breakthrough cases occur?

Is it possible that widespread vaccination using a vaccine that is not 100% effective against all strains is selecting for the resistant strains of the virus?"
2021-10-25 17:23,"As a public health doctor in good health (kenahura) and under 65, I'm still getting my booster because of the population I treat, which includes the homeless, shelter residents and public housing residents, people who generally have many medical co-morbidities and are highly vulnerable to COVID. I'm getting a booster to protect myself and my family and also them! I ride the subway to work, and mask wearing is under 100%. So, yes, I think public health policy is right to include people like me in those for whom a booster is recommended."
2021-10-25 17:28,"Experts are just advisors, they don't get to make policy merely by being experts.  It's up to the administration to decide if they want to give boosters to minimize infection and spread rather than just hospitalizations, even if the reason is economic and political rather than public health.  It's also up to the administration to decide how generous we as a country want to be with our vaccines that we bought and paid for."
2021-10-25 17:35,"The messaging from the CDC that we're supposed to all wear masks in public everywhere we go to prevent infection, but only get a booster if necessary to prevent severe disease never made since to me. If I (as someone who is under 65 and works from home) want to get a booster so I can resume eating at restaurants and flying on airplanes again, and feel safe while doing so, why is that so terrible? On the contrary, I would argue that widely available boosters is important for the economy. Even if you personally feel safe without a booster, there are many others who don't, and for the economy to reach its full potential, these ""many others"" need to be willing to get out into the world and spend money again.

While the evidence is not nearly strong enough at this point to support making boosters mandatory, the bar for merely making them available should be much lower, and unless there's safety issues or supply constraints (which I think there isn't), I don't see any harm."
2021-10-25 17:35,"I already got my booster shot and I am feeling great. What are the reasons not to? Even if it gives just slightly more protection against a milder form of COVID, what’s wrong with it? I am planning to travel soon, and I need all the protection I can get, not to mention the fact that some countries, including Israel, now require three shots for a vaccine passport. COVID is endemic now, much like flu. We get flu shots every year. The same will probably happen with COVID shots. Get used to it. I am eager to get back to normal life without masks and social distancing, as is already happening in countries like Portugal. Will some people get a breakthrough infection? Undoubtedly. Will some people die? Probably. People die of flu every year. We need to put the pandemic behind us, and vaccines are the only way to go."
2021-10-25 17:36,"This article conveys the hesitancy of the experts, but not why they are hesitant.  No evidence of harm is given.  So why not allow those who are worried about their personal situation to get the booster?  Isn't that similar to what we do every year with flu vaccines?"
2021-10-25 17:36,"I don’t understand all the angst about booster shots from various scientists and organizations. Surely it can’t do any harm to boost one’s immunity to this disease. I get that some people may not NEED a booster, due to their age or robust immune system, but why all the hand wringing? So many people in this country refuse to get ANY shot at all, so why shouldn’t the rest of us protect ourselves as much as possible from their selfish idiocy? We’ve got plenty of available vaccine, so why not offer it to those who prefer not to get sick even if the two-shot regimen keeps them alive and out of the hospital. Why take the risk or getting a breakthrough infection and/or having Long-Covid or some other bad outcome."
2021-10-25 17:39,"Anecdote time; I had the J&J back in April and a Moderna booster yesterday. 

In September, I got COVID. The only one symptom I noticed was loss of smell for a couple of days. (I did test positive). I'm 30 and healthy.

For the past 18 hours, I've been experiencing side effects from the booster shot that are worse than my COVID experience. Fever, nausea, headache, muscle soreness... I didn't sleep last night, and today I'm spending the day in bed.

What's the point of a booster if the side effects are worse than the disease it's supposed to protect against? What's the point of the booster if the approved vaccines have plenty of data to show that they prevent severe disease in healthy folks like me?

This reminds me of when I was required to get a Vaccinia vaccine when I was doing immunology research at a hospital. My experiments required me to inject Vaccinia into mice and it was the first time researchers used Vaccinia at the hospital, so the head honchos were nervous. The vaccine was administered by applying it to essentially a razor blade and then scratching my shoulder. Pretty nasty vaccine. The funny thing is, the only way I could have gotten infected was if... I accidentally injected myself. And the symptoms of such a Vaccinia exposure are identical to the vaccine, since it's a ""live"" vaccine.

 On the plus side, I should be immune to small pox now..."

2021-10-25 17:56,"I literally just got my Moderna booster. In my early 60s with chronic asthma, and about to travel overseas, there’s no way I’m going to do anything other than the best I can to protect my selves and others.

I wasn’t convinced that I NEEDED the booster, but I was convinced that it wouldn’t hurt and might help. We all just have to make the best decisions we can."
2021-10-25 17:57,"The problem is this:  while many experts are not presently convinced that a booster is necessary for a large cohort, by the time they learn that a booster may be necessary it may be too late. The real question is how harmful is a booster for most people. If a booster is generally safe, then I’d rather err on the side of caution than learn later on that people are getting sick and dying because that didn’t get a booster. Furthermore, while I may be protected against “severe” illness with two shots, I don’t want even a “mild” case of Covid-19 which could turn into something quite serious."
2021-10-25 17:59,"Seems like the calls being made by politicians, not scientists. When Pfizer was approved you knew Moderna would be approved.  Yet the Kabuki continued.

Four step approval process from FDA thru CDC but decision really ultimately made by political appointee."
2021-10-25 18:02,"Why are the advisers talking behind the FDA’s back? During this impossible time they should put up a United front against COVID no matter what they feel. They are further assailing the vaccines, Biden, and the general consensus."
2021-10-25 18:05,"It is no wonder millions of people are confused about what to do. The CDC says yes to a vaccine booster, and then some experts who voted for it rue that there wasn’t enough data to make a truly informed decision.  Hello?

The government’s communication about the pandemic has been confusing, to put it charitably.  The lack of clarity in part explains why early half the country is not fully vaccinated."
2021-10-25 18:06,"Yes, this is a complicated issue, and medical advisors must provide medical/science based opinions.  No one should be asking them to factor political evaluation in their decision making.  Obviously, 100 percent consensus isn't going to happen.  The entire issue of vaccination was poisoned from the beginning  with Trump's efforts to force CDC  and FDA to align with his political ambition- whether it was calling COVID-19 a ""hoax"", or touting hydroxyquinine, or glamorizing that vaccination was the silver bullet that would instantly stop COVID-19 in its tracks.  As  if killing an estimated half a million people (allowing that a minor percentage of the 670,000 dead would  have died in a best case scenario) were not enough, the the Republican Party ghouls continue the march to a million deaths by sabotaging  the war against this pandemic."
2021-10-25 18:07,"Experts who are no longer capable of applying common sense and independent thought, but must instead delay decision making until time consuming studies are conducted, should not be honored with the title “expert.”"
2021-10-25 18:10,"I’m sorry, but can the media give this story a rest? It is needlessly divisive and is yet another reason to make those of us in affluent economies feel guilty.

As someone over 65 I’m glad boosters became easy to get. Foregoing mine would not have helped someone in Africa who has had none. 

By all means compel Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson to distribute their vaccines at reduced prices (or even free of charge) to Africa, India et al. But these are decisions to be made by governments and drug manufacturers, not individuals. So stop beating this drum and trying to make me feel bad for no good reason!"
2021-10-25 18:13,"What would have happened if the CDC had covered the initial interest in therapeutics? Clearly, there has been federal push to avoid therapeutics with a greater good approach whereby the single best way to beat the pandemic is through a vaccine and that citizens should not consider therapeutics. Now that there's a booster that advisers question as not evidence based for efficacy this will further feed resistance to vaccines with a preference for therapeutics. The federal authorities continue to reinforce the notion that citizens can't be trusted to make their own decisions. I tend to think that this is true but in the long run it's a bad  tactic. The nytimes might consider a position paper on this issue. For instance, can the public be trusted to act rationally if they are told about visitors from outer space? One day, if not already, that will be a real decision."
2021-10-25 18:13,"The experts seem out of step with how many people who want boosters feel: they don’t want to even get a mild case of covid. For a lot of people, even getting a mild case, is a hassle because they have to be out of work, stay at home, and keep their kids and immediate family at home. It’s just not sustainable."
2021-10-25 18:19,"These experts seem to want years and years of data and nuanced studies before they make up their minds.  We don't have that, won't have that, until the years and studies pass by.  So far, the studies show the vaccines are not harmful, whether initial shots or boosters.  Multiple studies show waning of immunity levels after passage of time from the shots.  The experts need to stop the hand-wringing and go with the data available instead of the data that's on the wish list.  It would have made no sense to approve boosters for 65+ across the board, but not for people in the medical fields that are actively put in harms way with Covid patients every day..."
2021-10-25 18:20,"If you received two doses of mRNA vaccine and subsequently got infected with a delta variant, one of those break through infections, you probably do not need a booster."
2021-10-25 18:20,"What about the goal of eradicating the disease?  You cite Dr. Perlman who didn’t think the booster was necessary for younger people but responded in favor of the booster because he didn’t  want to have nurses or doctors staying home because they had asymptomatic infections.  Well, if doctors and nurses are coming to work with active asymptomatic disease what would that mean for their patients who are coming in possibly vulnerable?  Maybe, if their patients of all ages are vaccinated the patients would only be susceptible to one of those “mild” cases of COVID.  I’ve seen the results of those vaccinated breakthrough cases.  You don’t die but you are not the same.  Oh not everyone; just the breakthrough cases I know personally.  What the data does not account for is people who have recovered from Covid but will suffer long term maybe life-long.  But then the booster does give you a sore arm.  
The dog whistle for anti-Obamacare activists was “Death Panels.”  And these are the very people, it seems, who’ve decided:  You’re 65.  You’ve had a good life.  You’re not needed.  In, fact you’re in the way.  You can go now. Get out."
2021-10-25 18:23,"""But some said they felt compelled to vote for the shots because of the way the federal agencies framed the questions that they were asked to consider.""

Simple."
2021-10-25 18:25,"The myopic obsession of these dissenters with acute lung distress ignores the continuing flood of studies about loss of grey matter, new onset diabetes, long term kidney damage, disabling fatigue and brain fog, and many other sequelae from so-called ""mild"" infections of a virus that attacks the vascular system throughout the body. It may well be setting up persistent infections in places where it is hard to measure. Until a lot more is known about the long term effects of the virus, the goal should be prevention of all symptomatic infection, not just ARDS. We have the means, and it's cheap, it should be employed liberally. 

This goal is harmonious with the other realities involved with ""mild"" infections, such as exposing others, getting marooned far from home for an extended period of time while traveling due to airline rules on being asymptomatic for ten days before your (return) flight, and the fact that many will avoid in-person dining and other activities so long as they feel at risk for a ""mild"" infection. Any time I think of flying somewhere I have to ask ""What would the consequences be of me getting stuck there for a month?""  I have to wonder if a restaurant meal is worth the risk. I am reluctant to visit my elderly relatives.

No, ""mild"" infections are not acceptable - not for our bodies and not for the economy. Not when we have the tools to prevent them and we don't know exactly what the long term effects are of these infections."
2021-10-25 18:25,"Judging by the comments here ""the people"" are going to use the expert views as they fit with their common sense and politics, no matter whether they are liberals or conservatives. This is why millions refuse to vaccinate and other millions take scarce resource they don't really need from others who really need it. And the liberals say ""please don't question us"" ""stop making us feeling guilty"" etc. Plus they put signs in their windows like ""we believe in science"" and other dogmas. The liberals should are least recognize that there is little difference between them and the conservatives. Whatever fits into their silly common sense goes."
2021-10-25 18:26,Not discussed: young and healthy people in households with high-risk folks. Does that make a difference? Authorizing boosters does not mean anyone has to have one.
2021-10-25 18:27,"“ Other committee experts said that they wanted to avoid confusing the public further by dissenting, or that they voted according to their views of the evidence and were simply overruled.

“These are not evidence-based recommendations,” said Dr. Sarah S. Long, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia, and a member of the C.D.C.’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.”

Thank you. We are told to trust the science and now we know that population wide recommendations are not grounded by science but on opinions voiced pre-maturely by Pres. Biden and incomplete data provided by pharmaceutical companies that stand to profit from approval of their recommendations."
2021-10-25 18:28,"Follow the science until you don’t like what the science tells you. If this doesn’t finally discredit the CDC I don’t know what will. 

This is the same hysteria that led the CDC to change their stance on masks. In May the CDC said if your vaccinated you don’t need to wear a mask. Liberals lost their minds and pressured the CDC to change their recommendations. So they created some convoluted system to recommend masks for almost everyone. CDC blames delta variant, but we all know it was political pressure. The more someone tries to convince you they are following the science, the less they are. 

What a sham of an organization."
2021-10-25 18:30,I’m lucky I have a sibling that is a doctor that has treated many Covid victims. All along she has told me it’s better to just not get it so whenever I’d get lazy about follow protocol I’d remember her advice. She got a third shot before it was even approved. I think I will follow her down that road.
2021-10-25 18:06,I got Moderna in Feb and March and I’m getting a Pfizer booster today. Why Pfizer? B/c it’s a full dose and the Moderna booster is a half dose. I want the maximum protection possible. Israeli citizens had the Pfizer booster and it appears to be successful. That is good enough for me.
2021-10-25 18:31,"The vast majority of the vaccine reluctants are not going to care what the medical experts say, or they'll simply twist it to fit their current view no matter what they say. So they shouldn't be factored into the decisions. None of these experts seem to be disputing the safety of the vaccine boosters. Nor are they disputing that the booster can increase protection against the virus. Plus, these boosters dose would make a big dent in the world supply. Much of the world economy depends on the US returning to normal as soon as possible. The booster can help in that effort."
2021-10-25 18:34,"I would like to see data on breakthrough infections (hospitalization and death), for adults aged 50-64.  It’s the data that will show the need for booster shots.  I do not understand why the NYT is not providing this data in the daily COVID stats."
2021-10-25 18:35,This article is a helpful step in increasing transparency into decision making by the FDA and CDC. It's unfortunate that government representatives feel the need to dumb down the nuanced decision making. It reflects a paternalistic and untrusting view of the American public... and it's a big reason why people don't trust any of the recommendations. If leaders don't trust the people then the people won't trust the leaders.
2021-10-25 13:45,"I’m 60 years old, two years ago had a quadruple bypass heart procedure- I’m getting a booster later today. I go to the gym, in theaters, indoor sporting events and the like and I see Neanderthals who are no doubt anti-science anti-vaxers walking around with no mask on in violation of local law and the bare minimum of human decency. So yes, I’m getting a booster."
2021-10-25 18:45,We wouldn’t be needing boosters if everyone who was eligible had gotten their vaccines in the first place. Now there are so many breakthrough cases that boosters are definitely needed.

In the next breath they will talking up  ""Confusion."" Myself and numerous seniors I know have now had the Pfizer booster all with no ill effects. Nationally the number is in the millions again with no sign of serious side effects."
2021-10-25 18:53,Hands down these are some of best comments coming from the NY Times community I've ever read! This is why I love this paper (online subscriber but you catch my drift).
2021-10-25 18:58,"I got an email from the pharmacy chain that fills my meds about 6 weeks ago telling me that if I had gotten my COVID shots more than 28 days ago, come in and get a booster.  No one on the planet that I know of has suggested such a thing and I didn't get my shots at this pharmacy.  

I will wait till the guy who did jab me sends me an email telling me he thinks I should come back.  He has a Ph.D. in infectious diseases and has fun reading medical papers.  Plus, he has years of medical history on me sitting in his office.  

Ask your doctor if the New York Times is right for you!  In the meantime, quit getting medical advice from the internet and just ask your doctor!"
2021-10-25 18:59,"I’m shocked to see that advisors felt pressured to vote yes for reasons other than the scientific data (for “fairness” between vaccine groups, because Biden suggested all Americans could get boosters). This is a terrifying precedent given they are on the cusp of recommendations for healthy young kids, who are at a higher risk for common but serious vaccine side effects than they are from serious covid disease."
2021-10-25 18:59,"The national press reported numerous times on the reasons behind Israel's decision to give booster shots to its citizens. This, more that anything, planted the idea among Americans that boosters shots were necessity. Moreover, the press reported repeatedly that the efficacy of the vaccine diminishes significantly after several months. So it's no surprise, the public was clamoring for booster shots and it's no surprise the CDC erred on the side of caution and authorized them."
2021-10-25 19:00,"The only reason any of these individuals dissented is because they feel morally obligated to prevent the developed world from monopolizing the vaccine supply while billions in the developing world remain unvaccinated.

It's activism.

I hate to break it to them, but reducing the vaccine supply in America isn't going to increase the supply in Indonesia or Nigeria or Chile.

Furthermore, from a purely political lens, precisely zero Americans are going to accept Uncle Larry dying after being denied a booster because some advisor was guilt laden over the unvaccinated in the global south."
2021-10-25 19:04,"Hey I have an idea. Make sure it's reasonably safe, give people the data and let them make their own decisions about whether to get one or not. What a concept!

Fortunately the committees took that approach. It's telling that many of them felt queasy about that. They'd rather play nanny."
2021-10-25 19:14,"I had the virus in spring of 2020, tested positive for the antibodies in June of 2020 and got the 2 Phizer vaccines in the spring of this year. I have followed the vaccine and booster question very closely, as to how much immunity I may have and my need for a booster even though I’m over 65. A couple recent articles in The NY Times confirmed that it may not be necessary right now. One a couple months ago said that it was highly unusual to have boosters just 6 months after the original shots. Another, just a couple of weeks ago, said that people like me who had the virus AND the vaccines have a “robust hybrid immunity” and are the “rock stars” of the virus, not only immune to the original and the Delta by future variants. To check just how true that might be, I had a recent COVId antibody test, which came back as higher than normal antibodies. 

I had bad side affects from the vaccine, particularly the first shot, so am not eager to get another Covid vaccine that I may not even need. My doctor confirmed I can wait. I wish someone would contact me to help participate in a Data study to see who needs the booster and how much an original infection does help. I hate blood tests but would be willing to get them if it could help tone down the rhetoric and provide some answers about what is needed..  Also if the Phizer vaccines does wear off in 6 to 8 months, wouldn’t the booster do the same thing? Would boosters then be recommended every six months indefinitely? That makes no sense."
2021-10-25 19:14,"Aargh!  When I hear ""follow the science!"" being misused over and over again I want to scream.   There is the science, and then there is the policy.  Policy does not follow in a direct one-to-one correspondence from the science.  There are many other considerations.   The science tells me whether the vaccine is likely to be safe and effective, whether the immunity is waning.  Science can also say what the likely risk/benefit analysis is.    BUT it cannot and should not determine my personal risk aversion.   When the panel dissenters look at the statistics and say ""the vaccines confer adequate protection against hospitalization and death""  they are making a value judgement of what ""adequate"" is.  The delta variant has really changed things.    The COVID death rate for vaccinated people is only 1/4 that of unvaccinated people in Colorado  (see <a href=""https://covid19.colorado.gov/vaccine-breakthrough"" target=""_blank"">https://covid19.colorado.gov/vaccine-breakthrough</a> ) , hospitalization is only 1/5, and cases only 1/4.   That is not ""adequate"" to me and I want more protection.  If a booster will help with minimal chance of side effects then I will get it."
2021-10-25 19:17,"""The vaccines seem to be holding steady against severe Covid-19 and death, except perhaps in older Americans.""

This is important information. If the primary source study is available in a medical journal, or on a government website, can you include a link so we can make a judgement based on the actual studies?"
2021-10-25 19:29,"“The companies got what they wanted, the administration got what they wanted.”
If these decisions are being made with profit or politics in mind, we can expect problems later."
2021-10-25 19:33,"""The vaccines seem to be holding steady against severe Covid-19 and death, except perhaps in older Americans.""

But what they are not telling you (or maybe this is what they mean by low quality data), is that Pfizer did not test its booster in ""older Americans."" The oldest American in its 300-person test was 55. The average was 41. 

Are 70,000,000 people over 65 marching over a cliff? No one has any idea"
2021-10-25 19:33,"After all the talk about ""science-based"" responses to COVID--the booster campaign is obviously driven by nonexpert people who have decided a third shot will make them safer."
2021-10-25 19:39,"This type of messaging is very confusing and doesn't help the public at all.

I have served on a few national advisory committees, albeit the topic was not vaccination. However our topic was a controversial one.  When we were invited to the committees, we were asked to come to consensus in good faith, i.e. not dissent for the purpose of just dissenting and to recognize the final recommendations may reflect most but not all of each individual's suggestions. There was also a mechanism for public dissent in an organized manner (like how the Supreme Court allows minority reports).

The problem with this situation is it sounds very disorganized, with perhaps some people but not others being interviewed and the speakers unclear in their communication. This does not bode well."
2021-10-25 19:40,"A key point of the debate is that boosters should be used to prevent serious infection including hospitalization. The implication being that boosters should not be used to prevent mild infections. 

But for senior people even a mild infection can be devastating because seniors are also subject to other health threats, the most important of which is a weakened immune response. So for a senior person, even a mild viral infection can lead to other serious problems. The older you are the bigger the threat.

As a senior I did take the booster and felt a touch of shame because vaccines are badly needed in other countries, but they were already in stock at CVS drugstores, and would have gone bad if not used.

No question that we should help to provide vaccines or vaccine licenses to countries that need it. But Big Pharma is resisting and that is a shame."
2021-10-25 19:45,I dont know what the purpose of this article? Obviously many committee decisions are made without unanimity. Some people in the committee coukd dissent!! That is the nature of committee decisions. Does not make the decision invalid or somehow unscientific or nefarious as this article seems to imply!!
2021-10-25 20:07,"I too am very perplexed by these misgivings which seems like abstract, unproven concerns when the data for the booster's efficacy is clearly there: <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/d4e58d38-37d6-40cd-9d72-6b9bfd0a3683"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ft.com/content/d4e58d38-37d6-40cd-9d72-6b9bfd0a3683</a>

Recently released randomized control trial data comparing three shots with two shots and a booster shows a ~95% relative efficacy. Put another way, the booster reduces your chance of getting covid 10-fold relative to two shots. I teach 40+ students in closed rooms with unknown ventilation status - I might be 40 years old, but I got my booster because: 1) I'd rather not get long covid, 2) I have an unvaccinated two year old at home I'd rather not pass it on to. How is this hard to understand?"
2021-10-25 20:09,"I'm 70+ and my husband is 80 and we both got our booster shots.
If I were young I probably wouldn't have gotten a booster shot."
2021-10-25 20:12,I am also puzzled. I am 90 years old and got Johnson and Johnson. I approached CVS pharmacy for Moderna but they asked me that if I want full dose or half dose. Now I am again seeking advice of my doctor. CDC should clarify all those points so that people should feel comfortable and assured.
2021-10-25 20:12,"The objective should be to prevent as many COVID cases as possible, period.  Why?  Long COVID.  Yes, the vaccine will prevent me from dying.  But breakthrough cases can lead to Long COVID, and something like 25 to 30 percent of people who have developed COVID develop Long COVID.  Which is making quality of life terrible for thousands, maybe millions.  And for the life of me, I don't get why doctors are ignoring this over and over."
2021-10-25 20:14,"Perhaps at the moment, experts feel boosters aren't needed based on the data they have but I also remember earlier this year when experts were saying that breakthrough infections were extremely rare and media parroted the same.  Anyone remember when experts said masks weren't needed?  Things change, I get it, but one only needs to look at what's happening in the UK or Israel to see where things may be going. Where is the harm in providing boosters to everyone now?"
2021-10-25 20:14,"My doctor has advised me not to get the booster until the science is clear.  I have an over-active immune system and do not react well to vaccines.  Besides the normal reactions that everyone else got to the COVID vaccine, the glands in my neck visibly swelled for several weeks (to the point I was getting constant headaches.)  Would I still recommend people get the COVID vaccine?  YES!  Am I going to hold off on a booster until I know for sure it is necessary like my doctor recommends? Absolutely.   Do I disparage anyone who goes ahead and gets the booster now? Not at all."
2021-10-25 20:26,Physician here.  This article stirs controversy where it isn’t needed.  There is some data that boosters for COVID-19  can be beneficial and there are numerous immunizations for which boosters are recommended.  The benefits outweigh perceived risk.
2021-10-25 20:29,"Good reporting. The situation is complicated and if boosters aren't necessary to prevent serious risk, people shouldn't be encouraged to have them. These vaccines are new and all the risks they present are unknown. 
It has occurred to me, and it angers me, that the drug industry lobbyists are doing all they can to push for more shots and milk our govt for as much money as possible. Not that this kind of thing hasn't happened before. But the new vaccines and the extremely broad use of these shots are special considerations here."
2021-10-25 20:30,"Three FULL Moderna shots here.

40 years old with serious autoimmune issues. Taste, smell, and memory have no been diminished by COVID. I plan to keep it that way."
2021-10-25 20:30,"I am 65 and got the J&J in March.  I just got the Moderna booster this weekend.  I had to really seek it out as Pfizer is the dominant vaccine here.  I went to three places, and finally found it at Walmart.  I had looked up the first two on vaccine.gov for info, but the info was wrong.  Normally I’m not a big fan of Walmart, but everyone I dealt with there was very professional.  

I would have liked to get a full strength shot, but I would have had to lie about having had the J&J.  I was willing to lie, but it really didn’t seem possible since they had me in the computer system."
2021-10-25 20:41,"These ""advisors"" are the bad eggs.  While misgivings about anything still this new is reasonable, their point here is deeply flawed.  First, they start from the assumption made contrary to the little data we have that only those hospitalized from COVID need to be concerned about it.  They totally ignore the data on long-COVID and neurological issues from people who were not hospitalized.  Then they fixate myopically on the fact that the vaccines remain pretty effective at keeping people out of the hospital (for now).   Second, they ignore the consistently growing body of data showing that even the protection against hospitalization is gradually weakening.  In other words, these people don't care if we get sick with COVID as long as it doesn't kill us or put us in the ER, they don't care if we transmit it to others while sick but not in the ER, and they are the ones who have treated this as an academic exercise failing to realize that each and every day they have delayed boosters waiting on 'more data' has cost lives and caused harm - all preventable with more timely action on boosters.  Gen. Powell was scheduled to get a booster, but had not yet gotten it when he got COVID as a breakthrough infection and died.  If he had been living in Israel or one of the other countries that didn't delay boosters like we did, he would still be alive.  His totally preventable death is Exhibit A in why the so-called experts quoted here ARE the problem at the CDC.  Pls replace them."
2021-10-25 20:42,"My wife and I be are physicians. We treat Covid patients, who have become thankfully few in our area. We are strong proponents of the mRNA vaccines. We both received 2 shots of Moderna, completing the cycle back in March. This past Friday we went for our boosters, which are half doses. We both got violently ill, with fever and muscle aches. My BP skyrocketed to 200/116. I am hypertensive but normally well controlled on meds. My wife went back to work today but I am still too achy and foggy to see patients. I would not have gotten the booster if I could do it all over again. I understand every patient is unique and has their own considerations but if there is another dose recommended I'm going to pass on it. I can't go through this again, especially since the need for any doses beyond 2 is at best unclear."
2021-10-25 20:44,Let’s just call it like it is. The initial two shot dosage is doing exactly what was described and exactly as designed. Pfizer & Moderna just want to sell more shots so they can buy bigger yachts. So they hire lobbyists to pressure politicians to pressure government administrators to “authorize” unneeded booster shots. Just call it like it is.
2021-10-25 20:48,"It is evident from this article that the Biden Administration’s decision to get out ahead of the science on the issue of boosters made some if not at all of these scientists feel compelled to step outside their lane and area of expertise and take political, psychological, and sociological considerations into account when they addressed the booster question. 

Perhaps it’s too much to ask of this single article, but I would’ve loved to have explained or quantified the following, which can help people make risk management judgments:

— How many breakthrough cases have led to hospitalization? to Long COVID? to death? In which age groups and health categories? 

— What negative effects, if any, are there for one’s immune system and overall health if one is “overvaccinated”? (If these are negligible, the risk-reward ratio of getting a booster is almost equally negligible, and most people should get it. On the other hand, If it risks weaken ing the effectiveness of the vaccine going forward by taking them prematurely, then I’d rather refrain, since COVID is destined to be endemic, and  we’ll therefore need to get the vaccine periodically for the foreseeable future."
2021-10-25 20:53,"As an infectious disease immunologist of 40 years,  it is very clear to me that most of the confusion is due to our sloppy media.  They put anyone with an MD behind their name and have them speak about the vaccine.  They conflate infection and severe clinical disease.  They are not one and the same. Both can be goals but we decided long ago the preventing severe disease was the goal.  Then many started talking about ""breakthrough"" infections as vaccine failure.   It is not.   Since the experts were confused, so is the public.  It is no wonder so many people are vaccine reluctant.   We, experts, blew it!"

2021-10-25 21:09,"Whether or not you choose to get a booster shot may have little to no effect on the global vaccine supply.  HOWEVER, this article was not about individual choices, it was about a panel of doctors that influence policy decisions and public messaging.  They were hesitant to endorse boosters because the positive effects are not that well documented and are likely to be minimal (depending the particular case), meanwhile the US policy decision to go all in with booster shots WILL mean less vaccines in other parts of the world where vaccines are desperately needed to stop the spread of the virus and prevent mass hospitalizations and death.  The panel should have been honest:  1) Boosters are not likely to harm you 2) Boosters may have a limited positive effect.   It's not just about individuals, this is a global problem and we need to cooperate globally to solve it."
2021-10-25 21:14,"The article says: ""In interviews, the experts bemoaned the limited data on the safety and efficacy of the booster shots."" More details please! There is a big difference between data on SAFETY and data on EFFICACY. If there is a concern about safety, we need to know. If there is a concern about lack of efficacy, it matters less. If this is just sloppy wording, please fix it to say ""In interviews, experts expressed the desire for more data,"" rather than leaving us hanging here!"
2021-10-25 21:14,"Are vaccine booster needed at all? Maybe for those who were considered fully immunized months ago but no longer have antibodies when tested for antibodies against COVID.   65+, who were fully immunized before and would like to feel more certain about being protected should have a choice to boost their immunity. Those who think that because they have had the booster they do not need to wear masks or practice all common sense safety practices, they need to be aware that vaccines will NOT block exposure and if exposed with a large viral load can test positive. More and more I hear about previously vaccinated teachers testing positive (breakthrough infections) because they are tested for COVID, regularly. 

Finally those who have developed adverse reactions due to being over boosted for any other viral disease, need to be extra careful and consult with their doctor and a caring doctor will order testing for antibody levels to arrive at a decision to whether or not get a booster shot. I am one such candidate for developing hyper immune reaction because after several boosters a hyper immune adverse reaction to live attenuated vaccine against pox viruses some decades ago, I have never again had a booster and a later, larger study showed that even without a booster,  the initial vaccination provided life long immunity.

If only 2nd generation live attenuated vaccines against COVID were developed in place of the 1st generation subunit mRNA vaccines, there mabe no need for boosters."
2021-10-25 21:18,"I got my third Pfizer shot, and I'm good with it ( like I have a choice now).
But the messaging is ridiculous and no matter how brilliant people like Rochelle Wolinsky might be, they-and their staffs-are absolutely incompetent at public messaging. 
I happened to look at the CDC recommendations for vaccinated individuals in the area I live, near Palm Springs. CA, where cases and hospitalizations are plummeting. Yet, their recommendations- for vaccinated people -are so absurd that  can be seized upon  by any anti-vaxxer as proof that vaccines are useless. 
First,for example, the CDC  says, vaccinated people should ""Avoid large indoor events with more than fifty people. "". Huh ? I'm triple vaxxed but I guess I should not even go to the theater- or a larger restaurant.
Next ""socialize inside the home with only one or two other vaccinated households"". Well my  two daughters any their families plus my wife and I constitute three households. I guess we do a Zoom Thanksgiving. 
Do you see what I mean ?These are ridiculous recommendations for fully vaccinated people.  Few but the most fearful will follow them. It shows that whoever prepares the CDC messaging has no common sense whatsoever.
Their incompetency does nothing more than give support to those who are skeptical of vaccinations.
Just because of the way they articulate their advice, they sow fear in the American public, which is the absolute last thing this country needs now."
2021-10-25 21:18,"I'm skeptical about boosters because Pfizer and other Big Pharma have everything to gain and nothing to lose by exaggerating the risk of severe illness or death if one skips the booster. Maybe elderly and the immunocompromised need it, but not the average 50 year old.

I don't plan on getting one because there is little data on how long, exactly, one booster is supposed to last. An additional three months of immunity? Six? Eight? Pfizer and the other usual suspects have no real incentive to make a ""long lasting vaccine"" as long as there are people lining up for ""upgrades"" like the fools who eagerly await the latest iPhone and are all too willing to toss the old ones into the landfill."
2021-10-25 21:27,This is one of the few times when it might be the smart move to err on the side of caution and get the booster shot.

We have enough distrust of our public health apparatus right now - how dare these people allow themselves to be pressured into voting against what they thought the science said?? And, once they already caved to whatever pressures they faced, they further undermine that trust by sharing their despicable actions far and wide. I assume they do this to assuage their guilt, just more selfishness. They should never have been trusted with public health in the first place."
2021-10-25 21:41,"The kid wasn't vaccinated. Picked up Covid at school. Went to the store, coughed in the ice cream section, 3 other kids got infected. They went home. A week later their parents developed covid and during the interval these parents infected their own parents and co-workers. 

Heck! This is happening all over the country and the Intensive Care Wings are spitting out bodies so fast there are refrigerated semi trucks behind each hospital full of dead parents and grandma's and grandpa's. The undertakers are all smiles. Cemeteries doubled the price on headstones, cremations and funeral plots.

The butterfly effect, one of the best-known aspects of chaos theory, posits that small changes can have nonlinear impacts on complex systems. Covid-19 isn’t, by any stretch of the imagination, a small change. But it is still alarming to me that one person’s decision to forego a mask/vaccination in a distant state can yield death in such a wide swath across the country.

2021-10-25 21:56,"Stop this nonsensical discussion. Allow vaccination without restrictions. For as long as there is no cheap tests to determine the quality and quantity of immunity - neither CDC nor FDA nor FBI nor YOU know an individual's immunity.
Statistics is good for a generalized population-based statement, but they have too little to tell about an individual immunity here and now.
Allow people to vaccinate and revaccinate at will unless you can prove that it is detrimental to their health and wellbeing.
Focus on providing testing and tracing free of charge.

2021-10-25 21:56,"Scientific theories--which is what explanations are called in science--are replaced with regularity by better explanations.  The most important theories historically--Issac Newton's theories of gravity and motion--were replaced by Einstein's theories of relativity, but it tool three centuries.  And even today, a rocket engineer is likely used Newton's theories, which often is more useful than Einstein's.  

Why am I saying this here?  To point out that science can produce only the best explanation that it can at any given time.  New theories are motivated when problems with the old one's are discovered, and even the discovery of a problem cannot produce a new theory until someone figures one out.

Put this together with the fact that nature changes.  The laws of physics don't change, but biological organisms do, sometimes requiring our explanations to change.  

The fact that scientific explanations change is not an indictment of science.  It's the way science works.  And if you want to produce a vaccine, science is the only realistic path to take.

The mixture of science and politics that this article describes is a different kettle of fish.  Science always is in the hip pocket of politics and commercial interests.  Without them throwing their weight about, we wouldn't have the cash to build the labs and fund them.  The problem is allowing the politicians and money grabbers to grub up the works.  

Today's mess stems from grubby money and politics reaching in the pot."
2021-10-25 22:01,"""In approving the boosters, however reluctantly, federal agencies and their advisers may have given Americans the impression that two doses were not protective enough, some experts said.""

This is strange. I always understood that, like other flu vaccines, this one might require a booster. That was something that was being talked about and in the news from the time vaccinations began.

Why should this be so difficult to communicate?"
2021-10-25 22:02,"I got a 3rd dose of the Pfizer vaccine the first day it was available. Since the vaccines are safe and there is evidence of waning immunity over time, I decided to be extra cautious and get a third jab. I have seen no data that tells me to avoid a booster. If the booster actually does nothing to enhance immunity, then nothing has been lost. I say better safe(r) than sorry."
2021-10-25 22:02,"""Dr. Perlman said he was opposed to boosters for younger people at first, but voted in favor for other reasons. In the case of health care workers, for example, “I didn’t want to have any nurses or doctors staying home because they had asymptomatic” infections, he said.""

Yes, so just say what it all means:  Whether someone needs a booster or not is a judgment call and that cannot possibly be done by a committee, but ONLY by the treating physician in consultation with the patient.  And if a patient feels that s/he would benefit, then the answer is, of course, yes.

Making cookie cutter decisions on a highly variable matter like this by a committee is expected to fail.  Had I been on the committee, my vote would have been ""if in doubt, boost"".

There is no vaccine shortage, in fact, we are throwing them away!  Getting a potentially unnecessary booster is safer than risking insufficient immunity from the initial shots and then ending up on a ventilator.  

The more people get their boosters, the more they will drag people along for their initial shots.  What's not to like!?"
2021-10-25 22:11,"This does not seem to be a case in which the “science” clearly says a single thing. Clearly vaccines are broadly protective against bad outcomes. Clearly, some experts have suggested that some of the vaccines either are 3 dose (for Pfizer ) or 2 dose vaccines (J & J) or that doses need to be spaced out further than 3 weeks (Pfizer) . Other experts suggest that that modification is not necessary."

I do not like putting things into my body unless it is really required (to ensure maximum effectiveness of a drug in case I do have to take it). If the booster becomes mandated I will take it reluctantly. I do not wear a mask (unless it is mandated). I am getting on with my life. I have done what society has asked me to do and am a responsible citizen . I think if you are healthy and have been vaccinated, you should be okay.  If not then you should likely get a booster shot."

2021-10-25 22:37,"Given the proven relative safety of the vaccine and evidence from Israel and other data that immunity wanes after 6 months and, that we keep having these regional flare ups, I don’t understand this big questioning of boosters.

Greater reading comprehension and scientific literacy would go a long way toward public understanding of the need for vaccinations, much less booster shots.

I got mine today, but I'm 65 and have high blood pressure, so the decision wasn't at all difficult to make.  Take your proof of vaccination with you so that it can be updated. I don't know how universal they are, but mine has several more spaces for additional injections."
2021-10-25 22:48,"I'm not a doctor or virologist. This is my take from readily available information. Experts, please correct me. Any person exposed to the Covid virus can harbor it in nasal passages and mouth; and thus test positive for a Covid infection. What ensues varies. A person who has already had Covid or is vaccinated and has a functioning immune system should be able to rally the immune system to take the virus out before it reaches the lungs. A body that has not had the disease or has not been vaccinated is encountering a new virus. If the immune system is robust, that person could have an asymptomatic or mild case of Covid. If the person doesn't have a robust immune system--for example, is older (waning immune system) or has constant inflammation as is the case with obesity--the immune system might not be able to fight off the virus. 
Those vaccinated or who have had the disease should develop antibodies to the virus. Antibodies diminish after doing their job.  If we retained a horde of antibodies for every foreign entity that has ever entered our bodies, we'd be skin filled with antibodies. The immune system is efficient--it encodes the intruder in memory cells (B and T cells) so that the body recognizes it. It's easy to determine if there are specific antibodies in the blood, but not as easy to determine if the immune system is creating B and T memory cells for the virus. If it hasn't been capable of doing so in the past, why would it do so with a booster vaccine?"
2021-10-25 22:56,"I technically qualify for a booster as a longtime former smoker, but I would have gotten one anyway.  I do not want to get a breakthrough infection and perhaps suffer long covid, or infect someone who has unvaccinated children or infect my triple vaccinated parents (in their 90s). The public health messaging on this has been really horrible. I get an annual flu shot not because I'm at risk of dying of the flu but because I don't want to get it (or, if I get it, I'd like it to be mild) and I don't want to spread it.  So why doesn't this logic carry over to covid vaccines? I live in a highly vaccinated state but personally know of 10 people who have had break through infections of varying severity (yes, I know just anecdotal).  Why couldn't the policy have been to recommend boosters for certain populations and let the rest of us decide on our own?"

And given the  FDA's approval of the expensive useless Alzheimer's drug and how many others??  (And why is drug advertising allowed on TV??

2021-10-25 23:47,"Senior citizens and those who are immunocompromised require the vaccine due to the age related reduced efficacy of their immune system or a weakened immune system.  

As with all vaccines - post injection - there is a spike in “neutralizing antibodies” which gradually reduce overtime because that is what happens if there is nothing for the antibodies to fight ie: person isn’t infected.  However - there will still be a few remaining “neutralizing antibodies” roaming in the circulation and T cells that can combat the virus.  If an individual is infected with one of the sars-cov-2/variants, the immune system will acutely respond with B cells generating antibodies.  

If we only consider immunocompetent patients (< 50 yo) with robust immune systems - is the third vaccine necessary?  Or is the concern for the third booster a consequence of the delta variant’s ability to partially evade neutralizing antibodies?"

(3) ""need in order to prevent illness that may require medical care short of hospitalization?"" (4) ""need in order to prevent long term symptoms that may be troublesome even if they don't require professional medical care? (5) ""need in order to reduce the chance of infection that may be passed on to others who are at greater risk?  Etc.

I don't know why they needed to study the boosters for safety.  My Pfizer booster is exactly the same as the 2 shots I already got.  If they were safe, why wouldn't another shot be safe?

One doctor said the recommendations were not evidence-based.  That can't possibly be true, unless they didn't look at and consider any evidence at all.   The recommendations may not have been forced by the evidence, but are they ever?

One person is quoted as saying, “I don’t think that we have evidence that everybody in those groups needs a booster today.""  Again, there's that word ""need.""

Children are denied going to school safely. How many have died waiting for a ""review"" of critical ""data collection"". Then off to school.

People are dying; not directly because of Covid, but because Covid is killing people who refuse to protect themselves in any rational way. 

Diverting our total medical resources to treat people that have refused proper and early treatment (vaccination) should not be treated before other normal medical treatments. These patients must be placed in the lowest medical categories. Not massive treatment for stupidity.

I remarked loudly ""With beauty like this, people are forgiven not to wear masks"", to everyone's approving amusement who could hear me, but out of hearing range of the dazzling woman. 

And then somebody pointed to a person a tall potato faced white man in the crowd not wearing a mask. ""I guess nobody told him he is not in the same league"" someone remarked to hearty laughter. 

While many wore mask among the several hundred people in the endless snaking  lines, almost no one  attempted to keep the 6 ft distance marked on the floor. I wished I already had the booster.

I wish these scientists felt a bit better about just calling it like they see it. I am thrilled Biden is president but he pulled a Trump in speaking before the data was in, and should be called out for it.
As for me, I'd be getting my Moderna booster if these doctors seemed to think I need it, but until new data tells me I need it (and yea, new data is a good reason to change one's mind, including if you're in an agency) I'll hang tight. I can sense their ambivalence and deduce that in the meantime chances are slightly higher I might actually feel Covid if I catch it but am still at low risk for the bad stuff. Low risk is as good as life gets in my book. in the meantime, I won't miss the 2 days of fever, pretty considerable headache and sweating through my sheets feeling like a piece of rebar is stuck in my arm."

I’ve gotten vaccinated and have been social distancing, avoiding indoor locations, and wearing a mask since 2020 not just to avoid hospitalization and death, but because I do not want to catch and spread covid - especially to my children, who are too young to be vaccinated, or to anyone at higher risk for whom a breakthrough infection could be dangerous. Unless there’s a safety risk, what’s the harm?!"
2021-10-26 2:11,"Please spare us from the ""experts!"" Experts don't always give good advice.  We get boosters for other vaccines and a flu shot annually.  The increased incidence of covid in vaccinated people is the best argument for boosters."
2021-10-26 2:22,"Wow! Unbelievable! 
These statements & observations from the article makes me feel so frustrated. 

“These are not evidence-based recommendations,” said Dr. Sarah S. Long.
“I don’t think that we have evidence that everybody in those groups needs a booster today,” said Dr. Matthew Daley.
In interviews, the experts bemoaned the limited data on the safety and efficacy of the booster shots. The data supporting extra doses of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines was “of very low quality,” Dr. Kathleen Dooling, a C.D.C. scientist, acknowledged ¨

Shouldn´t these doctors & experts just be following the evidence and making  their recommendations accordingly?

But “if you’re going do it for one group, I think fairness kind of dictates you have to do it for all the groups,” 

Seriously? 
Are they doling out awards in some kindergarten class to make everyone happy? 

“It’s hard to show some of the misgivings, because we don’t want to have mixed messaging,” said Dr. Camille Kotton, an infectious disease physician .
Mixed messaging? What is this? Some sort of a ´How-to-be-a-effective-parent-for-a-teenager´ class?"
2021-10-26 2:49,"Are there other vaccines whose stated goal is only to prevent death or hospitalization?  Perhaps one source of confusion is that we generally think of vaccines as preventing illness, not just death.  We wouldn’t settle for “mild” cases of polio. 

Also some of the statements on boosters in these reports seem to be general and not nuanced; different populations do have very different risks."
2021-10-26 2:54,The only thing boosters do is put money into the pockets of Big Pharma executives.
2021-10-26 3:02,How about antibody testing before getting a booster shot?
2021-10-26 3:02,"There are a significant number of Times's readers who've already definitively decided that they ""need"" boosters even if they're under 65 and healthy. No amount of nuance or new information from knowledgeable scientists will ever change their minds. This is because a politico (Biden) promised everybody boosters a few months ago. It's also interesting to note that many other wealthy nations aren't pushing boosters heavily onto their low risk populations. I'm following the examples of other countries and waiting as I don't fall into any high risk category for the coronavirus. Everybody else can be beta testers for ""mix and match"" boosters."
2021-10-26 3:58,"If boosters only have upside and no downside, what are these supposedly“concerned” experts concerned about? If it’s about saving money, do they really think one or two hundred dollars per extra dose is too much to spend compared to the risk of wider Covid spread and the myriad of other related economic impacts? If their concerns center around the global unvaccinated, not putting a third shot in an American arm will not result in putting a first one in the arm of any un-vaccinated person residing in the 3rd world! The manufacturing, distribution and storage of vaccines and the availability of global health care workers to administer them isn’t impacted by any of this. It is true though, that all wealthy countries should do dramatically more around the globe. That said, if you start telling Americans they can’t get shots because some guy in a distant nation hasn’t had one first that is a sure way to get all funding for global vaccinations completely cut! It may be illogical, counterintuitive and immoral, but it’s also sociopolitically what would realistically happen."
2021-10-26 4:13,"I got the Moderna shot in February, the supposed longer lasting vaccine. I’m due for my flu shot in less then 3 weeks so that has priority. I’m going to wait at least 2 weeks after my flu shot before thinking about getting a booster."
2021-10-26 4:18,Their expertise is in evaluating safety and effectiveness. Nothing in the article says they were concerned about safety or effectiveness. Those who judge two doses adequate are presupposing that mild cases don't matter. We don't know that. Long covid is real.
2021-10-26 4:28,"Got my booster today. Normally when I get something I probably don't need, it means I bought a blu-ray box set at 3am while casually medicated. At least this was free."
2021-10-26 2:14,"This was not the least bit helpful.  More fodder the anti vaccine crowd to dig in, hence more opportunity for mutations.  Short of a medical reason they can all go jump off a cliff not a minute too soon."
2021-10-26 4:38,"If I could be sure that every dose of the vaccine that is not used to give a booster shot to an already vaccinated American was going to go to an unvaccinated American or someone in a developing country who otherwise would not receive any vaccine, I would be against booster shots.

But that's not the case. Whether or not vaccinated Americans get booster shots will not affect the ability of vaccine hesitant Americans to get their dose, should they want one, and it won't affect the situation in developing countries.

Booster shots will offer Americans who have had the common sense to get vaccinated an additional level of protection. They will make it more difficult for the virus to propagate in a community and slow the rate of infections, and they may even save a few lives. So, I'm in favor of those things."
2021-10-26 4:38,"Gosh... where to start here? How about “These are NOT EVIDENCE-BASED DECISIONS”
Some voted in support of boosters to “avoid confusion by dissention” or that they “voted according to their VIEWS  of the Evidence and were Simply Overruled”
“I Don’t Think we have Evidence that everyone needs a booster today”
All the advisors acknowledged that they were “Obligated” to make difficult choices, based on “SPARSE RESEARCH in the middle of a public health emergency”
The experts “Bemoaned the Limited Data on the SAFETY and EFFICACY” of the booster shots.
The Data for Moderna, J&J, “ Of Very Low Quality”
Panelists were “Hesitant to Voice their Discomfort”
“It’s hard to show Misgivings” because we don’t want to have “mixed messaging”
“Commenting in the middle of a pandemic has proven to be tricky”
Good Grief!  The level of intimidation and placating here reminds me of all those who pandered to Trump, trying to keep his feathers smoothed.
But the stakes this time are much much higher. Starting and with People’s Health and Scientific Integrity and dissemination of Factual Data.
Our “trusted news media” has done a spectacular job of misinformation and censorship all in the name of the “greater good” Hello VAERS? Side effects Off the Charts. Epic numbers. There have been no ongoing safety data monitoring of these vaccines. EARLY TREATMENT has been denounced and demonized. FEAR has been the game play here.
“The COMPANIES GOT WHAT THEY WANTED, the Administration Got What it Wanted” FOR SHAME!!"
2021-10-26 4:45,"They never talk about the downsides of getting a booster shot. I understand that if fewer Americans get boosters then maybe foreign countries will have more shots to give, but is that the only reason (besides the rare side effects)? If so, then CDC decisions are being made for geopolitical reasons. If there are other downsides, we should know about them too so we can make an informed decision."
2021-10-26 4:47,"We need clear, consistent messaging.
When the White House decides to allow unvaccinated  people from 50 countries to enter the US, that is NOT clear and consistent. In fact, it makes a mockery of the vaccine mandates forced on employees. 
We must insist on vaccinated travellers."
2021-10-26 3:11,I think Walensky is not the right person for the CDC.
2021-10-26 4:11,"By the way, among the things that seriously cheeses me off about the caterwauling is the abject failure, and indeed the refusal, of a whole bunch of Americans to face up to the fact of just how lucky—and privileged—they are. 

Most of us have the luxury of wailing about how you had to read an ARTICLE, you were asked to WAIT a little, you were told maybe you don’t really need to shave another 0. 0005 off your risks, you had to think through stuff a little, maybe you might even do well to shaddap and follow medical advice that didn’t come off your Facebook feed. 

Well boo-hoo, poor poor picked on us.

Try being a Bangladeshi farmer who’s scared for his wife and kids but isn’t even going to SEE a vaccine vial any time soon unless the local banker’s SUV crashes and spills a carton out the back, or a mom outside of Capetown living in a shanty and worried about her kid’s cough, or somebody in a favela way down south of here, or, well, fill in the darn list for yourself. 

I consider myself darn lucky to have the choices I have, the help I have, the support I have, the people staying up late and working so I understand what’s going on, the docs and nurses and staff who have my back if things go bad. And yes, all the insurance folks who worked and work to make sure I can pay for what comes next.

If you can’t see that, if your petty little squabbles and doubts and fears and point-scoring matter more to you, well then."
2021-10-26 5:56,Their is clear evidence of the need for boosters in some but definitely not all vaccinated patients. The CDC has made several missteps during this pandemic and one is discouraging the use of antibody testing in vaccinated patients  . . I disagreed and have been testing all my vaccinated patients to determine if and when the need booster shots and the data is clear and convincing. I have identified those patients with undetectable antibody levels after initial vacination and prioritized them for boosters.   Nearly 7% of my initial tested patients had no detectable antibodies. J & J was significantly inferior to Pfizer and Moderna and Moderna vaccinated had higher antibody levels on average than Pfizer. Pfizer vaccinated patient’s antibodies are falling in 6 months more precipitously than Moderna. Most J and J vaccinated had low or undetectable antibodies and most need boosters now. After giving J and J vaccinated a single full dose of Moderna all achieved maximum detectable levels of antibodies in 4 weeks. Similarly for Pfizer and Moderna all achieve maximum levelsafter 1 full dose  except for 5 immunocompromised patients. The CDC should support use of antibody testing to identify which and when patients are in need of boosters --that only makes sense and the data supports it.
2021-10-26 6:01,"At the Pfizer booster acip meeting, Dr. Long said, “I don’t care if health care workers get breakthroughs, they should be wearing masks.” Dr. Meissner is a Great Barrington Declaration signatory. They ignore Israel’s data. They have my vote of no confidence. 

They should have voted their conscience. Blaming Biden for pressuring, after the fact,  is inappropriate when they had the authority to do what they thought was in the best interest of public health.  

I’ve scheduled my booster and I’m grateful."
2021-10-26 6:05,"Because the experts failed to assure me the vaccination (Moderna) I received in April is still effective, I got a booster shot.  It’s a survival instinct; simple as that.  We’ve been told repeatedly over the past year that the vaccines are safe, which is the metric I used while making the decision to get the booster.  Besides, what’s the alternative?  Staying in the house another six months?  No thanks."
2021-10-26 6:08,"We don't know for sure if boosters are needed, but the Biden administration had to recommend them because if they didn't and it turned out they are needed, people might unnecessarily die.  And then the Republicans would fault the Democrats for ""death panels"" or some such nonsense.  I personally would rather be safe than sorry, and I got the booster for that reason (I'm in the recommended age group).  I don't feel I'm taking a shot from someone in a developing country - at this point we are on well on the road to having enough vaccine to distribute globally.  I'm at peace with my decision."
2021-10-26 6:08,"My mother's memory care facility has 16 residents and 9 of them currently have Covid-19. They are all fully vaccinated, but most if not all have not been able to get a booster yet since they had the Moderna vaccine. Today I rushed my Mom out to get her Moderna booster, the first appointment I could find after it got approved.  Clearly boosters are needed for that population.  They all have dementia and are in their 70s and 80s.  Hoping my Mom can make it until her immune response increases."
2021-10-26 6:31,"Why not err on this side of caution and simply allow the boosters for those who want them.  People of all ages have complex medical profiles, so it is ridiculous to object.  Some people over 65 may not need them, and some under may.  And heaven knows, there are simply too many fools who will not get vaccinated at all and therefore present risk for others."
2021-10-26 6:45,"I received the pfizer booster shot last week. I'm over 65, work in a hospital with face-to-face patient contact, but do not conduct medical procedures. In March 2020 I had a significant covid infection, so I thought the benefits outweighed the risks and/or side effects. I may never know.
10 hours after receiving the booster, I felt like I had malaria. Fever of 103, shaking chills, etc.  This lasted 72 hours. 
I had strong reactions to my first two vaccines and then with the booster, my immune system mounted not only an attack, but a nuclear one. I rarely remember being this sick ever in 69 years.
I am a huge supporter of the vaccine, but wonder if those of us who had a significant case of covid are being bamboozled. I would love to hear some medical opinions about this, as there are many like me."
2021-10-26 7:45,If the booster shot is not dangerous we need to cut all of the noise because it is just confusing more people. If your booster shot is the same product as your first two shots it doesn't take a PHD to tell folks it is not going to harm them. Unless the booster is going to make you sicker because you already had two shots we need to give this confusion a rest. The 70 million Americans who have not gotten their first shots are using all of this debate as a reason not to get vaccinated. Scientist may be great at coming up with world shattering breakthroughs but I doubt if any of them would make good used car salesman.
2021-10-26 7:51,"I understand that the kind of blood cancer Colin Powell suffered from eliminates or greatly reduces the body's ability to produce virus-specific antibodies.  A flaw in our covid strategy is that he was considered ""fully vaccinated,"" but probably did not receive any protection at all from his shots.   A healthy unvaccinated person who survived covid would probably have better protection than he did.

Public health officials may not want to admit this because it appears to muddy the messaging, but the goal of being completely forthcoming should overrule the desire for message consistency.

Antibody testing seems like it would be a critical piece of solving the puzzle of how Covid vaccines produce varying degrees of protection based on an individual's immune system response.  Why isn't their use being recommended by the CDC?  They're also not being accepted by authorities, supposedly because we don't know what levels of antibodies provide adequate protection.  How then are decisions regarding waning efficacy being made?  More importantly, how can this blind spot (not knowing whether any vaccinated individual's body has actually derived significant protection from their shots) be dismissed so easily?"
2021-10-26 8:08,"For all their talk about wanting to follow the science, the advisory panel  members made no sense in saying it was ""only fair"" to allow all groups to get boosters. All the vaccines weren't the same -- the J&J should never have been sold as a single shot to begin with, and even now they're not being clear that Moderna would be the most advisable for them. A second shot should not just be an option but a requirement to be considered fully vaccinated for J&J -- anything less is selling them short. They have also not clarified that J&J should likely not be an option for any mix and match third shot after an mRNA series. As for Biden following the science and not interfering with his science advisors, that didnt last long. Just like Trump."
2021-10-26 8:11,What a circus. No wonder there is no public trust.
2021-10-26 8:20,"Tens upon tens of millions of Covid vaccines have already been administered around the world with an amazing safety record - it’s an astounding breakthrough and will hopefully shake up the way new medication is developed. 

The understanding of this virus is ongoing and has already impacted such old diseases as TB and how it is spread. That’s great news, too. 

I’m 65, and just got my booster. My son just turned 12, and he was eager to get his first shot at the same time (thank god he’s not taking his info from nut jobs on SM!). My wife (49, is a teacher, so she got her booster, too) and our 14 year old son are fully vaccinated. Plus, we all got our flu shots. My wife just got her mandated by law TB test done, to make sure it’s safe for her to be in the classroom with students. It’s all on the same level!

Our pets have their rabies and distemper shots, too. What are their chances of them getting rabies without the shots? Realistically, almost nil - they live inside almost exclusively. But we get them vaccinated out of civic duty. 

I have no problem at all with erring on the side of caution. Covid, like TB and rabies, can be a nasty, life-threatening illness. It’s not a hangnail. A shot of a proven vaccine is far better than taking horse medication (and no spoons stick to us!).

I’m thrilled we are all on the way to being a fully vaccinated family!"
2021-10-26 8:49,"This is the most disturbing article about the vaccines, especially the boosters, that I have ever read. All the truth may not always be the best journalistic policy. Is this piece of the truth ""fit to print""?  Take a hard look: would you have more confidence in taking the booster shot after reading this piece? I have a friend who spent literally hours, just today, trying to track down a booster shot before he leaves for a long overseas trip this week. No pharmacy had any vaccine boosters left. And Kaiser Permanente would not administer a booster to him because he was one of the people who received a J&J vaccine. Should he feel glad now? Should he bother himself with this hash of conflicted information? Should any of us?"
2021-10-26 9:15,"For those with normally functioning immune system:

""Delivered too early, another dose of the vaccine could end up “restarting something that was already working,” he said. Ellebedy recommended delaying any booster shots by at least six months from your initial course of vaccination. Eight months is better; even a year would be fine.""

You Might Want to Wait to Get a Booster Shot
There are no simple rules for timing on a third jab—but maybe don’t rush it.

2021-10-26 9:20,"The resistance to the COVID vaccine has become so insanely idiotic that once my family (from grandchildren to older relatives) and I all have our complete dosages (initial plus booster) I will stop caring.  

Those who refuse the vaccines are on their own - and I do mean that I don't care if they are fired, or get sick, or are forced to pay a lot more for health insurance (as smokers are).  

It's not very ""christian"" of me, but I'm done worrying about these people.  Natural selection will take its course."
2021-10-26 10:01,Let's THINK about this. As Covid-19 vaccination rates have increased Covid-19 infection rates have decreased. Area with high infection rates have low vaccination rates. Is it really all that difficult for people to understand?
2021-10-26 10:09,"In the past 18 months we have had 760,000 deaths from Covid 19. In the past 9 months there have been 190 million vaccinations in the U.S. with only a tiny fraction of one percent of negative effects and breakouts. A third vaccination seems very appropriate so we can protect our own population while still donating hundreds of millions of doses to poorer nations."
2021-10-26 11:20,"I understand scientists look at the vaccine as something to stop severe cases and death. But a “mild” case will be very disruptive for my job. I don’t have a good situation to be off work. It will open the door to long term complications. Who wants months or years long health problems if they can avoid them. And I don’t want to be sick with the initial infection either. I get pneumonia after a common cold. I want a booster to avoid all three of these things. These aren’t death and hospitalization, but they are significant impacts on my life and my family’s lives. I see no issue with getting a booster for these reasons."
2021-10-26 11:24,"Booster shots will not stop the spread of the delta variant but a vaccine specifically directed at delta could if developed quickly enough. We should not be complacent in this battle with covid 19 and the high frequency of breakthrough infections from the delta variant with the current vaccines should not be accepted even if most fully vacccinated people are avoiding hospitalization. ""Some Federal Advisers have Misgivings""--these experts seem to be willing to accept widespread infection and the risk of post covid complications that has occurred in 30% of patients in a study of  2 million cases previously infected with covid 19. The federal advisers should be forward thinking and pushing the vaccine makers to develop a vaccine against the delta variant specifically. The science of viral infections suggests that after 12-18 months a strong variant will take hold and last over 1yr."
2021-10-26 11:35,"Follow the science, people!  If a little salt is good for the soup, then 10x is better. If one mask is good, two is better, and three is even better. If one dose of the vaccine is good, two is better, and three is ideal. If vaccines work, which of course, they do, then we need to get the unvaccinated vaccinated to protect the vaccinated from the unvaccinated. It's all just science, people, marvelous, predictable, logical science. Don't question it. Just follow it. I'm off to get my umpteenth booster today, while wearing three masks."
2021-10-26 11:36,"Back in March of 2020 I began wearing an N95 mask, staying home and social distancing.  The CDC first advised against all masks before eventually advising that we wear masks— just not the effective N95s. No they wanted us to pull tee shirts over our faces to save masks for use by medical personnel only, before finally admitting we needed to upgrade our masks. They failed to adequately explain that mask guidance, causing unnecessary confusion and contributing to mask resistance. 

The evidence based truth was always that masks are like birth control, and advising us to use a home made contraceptive makes as much sense as a home made mask.

The idea that we should be factoring pointless guilt over the relative vaccine wealth of our country into what should be a medical risk assessment is not helpful and just repeats the mistakes we made with masks.

I’m still masked in an N95, avoiding public interior spaces and I am getting my booster. A small chaser dose of logic wouldn’t hurt."
2021-10-26 12:05,"If one has a risk factor, then it is reasonable to try to do whatever one can to prevent severe illness.  I'm over 65 and I received the Moderna additional dose.  I want to do my best to stay out of the hospital for my own sake and for the sake of others who may need those hospital beds for serious medical issues and in the hope that my caution will spare overworked medical workers one more preventable case."
2021-10-26 12:27,"Well they've done it. The medical community has managed to make me--a strong defender of all things scientific--doubt their reasoning ability. I think maybe they should have taken a few classes in logic, and done a bit more history and philosophy to learn how to reason well.

Pray tell, what is the reason for people under 60--who rarely have to visit the doctor for the flu--to take the flu shot now? What are the reasons for childhood immunizations for diseases that only rarely lead to hospitalization? What in the world were they thinking? They--these poorly educated medical bureaucrats--are the ones giving ammunition to antivaxxers. Every single quote in this piece will be used in antivaxx propaganda for years to come.

As for the idea the booster lowers confidence in the vaccine--that is patently absurd. Anti-vaxxers have no confidence in the vaccine. The vast majority of people who already have confidence are eager to get the booster--including everyone I know who is eligible. Finally, it's not that hard to find out that the UK & Israel have boostered their populations, so the idea of boosters was out there, whether the U.S. approved it or not. The idea that we who are rational should suffer the chance of illness (illness that produces neurological disease in a certain percentage of mild cases!) so that the anti-vaxxers should not be given an additional reason to doubt the vaccine--absurd. It is not our role to sacrifice health for uneducated conspiracy theorists.

The"
2021-10-26 12:29,"Since last year, so many have died of Covid, and as a 78 year old I'm not ready to die yet, I could make it to my 90's but only if I have the vaccine and can stay out of a nursing home, where their workers refuse the vaccine, which makes it very bad for their patients we are dying in droves. So I'll get the booster and feel at least somewhat safer....

I used to worry about people who won't get the vaccine, but now that I see their stupidity I could care less.These people just don't care about anyone but themselves, but let's see what happens when their kids dies. It will be the same shock, when they find out they have it."
2021-10-26 12:45,"If the booster is safe, why not get it?  My husband and I got it 10 days ago. We were starting to be nervous in indoor restaurants and venues again because we knew our immunity was wearing off and now we feeling protected again. It's so easy now too; was in and out of CVS in 5 minutes.  I am at point of not feeling sorry for the unvaccinated. If thats what they choose, it's their life. But for those who want to feel safe, go get your booster."
2021-10-26 12:49,"There are many vaccines that require 2-3 doses, this is nothing new.  Calling the 3rd Covid jab a booster shot is a bad piece of communication that undermines confidence.  We don't generally debate the need for a second shingles shot or third doses of hepatitis or hpv or meningococal vax but it has become a thing for covid."
2021-10-26 9:24,"Confusion—The Covid pandemic has been full of it. If there's anything we the public need, it's one unified voice on what to do to fight this pandemic. Instead we get Tom, Dick, and Harriet, each with a different opinion. And the outcome of all of that is confusion and distrust of anything we hear or read. They talk about giving us choices but we don't need choices, we need a firm DIRECTION."
2021-10-25 14:11,"The booster appears to be the same as the original vaccine. Since the CDC has announced that the original cannot prevent infection from delta, what’s the rationale for more of the same?

The argument I’ve heard is that it still reduces the severity of the virus if you’re infected. But for those under sixty the data shows that as long as we don’t have serious comorbidities, we won’t get seriously ill anyway.

So why not focus the entire vaccination program of the elderly with weakened immune systems and those with diseases that suggest they couldn’t also fight off a virus infection?

Too much of even a good thing is still too much."
2021-10-25 23:08,"Look at the in vivo data, this should not even be a discussion. A simple look at the ratio of infections to hospitalizations shows very little shift from last winter, despite pretty high levels of vaccination in the most at-risk age groups.

The UK data shows that 2 doses of Pfizer or AZ provides very little or no protection against infection for individuals over 40 and only modest protection for 20-40 year olds when masks mandates are lifted. There appears to be currently no path to herd immunity on the basis of the current vaccines. 

The UK data also shows that current vaccines reduce the risk of hospitalization about 6-fold for 50-60 year-olds, but the level of protection drops of sharply over 70. Boosters produce a significant, but quite possibly temporary, rise in immunity in seniors.

But also consider the absolute numbers for 50 and 60-year olds: the UK data shows that even when doubly vaccinated, they have on average 1% chance of hospitalization. With about 75 million Americans in their 50s and 60s, even if they were all vaccinated, that would be up to 750,000 potential hospitalizations, which our hospitals certainly could not tolerate over a winter.

If people want to get closer to normal, we should inoculate all kids in school and accept that we will quite possibly need boosters for 50+ year olds and people with other risk factors every winter. And make a habit of getting tested before visiting friends or relatives at risk."
2021-10-19 2:23,"As one who received the J&J--it was what was most readily available at the time--this is good news. 

Hopefully getting a booster won't be fiasco this time."
2021-10-19 2:23,"for those trying to make sense of the ""Mix and Match"" approach:

Each of the approved vaccines contains a nucleic acid sequence (i.e., RNA or DNA) which encodes a protein from SARS-CoV2. 

The mRNA vaccines (BioNTec/Pfizer and Moderna) contain mRNA encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle which delivers the mRNA into the patient's cell. Think of this as a protective bubble which protects the mRNA. The lipid nanoparticle is inert, meaning it does not elicit an immune response on its own. The inertness of the lipid nanoparticle makes this vaccine less potent, thus a two dose regimen is required for efficacy.

In contrast, the J&J vaccine uses another virus (adenovirus) as a vaccine vector (i.e, backbone) to deliver DNA encoding the SARS-CoV2 spike protein. By utilizing adenovirus, the J&J vaccine elicits a stronger immune response and allows for protection after a single dose.

Now the twist - with the J&J vaccine, the patient will develop antibodies against both the SARS-CoV2 spike protein AND the adenovirus backbone used for the vaccine. Thus, when you administer the same J&J vaccine the second time, the immune response against the backbone (adenovirus) limits the immune response to the SARS-CoV2 spike protein. This ""vector neutralizing immunity"" limits the benefit from repeated doses of these types of vaccines.

By using a different vaccine for the ""booster"", the immune response against the J&J backbone is avoided and the immune response against SARS-CoV2 is boosted."
2021-10-19 2:34,"I got the J&J vaccination in late March because there was no other vaccine available to me at the time. I'll get a booster shot as soon as it becomes available.  However, I'm tired of reading about these ""updates"" with the right hand not really seeming to know what the left hand is doing. Please - those of you in charge - get your act together and stop confusing the public."
2021-10-19 3:02,I got the Moderna vaccine in February and March simply because it was available at the time. Had no idea it would end up being apparently a little better than the others. I'm high risk but don't fall into the narrow official criteria for it issued so far; I hope they will broaden that and give more flexibility. Anything beats dying of a disease that is now almost entirely preventable.

2021-10-19 3:24,"The J and J vaccine should be pulled- it is so clearly ineffective. I hope to stick to Moderna, which is leading the pack. Wonder what kind of behind-the-scenes deals have been made to downplay this fact."

2021-10-19 3:37,"The appeal for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine should increase since most Americans have had the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines.  People vaccinated with different vaccines is an obviously intelligent strategy to broaden the number of different antibodies attacking the virus.  Those receiving the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine should consider the J&J vaccine, except for those women who are more susceptible to the blot clotting issue."
2021-10-19 3:42,I went to my pharmacy today.  I had the J&J on march 9th and wanted either the moderna or J&J as a booster.  They refused.  Would only give shots to the Pfizer recipients.
2021-10-19 4:28,"Search for ""Heterologous SARS-CoV-2 Booster Vaccinations – Preliminary Report"".

In the PDF version (preview or download), go to page 24.

Wouldn't it be simpler if the CDC just recommends Moderna 100 mcg as booster for everyone?

(I understand each group only had about 50 people, and there is concern about heart inflammation in young men especially with Moderna.  But comparing groups 3 and 9, for best protection over time, I don't understand why people over 65 would not want to boost with Moderna even if they had Pfizer.)

(I was similarly puzzled as to why people would pick J&J when they could also get an mRNA shot after data became available -- if they wanted ""one and done"", wouldn't they be better off to just get the first dose of the mRNA and skip the second dose.)

Please, CDC/FDA/government, just give us the common sense recommendation."

2021-10-19 4:37,"It is the article, not the FDA or the Advisory Committee, that is confusing. I listened to both days of the Advisory Committee meeting, and I am impressed that they are doing as good a job as can possibly be done under the circumstances. Some of this article accurately reports what was discussed at the meeting, but much of it is just the conflicting opinions of those apparently advising the reporters. 
All of the commenters who seem to think the FDA does not know what it is doing should listen to these meetings, which are publicly available. If you do not understand what they are talking about, please consider the possibility that it is you, not the FDA, who lack the expertise to voice an opinion!"

2021-10-19 3:29,"Tired of waiting in limbo as the alphabet bureaucracies take their sweet time taking approval actions everyone knows they will eventually approve.  Was there any doubt that the Pfizer vaccine would get approved after the glowing phase three trial results were released in late Oct 2020?  None the less, it took the FDA 6 more weeks to approve the EUA for it.   Meanwhile, tens of thousands died.   Since July, the data has been clear that boosters increase immunity against covid by many fold and the mixing brands is safe and effective.   This is a pandemic and time wasted is lives lost.  Very frustrating."

2021-10-19 6:02,"The data from the J and J booster study likely reflects the response to the vaccines initial dosing. Moderna is giving a more robust response than Pfizer—which is excellent — but not the same level as Moderna. J & J has given a mediocre response and I would not recommend getting a second dose. AstraZeneca is a two shot version of J &J and in Europe the second shot used was Pfizer which gave a better response than 2 shots of AstraZeneca also. I have had excellent responses using Moderna booster with all 3 vaccines and expect a longer response with Moderna and I am likely to continue to use this preferentially.I have seen no adverse effects mixing the vaccines and there is no biochemical reason to expect otherwise. Next we need a new vaccine specifically for the delta variant because even with the maximal detectable antibody response I am seeing breakthrough infections. Thankfully, none of my vaccinated patients with detectable antibodies have been hospitalized or died from covid so far with the breakthrough infections.The vaccines are working."

Outside the US, there’s a lot of mixing going on."

It's the totally unvaccinated who are the problem. I was grateful and happy to have access to the first two doses of Pfizer but I was sick for three days after the second dose-- a small price to pay, of course, but I can't do that several times a year, especially when we have unvaccinated people spreading it and allowing it to mutate. There is also no way I would ever get a flu shot at the same time as the booster. Why is everyone so blase about overloading our systems like this? I don't even allow my dog to get several vaccines in one day. As usual, we are doing things haphazardly and without fully understanding the benefits or repercussions."

J&J is unsafe, no it’s OK

J&J is one and done; no it was always 2. Or will it become 3?

No, Pfizer is not approved for everyone

No, Moderna data aren’t ready yet

Of course you need a booster, always did. After eight months.

No, there are two different technologies, created independently by three companies

But hey - mix and match is OK!!!"
2021-10-19 10:59,Here in New York at least people who wanted a Moderna booster just went to CVS and got one.  It was really easy.  I got my Pfizer booster at the hospital.  Why is this so hard for the rest of the country?

How many recipients in this study? Is this increase of 76-fold relating to age or other important factor?

Why is this discrepancy of using different booster shots so large that lacks conventional reasoning? Why?"
2021-10-19 11:23,Canada has used a mix and match approach to Covid vaccines from the start and it has proven to be an extremely effective approach.
2021-10-19 11:34,"To put some perspective on this, think about the number of cells that an average 70 kg man (about 155 lbs) man has in his body.  The number is estimated to be, according to an abstract of a paper by the N.I.H., around 30,000,000,000,000 (30 trillion).  These cells are a mix of types, red blood cells, white blood cells, muscle cells, fat cells (ugh), etc.  Now realize how complex the interaction of all these cells must be to keep that 70 kg man alive, moving, thinking, etc.

Now, I would wager most of you have seen the innards of a PC.  How many parts are there inside the PC? Less than the parts in a human?  Now how many of you really understand how all those parts work together to put an image on your monitor?  I’ve owned and used personal computers for about 40 years, and was a programmer for 27 years, and I have, at best, a vague idea of how that happens.

Are we really surprised that there is some discussions and differences between scientists dealing with a relatively new virus and it’s variants, and vaccines to prevent that virus from, hopefully, infecting or, even more hopefully, killing a person?"
2021-10-19 12:01,"What was and is the data showing the FDA telling them not to have us mix and match yesterday and now today this week we all can and it's actually beneficial even though we (the FDA/Fauci) knew months ago it was ok to do so and J&J vaccine efficacy rates were questionable and may need a second shot. But we were also told that a two shot program was fine and now, Pfizers 3rd booster is the cat's meow of vaccinations. Any guarantees on this?"
2021-10-19 12:08,"I do believe news like this leads to confusion and fuel for anti-vaxers. 

I work in a health care practice where only 4 of us are vaccinated.
It's outrageous how dangerously misinformed these people are and yesterday the death of Mr Powell just fueled their tirades."
2021-10-19 12:42,Sometimes I think I live in Bizarro world. How does the US  still NOT have an executive level Health Communications Director? The FDA and CDC regularly miscommunicate their messages to the American people. Imagine a Jen Psaki type person managing the message related to health.... ya know.... during a PANDEMIC!
2021-10-19 12:45,"In many ways, this makes perfect sense to me.  Science and thinking evolves.  Just as in the mask wearing.  At first they did not recommend it…. There were not enough masks, better to stay home.  More studies were done, mask became more available, and we are recommended  to wear masks.  Made sense to me.  

I think this “confusion” about vaccines is really the result of the quest for the best solutions, and a very quickly evolving research.  And, the relative transparency of the FDA which reports their findings as they come out. That the efficacy is constantly being evaluated in real time, is a good thing.

I’m going ahead and getting my third Pfizer vaccine.  Grateful that I can.  Not looking forward to side affects… the headache and just the “ugh” feeling that may lay me low for a day or two. If it makes me more confident to lead my life normally, and not become ill and a burden to health care…

All that said, it could be better, this messaging from FDA.  I can see how this gives fuel and fodder to anti vax crowd.  “See?  The FDA doesn’t even know what works!”

Rather, this is what I glean from it all: That the FDA and my government has a keen interest in ending this pandemic and keeping me safe and healthy.  They have done miraculous work, and are coming  up with pretty good solutions for which I am grateful.  I take it under advisement that my booster is not the end all solution and down the road there may be something else that I must do to keep myself as safe as I can."
2021-10-19 3:11,Clear as mud!  Thanks FDA and CDC for  once again proving that you are the gold standard of scientific review and implementation.
2021-10-19 3:12,"It’s a grab bag! Just take something. It’s all good. Who cares? It’s science, trust us!"
2021-10-19 4:18,"Comments like ""clear as mud,"" ""It's a grab bag,"" and ""this is power gone amok"" show people want simple certainty when reality is messy. When an authority figure doesn't tell them precisely what to do next, it means no one knows anything.  

Naw. It just means science is grinding along as normal. That science - and I've just reviewed the few articles in the medical lit on Covid vaccine mixing - is fairly straightforward, and the analyses are decently designed:

1) Our immune systems may benefit from getting different ""looks"" provided by different vaccines. This is textbook virology, and appears to be why people who have caught Covid nonetheless benefit from a vaccine. 

2) This ""mixing benefit"" appears to be particularly the case for the Johnson and Johnson and Astra-Zeneca vaccines that are based on the whole virus; boosters with a mRNA vaccine did in fact promote a far stronger neutralizing antibody response. Later T-Cell response is an open question. (Translation: Neutralizing antibodies help keep you from getting something. T-Cells help you shake it off once you get it.)

3) We do not know yet if people who received two shots of Pfizer or Moderna will benefit as much from mixing. Studies to address this are happening as I type. Colleagues who work in this area indicate there will be some benefit, but nothing as dramatic as J&J or A-Zen. 

So stay tuned, and stop expecting good science to have the same reassuring finality as good religion. Or bad politicians."
2021-10-19 5:34,"Finally, there's official recognition that a vaccine's adverse effects may warrant switching to a different vaccine when getting a third shot or booster. 

I lost a great deal of hair after getting Moderna's vaccinations, just as I had after being vaccinated for hepatitis A and B several years ago. I filed VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Report System) reports with the CDC after each Moderna vacccination. I also called the CDC to determine how I could get the Pfizer vaccine instead of Moderna's for a third shot. I was told to get a doctor's letter or order, which I did via a prescription.

There's a reason why Moderna is recommending a half-dose for its boosters. It kicked my socks off, or shocked my system as an expert in female pattern hair loss told me. He likened it to the response individuals on chemotherapy commonly have."
2021-10-19 6:34,"I got my first Moderna shot in March. I had some side effects, but nothing too serious.  Still, I didn't want to get another headache or itchy rash for a while, so I canceled my 2nd appointment.  Then I read a study from the U.K. showing people who waited 12 to 14 weeks to get a 2nd dose had more antibodies than those who got vaccines during the recommended period.   I made an appointment about 12 weeks after my first shot and returned to the same pharmacy.  They refused to give me the shot!  ""You waited too long.""   I didn't give up, called the SC DHEC and was able to get my 2nd shot at the same location.  Here's something I noticed. Although Medicare paid for both shots, I was surprised to see a cost difference between the 2 shots, both Moderna.   First shot:  Amount charged $28.39.  Medicare paid $15.94.  Second shot:  Amount charged $56.99.  Medicare paid $37.44   Does anyone know why?  I thought the first and second dose were exactly the same."
2021-10-19 7:34,"This is teetering on slapstick. Experts claim they don’t know what a booster is, but they know one when they see it. See also the Samsung family of smartphones which is every conceivable size of phone to compete with Apple who at the time had one. If it looks like a vaccine, swims like a vaccine, and quacks like a vaccine, then it probably is a vaccine. Keep calm and booster on. Follow the science. Just two more weeks till herd immunity."
2021-10-19 8:54,"Healthy people are better choosers than unhealthy people.  The age-old mutually exclusive contrast between ""what is"" and ""what ought to be"" is a false one.  We discover rather than invent or create what values people trend to, yearn for, struggle for, as we improve ourselves (grow) and which values are lost when they get sick.  

When we feel strong, and if free choice is possible, we tend to spontaneously choose the true rather than the false, good rather than evil, aliveness over deadness, uniqueness rather than stereotype, and so forth.   

Self-aware, healthy people choose on the whole ""what is good for them"" in biological terms, for sure, and perhaps in other senses as well.  One might assume that given enough time, we would all eventually choose what healthy choosers choose quickly. Or that we might sooner or later see the wisdom of their choice and make the same choice. 

The highest values are within human nature itself, to be discovered within. This is a stark contrast to the customary and older belief that the ""highest values"" can only come from a supernatural God or from some other source outside of human nature itself."
2021-10-19 13:57,"The FDA panel originally recommended a booster for J&J recipients between 2 and 6 months after your first shot. Unfortunately virtually all J&J recipients received their shot 7 months ago or longer, as the vaccine has been out of fashion since they paused it's distribution in April. (I got mine March 13) So their recommendation was useless for virtually every J&J recipient. 

How to fix this problem ?

They're going to tell J&J recipients like me that it's OK to ""mix and match"" then will probably not make any J&J vaccine available to us, thereby forcing us to get MRNA boosters.

Problem is that 1. my doctor recommends I stick with the vaccine I originally got and  2. the evidence that ""mixing and matching"" is better is still scant (an observation that is buried in, like paragraph 14 of this article

As a J&J recipient I am prerared to feel slighted."
2021-10-19 15:19,"Well, having received the two doses of Moderna, anyway, when I hit my 6 months, I'll get it again for my booster.
For the J&J people, (if it is offered, and I see no reason why it wouldn't be) even a second J&J would be better. It's just studies indicate that you can get BETTER immunity by getting one of the mRNA vaccines.
One caveat - I'd probably go with my doctor's advice. They should know you about as well as anyone, so can anticipate untoward reactions, or whatever.
In any case, I see these latest recommendations as a good thing."
2021-10-19 15:55,"Canada led the way on this, being the only country to mix and match. It has proven to be a successful way to get more people vaccinated and seems to maintain high levels of Covid resistance.

2021-10-19 15:12,What are the booster recommendations for people who got breakthrough covid cases (were fully vaccinated yet got sick with covid thereafter)?
2021-10-19 16:13,"They don't need to allow ""mix and match"" but simply need to allow mixing the vaccines. Matching vaccines has been not only allowed but recommended."
2021-10-19 17:09,"For those who are concerned that the scientific community has multiple opinions, and has changed course throughout the pandemic: that's a GOOD thing. 
Good science reviews the data, learns from it,  changes as appropriate, and acknowledges the degree to which it is unsure.
We would all as people do well to learn to do the same. 
Of course the FDA has changed course during the pandemic. It didn't know then what it knows now. And it's acknowledging that what it knows now is not certain and that there are some mixed results.
That does not mean that they are randomly changing recommendations, or don't know what they are doing, or in a conspiracy to mess us up. 
It means that they are looking at the actual available SCIENCE, interpreting it the best they can, and issuing recommendations. That's very good news. If they never changed their recommendations, we'd be in big trouble."

""The ongoing booster trial is evaluating the safety and tolerability of the current BNT162b2 (currently available from Pfizer) vaccine. While we believe a third dose of BNT162b2 has the potential to preserve the highest levels of protective efficacy against all currently known variants, including Delta, we are remaining vigilant and are also developing an updated version of the vaccine that targets the full spike protein of the Delta variant. The first batch of the mRNA for the trial has already been manufactured, and we anticipate the clinical studies to begin in August, subject to regulatory approvals.”

2021-10-20 10:43,"Nursing home jobs, esp those involved with direct care, are difficult, labor-intensive, at times dangerous. They generally pay poorly.

Staffing is almost invariably held tight — profits — under normal circumstances. Many openings go unfilled. This leads to overwork, more hours, possibly more hazardous conditions for the remaining staff.

Add COVID. And misinformation. And now the COVID immunization initiation becomes fuzzy.

Also, l a b o r  shortage. Cold and flu, indoor season coming up.

Nursing homes may not get much pressure to vaccinate in the foreseeable future."
2021-10-20 10:45,"If families of nursing home patients who caught Covid from an unvaccinated staff member and then died began suing that nursing home, you can bet that the managements of every nursing home would start mandating shots.

We don’t send our love ones there to die because the staff does not have the vaccinations (this includes the viccinnes and flu shots).
The companies and association MUST be held accountable for lack of having healthy staff. If our love ones ‘death is the result of unvaccinated staff, we have the right and obligation to sue the health care provider.
“ But many nursing home administrators are waiting for the federal government to issue new rules that will govern a mandatory vaccination program for all their staff members that President Biden first announced two months ago. And some facilities and labor groups are still pushing for a testing option in lieu of a shot.”
So the nursing care administrations does not have the guts to provide the safe place that they advertised in their fancy brochure. They pay the staff the very minimum in a lot of cases but the stockholders do very well. This is why the administration is AFRAID to require the proper vaccines, they are afraid their employees will quit if they have to get the required shots.
 It is hard to get good health worker to do the things necessary to keep our love one clean and safe, for minimum wage. Money and education is the solution for this problem.

Those who fail to comply must have their license suspended pending re-education and compliance. Unemployment benefits should be denied for those who are fired for cause. Enough.
2021-10-20 11:48,"“It is medically wrong and borders on unethical to have unvaccinated nursing home staff caring for residents,” said Dr. Michael Wasserman, a geriatrician and former nursing home executive who has become a critic of the industry. “The vaccine works. It has made a profound difference.”

“Borders on the unethical”? That has to be the understatement of the year. Look, you get what you pay for. With what we pay direct care staff in most nursing homes? Yeah, “vaccine hesitancy” is just one indicator of the quality of employee attracted to “direct care” labor. (And it is laborious.) That “hesitancy” is indicative of the essential contempt too many “direct care” workers have for their vulnerable charges. And that contempt translates directly into neglect and abuse in other forms for which the “industry” is justifiably notorious."
2021-10-20 11:52,Never ever for ANY reason go to a nursing home.  Know when it is time to let go.
2021-10-20 11:56,"How does anyone know for sure that a vaccinated 90 year old died because of an unvaccinated staff member? With the Delta variant, vaccinated people can transmit the virus. I know several people with Covid right now, and they are all fully vaccinated."
2021-10-20 11:59,"This whole situation has made me more adamant than ever to dispose of myself before I ever live in a nursing home.  Too bad conservatives won't  make it easy, instead fighting mandates all the way, showing just how much they value elderly and infirm life."
2021-10-20 12:02,"At Sun Terrace in Sun City Center, my wife's 99-year-old mother can't receive visitors because some of the staff at that facility frequently have Covid. Despite the Florida Governor's interference with masking, which is bad enough by itself, when you ask the staff why they aren't getting vaccinated, many of them say ""the shot doesn't stop Covid."" This results in very little oversight for the nursing home residents along with a great deal of loneliness. 

It's hard for me to understand why people like this aren't fired just for being too stupid to work in healthcare, along with the danger they represent to patients and to other staff."
2021-10-20 12:04,"Do these poor elderly people have anyone to advocate for them?  It is astonishing that is has been allowed to happen.  Also a good window into the minds of the folks who work in these homes.  Obviously they don't care about their patients.

If my children cannot care for me when I am no longer able, as I did for my parents, and they did for theirs, I will end my life.  

Interesting to note that this seems to be an American problem similar to some of our other maladies:  ""Institutionalization rates for older adults in eight developed countries (United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, France, Germany, and Japan) are estimated to range between 5 and 7 percent of the total elderly adult population. Use rates of formal home care among the population age sixty-five and older in these same eight countries are estimated to range from a low of 5 to 5.5 percent in Japan and the United Kingdom to a high of 16 to 17 percent in Canada and the United States. In the United States, data from the 1982, 1989, and 1994 National Long-Term Care Surveys on use of formal home care by older Americans with chronic functional disabilities residing in the community show an increase from 25 to 35 percent.""

Why are the elderly disposable here?  Why are families so fragmented?"
2021-10-20 12:10,"Instead of a raffle for "" a chance to go to Disneyland""  each nursing home employee should be offered 3 days of paid time off to get the vaccine: One to get the shot and two following to recover from what can be some miserable but temporary side effects. Most, if not all of these workers are making very, very low wages and many have second jobs just to get by. Taking time off to get a shot and then feel ill is not a realistic ask."
2021-10-20 12:10,The nursing home resident who feels like a sitting duck is a sitting duck. Breakthrough infections in the vulnerable elderly are at risk of dying. This could not have been made more obvious than with the tragedy of General Powell's death. Nursing Homes receive Medicare and Medicaid funding. A federal mandate could be employed with the use of a single pen and paper. And mandates work. The vast majority of hospital workers in NYC have chosen to vaccinate rather than seek unemployment for which they would be ineligible. It takes political courage to institute controversial mandates. That is lacking in our nation's capital. The virus is at the mercy of vaccines and we are at the mercy of politicians.
2021-10-20 12:12,"I know most of the ""aides"" in nursing homes as well as ""home health aides"" here in NYC are of West Indian or African descent, I assure you they will eventually get the vaccine if mandated because so many support family members out of the country. They send barrels home consistently filled with clothes, toiletries etc for their poorer communities and children they have left in the Caribbean being cared for by family members. They will not jeopardize losing this important means of support, they know the job market for them means eventually they will have to be vaccinated periodT!

A good friend’s father, isolated for months from his family in a nursing home, died of Covid obviously contracted from a “care” giver. Sadly, because money is the only thing that speaks to many businesses, filing lawsuits against them for gross negligence (as death and injury from covid are entirely foreseeable results of permitting unvaccinated workers) may be the best way to get effective vaccine requirements that protect patients."

1.  You are already mandated to drive in certain lanes on the road.  And you are grateful that the person coming at you in the other lane going 50 or 60 mph is mandated to do so as well.

2.  You are mandated to not kill others.  And there might, eventually, be a good case brought forth in some court somewhere that if you knowingly have Covid or any other highly infectious deadly disease and you spread it to someone who dies you could face manslaughter charges.

People are mandated to do things all the time they don't seam to freak out about.  But when people who are seen as progressive introduce the idea of mandates for public safety issues in order to save the lives of those who are left with no choice, the Right uses it for another opportunity to throw gas on the great cultural divide tearing our nation apart."

We owe such a debt to our elders and to watch them be hung out there in the wilderness while we spit on their accomplishments, courage and tenacities is beyond me."
2021-10-20 12:55,"People need to see the numbers- they need to see the number of deaths tied to the vaccination rate and compare that to other facilities with similar bed counts

More than 16,194 people died in Florida from Covid during the 90 days of July through September 2021.  More people died in Florida this summer than in any other state in the country.

Compare that to NY as state with similar population who lost 1,791 during the same period."

And he is a far-right guy who used horse rides to proclaim his disrespect for human life. Why the families of the prisoners of nursing homes didn't ask the staff if they wee fully vaccinated? Men and women who provided care, food and a home to their descendants during many years deserve respect. The spirit of Bela Lugosi  will be the star of the terror movie: ""Unvaccinated Staff""."

2021-10-20 13:14,"As a physician who works in nursing homes, I have had a first hand glimpse into the devastation of COVID-19 and the reluctance of staff to get vaccinated.  While I strongly advocate for all staff and residents to be vaccinated the reality on the ground makes this very challenging.

1) Staffing shortages are a huge problem.  NHs have had increase use of agency staffing, high burnout rate, and overworked staff.   This is not sustainable.  CNAs have been moving to other jobs, in fact, we have had a few leave to work in manufacturing at the new Tesla factory. NHs are competing with restaurant for cooks and dish washers.  

2) The national and local environment effects perception around vaccination.  Nursing homes have a hard time to combat state and national leaders advocating for no mandates.

3) Families do not have to be vaccinated to visit, and within my communities we have had multiple infections start from families or hired caregivers that brought it into a facilities.

Every nursing home is worried that if they push the envelope too hard, they will not be able to take care of the residents as staff will leave to other nursing home that do not have mandates.  We should not put the pressure just on nursing homes but on our government and society to make a broad plan applicable to all nursing homes with a mitigation strategy for short term risk of staff shortages.  Putting all the blame on NH is just unfair."
2021-10-20 13:19,"This is truly a failure of federal leadership.  It's time to stop messing around.    It shouldn't take months to put the regulations in place--this is an emergency.

If there were a federal mandate, then workers would know they cannot simply jump to some other facility that doesn't have a mandate.  I don't care that many of the effected workers are lower income.   That doesn't give them license to jeopardize the lives of those they care for."
2021-10-20 13:13,"This article begins to highlight as has our pandemic the hidden problem of elder care.
There are the corporate chains and the lobbyist entities whose only bottom line is profit and smooth legislation.
There are the workers who are doing hard work without excellent training and support and payment that provides a solid income and life.
There are the professional staff that are skeleton crews. Few nursing homes provide full service and team professional support. Many internal medicine doctors and others do not follow their patients into the nursing home. This creates a strong dissolve in the responsibility of the nursing home paid physician who has no knowledge of his or her new resident and sees someone sometimes at their worst and most vulnerable.
There are the families who too many times learn of the differences between skilled and no skilled care and the actual difference between Medicaid and Medicare at the time of a loved one’s medical crisis. And because of the push for beds in acute hospital settings if the hospital system does not have a wing for extended care literally have to take whatever bed is available regardless of location or sense of good fit.
 The patients are in crisis and pulled away from known supports and their physician.
The extensive knowledge base of geriatric medicine on  issues like sundown if and alternative therapies sometimes has not been passed down. Many nursing homes do not have patient councils and or other heard involvement ."
2021-10-20 13:32,What is any unvaccinated person doing working anywhere near a nursing home? Being vaccinated against anything the residents could catch should come with the job.

2021-10-20 13:39,"I could write pages on this.
My 92 yr old mother's in facility in NH... one of the ""high end""ones promoting Quality of Life for residents.
Over the past 20 months my mother has spent probably collective of 6 months plus in total isolation due to Covid  cases in the facility .
This means restricted to her 12x13' room seeing staff when they do meds, drop off meals and a single ""wellness"" visit from Activities Director. Other places call this Solitary Confinement!

I've watched my Mom has declined mentally and physically due to this lack of socialization. The residents have been vaccinated since February .

The most recent two wk ""lockdown"" was just lifted.  WHY the recent lockdown ?  
The DON stated it was due to N.H Public Health Guidelines AND  the fact  FOUR UNVACCINATED staff tested positive.

I have asked the facility time after time about the policy and whether they will make changes after 20 months and going into winter.  I'm not not even getting a Cut and Paste reply  about Public Health recommendations now. 

When I was working as a nurse, I wasn't allowed to work in hospital or Home Health w/o a Flu vaccine.
But I worked in VT, not N.H. The ""Live Free of Die ""State 
And, yes, I am yelling in CAPS b/c I'm ANGRY ! 

At 92, socialization is much more important to my mother than spending another 2 wks w/ only  TV she can barely hear to keep her company. 
Even direct floor staff agree.

I LOVE my mother but it really comes down to ""They shoot horses, don't they ??"
2021-10-20 13:49,It's a shame that so many healthcare professionals don't take seriously their responsibility to the vulnerable clients they're getting paid to serve. Such people deserve neither continued employment nor any government benefits. Losing their services will be a temporary hardship at worst. Employers need to get serious about purging the dead wood from their payrolls.
2021-10-20 13:53,"In Newton, MA, a home health care agency, during last year's initial Covid events and prior to the general availability of vaccines,  was dispatching aides who would show up in homes unmasked. There was a long interval before they were (all?) vaccinated. How much of this observation of lack of vaccination is due to profiteering by home care agencies? In my experience, their staffing quality varies dramatically, involving issues of punctuality and services rendered. And these services are very expensive. One might hope a national standard will eventually be applied, with Medicare supervision."
2021-10-20 14:06,That these nursing homes and assisted living facilities are ‘for profit’ is all you need to know. We have no one to blame but ourselves.

They come into contact with the residents daily. This is reckless endangerment as the elderly are especially vulnerable to severe illness and death from this virus.

I have a 75 year old aunt who is in a nursing home in central Illinois. No one is allowed to visit her. She is vaccinated but recently contracted Covid - presumably from a staff member - and was moved out of the facility to a hospital in Chicago. Why was she infected when we have safe, free and highly effective vaccines? Will she now die because some people insist on believing bogus science and we don’t have mandates in place to protect each other?"

Otherwise, please find another job."
2021-10-20 14:58,"A federal mandate requiring all nursing home employees to be vaccinated must be imposed immediately, and NO religious exemptions allowed.  No one unvaxxed should have ANY contact with residents/patients.  Serious fines and federal funding forfeiture should be imposed.

2021-10-20 15:16,"Given the mandate uncertainty described in the story, one should expect nursing homes with marginal staff vax rates in relation to resident census to be experiencing systematically different census growth rates than homes with higher vaxxed staff-to-resident ratios.  A talented statistician (using the federal data cited in the story) could easily match the weekly reports by each of ~14,000 individual homes from, say, 8/1 through 9/26, and see what the unwanted effects of a federal mandate might be -- and where they may play out.  After all, people who should be in a nursing home may end up somewhere else where care quality is less even (e.g, at home, perhaps burdening family members who would otherwise be in the labor force) or where cost is higher than in a nursing home (e.g., in a hospital, perhaps foreclosing the admission of others more in need of such care, particularly if hospital workers are subject to the same mandate)."
2021-10-20 15:21,"Why not ask the nursing home residents if they want to be cared for by unvaccinated people. If the staff hears the request from the residents themselves they might be more receptive.

If we have mandates everywhere and noncompliance results in job termination without unemployment benefits after a few weeks or months of zero income my guess is that most will comply."

Emergency rooms are not accessible and if you get to one then you are triaged out in favor of a deplorable; home health care is a joke, designed to bilk a negligent Medicare system; Hospice with its daily reimbursement schedule is in conflict with good care.  Private home health care agencies can't get workers, let alone vaccinated workers.  The federal government is focused on ""expanding"" Medicare instead of fixing current problems.  And within this mess we have 50% of the country who are more concerned with ""personal freedom"" (at least when it comes to masks and vaccinations) than the health and safety of the rest of us.

2021-10-20 15:50,As an immigrant I fear growing old in the United States. It looks like the elderly are disposable. It is financially advantageous for these nursing home companies to clear out their homes from the most vulnerable residents that cost much more to care for. Covid-19 was great for their balance sheets. The hesitancy of the federal government to implement and supervise the vaccine mandate for nursing home workers is horrible. I hope that families will sue these companies and their workers for negligence.
2021-10-20 14:07,"I’m a pretty liberal-minded physician. I love science and vaccines. 

Vaccines are primarily meant to decrease the severity of illness, not transmission.

Yes that’s true, But that’s not the point of the vaccine, the point of the vaccine is to keep hospital￼s from being overwhelmed.

3500 participants
1/2 placebo - 1750 got the jab, 875 boys
Vaxed - no cases no hospitalization no death.

2021-10-20 11:01,"Vaccinating little kids will break the back of the disease.  This is the last demographic that has not been innoculated.  If parents do not want their kids to have to wear masks, then get them vaccinated.

The high percentages of parents who so far have indicated that they want to wait or will refuse to get their children the shot is appalling.  You would think that 90% or more would want to protect their kids, not half.  This is a tragedy.

Politics is one thing.  Making a bad decision for yourself often hurts those around you such as drug addiction or spreading disease.  But don't hurt your kids because of your politics.  That's not freedom, that's cruelty.  Children are not property.  They are not owned.  They are helpless beings that must be cared for and preventing them from getting sick is a big part of that care.  

Probably the worst, phoney advice out there being pushed by Fox News is, ""Do your own research"".  That's what the NIH, the CDC, and the FDA have already down.  These agencies are staffed with tens of thousands of dedicated professionals who apply strict and rigorous scientific protocols to test vaccines.  They have cleared its use.  What other research is there?"

Therefore they could not support universal vaccination for this age group.  Why is it in the U.S. the almost exact opposite attitude toward vaccination of these children taken?  In this article the medical authorities talk of ""potentially"" slowing the spread of the virus and children are not affected as severely as adults, but one must consider the long term effects.  These are the justifications for ""emergency use"" which in the adult population has morphed into mandates.  Are the health authorities in Great Britain ignorant or stupid as those who support universal vaccination in the U.S. call those who oppose vaccinations?"
2021-10-20 10:54,"As a physician who administers the COVID vaccine to my patients, I’m always frustrated when I hear willful ignorance masquerading as thoughtful decision making. Too many people believe that the credibility of information is determined by its volume and not the quality of the data or its proponents. But as we know, social media (facebook!) amplifies anything that is sensational or controversial with no regard for its veracity. Most people can tell the difference. Those who can’t just aren’t trying. I’m not very hopeful that parents will apply better logic to getting their kids vaccinated than they do for themselves. So half the kids will unfortunately go without the vaccine."

2021-10-20 11:37,"I've read this article carefully but as a parent it doesn't provide me with the information I need.

For example, what are the risk/benefit calculations for children's vaccination?

The article mentions ""children are still susceptible to serious or long-haul versions of the illness."" This is too vague. How susceptible? 1 in 1,000? One in a million?

What did the drug safety review board say about the children's vaccine?

My understanding is that for all children's products the FDA appoints and independent review board to review both the pharmaceutical company data and the FDA's preliminary report.

This is crucial information for parents, but no mention in this article.

What do we know about school systems that either have vaccinated kids? Or haven't but have been operating during the delta surge? Israel, Taiwan and Sweden come to mind.

I'm a little frustrated with this level of reporting. The FDA has never in its history approved a children's product in a matter of months.

In other words, I want to read the label before I have my child injected. Everything might be fine with this vaccine for kids. 

But ""might be"" isn't the standard I and Im sure other parents use for determining their child's safety.

And the biggest unanswered question is since the CDC says the adult vaccine doesn't prevent infection or spread by the infected, is the same true for the children's version?

Are we looking at booster shots every few months? If so, where is the safety data on that?"

Lamentably, politicians and school board members are scared witless of being booted out of office or worse by these angry and belligerent people, so they will not institute a stick over carrots approach. A policy ""Unless you have legitimate medical proof as to why your kid(s) cannot be vaccinated, no unvaccinated children may attend school and we don't have enough remote learning resources to go around. We don't care about religious objections. Oh, you can't work remotely and you have to stay home to watch your kids, thus lost income? Gee, what a shock, actions have consequences.""

And I'm fairly confident people are going to reply to me aghast that I don't think that their religious and/or personal freedom includes walking around being plaguebearers and keeping this accursed plague simmering, but what did I just say about them viewing admitting having made a mistake as a sign of weakness?"

It’s not a great choice either way — eventually we will all become exposed, and I would prefer my children are exposed in a controlled manner (vaccine) rather than uncontrolled (infection in kindergarten with an unknown amount of virus passing through them), so that their bodies can build a proper immune response before the inevitable exposure that I am sure we will all get. This is a virus we just have to live with now; it won’t be eradicated and hopefully it will mutate into an extremely contagious (so it will dominate other strains), but mild version. Until then, we just have these choices. Myocarditis does happen sometimes from the vaccine, but the risk of myocarditis for unvaccinated children who get covid is much, much higher and there is the long covid risk. 

I have friends living with long covid symptoms who just turned 40 and are the healthiest I know (got sick before the vaccines) and I’d like to avoid that for my kids.

My 11 year-old niece turns 12 in eight weeks. We've been counting down every tantalizing-yet-agonizing day until she can be vaccinated, hoping that approval of a pediatric product would shorten the wait. Early November is a lot more appealing than mid-December.

What a relief that after tense months of waiting, our only question will be whether she can receive an adult second dose scant days shy of her twelfth birthday, or whether she'll have two doses of the pediatric. Finally, after twenty months of Covid, a ""good"" dilemma."

Public health wise, we are better off if kids get the approved vaccines now.  However, J&J may be a better option for both adults and those with kids who are skeptical of the mRNA vaccines.

I think we were so immersed in the political argument around vaccines, no one took the concerns of skeptics respectfully.  Many of those folks might be ok with non-mRNA vaccines."

I think we are too wedded to the idea that it has to be scary and hard to do or we won’t pay money for it 

The common comment from older veterinarians when I was just starting was to always give the patient a shot even if I could just start oral meds as effectively because that would make to owner think they got real medical treatment

Indeed. 
Reminds me of when my first grade class was lined up and marched down to the principal's office to be vaccinated for polio. We could clearly see what was happening and there were plenty of tears shed in anticipation (unlike the brave, cute little girl in the photo) - fewer after the fact - it was not that bad.
But we knew what polio could do to kids and no one resisted or objected. And certainly no parent wanted to see their kid stricken with that dreadful disease; there was nothing but enthusiasm for vaccination.
Sad that vaccination has somehow become political."

Hourly workers don’t get time off. Mobile clinics can be scheduled at times when more people are off work,  and able to bring their children without losing pay. I have seen how well this approach works in the mobile clinics Austin Public Health does. They go anywhere there are people to vaccinate, and late Saturday afternoon mobile clinics have been very popular in at least one small mobile home immigrant community where I’ve volunteered. The recurring clinics combined with the community organizing that we did have really paid off- most of the eligible residents are now vaccinated. Hoping that vaccine clinics children will soon be possible."
2021-10-20 13:38,"Teaching my children from a young age that getting a vaccine is a wholly positive experience  was one of my best parenting actions. From the time they were just old enough to comprehend I talked excitedly about how lucky we were to be able to get vaccines which hurt for for less  than one second in exchange for avoiding the much longer pain of being sick later on. We celebrated with small wrapped gifts at the doctors office, a special lunch afterwords and a trip to the toy store! The pediatrician told me she passed on my “ this is a celebration “ technique to new parents in her practice.  My kids were the ones who offered their arms up enthusiastically for jabs. My kids now reminisce about how much they loved the doctor visit with shots days. My daughter is a nurse and says that when she volunteered at a mass vax site early on in the vax release it brought back the feeling of exuberance I had instilled in her years before around vaccination."

2021-10-20 13:40,"Relying on pediatricians' offices is shortsighted in areas with high population density. Opening up mass vaccination sites in these areas for just the first six weeks after the shots become available will help get our kids vaccinated so much faster, and will help ensure that parents who wish to vaccinate their kids can do so before the winter holiday season, when we're sure to see another spike. 
I think Gov Hochul and Mayor DeBlasio need to think about the unique needs of our highly populous state, and consider the welfare of NY kids and parents who are chomping at the bit to get their whole families vaccinated."
2021-10-20 13:38,"My 11 3/4 yo is fully engaged and wanting this vaccine! We are beyond thrilled this is finally coming around for his age group. The delta variant stories have brought new concerns about long Covid in children and we will be making our appointment as soon as it’s legally authorized. 

I would like to add that this age group is not just largely in elementary school. This group makes up a large part of middle schools as well, as middle schools tend to be feeder schools from elementary and many children in middle are still unvaccinated. 

This lower dose is very reassuring and personally, I would like to see an adjusted dose for 12 , not just a “jump” from 10 micrograms at 11 yo to 30 at 12 yo. The concern over myocarditis, however small, seems to be mitigated by this lower dose. A dose adjustment on this new technology of vaccine seems to be a warranted path to consider. The ethics of it are certainly justified, as vaccinations for the younger population are predominantly to prevent others from getting sick. 

At 11 years and 10 months, we will be running to squeeze this in before turning 12. This just can’t happen soon enough."

I believe in vaccinations for certain populations. But not kids. I think we have as a nation, created a culture of fear and histrionics. Kids are scared because of this depressing, incessant drone for the last two years. As a 53 year old my covid experience wasn't bad. For teens and pre-teens it's predominantly a minor ailment, similar to the flu, or even less severe. Don't make these kids get vaccinated, just for the benefit of the elderly. We've punished our youth more than enough during the past 2 years. They missed graduations, prom, in-person schooling, socializing, etc. They don't need to get vaccinated if they don't want. If you're over 60, go get vaccinated and leave the kids alone."

Its also about keeping our schools open and keeping their hockey and soccer teammates/families safe and healthy. Not to mention I know the risk of them gong to the hospital due to a sports injury is much greater than from vaccine side effects. The difference is that a sports injury isn't contagious and will not hurt someone else.

If people want some numbers, 3.74 Billion people have gotten the vaccine worldwide. In the next couple of months there will be millions of children getting the vax. Those are huge data sets. Assuming the vax is approved for 5+, there is no reason not to get it after December. At that point any significant short term risks will be identified. Anyone who is waiting for long term results should just say they never plan to get the vaccine, since 10 years from now this pandemic will be over."

Some hard data would be helpful."
2021-10-20 14:14,"We can well understand why conscientious and thoughtful parents would hesitate to vaccinate their children based on the evidence and science:

1. The majority of kids with covid are barely aware of it.
2. Those that do have flu-like symptoms, usually mild.
3. Only the tiniest fraction of a percent are hospitalized or die, virtually always with underlying medical issues.
4. Long-term covid in children, and its level of pervasiveness as well as severity, is not yet well understood, and it's also not yet clear how much the vaccine prevents it.

Based on the above simple and clear facts, is it a wonder if a well-meaning parent prefers to hold off on the shot?"

The thought of doing something to help others, sadly is no longer a consideration for too many Americans.  WE have forgotten that with liberty and freedom comes responsibilities to ensure its continuance. And this is why we are failing as a nation.

Somehow we have failed to get the message out that Covid is a killer, but is it killing children at the same rate as adults ? Are children ages 5 to 11 getting Covid ? If they are getting covid are they dying in droves or getting hospitalised ? Are they spreading Covid ?  Are they going to be required to wear masks after getting vaccinated ? I doubt we had hesitancy or outright resistance to the polio vaccine. Unless the vaccine is made mandatory, we are going to fail."
2021-10-20 14:43,"As a parent of now an adult, I made sure she got all her vaccinations as I did not want her to suffer or worse due to my negligence. Since my daughter is an adult now, 24, and is going to medical school, I was hesitant for her to get the vaccine at first. She got it as soon as it became available for health care workers. It wasn't up to me to decide, but I dreaded that no enough was known about the vaccine. Now I am glad that she got it. She is protected, and she is also helping protect others. So I understand what parents of young children might be going through. But I guess waiting might not be a good idea if a child becomes seriously and dies or has long term health problems. It is a tough choice. I would probably err on the side of getting my child protected."

By the way, it’s pretty hard to tranmit covid by touching stuff. But if you’re gonna try, sneezing into your hands and then grabbing stuff in a busy store is an excellent approach."
2021-10-20 15:23,"When we had our first child nearly 11years ago and went to the pediatrician, their first question was to assess our stance on vaccination.

Of course we were all for it.  The doctor was relieved, because they would have refused us as a continuing patient.

Having a parent who contracted polio mere months before the vaccine and his resulting physical challenges, and a great aunt who had polio as a toddler and never walked, does provide a visceral context.

Our children understand how a vaccine can reduce spread and mitigate symptoms if they do get it.  It isn’t a hard concept to grasp.  We anxiously await emergency approval and hope we can avoid an (unvaccinated) infection just a little while longer."
2021-10-20 11:56,"Using pharmacies, clinics and family doctors, P.A.s, N.P.s seems no brainer. Yesterday I saw again that this nation has only 59% fully vaccinated. Today is exactly 9 months since Biden became President. When I pointed this out to a friend his reply was "" What could Biden do about that?"" Mandates, while controversial, are effective. He could have given a prime time address, at least once, and pre-empted regular programing at 9pm, he could have begun mandating vaccines for federal workers and those who do business with federal government much sooner T he FAA is federal. He could mandate vaccination in order to fly. The nation is still in the grips of this pandemic and winter is coming. Trump failed us; Biden is failing with a calamitous pandemic."
2021-10-20 15:58,"I'll vaccinate my eleven year old as soon as this is approved. My family chooses not to live in selfish, cowardly fear."
2021-10-20 15:54,Adult trials had 44k people and didn't uncover heart inflammation problems or blood clots. Child trials has 2k kids. What could go wrong?
2021-10-20 15:21,"I will vaccinate my kid asap but I will not do it out of some immediate concern for his health. I will be vaccinating him out of a desperate need for normality, for not having to live with restrictions. I would like masks mandates to be removed asap."
2021-10-20 15:32,"I also wish it would be emphasized that this is an easy inoculation- and I’ve had a lot of other vaccines. Take the word “jab” out of the marketing, there are still some people hesitating because of fear of needles. It’s a very light needle, and on my second Moderna I looked back, wasn’t sure it had happened but they were already putting the bandaid on."
2021-10-20 15:49,Out with the vaccine already! It's been almost a year. No point spending time on useless things like community outreach. Let people who want it get it. Or get people who draw government benefits affirm that they have read a pamphlet before getting benefits.
2021-10-20 16:05,"My 7-year-old is so excited to get it, because we've talked to her throughout the pandemic about how vaccines protect ourselves and others. Getting vaccinated will also mean more maskless playdates! I wish kids could get their shots at school, but I understand that her school nurse is already beyond busy this year."
2021-10-20 16:17,"I told this great news to my 10 yr old at breakfast and he's so excited for some normalcy again! We'll be making plans to apply for in person school asap once we get his first vaccine appointment made. There's a light at the end of this dark, depressive tunnel for our little boy soon. We're so thankful for all the medical professionals and scientists who made this vaccine possible."
2021-10-20 16:18,"Our ten-year-old son is eager to get vaccinated like the rest of the family.  We'll be able to have playdates without leaving his friend's house once the other kids head inside maskless when they get tired of outdoor play.

Plus, we're banking on getting our youngest vaccinated so we can finally fly up to visit my father, who's over 80, who is fully vaccinated (and boostered), and whom we haven't visited since February 2020.  (I really miss my Dad!)

Honestly, this is the last piece of the puzzle for our family to resume a more normal life.  

We'll still mask when we're indoors in public places, but getting the last member of our family vaccinated will be a gamechanger, for real."
2021-10-20 16:26,"I really hope that kids being vaccinated will minimize how often kids are having to stay home from school due to covid and illnesses in general. Right now my daughter is on day 3 home from school with a minor cold (negative for covid after 2 home tests) because we are still waiting for her PCR test to come back. The schools here don't accept rapid/antigen tests at this time. Anytime a kid has even a minor sniffle we have ended up having to miss up to 4 school days. This means I've been unable to return to work because I need to be available to stay home with one or both kids. Fun times! 

My oldest will soon be eligible for the vaccine and she is VERY excited about it. It makes me laugh because normally she hates shots or blood draws with a passion. This one she is looking forward to. 

The younger sibling is still under age 5 so he'll have to wait."
2021-10-20 16:26,"Only thing is: I wish that they would not discount mass vaccination sites.  Our 10 year old went with his older siblings when I took them to get vaccinated, even waiting two hours on the day of their first shot, and he'd be expecting the same process for himself. 

And I can't imagine that it will be easy for pediatricians' offices to add availability for many more visits just for this one vaccine.  

A mass vaccination site with a two-hour wait sounds preferable to me (with a 10 year old) than having to wait weeks for an appointment just to have a shorter line on the day of the shot."
2021-10-20 16:13,Welcome news! We can’t wait!
2021-10-20 16:30,"Supergirl, with the skinned knee and the star necklace, is my new hero!"
2021-10-20 16:45,"Setting up mass vaccinations sites  for children would make vaccines available far more quickly  to children than what is planned.

Children wouldn't have to stand on long lines. I didn't have to stand on any line.  Someone met me at the door and checked my I.D.  The next person led me to the nurse who vaccinated me.
Someone led me to the waiting area where people who have been vaccinated sit for 15 minutes.

There were EMTS and Paramedics at the New York State  Vaccination Center  who were equipped to deal with  adverse reactions.

I felt lightheaded within minutes and waved over a paramedic.
An EMT and paramedic came over immediately,  and checked my blood pressure and so forth.

A sweet young EMT stayed with me for hours, then walked outside with me as I had thought that fresh air might help. The EMT was prepared to stay with me longer, but I decided. that I wanted to leave.

Pharmacies and doctors don't have EMTs and paramedics onsite.

Many children don't have pediatricians, just as I have no  doctors.

The vaccinations will be delayed as parents scramble to get appointments with pediatricians. 

Pharmacy techs are not nurses, physicians or physician's assistants.

This isn't being done to benefit CHILDREN. It's easier & cheaper  for Biden.

Why expend the money on CHILDREN, when some CVS, Walgreens ,Supermarket or Walmart tech can inject a five year old ?!

Is there anyone who would CHOOSE to be vaccinated by  pharmacy tech over being vaccinated by a doctor or nurse ?
f"
2021-10-20 16:50,Great news! Hopefully the under 5 yo population will be eligible next.
2021-10-20 16:46,Every parent should be jumping at the chance to protect their child with this vaccine.  For hubris to keep the child unvaccinated would be tragic when you have to talk to them through a window on their last days. Get vaccinated and get your kids vaccinated; wear a mask in public; and shelter as much as you can until this is over.
2021-10-20 17:09,"I’m fine with vaccinating kids. I’m fine with not vaccinating kids and letting them acquire immunity through exposure, given the minuscule risk to children. What I’m not at all fine with are the ludicrous limitations that we are putting on kids and society in general in children’s name given the extremely small risk to children from covid. If parents don’t want their kids vaccinated, fine, but stop with all of the masking, social distancing, classroom closures, cancelled after school programs, etc. 

And I say this as the parent of a 5 year old and 2 year old in NYC."
2021-10-20 17:16,Will a doctor's visit for the children's covid vaccine be free? I know the vaccine is free of charge. But a visit to pediatrician other than the annual check up is quite expensive in my experience.
2021-10-20 17:33,"Glensakes reports on the death toll in children who contract COVID-19.  The death toll is very important but what seems to be missing in the conversations is the incidence of Morbidity.

Morbidity is the hopefully uncommon effects of Covid-19.  These include heart and lung problems of a long term nature, depression, loss of the sense of taste and smell, loss of hearing  (probably permanent) in one or both ears and long term joint pain.  I cannot find much information on the web about the prevalence of morbidities in children but this should be considered.
I lost the hearing in my right ear to the mumps and gained loud tinnitus which I was able to block out as a child but it came back in my 40s and remains a problem now.  These have been disabilities for me and the hearing make carrying on a conversation with even modest amounts of ambient noise almost impossible."
2021-10-20 15:16,"I am so ready to have our kids vaccinated. In the immortal words of Kursty the Clown, "" Let's get this ooooover with!""."
2021-10-20 17:29,"This should be done (also) through schools, just like other mass vaccinations of children have been done."
2021-10-20 18:43,"My wife and myself are vaccinated and have had the booster shots, my daughter is also vaccinated but her 6 year son is not, we have been holding our collective breaths for quite a while.

For those that are the naysayers the cases of pediatric Covid have increased many fold with the Delta variant, that includes a proportional increase in hospitalizations and deaths, yes they are still statistically small but i have never learned a way to tell a parent that the loss of their child does not matter. Plus there might be a potential for side effects but we are first learning about the secondary conditions that stem from mild cases of Covid may they be neurological,  cardiovascular or pulmonary. Yes we have every intention of reviewing the available data and then getting our grandson a vaccination with all speed."
2021-10-20 18:44,"Please just set up mass vaccination clinics!  

The primary care clinic my children go to has thousands of children as patients.  How can they possibly accomodate this many children who need vaccines in a timely manner?  Do you honestly think I care if we have to stand in line for a while to get a vaccine?? We're going on 2 YEARS of my kids not being allowed to anywhere indoors, 2 years of not going to school, 2 years of not participating in any of their afterschool activities, 2 years of not having friends over for playdates unless we're outdoors the entire time.

Roll out the vaccines using mass vaccination clinics until the numbers wanting vaccination start to dwindle, as they did with adults, to the point that people can get them through their primary care provider."
2021-10-20 18:49,"It's not unlikely that there will be some long term consequences for at least some children who catch the virus.  Since it's not impossible that there could be an issue with the vaccine that isn't detected by the trial, it might make sense to wait a couple of months unless you have someone immunocompromised in the family.  Knowing how the vaccine works, I think you can safely rule out any long term consequence from the vaccine that wouldn't also occur from catching the virus and the virus is vastly larger and more dangerous than the vaccine in terms of potential long term consequences."
2021-10-20 18:03,"Whatever happened to children getting their vaccinations at school?  We'd line up and get them.  Nobody cried because they didn't want to be laughed at.

Even without a mandate, it's the easiest and fastest way as well as putting peer pressure on the kids to get their vaccination.  Biden's people overthink everything and all it leads to is confusion."
2021-10-20 17:45,"I know the consensus in the press is that it is inevitable that a COVID vaccine will get EUA for everyone.

This sounds great to me and I'm gonna get my kids vaccinated as soon as there's an EUA. But it seems unduly optimistic.

Parents need to be prepared for the possibility that VRBPAC/ACIP/FDA will review the data and find that the tiny risks of vaccination outweigh the small known risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection in kids, either in the 6mo-5yo age range (data pending) or the 5yo-12 age range (consensus is this will be okay).

It's great to think there will be a vaccine for my 2 year old soon, maybe even this year. But what if the risks in their age range are so small that ACIP can't recommend it for them?

Then I'll probably need to plan for my kid to spend 1-2 weeks out of school once or twice a year each time they are infected. And I'll need to expect major limits on international and domestic travel; with no valid proof of vaccination my kid might not be visiting their grandparents for a few more years.

And I may need to think about asking my doctor to prescribe a vaccine for my young kid. If ACIP ultimately finds the vaccine is very slightly riskier than doing nothing in young people, I will need to consider whether the external benefits (reducing the risk that they infect and hurt their older, at-risk caregivers) outweigh the risks to their health."
2021-10-20 18:54,"We should vaccinate kids in schools, where they are all day anyway. A team could go to a different school each day and get through a county in a few weeks. Too many Americans don't have a primary care doctor and many parents can't take off work to take their kids to get vaccinated. In rural areas, the drive to a pharmacy could be long. It just makes sense to set up clinics in the schools."
2021-10-20 18:57,"It feels like this is being overthought. It's hard to imagine getting this rolled out in a timely manner if it's going to require parents to make appointments with their pediatricians or pharmacy. That's going to create a very long bottle neck.

The mass vaccinations worked for adults. It will work for children. Allow a parent to accompany. Get some folks in mascot costumes. Hand out some balloons and candy. The kids will be fine."
2021-10-20 18:56,"I hope that once these vaccines are approved for kids, they will become mandatory for school attendance, as is the case for other vaccines. Denier states should be penalized by withholding of federal funds. As for Covid becoming endemic, this is wishful thinking, as demonstrated by the Delta variant. The longer we remain behind this virus in terms of vaccination, the greater the chance of replaying severe surges as new variants appear and spread. The next variant might not be so benign to children as previous ones."
2021-10-20 18:51,My 4-year-old non-binary child said that the only thing they want for their birthday next month is to get the vaccine.  I can't wait to go with them to get the jab!
2021-10-20 17:40,"I think one of the best ways to ensure kids will get fully vaccinated is to put it all in one vial. I'm no scientist (so please no snarky replies) but from a policy standpoint, seems that trying to make one shot would help parents and kids. Is this possible? Can they fit all the medicine in one turn? Have they tested doing one dose of Pfizer or Moderna?"
2021-10-20 17:50,Ugh. Could we PLEASE have mass innoculation sites? I can't even imagine the deluge of calls that my pediatrician's office is going to receive in coming weeks and it is hard enough to get an appointment there when you're sick...
2021-10-20 19:11,We pediatricians are ready to deliver the COVID vaccine to our patients ages 5-11 once authorized!
2021-10-20 19:16,"@DJS, and to anyone wrongly thinking that “pharmacy techs” are administering injections, they are not. Those giving vaccinations at pharmacies are pharmacists, RNs, NPs, or PAs. Although my personal preference is for a RN or NP to do the honors (nurses are extensively educated on proper injection technique), any of these licensed (key word being ‘licensed’) providers have this competency."
2021-10-20 18:51,"I welcome this. I don’t have kids but several of my friends and cousins do, and all of those children are under 12. The families have been in limbo/disaster/crises mode, coupled with a never-ending cycle of home school, hybrid school, and quarantining, for the past 19 months. Particularly for parents like my friend in Texas, who masked up her entire family while everyone else around them flew free as an unconcerned bird, and it was, and has been, a constant nightmare. They need the vaccine.

I work in education, so I know firsthand how hard the past year and a half has been for children and their families. I would never wish what I felt in the last year on anyone: the fear and the despair were constant and ever-present. The relief I felt at finally being vaccinated was so great that I cried after the nurse administered my second dose of Pfizer. (“It’s okay, honey,” she said as I collected myself.) I want the students in my school and their families to feel the same way. I want them to feel safe and protected. I want them to feel happy again, because for me that’s what it took. Vaccination helped some of the sadness and the deep fear dissipate. So many children and families are still awaiting the go-ahead for vaccination, and I’m thrilled for them that the green light is almost here. Help is on the way!"
2021-10-20 19:36,"Our family has been very careful throughout the pandemic to wear masks, social distance and we support our Scientific and Medical professionals. The adults in our big Cuban family are all vaccinated. Our children and grandchildren are next! 

Grateful for the Medical and Scientific professionals working diligently to save lives!"
2021-10-20 19:22,The school should be the primary site to consider for vaccinating the children. The elementary school in our neighborhood is already set up to test every student and employee every week for the virus. Changing the process to vaccinate the children should be an easy switch.
2021-10-20 19:48,"Both my boys are vaccinated. One is 19, the other is 13. I scheduled appointments as soon as I could. I was elated and relieved after the second appointment in July. I monitored for symptoms right after and for two weeks. Other than a sore arm that both had for a couple of days, and a slight headache that my 13-year-complained about the next day (some ibuprofen worked wonders), there were no other side effects. I can see why so many parents with younger children are waiting anxiously for FDA approval. It is a big deal."
2021-10-20 19:38,Why can't we use schools as vaccination sites?
2021-10-20 19:50,"Why are people suddenly against vaccinating their children when they've always done it before? Politics. They're simply choosing politics over everything even their own family. Do you remember when evangelicals fought so hard to keep the doctors they now don't trust when Obama tried to pass Obamacare? Have you noticed a pattern with the evangelical right? They are against anything the Democrats do even if it goes against common sense to follow them. That means doubting the government, doubting their own doctors, doubting their own relatives, doubting everything. Sowing doubt is working for those that benefit from the loss of people's lives and livelihoods. Who are the puppeteers? May the light shine brightly on them."
2021-10-20 19:41,"You can give younger children shots successfully at mass sites, if you set it up intelligently.  The key is to keep the children who are waiting from hearing crying from the children getting the shots.  There are also distraction techniques that have been proven to be successful.  Most adults just don't make the effort to make things less unpleasant and scary for the children."
2021-10-20 20:04,"I’d like the option to bring my perfectly heathy children to a drive-through vaccine clinic/site rather than have to bring them inside a doctor’s office or pharmacy, where people with who-knows-what contagious conditions often are.  Why expose kids to that (including pathogens that may be transmitted by means face masks don’t prevent) just to get a vaccine meant to keep them healthy?"
2021-10-20 11:56,"This paper has reported countless times that COVID prevents a minimal, if not negligible, threat to young children, with unvacinated children being less at risk than vaccinated adults. There is absolutely no reason to vaccinate such you children with rmna technology that has never been used for vaccines before and for which there is no long term data. It is not about ""protecting our children"" - their immune systems are there to protect them (as the science has cleaely shown us). And I write this as a liberal mother of two young children."
2021-10-20 17:53,"I am hoping there will be no mandates for children to get vaccinated. 

In the end it’s mostly older unvaccinated people dying, why should children pay the price for those by having vaccine mandates? 

In the end this will be an endemic virus, which has not arrived in the mind of most people. We will all get infected with Covid-19 every few seasons again and again. That will be unavoidable, and we should accept that as reality. 

I can’t wait to get natural immunity. 

I am triple vaccinated, but my child will not be the first in line. I want to see how safe those RNA vaccines are. 

I hope the dose for younger children will be weaker than for adults. 

I also hope that a traditional (non RNA) vaccination will become available soon."
2021-10-20 11:44,"It's been easy for the left-leaning media to suppress and minimize the sometimes-life-threatening side effects (myocarditis, blood clots) of the vaccines for adults, but God forbid children start having life-altering or -ending consequences, many otherwise pro-vaccine, vaccinated parents (like me) will rightfully be enraged. Forcing parents/children to get this vaccine is a huge gamble that, if it goes poorly, will have far more substantial consequences for Democrats nationwide than any pundits can possibly foresee. People are willing to take risks for themselves, but far less so for their children; coercing people into potentially harming their children in the name of ""public good"" or ""science"" will backfire spectacularly and explosively. I'm sure most of the left-leaning commenters will dismissively (or vehemently) disagree, but I guarantee that those people are catastrophically and dangerously underestimating the innate biological drive of parents to protect their children."
2021-10-20 12:06,Everyone is worried about the long term effects of the vaccine. What about the long term effects of COVID? Do you know that COVID infection also causes myocarditis in rare cases? The vaccine was developed “too quickly” but nobody stops to consider that it was developed quickly because the virus is new and a threat. People are really bad at cost-benefit analysis.
2021-10-20 12:25,"My kids are a little older and have been vaccinated.  I think we have seen more than enough mRNA experience to be confident it is safe.

I would absolutely be more hesitant if the first vaccine were based on adenovirus technology.  That vector needs access to the nucleus to build the mRNAs that will then build the proteins that will prime the immune system.

Plus, an adenovirus used as a vector could present itself, theoretically at least, to the immune system in such a way that future boosts could trigger a response.

mRNA is different.  Our own mRNA that serves as a blueprint  for our own proteins disappears very quickly and only DNA transcription can make more.  Here, Pfizer and Moderna mRNA is introduced from the outside and there is no way to overexpress the spike protein target because this mRNA, like its naturally occurring versions, is destroyed quickly by the cell.  It is not replenished.

As long as the target protein is properly coded for by the laboratory built mRNA, this vaccine is only doing what nature would do in a COVID infection - presenting a spike to the immune system.  

Now, the initial load may be far higher and there could be other side effects, but they are short lived - this technology, if implemented competently, just cannot create weird long term problems.

It is time to trust that this was done well and get vaccinated, including younger kids.  COVID does not have to remain the emergency problem it has been.  We have a path forward."
2021-10-20 15:08,"What's going on? In a word, Delta. 

From the American Academy of Pediatrics 9/3/21:
""Children ages 0-4 years have had the highest pediatric hospitalization rates since the start of the pandemic, and their weekly rate of 1.9 per 100,000 children in mid-August was nearly 10 times that of late June.

Researchers looked for signs if delta is causing more severe disease. Both studies found statistically similar levels of severity before and after delta was dominant. For instance, about 23% of those hospitalized were admitted to the intensive care unit in the delta period compared to 27% pre-delta. Likewise, 10% required invasive mechanical ventilation and 2% died in the delta period compared to 6% and 1%, respectively, before delta. ""

So kids who brushed off the early virus, are now getting hospitalized with Delta. Yes, ""only"" 10% of those hospitalized could no longer breath on their own and 2% died. But remember, when the absolute numbers of hospitalized children increase, then 10% and 2% get multiplied by larger numbers, meaning in absolute numbers, more children are dying from Delta than they did with the original virus. 

If you had a kid, would you just cite numbers and let your kid take his/her chances with statistics? I would not. There is no data that the covid vaccines cause children to stop breathing and die."
2021-10-20 16:22,"There are some 70+ million children in the US. 
So far, about 525 have died from the virus. 
Around 350 children from the age of 1 to 4 die of swimming pool deaths each year. 
In 2019, 609 children age 12 and younger died from car crashes, the numbers are similar for the following years.
In 2019, nine children and teens were killed with guns each day in America—one every 2 hours and 36 minutes 

Obviously, in the grand scheme of things, covid-19  represents a very small, negligible risk for healthy children. What I find extremely annoying is the semi-religious fervor with which parents argue both sides of the issue, without considering the fact that too many children die needlessly from other causes, in far greater numbers."
2021-10-20 21:55,"""The Pfizer shot for children is expected to contain 10 micrograms, a third of the adult dose."" 

So a 45 lb. child who just turned five, get the same dose as a 100 lb. child about to turn 12? And you wonder why parents are worried."
2021-10-20 21:06,"All unvaccinated adults should step up the plate and get vaccinated first, and then kids."
2021-10-20 21:40,Why why why no mass inoculation sites? Parents who want their kids vaccinated DO NOT want to wait days or weeks for an appointment with the pediatrician. We have waited long enough. This strategy sounds horrible.
2021-10-20 21:56,"We have a 3 year old and an 18 month
old. My youngest is too young to wear a mask and has never been in a restaurant or store. My three year old used to go to the diner with us for Sunday morning brunch.  As a result of COVID the diner has gone out of business and
she has zero memory of it. 

We hope that they get shots soon after the 5 year olds so they can start living life freely. They really deserve it."
2021-10-20 22:16,"I thought most doctors could not store the vaccine properly?  If they can for children, why not adults?  It might push many of the skeptics in the right direction"
2021-10-20 23:05,"While I have not been a proponent of federal vaccine mandates as per the White House's request, I do believe that people should have a choice in getting the vaccine or not, and I think that paving out logistical issues to distributing the vaccine for children BEFORE it is even approved is a rational thing to do. However, I am slightly taken aback at the idea of the dosage being 1/3rd the potency of the adult vaccine. Sure, I understand that younger and smaller individuals may not need as much of a dose, however there are many young children who are under the age of 12 who might need the normal dose due to weight size. I propose that vaccine manufacturers find a healthy way to gauge what the cutoff point for the adult or child vaccine is, not just based on age but a weight gauge as well."
2021-10-20 23:08,"There are 2 arguments in favor of vaccinating children.  

The first is for their own safety.  It is well known, and anyone that is honest will acknowledge, the risk of serious illness or ""long covid"" is minuscule.  Children live with larger health and accident risks everyday without this overwrought fear.  The vaccine is not needed to protect children.

The second argument is to protect others at risk - even the vaccinated.  Building herd immunity.  This is using children, exposing THEM to the risk of vaccines that are unnecessary for THEM - to protect older or less healthy adults, vaccinated or not.  These children have their whole life ahead of them.  As we get older we will all succumb to something.  I don't yet have grandchildren, but I imagine most grandparents would willingly accept modestly higher risk on their own part if there is even the remotest chance of bad outcomes for their grandchildren.  (husband writing)"
2021-10-20 23:27,"Hmm, great news for kids with pre existing conditions and Immuno compromised who are the most impacted. Surprisingly, don't see any data if the vaccines were tested on such kids with conditions leading to hospitalization and death. Without these numbers, it feels like all healthy kids have to be forced because of some, Where are these numbers? 

It has been a year since schools opened, what was its impact, not much at all with or without masks. Given 80% of adults are vaccinated and we don't know long term effects, giving an option is one vs mandating is forcing given the vaccine companies have zero liability. Did they test on kids with immunity/neurological issues who are most vulnerable and not protected, no idea?

CDC itself is confusing, they say virus was not airborne, then no need for mask, 1, then 2 then booster vaccine, kids VAERS reactions are okay, now they ""mandate"" young kids soon? Do we have proof of D Dimer test or blood clots as young kids are just forming their heart, brain and uterus? Long term unknown effects vs some known risks for young kids.

As they are very asymptomatic, why not check for antibodies first and support natural immunity like other diseases before vaccinating to reduce risk? With 100 million already Covid positive, we can also save the pandemic heroes like doctors, front line workers, teachers instead of firing them. Same for kdis, we could avoid risk?"
2021-10-20 22:46,"I like all the comments about how mRNA vaccines vs conventional vaccines. So do you prefer live attenuated or inactivated? What about the risk of reversion to wild type? Just asking. 
I can’t wait for my 5 year old to be vaccinated. No more remote learning! A possibility of getting rid of masks!
People can choose not to get vaccinated but if someone in the class gets sick, then all the unvaccinated kids go home. Your job requires vaccination? Well no employer is required to employ you. Guess what, if you work in healthcare you need to be vaccinated for a lot of things. You are required to wear masks, wash your hands, and sometimes wear hats and booties as well as gowns.

3. Efficacy trial against serious disease cannot be done but because serious disease is very rare in kids
4. The vaccine does not protect well against infection or spread. Therefore there will be never herd immunity through vaccines.

They've had their conclusion, without regard to personal or public health, for a long time. They've not been listening, except for this rationalization and that, some old, some new, all along. Proceeding with boosters presents no policy dilemma. For it to be one, one must assume the yet unpersuaded are yet persuadable in significant numbers. Which is a laugh. Certainly, one-to-one persuasion must go on for those few it can reach, but elevating their current most prevalent rationalization of a foregone conclusion to a policy consideration only does a disservice to the vaccinated ready for boosters.

We used to call such people ""working class"", but that is both politically correct and out-of-date. Many lower-level professional jobs today are so regimented and powerless that they feel just like working on an assembly line in a factory.

When any of those pretexts is refuted so categorically that even they can't deny it, they just move on to the next excuse.  If booster shots are necessary to protect those already vaccinated, we should not refrain from giving them in the vain hope of somehow persuading the holdouts.  What will persuade them are vaccine mandates and other measures designed to maximize the penalties for not being vaccinated.  And those penalties should be much stiffer than they are even now.

These people, who refuse to publicly identify as refusers, are just looking around for some other reason to justify their refusal. As each one of their professed reasons gets shot down by science and public opinion, they have to cast around to find a new one. And the media keeps speculating on why they won't get vaxed, which ultimately provides them with a new reason. The fact that we need booster shots proves that the vaccine doesn't really work? C'mon man! Get serious! Does the fact that we need a flu shot every year prove that the flu vaccine doesn't work?

It's not logical, there's no scientific support for it, and there's not even a conspiracy tale to go along with it.

I would point out that the reason so many elderly and otherwise vulnerable people are still around six months later to get a booster is that vaccines work. The Covid-19 vaccine is not magic. It works like other vaccines. People should check the CDC recommended vaccination schedule for kids if they want to see a series of boosters needed within a year to provide protection. And those people should then try to come with anyone they know who has contracted those childhood diseases after getting the recommended series of boosters. The evidence that vaccines work and that boosters are normal is available all around us, in people who received vaccinations and never contracted a whole basket full of childhood diseases that used to torment children and worry their mothers."

2021-10-11 21:21,"“The main question is how long the immunologic protection against SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, lasts,” says Albert Shaw, MD, PhD, a Yale Medicine infectious disease specialist. “And since we are learning about COVID-19 in real time, this is hard to know”  (Yale Mediine 10/6/21).

With a fair amount of science (MD, MPH) and reading the scientific literature, I see the push for boosters as political, and degrading of the science behind vaccination. The rationale for boosters is waning immunity, but where are the data on decreasing antibody levels? And we don't measure the equally, if not even more important cellular immunity, because these are complex tests done only in research labs. 

It is said more breakthrough infections are reported, but the CDC stopped collecting data on breakthrough infections so how do we know? Remember, the Covid 19 vaccines never claimed to stop infections; they work because they decrease hospitalizations and deaths. So where are the data on increasing hospitalizations and deaths among the fully vaccinated?

How can you expect the public to trust science when science doesn't have the integrity to tell the politicians to first get a science education before practicing medicine without a license?"
2021-10-11 21:26,"Sigh. If anyone reading this comment can provide a link to any published research showing efficacy rates for Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J against infection; illness; and hospitalization; shortly after the vaccine and then again 4-6 months later, I will appreciate it. 
I did read one article a while ago, when CDC was deliberating which Pfizer-vaccinated people should get booster, which included a little hard data, something along the lines that showed Pfizer vaccines significantly losing effectiveness after 4 months (something like 93% down to 77%), but Moderna showing only slight reduction (something like 96% down to 94%). The question the data raised in my mind was why the CDC was not deliberating whether to recommend reliance on the Moderna vaccination instead of deliberating advocating for more Pfizer shots. I am also now wondering, as a Moderna-vaccinated person, whether I will bother with a booster even if one is approved for me. I have seen no evidence yet that would convince me that the risk of a  booster is less than the risk of illness/hospitalization, considering I was fully vaccinated with Moderna. 
I didn't start as a skeptic, but the tone/content of CDC publicity regarding vaccination (paternalistic, prescriptive, over-simplified, short on hard data) and the nature of Covid-vaccine media coverage (more like public-policy advocacy than fact-laden journalism) is making me one."

Any adult who has refused vaccination has made a choice. As an adult. 

What else, besides targeted mandates, can be done.  When the vaccines rolled out, we knew that by late summertime, a certain percentage of the population would be actively refusing vaccination. 

The scary thing is that this population, urban and rural, is expanding their resistance to reject all vaccines. There’s more general anti vaccination people now. This does not bode well for other very important vaccinations."

Yet they believe their ignorance equals expertise. And it seems around 25% or more of the country will never change. Amazing how hard-headed ignorance and selfishness can be.

Those that willfully put others at risk of serious illness or death should be banned from jobs, businesses, restaurants and crowds of any sort. Yes, they can refuse the vaccine but they also give up their right to put anyone else at risk.

The vaccines were designed before Delta was the dominant variant. Vaccine makers knew waning efficacy might be an issue they just didn’t know if it would happen, how long it would take, and how steep the drop the would be. 

Now we know about Delta, we have longer studies of efficacy, hence the research into and recommendation of boosters. It’s a simple process. Act on the best information you have, correct course as you learn more.

Even now, the New York Times is claiming that the vaccines aren't very much different. And yet, they ARE. 

From the NYT today: 
""Which vaccine is best?
–
All three vaccines used in the United States — made by Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — remain highly effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death from Covid-19. But some recent studies have shown small differences in efficacy. The findings don’t translate to a meaningful difference in protection in the real world, because all of the vaccines work well. But the research could influence decisions about the timing of booster shots.""

""small differences in efficacy""? 
For goodness sake. In March, it was clear that the J&J vaccine was much less ""efficaciious"" than the two mRNA vaccines. And since then, articles here on the NYT state that people who got the J&J vaccine are at higher risk of serious illness and hospitalization.

A small difference in efficacy? Sure, if you don't know how numbers work."

What the unvaccinated should not be able to do is spread Covid in society- at public events, transportation and workplaces etc. Or spread the *costs* of having preventable severe Covid- so they should pay more in health insurance and have lower priority in accessing care at crowded hospitals.

2021-10-11 21:40,"At the very minimum we should be doing is donating the vaccines we aren't going to use to third world countries who want them.  If we let them expire and toss them away, that should be considered a crime against humanity.  This is not a political statement, it's just common sense.

This would be the equivalent of hoarding all the water (just in case) if the state next to you had a natural disaster affecting their water supply, then finding out you don't need it and then pouring it down the drain."
2021-10-11 21:40,Science is pragmatic and empiric. It is evidence based. Not a dogma like religion. Booster shot is evidence based data.
2021-10-11 21:41,Some states force pregnant women to view a sonogram of their embryo before electing an abortion. How about a law requiring vaccine refuseniks to view videos of unvaccinated people on ventilators breathing their last? Clearly more gentle and reason-based approaches have failed.
2021-10-11 21:41,"It's self contradictory to say boosters complicate coaxing hard-core refusers. Hard core people either change their own minds or they don't. They'll either be coerced by a mandate or they won't. There's very little coaxing. All I'd bother saying to a hard core person at this point, is that it's possible to get vaccinated for their own reasons, privately. They don't have to shoot a selfie, and clinic staff won't trawl their social media for anti-vaccine memes or comments."
2021-10-11 21:41,Implement mandates and sue Facebook if they refuse to remove vaccine misinformation.
2021-10-11 21:42,"I voted for Trump and I am fully vaccinated.  Part of the problem is that calling this a vaccination forces me to change my definition of a vaccine.  To the best of my knowledge, all of the vaccinations that I have received, with the possible exception of a flu shot, have been inactivated virus vaccines.  Nobody ever caught the disease after getting the vaccinations that I know.

The other issue driving the confusion is the fact that the US is 4.5% of the world's populations yet has a quarter of the world's cases and deaths from the disease.  The Delta variant and anti-vaxer explanations don't explain why vaccination rates in countries are inversely proportional to the cases and deaths.  Africa, Latin America and everybody else is doing better than we are based on the numbers.

Another issue is the high level resignations from the CDC, FDA and recently the NIH over arguments between scientists and the Biden administration over the national response to the virus outbreak.  The Democrats and the liberal media promoted hoaxes about how Trump wasn't taking the advice of scientists and how Biden would change that.  He did the opposite.  They are resigning because he won't take their advice.

The problem is that people don't trust the Democrats and the liberal media after being repeatedly burned by hoaxes, propaganda, conspiracy theories and fake news.  They have destroyed their credibility with part of our population."
2021-10-11 21:43,"If you are looking for an excuse not to do something, like getting vaccinated, then any reasons are in play. Whether horse medicine cures covid19 or Microsoft wants to plant chips in you, or there is not enough research about the long-term effects of the vaccine, or you know someone who knows someone who died from covid19 who took the vaccine, or why do we need a booster shot if the first vaccinations were supposed to be adequate, it does not make a difference. There is no end to the excuses you can manufacture if you don't want to do something."
2021-10-11 21:43,"Forget about convincing the hard core refusers. They will need to be tested regularly to participate in many activities. The rest of us need to get on with our lives. If 700,000 American deaths doesn't convince them Covid is real, I'm not sure anything will."
2021-10-11 21:44,Many eligible people who are still not vaccinated will die from COVID.  There is nothing we can do except get coffins ready.
2021-10-11 21:46,"If the issue of COVID boosters is confusing or any way unsettling, this tells me that the unvaccinated have only empty space in their brains. Stop wasting time and money trying to convince those who cannot or will not be convinced to even get the first vaccines."

2021-10-11 21:47,"I'm so sick of these gullible consumers of anti-vax disinformation. I'm about to be 78, and I've tried to remember if there was a time when I was that stupid and couldn't step back and be objective about what I saw and read. And, there was NEVER a time when I was that dumb. My mother, who just turned 100, volunteered for the March of Dimes to raise money to develop the Polio vaccine. That was the early 50's. Well, Jonas Salk developed the Polio vaccine. He didn't even patent it, because he didn't do it for profit. There was no such thing as ""anti-vaxxers"" then. We were thrilled to get our shot AND BOOSTERS. I live in the Spotsylvania County, VA Battlefield District. I went to vote. There was a young man running for County Supervisor. He told me he was a firefighter. I asked him if he was vaccinated for Covid. I ask everyone if they're vaccinated. He hemmed and hawed and said he wasn't! A first responder who WASN'T vaccinated! Needless to say, I didn't vote for him. I did tell him to get vaccinated, though. The thought of him giving someone mouth-to-mouth....."
2021-10-11 21:50,"I wonder if hard core refusers would have been hard core seatbelt refusers or hard core smokers in days gone by. Whenever I get exasperated I remember those folks back then. Vaccines aren't perfect from the individual standpoint, but if they get the reproduction number down below 1 they will benefit everybody in the end. Of course, masks would have done that all along but some people just can't be persuaded."
2021-10-11 21:51,"I'm surprised that people are still expressing so much skepticism about the Covid vaccines. My wife had a routine appointment with our family practice and that's when we learned that the family nurse practitioner we've been seeing no longer worked at the facility. She was let go for refusing to get vaccinated against Covid.
 What gets me is that she was gung-ho for us to get our flu shots, the pneumonia vaccine, shingles vaccine and up to date on our tetanus boosters. It makes no sense."
2021-10-11 21:51,"Math impaired.  How you could still question the value of the vaccine after we've seen so many deaths of unvaccinated people compared with those of vaccinated people I don't understand.  Lacking 4th grade math skills?  Tribalism?  Still clinging to the adolescent belief that ""it won't happen to me?"" Do they really think the government is trying to kill the very population that pays taxes and volunteers for war duty?

I am deeply saddened by each Covid death, but my patience and empathy is wearing thin."
2021-10-11 21:52,"I have some training in research, but I don’t have the training or expertise to parse out the meaning of the studies, data, concerns, and conclusions.  

I think that most people are like me.  We must rely upon the knowledge and experience of medical and scientific professionals, who network and work in this particular field of study. 

I rely on doctor to keep updated with information and to inform me in a way I can understand.  I rely on the medical professionals in my family to give me trustworthy, educated advice. 

I think many people don’t know what they’re talking about.  The vaccinated ones and the unvaccinated ones.  I don’t honestly know much, but I choose to depend on the advice of the people in my family who do, and on my doctor’s advice too. 

There’s many people, vaccinated and unvaccinated, who couldn’t tell you the difference between virus and bacterium. It’s important that we remember that we are not superior just because we are vaccinated."
2021-10-11 21:53,"It is so painfully easy to call skeptical people stupid. And of course fully vaccinated sorts are really smart. Read the various early reports on the efficacy of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.  I have read through dozens of them. Time again in the early going results spoke of PREVENTING Covid infection. Today the vaccines are valued for preventing hospitalization and death. Breakthrough infections and hospitalizations are exceeding 20 percent of newly reported cases in some states  Boosters are on the horizon for most of us. I am fully vaccinated, and glad of it, but clearly the goal posts have been moved."
2021-10-11 21:53,Let them die. Just don’t let them take up hospital space. Choosing not to vaccinate has to mean choosing not to be treated! Our ears in Rhode Island are overrun with these people leaving many stuck alone in the triage area if they present with anything under life threatening. Just happened to us.
2021-10-11 21:56,"The unvaccinated are playing a life or death game. They will dig and search for the most minute shred of false narratives and lies to prove that the vaccine does not work or is dangerous. Then, if these people should get the virus, and I certainly hope they do not, they will be screaming and crying to the world to get the vaccine and wishing they could give anything to go back in time and had gotten the vaccine. At this point in the corona virus situation it appears that nothing will change their minds while they are still free to get the vaccine. I guess they enjoy rolling the dice with their lives and putting their faith in lies and liars."

2021-10-11 21:57,"The bigger problem is that a lot of people who completed the two-dose regimen are not necessarily going to be game for the 3rd booster shot.  I'm not talking about the older folks or the enthusiastic crowd who already qualify and are getting it now.  I'm talking about younger, healthy people who are not going to want the booster shot next spring when it it is recommended for all.  Then what?"
2021-10-11 21:58,"The unvaccinated need to be informed that vaccines provide great protection, but not forever, especially against a potent variant like Delta. And then the unvaccinated can be informed that boosters for other vaccines aren't uncommon, and accepted. Of course the unvaccinated either 1) don't believe the science, 2) are letting politics guide their thinking (generous word usage), 3) are unable to comprehend what's happening, or 4) are too stubborn to be convinced. It's probably several or all of the preceding. And any other the four can, and will, lead to death."
2021-10-11 21:58,"If you refuse to get vaccinated and you contract covid. You will be refused care at any medical facility.  

The unvaccinated pose a clear, direct, threat to the United States.  

Let’s start treating the unvaccinated like the threat they are."
2021-10-11 22:01,"Shame on you for not  acting like adults.  You remind me of when I had to take my 2 year old to the doctor for his shots.  You are acting like children. 

 We went to Chicago for the last few weekends to see the symphony and the opera.  Illinois has a state wide mask mandate.  Orchestra Hall and the Lyric Opera House required masks and we had to show proof of vaccination along with our driver's license.  They checked everyone's license against their vax card.  It might be a little inconvenient but it feels so good to be able to go places now. Other than wearing a mask, it almost feels normal again.  But the unvaccinated people can't do things like that because of their stubbornness.  You're not only hurting yourselves but those that catch Covid are overwhelming our nurses and doctors to the point where they don't even want to come to work anymore.  Shame on you."
2021-10-11 22:01,"If my age group has to pay 4 times higher insurance rates, these anti-vaxxers should have to pay 10 times higher rates.

There is nothing to discuss.  If I can be discriminated against because of my age, these anti-vaxxers have no valid arguments  to prevent being charged a much higher rate.  

They are more likely to die than I am."
2021-10-11 22:02,"Yeah, the CDC really dropped the ball on messaging on this.  When the vaccine first came out the discussion included wearing masks because break through was a real possibility and there was also talk about boosters...hence the 'don't laminate your card'.

I guess the new regimen felt it would be a better incentive to the vaccine hesitant to dangle removing your mask after vaccination and playing the vaccine up as once you get the shots you're as good as done.  The hesitant just dug in all the more when neither panned out and the reality was closer to what we were initially told.

I really do question Dr.Wallenskys judgement in that the backtracking has made an already difficult task convincing the hesitant next to impossible."
2021-10-11 22:02,"""leaving an unvaccinated population that is mostly hard-core refusers.""  

Similar to not-voting, you are participating by not not getting vaccinated.  its called the 'control group'"
2021-10-11 22:04,"Since I cannot control other people's actions towards this disease, I am protecting myself and my family as much as I possibly can.  My spouse & I, as eligible candidates, had our covid boosters last week. My 86 year mother will get hers next week and as soon as possible,  my offspring will receive theirs.   I want absolutely no chance of contracting this illness that has killed hundreds of thousands and ravaged so many more.  My heath is too fragile to rely any more on these selfish petulant adults..  If all these hard-core anti-vaxxers hadn't allowed this spread in our nation in the first place, boosters wouldn't be a concern. We'd all be in a far better position and medical staffing wouldn't have such horrendous burnout."
2021-10-11 22:05,"No matter what, these stubborn people will not get vaccinated. This is only the latest excuse. They are holding us all back and it is way past the time that the rest of us say ""if you're afraid, STAY HOME"". I am so fed up with them."
2021-10-11 22:05,"Bless the people still striving to reach the self-dramatizing and ignorant non-vaxxers, and I'm thankful for every one that comes over. But at this point, for the holdouts, I just want to say let God sort 'em out."
2021-10-11 22:05,There are millions of people that had Covid. Many of them have had antibody test. Some more than one antibody test. Most of them are coming back with full antibodies. Some reports are out there indicating that natural immunity is sufficient. These people feel safe So they figure why take the risk?
2021-10-11 22:08,"People do have a choice. They have choices in all things—it’s the nature of human existence, no matter what country you’re in (unless you are a child or subjugated in some way as is the case in some countries). We just have to make the consequences of choices more stark. Employer mandates aren’t going to work on the retired, unemployed, or self-employed and that’s a lot of people. There should be more restrictions and costs put on unvaccinated people so that they will feel the consequences of their choice. You can make the choice to drive without a seatbelt on but if you get pulled over, you will get a ticket and if you have an accident and go through the windshield, you will suffer grave bodily harm—your choice. I don’t think unvaccinated people should be turned away from hospital care, but if Medicare/Medicaid and insurance companies would refuse to reimburse costs, that would be a good start. I think it’s going to take something extreme for the hard-core refusers."
2021-10-11 22:09,"Encouragement may help with those under 30, but we need to accept that a high percentage of those over 30 will not get vaccinated because of positive messaging. Most in that grouping will not get vaccinated absent (1) their seeing unvaccinated family and friends become seriously sick or even dying from Covid, or (2) their incurring a high price for their refusal, such as loss of employment or other opportunities, or loss of, or higher premiums, for medical insurance coverage."
2021-10-11 22:09,"I’ve become resigned to the disproportionate number of deaths the anti-vaxxers. It’s an unnecessary tragedy for their families and friends. But if they won’t vaccinate to protect themselves and their families, they aren’t going to do it for me and mine. They deserve the measure of social ostracism and biological comeuppance that is coming their way."
2021-10-11 22:10,So just let them go. I will protect myself with every available booster and behavior.
2021-10-11 22:11,"If you read the article carefully you will see that there are no data to support the headline or the implication that boosters have made it more difficult to persuade people to get vaccinated.  In fact, some of the discussion says precisely the opposite (e.g., ""Experts in vaccine behavior fear that the country is bumping up against the ceiling of persuadable people.."").  Sure, the anti-vax crowd has added the need for boosters to their litany of reasons not to get vaccinated, but unless you can show that, for example, people with appointments for vaccinations cancelled them after learning about boosters, all you have  is speculation. 
And suppose boosters really did make the unvaccinated even more hesitant (whatever that means), should we tell people who have seen the data (i.e., the science--from Israel, from Kaiser, etc.) to forego boosters so the unvaccinated will do what??  Feel better about their choice to remain unvaccinated?"
2021-10-11 22:12,"The Hard Core Holdouts love the attention.  ""Look at me I'm special.""  Stop talking to them, and treat there illness at their own expense, they don't deserve to keep their homes (and that's assuming a lot isn't it.)"

2021-10-11 22:12,"In recent days I took a look at the map of this country, coded with cities and areas which are experiencing high numbers of administered Covid vaccines. The NYT has done an outstanding service to those of us who want to be in the know (as opposed to being “in the NO”) — the map outlines clearly (in real time) which regions I would feel most comfortable traveling. Like some readers here, I feel that I might have more than a few years awaiting me. You can read in between the lines on which regions might be more threatening to my health. 

No amount of finger-wagging will turn around the minds of the anti-vaxxers. So now, dear Lord, hear my prayer:  I ask for a swift wake-up call, so that they realize that their stubborn passivity is in fact a killer. And some of these people want to put their legislative hands on a woman’s body. Shaking my head with sorrow at the hypocrisy of this."
2021-10-11 22:02,"Yeah, I’m all done letting these unconvincable people drive.

More million vaccinated."
2021-10-11 22:14,"Blaming booster shots as a meaningful force driving vaccine avoidance misses the mark.  Americans are generally stubborn and suspicious, and even something as obvious as mass distribution of a life saving vaccine somehow cuts against the national character. It’s all tragic and senseless, but we all know it won’t change.  It’s who we are."
2021-10-11 22:15,"The hard core refusers are just looking for another excuse not to get vaccinated.  By now, if they are not vaccinated, they are not going to be. Hoping to appeal to the anti-vaxxers is no reason for other people to be denied booster shots."

2021-10-11 21:55,"Never seen a vaccine forced into people like this one. Some schools and colleges required vaccines before, but to require a health certificate (vaccine passport) to be carried all the time is a red flag, especially for a virus that has very high survival rate. 

Why would I need to display an ID (vaccine passport) to enter a restaurant, gym, or even to worship? That is a new level if abuse in the name of keeping us “safe”. Seriously? Three vaccine shots for a virus that has been around for almost two years and killed (supposedly) 0.03 percent of the world’s population mostly people over 70. 

Go ahead and only publish the comments that suits your agenda."
2021-10-11 22:17,"The headline for this story is very incorrect and misleading…getting vaccinated is NOT complicated for most people and the majority of Americans are vaccinated.

I really don't care what these people do and if they get infected they cannot play the victim card. Myself I am due for my booster in two weeks and looking forward to it. I suspect we will need annual boosters especially as long as we have such a large number of unvaccinated playing willing hosts to the virus.
2021-10-11 22:22,"Those of us who took responsible actions at the appropriate times -- social distanced, wore masks (correctly), and were vaccinated -- are not worried about COVID-19.  Sure, some of us may get a breakthrough case, but the likelihood of needing subsequent hospitalization (or death) is quite small.

The real worry is the next zoonotic virus.  Humanity luckily dodged pandemics from SARS and MERS, but recall that those outbreaks were all within the last two decades.

With the brilliant decade-old messenger-RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology, and having rapidly and successfully dealt with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19), an mRNA vaccine for the next nasty zoonotic virus will probably be developed and made available with equal speed.

However, with about one third of the US population, for one reason or another, convincing themselves that vaccines are unnecessary -- apparently ignorant of the success of the vaccines for diseases like polio, smallpox, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, tuberculosis -- I can only imagine the global chaos if the next zoonotic virus has a lethality of 30-40% as did smallpox among the unvaccinated."

The ""Green"" Passport used by Israel is only valid with that 3rd dose if the 2nd dose was more than 5 months ago.

Israel gives that 3rd dose booster to all regardless of potential hospitalization risks because it helps to lower the **spread ** of the virus.  In addition, people can be asymptomatic, not knowing that they are infected, and pass that infection on to more vulnerable populations.   This includes the elderly (even with boosters), immune compromised from transplants and certain cancer treatments, and so on, and of course children not eligible for vaccination.

When I speak with people inquiring about a first vaccination, I mention Israel, that used an Iron Dome missile system to protect itself from 4,300 missiles shot at their cities in May with 13 deaths, put a great deal of effort in protecting their population from terrorists or from viruses.  The Israeli vaccination program is an ""Iron Dome"" for the Covid virus as it is an ""Iron Dome"" for Americans against the virus.

Far too many people believe themselves to be invincible/exceptional/divergent et al., and so immune to a virus which does not discriminate.

The mRNA vaccines are different from traditional vaccines and, rather than acknowledging that the mRNA vaccines removed many of the traditional antivaxxer talking points, antivaxxers invented new reasons to be antivaxxers (e.g., they shifted from the 'mercury' argument to the 'change DNA' one.) They are so dug in to their beliefs that whether we have no boosters or many boosters, I really don't see that making a difference. At least on the bright side we have a highly effective vaccine that has relatively few contraindications. 100 years ago, droves of people died because we lacked advanced medicine.

I have yet to see a good explanation of why those of us who are vaccinated should care whether there are unvaccinated people.  We can protect ourselves from harm by getting vaccinated.  The only people likely to get sick are the unvaccinated, and that is their personal choice.  Younger people and children are affected only in rare cases, and now that most of them can be vaccinated, the urgency for vaccination is not there.  In addition, those who have contracted it have better immunity to reinfection than those who have received only a vaccine.  Look at the CDC web site for the data.  It is there.  

Most states have exemptions for childhood vaccines based on religion or personal belief.

We're nineteen months into this, and anyone who is still fool enough to listen to Facebook instead of Dr. Fauci has no claim on my sympathy.

Compounding this is the fact that willful ignorance is now firmly embraced with pride by mainstream US conservatism, and reinforced by GOP politicians (just watch them squirm when asked if they're vaccinated themselves). They will believe what they want regardless of the evidence, from vaccines, to Covid, to climate change, to guns, to election integrity - the truth just does not matter.

There may be some minor trickle of newly vaccinated due to employer requirements etc., but this country is now essentially segregated into the vaxxed and unvaxxed. 

The vaccinated must accept this illogical, unnecessary, wasteful, reality (which is hard for rational people to do). The unvaxxed simply do not think the way the vaxxed do. We must accept the unchangeable reality that somewhere around 1/4-1/3 of the people in this country will *never* get vaccinated no matter what happens - and adjust accordingly.

This means a number of things. The vaccinated need to do whatever they can to protect themselves in a new reality where the virus is endemic and will always be with us, ebbing and flowing, rising and waning. This means getting booster shots likely on a regular basis for the foreseeable future, as Israel is planning (unless new generations of longer acting vaccines are developed). It means wearing filter masks during times of outbreaks. 

The most difficult adjustment will be the need to ration healthcare. With the large population of unvaccinated, there will be a permanent COVID patient population in hospitals. There are not enough resources to go around, and painful decisions will need to be made to ration them."

The hard core won't change.  They've convinced themselves the vaccines cause the variants (the virus is trying to escape the vaccines) and, of course, vaccines don't work.

My all-time favorite was someone who, when I pointed out that Texas and Florida had 3 times and 6 times the death rate of California during the Delta surge, accused Californians of being ""cowardly"" in their response to COVID (apparently meaning that healthcare is interfering with God's plan for people.  Now I see why they hate vaccines; it's ""un-christian."")

This also accounts, I suspect, for the frequent statements by the Trump Base that 700,000+ deaths is no concern because most of these people were predominantly elderly, with co-mobidities, and were ""going to die anyway.""

They fundamentally don't believe in healthcare, especially efforts that involve the government.  No way are they going to be convinced (beyond being scared by the deaths, which does seem to have prompted some number to get vaccinated.)

Herd immunity refers to people with immunity to a given disease, not necessarily just those who've been vaccinated against that disease.

While it's true that some people who've had Covid can get it again - it's a somewhat similar situation for vaccination with ""breakthrough"" cases. It seems by this point we should be able to measure a person's blood antibody levels and make a judgement, however imperfect, of a person's resistance to Covid-19. Why shouldn't people who have 'natural immunity' be granted the same access to jobs etc. as the vaccinated?

Perhaps public heath officials fear that if ""natural immunity"" was granted a status similar to vaccination, the anti-vaxxers would flock to ""Covid parties"" and we'd end up with surge of hospitalizations and deaths - not to mention scores of ""long Covid"" cases.

I am not even angry anymore. I was, not too long ago. Absolutely furious that a stubborn, unthinking minority was keeping the country hostage. I can't be bothered with them anymore.

People can develop long covid from having mild to moderate disease. At this point, people who do not want the vaccine will not get the vaccine unless they are forced to so they can keep their job. I'm also sure several million have natural immunity of which mandatory testing would answer the question of are you infected or not and would be good for everyone interacting with the public, vaccinated or not. Just stop blaming vaccinated people who want boosters.

Okay, maybe it is fine if an individual personally does not want to get vaccinated for a host of reasons. Noting that the Kaiser survey also showed the strongest predictors of not getting vaccinated was voting for Trump and low education. 

But the more important question is what are the social and medical consequences of an individual's decision to remain unvaccinated in a highly contagious pandemic?

We are in an ethical dilemma, which involves a clash between 2 competing moral values

Ethically, which moral value is more important to society and also more likely to more quickly reduce the spread and mutation of the covid virus so we finally CAN go back to a more normal daily existence?

a. Each individual has the right to decide for him or her self which is the right decision for them personally in all situations, no matter the consequences for others.

b.  As individuals, we live in a society with other people; therefore we need to consider the consequences and impact of our decisions not only on the self but on other people with whom we interact. 

So to me, this decision not to get vaccinated, (including the possibility of being fired from one's job) is purely stupid, selfish, stubborn, immature, and pig-headed. 

It says I don't care about anyone else but me, and I am not only willing to risk severe illness and death for my self, but I don't care if I put others at risk also and cause them to die.

2021-10-12 1:10,"Let me share a personal experience.

On Thursday last week I read a press-release by the STIKO (""Ständige Impfkommission"", a committee dedicated to all things vaccine). In it they wrote that the protection offered by the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is ""insufficient"", mostly because of the prevalence of the Delta variant in Germany.

Alarmed by this I made an appointment with my doctor to get an mRNA booster shot, as recommended by the STIKO. But this morning, when I went there, she told me that she's ""not allowed"" to give the the shot (only third doses of BioNTech/Pfizer to at-risk people). ""Maybe in December"", she said.

It seems - despite a clear and public acknowledgement that J&J has problems - the whole thing has to go through some typical German, archaic, bureaucratic process until GPs are allowed to do this cross-vaccination (that has been in use in the UK for month).

So I'm stuck in limbo. Insufficient vaccine, yet no booster shot for me. Great! Basically it means that I can't go shopping, can't apply for a new job, can't meet my friends (who are all protected by BioNTech/Pfizer), can't do anything. I'm in ""personal lockdown"", so to speak.

I just wanted you all to know that there are people more then willing to get full protection, but sometimes it's not possible. I just wish this whole thing would go away, it's getting at my nerves after 18+ month. But I guess I'm not alone in this..."

Seems like winning odds for a knockout blow to the unwary, from a most malicious combatant. Talk about letting your guard down: anti-vaxxers have relaxed their self-defenses to full droop, while sticking their heads forward like nothing can get in their way. Sounds like the perfect posture for getting a dreadful wallop, that puts you in a world of woe."
2021-10-12 1:27,"Premise of this article is so absurd.

2021-10-12 1:37,"I just got the J&J vaccine this weekend. Why did it take so long? 

I am not anti-vax. I have a chronic, painful condition and I was afraid. Unfortunately, vaccines create an immune response and, with that, inflammation in the body. For someone like me, that's terrifying. Would this life-saving shot put me back into bed? Would I get a flare? The people I spoke to in affinity FB and Reddit groups split. Some saw their autoimmune issues flare. Some didn't. I even had the opportunity to speak to an epidemiologist at a major research hospital and she confirmed that there could be a chance -- although very remote -- that the vaccine would cause my disease to flare. And so that is why I have been so hesitant. 

That said, I continued social distancing. I wore (and will continue to wear) a KN95 mask when inside stores. I washed my hands a lot. I did not invite people into my home. I was careful. 

This story doesn't take into account those who are like me, who were fearful but careful. Sure, there are those who don't believe in science or of taking care of society. However, you just can't paint everyone with the same brush."
2021-10-12 1:19,We are finally having our turn here in Polk County Wisconsin. The hospitals are full of covid patients. We have a low vaccination rate and a lot of Trumpers. Sigh.

If the die-hards continue to refuse the vaccine, they have made a decision to gamble with their lives. To live or die is a risk they consider worth taking. We can't place a value on their lives. Only they can. I've given up trying to understand them. 

On the positive side, their deaths mean there are fewer spreading the virus. Harsh? Yes. But not nearly as harsh as those who seem more than willing to infect others."

We know who is being hospitalized and who is dying, it's the unvaccinated.  And now we've seen that over 140,000 children have lost a parent or caregiver.

If you have kids, get the shot.  Don't let politicians or non experts impact your decision.  If you're not gay and under 70, you probably have never seen how disease can wipe out or maim huge swaths of people, as polio and HIV have in my lifetime."
2021-10-12 1:51,"Sad but something like 10-20% of the population will probably get away with avoiding the vaccine in the short run. By short I mean over the next 6-12 months. 

Unfortunately, this virus will almost certainly become endemic and infect some of the vulnerable every year. Hopefully the numbers will dwindle to levels easily handled by our healthcare system. But the avoidable deaths, hospitalizations, and morbidly will still matter. 

I’m betting the unfortunate infectees will be so sorry for their mistake, but the lucky rest will proudly proclaim their tremendous insight while denigrating the vaccinated who actually made their successful nihilism possible."

No real proof except that most of those wearing masks are the elderly and most of those unmasked are the young.  If correct this may explain why  there was such a surge when the delta varriant took hold among the unmasked and why the number of infections is dropping so quickly .

How can the article make the following statement and not take into account those already infected?￼ Just bizarre 

“About 56 percent of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, a level that exceeds some early estimates about what it could take to achieve so-called herd immunity against the coronavirus. That percentage will surely rise once the shots are authorized for children under 12. But Delta is so contagious that experts have revised their optimum coverage estimates to 90 percent or higher.”"

It's like ""I'm not going to put on my life vest because I may be allergic to latex, and it doesn't look like the ship's taking tha-a-at much water""
Full disclosure: I have not read the scientific papers on the vaccine and disease, nor have I conducted my own double blind trial. I do believe what my doctor and respected medical experts have told me. I've also seen pictures of the logjam of bodies in the morgues around the world. I got vaccinated as soon as the bumbling rollout in Australia allowed me to."
2021-10-12 2:02,"We are very lucky in America to have access to the vaccines. And so lucky that the vaccines are highly effective.  Most people who receive the vaccines will be protected from severe symptoms. Not all, but most. 

No vaccine is perfect.  Or I should say, no vaccination program is perfect. As we see in America and countries worldwide, vaccination programs run into voluntary uptake problems, and distribution problems.  And other problems. 

Before smallpox was declared eradicated from the world, I was inoculated.  The vaccination site on my arm showed no reaction, unlike the others who were vaccinated with me.  I don’t have the telltale scar. I should have been re-vaccinated, but was not. So for many years, unbeknownst to me, I had no immunity to smallpox.  

There’s many people in the world who can’t get even a first dose of any Covid vaccine. Anti vax people in the Western world don’t know how lucky they are."

2021-10-12 2:06,"""71 percent of unvaccinated respondents said the need for boosters indicated that the vaccines were not working""  Wow, there's a surprise.  The unvaccinated have made up their minds already. They are now selectively searching for information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs. 

Just stop with the ""we need concentrate on getting everyone a first vaccine shot before we start giving boosters"" talk.  When I was chatting with my pharmacist, who offers  Moderna,  I ask if a lot of doses were being wasted.  She thought that about one in five doses where ending up in  the trash at the end of the day, in her small operation.   The CDC guidance is to give a first dose to who ever walks in and request one, even if it means thawing a new vial and throwing away four doses.  Extrapolate that nationwide and tens of thousands of doses must be being wasted each day.  Add to that the millions of doses, of mostly J&J, sitting in freezers about to expire.  I ask her if I  could get one of the wasted doses as my third shot of Moderna. She answered, no, that would violate CDC policy.  The point is that there are plenty of doses available to give boosters and first doses.  

Again, are we waiting on an FDA approval. This time for  J&J and Moderna boosters.  With all the data submitted, why this takes weeks only God knows. With an overwhelming amount of data, showing the effectiveness of these boosters, we all know they will approved.  Time for the FDA to get to work and save lives."
2021-10-12 2:07,Next two or three months covid will infect all unvaccinated and they will either make it or not. Hopefully they are not creating a new even stronger more transmissible variant in the meantime.

The best thing you can tell these people is that we don't care if they kill themselves. Neither do I want them taking up a hospital bed if anyone in my family needs one for another reason. Stay home folks and fend for yourselves. Also that anti-viral that's getting emergency use authorization? That's ""experimental"" too so those who refuse the vaccine will need to refuse that as well. Harsh words? Yes, but after almost 2 years of this I'm tired of this garbage. These people made their decision. I'll get my booster soon as Moderna has one, if I have to do it every year like the flu shot I will. Also, I'll wear my mask. It's America, I will wear it if I want to."

On the other hand, if there is a resurgence of COVID, President Biden will get the blame, and the Democrats will lose."

The CDC recommending them for others, against the recommendation of their own advisory panel, further discouraged those who were hesitant to vaccinate in the first place.

Most unvaccinated folks have ideological motivations or are just too clueless and broken down to bother. Some have an irrational fear of short-term side effects, like headaches and fatigue. These people now think that they will have to experience these effects three times. Thy are irrational, but so is the mad rush for “boosters” among those at low risk."

2021-10-12 2:35,"""Even as boosters are providing added protection for vulnerable populations, they are raising further doubts among those who remain skeptical.""

Guess what:  ANYTHING is going to ""raise further doubts"" among those who remain skeptical, because they have made a decision to remain skeptical.  If Fauci and the CDC suddenly say they've found out the vaccines don't work, they will still be skeptical.

By this point --- actually we reached this point months ago --- anyone who is still refusing the vaccine (I don't mean the ones who can't have it but the ones who won't) is simply never going to accept it, no matter what.  It's like proving or disproving the existence of God:  whichever side your belief lands on, there cannot ever be sufficient proof to make you change your mind.   

If your priest or minister says s/he doesn't believe in God anymore, your response as a believer is not to follow your leader and stop believing in God; your response is to say ""well if you no longer believe, I'll go find somebody who does.""  Hence the booing of Former Guy by his supporters when he recommended that they consider getting vaccinated. As far as I know he's been pretty quiet on the topic since then.

In short:  there's no point, at this point, caring what these people think.  Go ahead and vaccinate everybody who's willing, and be as ready as you can to deal with the others."

2021-10-12 2:56,"Dear Mr. Poe:

Immunology is beyond your ken.   You have no idea of things like antigens and antibody titer, and stuff like that.

I am getting my booster on Thursday at Costco.   There is very little risk.   There is much more risk of getting Covid, hospitalization, and permanent organ scarring from  a viral infection all through your bloodstream.    Vaccinated people don't suffer like that.

The Covid vaccine is just a strip of mRNA or DNA.   It is not an antibody-inducing vaccine that is a killed virus or an attenuated virus.   Therefore, there is much less potential for problems with allergic reactions or virulence.

A person infected with Covid is not only a victim, but a vector transmission, at a much higher probability than the vaccinated.    Vectors are also the breeding ground for variants.   Even with breakthrough infections of the vaccinated, antibodies induced by a vaccine will clean it up faster, thus lowering the probability of mutation.

In years ahead, vaccine refuseniks will look silly, because the mRNA technology will usher in a golden age of medicine in which shots using similar technology will be used to do things like attack tumors and rebuild insulin producing cells in the pancreas.

The main thing is, those who refuse the vaccine now put society in general at greater risk."
2021-10-12 2:58,"The acupuncture practitioner I go to monthly is unvaccinated for motivations that I find differ from my own (I’m fully vaxed since April), but I don’t disagree with his point of view, and he supports mine. I’m not particularly more concerned about his or anyone’s responsible choices that may include choosing not to vaccinate (he masks, limits his travel, and abides by other mandates that help limit the spread) than I am about a contracting a breakthrough infection from another vaccinated person. We’re all at some risk. Irresponsible behavior -flagrant mask evasion, harping about infringement on “personal” freedom (whose freedom, from what?), propagating unsubstantiated misinformation, and other irresponsible behavior is altogether different. Unvaccinated by choice and being responsible about it is not the same as being anti-vax and behaving irresponsibly, putting others at risk out of willful ignorance. Responsibly un-vaccinated people should not be forced to be vaccinated. My acupuncturist is doing the right things. We actually need a responsibly unvaccinated population as a control for the vaccines, to gauge vaccine efficacy. Mask up, please -it’s kind, neighborly, and easy. Let science and rationality prevail, please."
2021-10-12 2:58,"Vaccine hesitancy can easily be satisfied by reviewing the Medical Safety Review Panel Reports.

It's common practice for the FDA to appoint an independent board made up of experts who do not have any stake in the outcome of the application.

There's only one problem. The FDA waived the appointment of that panel for the Pfizer review and there is no independent report for the booster applications either.

In fact, the main problem with this ""fast track"" process is that the FDA, the CDC and the pharmaceutical companies make up one very big revolving door, with top personnel moving from one to the other. 

And they all have a stake in the outcome of the review process. 

The only way to restore confidence in our public health system is to stop the censorship, appoint independent reviewers and have a truly transparent process.

Anything less will only increase hesitancy and this caution will be well founded."
2021-10-12 2:59,"Boosters aren't complicating things, these people's collective denial of reality is. No matter what evidence you present to them it will always be evidence in favor of their case, which is possible since their case has no basis in reality to begin with so your evidence and research can mean whatever they want it to mean. 

A lot of these people are deeply indoctrinated into a cult which last year embraced a series of increasingly unhinged conspiracy theories in an attempt to deny the existence and/or overall severity of covid. Getting the vaccine at this point would completely shatter their worldview that all of their anti-intellectualism revolves around, and they've already proven that they'd rather die and sicken others than accept legitimate medical advice. . .so I'm not really sure what anyone expected.

Maybe if the media outlets actively promoting all of the blatant lies and disinformation surrounding the vaccine were held accountable for all of the death and destruction they've caused, and maybe if a plethora of politicians admit that they lied, repeatedly, to their constituents about all of this, things can change. But until then those people will continue pedaling their snake oil, and there will always be someone to buy it."

Thank Trump for the refusal of a large swath of the public to get vaccinated. It has done incalculable harm to the country."
2021-10-12 3:03,Let me get it right; the need for a booster or maintenance dose; justifies doing nothing. By this logic you wouldn’t buy a car or house or computer….because they require maintenance as well. For me I prefer maintenance rather than doing without.

When the vaccines rolled out to the general public, I was beyond thrilled. A way out of this mess! Although I’m a specialist I spoke to all of my patients about it, tried to convince the reluctant, saw patients again and re-visited the discussion. It was exhausting but I was so hopeful. 
Now? I’m just exhausted but not hopeful for those who’ve refused. If they’re not vaxxed, I tell them that they should be. Then I move on. 
And I wonder why I’m putting effort into treating them at all, if I care more for their health than they do."

Maybe, it would be a good idea if we could get everyone vaccinated before giving a third shot to “old”people like me?

Many people who would not get an mRNA vaccine out here are happy to get the more traditional vaccines. The traditional vaccines are safer and less effective, which is a reasonable trade off for younger, healthier people. But it’s not an option in the US, probably for reasons that have more to do with politics than science. Wider availability of Novavax would probably cure some vaccine hesitancy, but that doesn’t seem to be happening for some reason."

Remember, refusants, that your stance may well affect any vaccinated descendants you leave when you die, The internet has a long memory, and I foresee a time where one’s family’s negative attitude toward vaccination will be regarded as a red flag for association. As in, “Don’t play with/be friends with/ marry anyone from that family — their ancestor refused the Covid vaccine.”

Meaning, their ancestor risked the lives of others for his/her own selfishness, and may well have caused others’ early deaths."

But for months now vaccines have been freely available but yet in some communities the vaccination numbers are high. But the media has gone silent on that. Now that booster's are available the media is back blaming Americans who choose to get the boosters. Until we attack the root cause of the low vaccination numbers among some communities we are not going to progress. The fact is in rural areas vaccination rates are low. Among some minorities the vaccination rates are low. We need to identify such pockets and convince people to take vaccines."

This nonsense appears to have a impact the FDA and CDC committee reviewers, who mostly work at academic institutions, and compelled to academic institutional wokeness and group think, which is largely dysfunctional.  It is good the CDC director overrode them.  Many do not seem to figure out that vaccinating the world, vaccinating the unvaccinated in the US and making boosters available are independent, and all are needed.  In practical terms, the largest success is easily predictable -  making boosters available to those that will readily seek them out.  Vaccinating the third world with Pfizer and Moderna will never have much success for multiple reasons.  And those that refuse vaccination are unlikely to change there minds.  It is simple logic what should be focused upon. Although Biden et al might talk up this nonsense in alignment with the NYtimes, surprisingly his administration is prioritizing booster availability over all else."
2021-10-12 4:07,"The reality is this:

1) Hardcore anti-vaxxers are not going to be convinced. Whatever their reasons (religious, political, distrust of government, “freedom”), they have been politely asked, pleaded with, lectured to, begged, cajoled, and threatened. You can’t force a person to do something they don’t want to do (just observe a 5-year old with a bowl of overcooked spinach in front of him/her).

2) At this point, people who are vaccinated are mostly safe from the worst illness and extremely unlikely to die from Covid. The people who are getting the sickest and dying are the unvaccinated. This makes sense and maybe it will start convincing more anti-vaxxers  to get vaccinated. If not, well, it’s too bad more people have to die from this preventable disease, but it is what it is. You can’t stop people from taking risks with their own lives.

3) There is and will continue to be collateral damage: people who cannot get vaccinated or vulnerable people who are vaccinated. While these people will do everything they can to be safe, as long as we have a large population of unvaccinated people, these “innocent” people will get very sick and some will die. This is not only unfortunate, but sick. The unvaccinated are largely responsible for the sickness and death of these people. So sad.

4) Lastly, the unvaccinated are Petri dishes for the virus. It will continue to mutate. Eventually, it will outsmart the current vaccines. Hopefully, our scientists can stay ahead of it.

Good luck!"

So over 97%, of mostly Delta variant deaths, were in the unvaxed. But the CDC didn’t have highly reliable numbers, which was very disappointing.

When the Times article about the 700,000 American Covid deaths came out, it was only mentioned that 2900 of the last 100,000 US deaths were in those who were vaccinated. So over 97%, of mostly Delta variant deaths, were in the unvaxed. But the CDC didn’t have highly reliable numbers, which was very disappointing. 

The CDC needs to tout deaths in terms of unvaxed vs vaxed  to the nth degree. The apparent inability to do so is killing people."

2021-10-12 4:19,"I found this article a muddle. It purported to be about how the booster was complicating efforts to entice the unvaccinated. It wasn’t. 

And it should have been: Many of the deniers are using breakthrough infections, as well as the need for a booster, as “proof” the vaccine doesn’t work.

(Of course, this just shows they misunderstand how any vaccine works; many of us who get flu shots still “get” the flu. It’s either asymptomatic or so mild we think it’s a cold. And all vaccines show a loss of early neutralizing antibodies over time; this has little impact on the remaining immune defenses that keep us out of the hospital.)

But instead of probing how boosters are being gathered into anti-vax narratives, the article veers off into yet another set of interviews about how burned out medical professionals are over anti-vaxers. Which is also a serious problem, but not the one announced by the headline."

2021-10-12 4:27,"This is easy. I have always advocated for the ""right to die"". In a free society, it is absolutely a measure of personal freedom to allow people the choice to decide to die rather than live in a manner they find unacceptable. 
The caveat must be that, should you choose the ""right to die"", you have preemptively refused life-saving measures to be used to heal or resuscitate you after you have chosen that it is your right to choose the option to die.
Therefore, if you choose to accept measures that prevent death from a particular disease (like choosing to take chemotherapy for cancer, or taking the COVID-19 vaccine to prevent infection and potential illness from COVID, or choosing to take the rabies vaccine being bit by a raccoon or a bat), you are able to access any and all measures of preventing death.
However, if you choose the ""right to die"", it should be viewed by the medical community the same way as a DNR order. Do not mitigate the chosen disease or death of someone who has chosen that it is absolutely their right to die of a disease. To interfere in their choice to die is absolutely un-American, according to their own ideals and actions."

Covid is not seasonal, and a more vigorous variant having already appeared, we are getting another shot in 8 mos. (or longer).   Nothing new there.   Someone who says he is worried about potential ""long-term effects"" of a vaccine might weigh that against potential long-term effects of Covid (or the short-term one, death).  But reason is not the strong suit of any of these folks...nor is duty, social responsibility.

Health experts pleaded with Biden (and his administration) weeks and weeks and months ago, to use the pulpit of his presidency to urge that universities and organizations and corporations REQUIRE vaccination.

Their like-minded friends and family should treat them at home with whatever ""cure"" they believe in and leave it at that. No one else should absorb the costs, the physical and psychological strains, nor the danger they pose to the greater population."
2021-10-12 5:59,"At this point, vaccine (and Mask!) mandates are still useful, but we are soon reaching the point of diminishing returns. Let the Anti-Vaxxers cling to their principle of ""Personal Responsibility"", and let it be known that anybody who declines to be vaccinated by Year's End will bear all of the medical expenses that they incur, if they end up needing healthcare services as a result of getting Covid. Stupidity ought not be subsidized.

Fatality rates are down to about 1 Percent for those who get infected with the virus. Only about 100 Million Americans remain unvaxxed....

The Government did not do a good job of managing expectations. The vaccines which were developed (and approved by the FDA) are good, but not great. They are effective, but only for a while. Whereas many vaccines provide strong protection for a lifetime, other vaccines are only good for a year, or less....
This is certainly the case with the Seasonal Influenza vaccine, which is really only effective for a few month, but usually long enough to provide some protection for most of the duration of the Flu Season (Winter/Cold Weather). Since Covid is a year-round disease, and is more contagious than the flu, there will be no off-season respite. Therefore, Booster shots will eventually be necessary every 2 or 3 Months, unless a dramatic improvement in the way the vaccine is formulated can be devised and implemented."

It's like playing whac-a-mole with the new misinformation that keeps cropping up, even amongst people who ought to know better. Lately I've had conversations with two medical professionals -- a nurse practitioner who refuses to be vaccinated even though this puts her family-breadwinner job in jeopardy, and a dental surgical assistant who is vaccinated because she wants to keep her job, but she still mistrusts the vaccine and doesn't think it's helping. Both these professionals, who live in different states and don't know each other, cited the same reasons for their vaccine mistrust: 1. They believe the VAERS data proves the vaccine is harmful. 2. They are convinced that ANY health problem people experience soon after receiving the vaccine must have been directly caused by the vaccine, even if no cause/effect has been proven. 3. They are furious about the mandates because to them that infringes on their ""freedom.""  4. They maintain there is a hidden population of ""vaccine victims"" whose stories are being ""censored."" How does one even begin to untangle this knot?"

He issued an order prohibiting any vaccine mandates in the state for anyone who has a religious or medical objection. Though his order presumably applies to private companies. I'm not sure how he can tell a private company how to run its business. As for the medical and religious objectors, companies and organizations who mandate the vaccine should reject medical excuses written by chiropractors (who are among the most influential group of anti-vax practitioners) and other fringe practitioners without a license covering medical practice for infectious diseases, and also reject religious exemptions for people who cannot point to long-established doctrine in their religious congregations."

Now the media will have us believe that the reason the media has a 25% trust rating is the readers fault not anything they did. First they print something misleading or don't cover a story (both the left and right) that they would like to avoid and then they run adds saying they are trustworthy. Do people realize that every republican is not ignorant and uneducated (The neurosurgeons at U of Alabama are the top rated in the Nation) and that there really is immunity that arises after someone has had an illness.

These people have become a religious cult who live in their own fantasy world believing the lies and propaganda of the Republican Party leadership and the the anti-vaxxer movement, many of whom are making huge profits from fake anti-vax products.

2021-10-12 9:40,"Thank you to the NYT for this update. 

I think it is important for the general public to understand what the COVID vaccines do and equally important what the vaccines don’t accomplish. 

Vaccines mitigate symptoms reduce the risk of hospitalizations and reduce the potential for mortality. 

Vaccines do NOT prevent transmission. Vaccines do NOT prevent infection. 

Natural immunity ( technically referred to as sero-positivity ) is what occurs in people who have been infected and recover.  There are increasing numbers of reports appearing in respected medical journals around the world that document the superiority of natural immunity on almost all objective measures. Historically the public health goal of vaccination  was to achieve the immune benefit of natural immunity. The functional prevalence of natural immunity to COVID 19…and its multiple variants in the population has not been objectively measured at any scale….YET. However there are numerous smaller studies that suggest the incidence of natural immunity is now sufficiently high to assume the US population has reached “ herd immunity “. 

It is one thing to “ mandate “ the application of a mask. It is quite another to “ mandate “ the application of injected material into another person’s body. As with reproductive rights these are personal decisions between a patient and their physician.

There are unintended social
 consequences when politicians and employers coerce personal health choice."

2021-10-12 10:10,"About 16 years ago, the chickenpox vaccine came out. Our family physician recommended that my young daughters get it. “It’s an important shot,” he said. “One shot and they’ll be immune for life, without ever having to get the chicken pox.” So we followed the doctor’s advice and got the shot. A few years later, the doctor tells us, “Your kids are going to need a booster in a few years. It turns out the vaccine does not work as well as we thought it did. And it’s really really important that your kids get the booster when they’re supposed to because chicken pox is much more dangerous the older you get.”

So, had they been allowed to get the chicken pox naturally, they would have been immune for life, but because I allowed them to be vaccinated, they are now in more danger of complications when older if we don’t forever after give them the boosters.  

I’d rather go for natural immunity, and no longer trust the advice of the government and physicians as much as I used to.

So, when it comes to COVID, which mostly kills those who are already unhealthy in some way (whether they know it or not), and of which most people get very mild cases, I’d rather get it and develop whatever natural immunities will develop, because we done know, long term, how these vaccinations will truly help or hurt us, or long term what this disease will do to those who don’t develop natural immunities."
2021-10-12 10:12,"People who take a test that shows they’ve had Covid and are now naturally immune should not be required to be vaccinated. They should be issued a card that indicates this.

But unvaccinated people needing hospitalization for Covid are driving up the cost of health insurance. Just as smokers are required to pay more, those who can’t show they are naturally immune and refuse to be vaccinated should be required to pay 50% more for their health insurance. Why should the rest of us be subsidizing them?"

2021-10-12 10:56,"I was a hardcore hold out. I would have quit my job had the vaccine been mandated. But I recently heard interviews with two 20-somethings with no known health issues telling their stories. One required a lung transplant, and the other almost died as well. I had my first shot last week, but I still have a nagging doubt about whether the interviews were staged. (To put it mildly, network news is not objective or impartial.)"
2021-10-12 10:58,The confusion about boosters is an excuse not a reason. I am all out of patience with those who refuse to care about their community. Even in my building on the upper West Side we have people abusing our staff about our mask mandate. I’m so depressed about this.
2021-10-12 11:01,"If you have been injured i.e. infected by an unvaccinated person sue them. If you have been injured i.e. infected by an institution, government or private, that did not protect you from the unvaccinated sue them. Write your insurance commissioners and insist that unvaccinated pay more for insurance. Write your hospitals and insist that areas be set up for vaccinated people. No one who is vaccinated should have to wait for medical care. Sue them if they try to put off medical care because they are treating the unvaccinated Covid patients. It is time to FIGHT BACK."
2021-10-12 11:08,"Maybe we wouldn't need Boosters if the vaccination rate was higher and cases were lower.  The Delta variant is on a rampage and it is unfortunate that so many people are not seeing this until it's too late - they get sick with Covid or someone close does - or God forbid, someone dies.  This debate is tiring and I'm afraid it'll go on for a long time unless we do the right thing."
2021-10-12 11:10,"When it comes to Covid, I have adopted practices that has kept me well - so far. My husband are best friends, retired, so we can easily avoid most public places. We live in a region in which most people are not vaccinated and Covid is still at high levels. We have been fully vaccinated since April and continue to wear masks when we grocery shop, go to necessary appointments, etc. Except for close family members, all vaccinated, we avoid small gatherings. We get take-out from restaurants that require masks. We can find plenty of things to do around our house and in our yard. We read, exercise, talk with friends and family on the phone. We’ve gotten our flu shots and intend to get the Moderna booster when/if it is available. The thought of staying well overcomes any temptation to get bored."

23 years ago a 'Dr' did an unnecessary bronchoscopy and infected me with a bacteria normally found on the skin, but when internal (always via medical instrument according to the CDC) it's virtually 100% fatal.  I was a guinea pig at a respiratory  research center which is why I'm alive. One of the first to survive it internally.

All the treatment to save me left me with 'worn out lungs' (easiest way to say it) and far more susceptible to infection than the average person.

At the moment I have 6 environmental lung infections. Thankfully not contagious! Most people are immune to these, I no longer am.  All are fatal if not treated.  But the medications are strong and I'm getting hearing and eye sight side effects so 2 had to be stopped.  They need to take out more of my right lung.

I have the best Dr's in the country treating me, but these anti-COVID vaxers  are bound and determined to harm and kill others due to their bone headed stupidity.  

It's way past time that restrictions be put on those who simply refuse to get the vaccine.  It's akin to murder."
2021-10-12 11:15,"The real argument between vaccination and not vaccination comes down to ""do you trust the science that developed the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines?""

CDC or FDA should address the questions openly and honestly."

They prefer to believe what they read on bogus Facebook sites  to what the scientific literature prepared by world experts reports around the globe offers after the accumulation of huge amounts of unbiased data.

The deliberate refusal of these anti-science people have made a religion out of anti-vax lies and are indeed killing themselves along with family and friends. 

Herd immunity', also known as 'population immunity', is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that happens when a population is immune either through vaccination or immunity developed through previous infection.  Given the seriousness of COVID infection for most people, the choice is obvious - unless one is blind-sided by propaganda.  Furthermore it also prolongs the time it will takes to reach herd immunity. That has an unjust impact on everyone. 

Ignorance and selfishness combined is extremely lethal during a pandemic."

It seems like political pressure and the simple logic that if one is good, two is better and so on and so forth. I am vaccinated, but I am also realistic. The messaging on this has been terrible, starting with Kamala Harris not willing to take it if ""Trump is for it."" We have destroyed any faith in our institutions of ""science"" because politics - not science - is driving all of this."
2021-10-12 11:46,"We all make choices daily, typically to our benefit based on available information. The information about vaccines and their efficacy isn't complicated.

Fortunately the CEO of Norwegian is a lot smarter and saner than DeSantis and will continue to repel DeSantis' attempt to destroy what is left of the cruise industry after a hellacious year of watching their multimillion dollar investments sit in port or anchor off the coast.  
When will the vaccine resistant realize that Trump, DeSantis and the crew downing vaccines on Fox are ALL vaccinated?"
2021-10-12 12:08,"I few weeks ago, I found myself in an infrequent conversation with a 91-year-old longtime Republican friend whose life has been tragic.  For many years she has supported the two grown daughters who live with her; one is in a wheelchair, the other has never been able to hold a job.  My friend herself is not in good health and seemed clearly depressed about the state of the world, especially the impact of COVID.  I gathered up my courage and asked her if she had been vaccinated; she responded, ""No, I'm too scared.""  As we talked through the  benefits, I realized that her fear was not a political problem, but one of logistics.  I asked if she and her daughters would be willing to be vaccinated if I arranged for someone to come to their home, and she said yes.  We live in different states, but I found a source where she lives and helped her jump through the paperwork hoops.  A week later,  two nurses showed up at her door for the first dose, and they will return in four weeks for the second shot.  So maybe instead of being afraid to ask ""Have you been vaccinated?"" we should gently prod people we care about and ask, ""If I arrange for someone to show up at your door to vaccinate you, would you do it to protect yourself and your family?"" I know this is just one tiny step, but every step helps."
2021-10-12 12:22,I'm sorry. No apology for getting the booster. Why should I  risk my health just on the remote chance that it might persuade  a vaccine hesitant person not to get one? If they couldn't use this excuse they'd find another.

We know an unvaccinated person who recently died of Covid, yet the rest of his family still won’t get a vaccine. You can’t fix stupid. But like with alcoholism and drug abuse, while it’s difficult and maybe impossible to convince the abusers to stop drinking and shooting up, it is company policy in almost all organizations to have zero tolerance for drinking or drug abuse on the job. We have to address Covid the same way with employer mandates, firing of the refusers, and stop wasting our collective breath on the much smaller pool of refusers in smaller businesses or not working."

2021-10-12 14:07,"Maybe the time has come for the hospital systems in the nation to put all COVID patients on the back burner, unless they were previously vaccinated and go back to providing the needed care for those who are vaccinated as well as providing the not needed surgery choices, again, only for those who are fully vaccinated.  When those who chose not to be vaccinated show up and cannot be taken in they must be told that it was their choice!"
2021-10-12 14:18,"Well, at least there are now treatments emerging to care for those who refuse the shots and get Covid.  I have a couple of friends who, due to their compromised health, have not gotten the shots, so I'm glad for this development for them."
2021-10-12 14:27,"The hatred here is palpable.  And it's driven by the new Democrat party.  The one that claimed restricting travel was racist.  Now the one that wants the unvaccinated to lose everything.

But, contrary to the narrative from DC, they nytimes, and most of the media that has swerved far left and forsaken any sense of journalism, the unvaccinated cross parties, industries, religious beliefs, race, and ethnicities.  I honestly believe that if Trump were still in office, the far left would refuse the vaccine (as stated by Biden, Harris, and others).

At the end of the day, it comes down to choice.  If people refuse the vaccine, it's because the media, DC, and our healthcare institutions have done a very poor job of teaching people what it is, how it works, and why it's important.  I'm vaccinated and was excited to have access to it.  However, I'm sick of the elite, arrogant, and dismissive attitude of readers and most of the 'progressives.'  

The more you push, the more people will resist.  Mandating the vaccine has just widened the huge divide that exists in this country.  STOP IT!

PS Evidence tells us that variants will continue, with or without the vaccine.  Science tells us that the delta variant will infect the vaccinated and unvaccinated, and both will spread the virus once exposed.  We have effective treatments for those infected with a mild to moderate case (monoclonal antibodies to name the best to date).  Done."
2021-10-12 14:30,"If Trump had touted vaccinations after medical science saved his life he'd still be president.  Fortunately for the world, he didn't.

We need the booster because they keep the high spread of the disease going.  Making vaccination a job requirement us a great idea, because it is bad business to pay unnecessary high healthcare costs, cause other employees to miss work and make your customers sick.

This in a province with well over half the population vaccinated.  I’m no fan of a mask mandate, and think masks are annoying but it beats getting a potentially fatal disease.  Shots are no big deal.  Again, beats getting sick. 

Canada has its share of anti-vaccine idiots, but the mask mandate is not stopping anyone from going to stores and even eating in restaurants. Some restaurants  are requiring proof of vaccination, but all in all it works and things are semi close to normal.  It was weird to come back to the US yesterday and see people in the gas station/food stop near the border not wearing masks. The cheap gas was nice, but I drove off wondering how many of the non-masked people had been vaccinated and were happily spreading Covid around."
2021-10-12 15:01,"The New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, and Nature all publish real scientific articles about Covid on their websites and access to those articles is open to all. My guess is that information is a lot more accurate than anything on FaceBook or Utube."
2021-10-12 14:00,"Not getting vaccinated or not vaccinating your child does not mean you, you don’t care about the life of others around you. It doesn’t not mean your politically motivated.. It means you actually care about what no one at this very moment can answer “What are the Long Term Effects ?“ there isn’t a sole that has taken or administered the vaccine, who can answer that because it’s too soon. Period.
I went to Israel in summer 2019 at that time a breakout of measles in the US was occurring. I asked my Dr if I needed a booster shot prior to my trip, she tested my blood and said No Booster needed as I still have antibodies.. yeah, from 40+ years ago! And a COVID booster is being rolled out within months? To each his own. Masks and social distancing work if done properly."
2021-10-12 15:15,"The most interesting finding to me in the KFF work is the question about how the respondent sees booster shots.

Booster shots are needed because at least the mRNA vaccines' protection fades rapidly.  That was not expected, and not what the authorities claimed initially.  Of course, without experience, there was until recently no evidence one way or the other.

However, that does not seem to have any bearing on how people responded to the question.  82% of Democrats claimed that the need for boosters indicates that ""scientists"" are making the vaccine more effective.  But the booster is the exact same vaccine, it wasn't made more effective at all.  This is pure religious thoughtless tribalism.

Meanwhile, the unvaccinated have the correct answer to the question, but use it as a reason to avoid getting the vaccine, a false conclusion, essentially making the perfect the enemy of the extremely good.

The result is that only fairly small fraction of those surveyed, maybe 20% at best, understand that the vaccine is not working as well as hoped BUT nevertheless one should definitely get vaccinated.

It's a sad day for America, folks."
2021-10-12 13:42,"The booster shots have nothing to do with the reason which you state as a reason for the hold out people. A reasonable person gets flu shots every year. Why not COVID shots. Kids are required to be vaccinated to be allowed in school. Not getting vaccinated is simply selfish and brainless. If a person is a jeopardy to society, he/she should be obliged. Enough of these freedom speeches for the sake of all of us!"

2021-10-12 15:36,"A year ago, long before Delta, we were told that boosters might be needed a year from then.  Now,  they are needed especially for the elderly and those with underlying conditions.  The data has shown that among the vaccinated serious problems can happen to those who have problems.  Most of the vaccinated have been able to weather the storm.  It's the unvaccinated who are upsetting the apple cart, especially among the young children.  The problem is that so many of the unvaccinated don't believe that Covid exists, feel that their natural immune systems are strong enough, or  just filled with the nonsense that is online.  These are the same fools who actually believe that the Arizona recount proves that Trump was the real winner just because he said so."

Or were those diseases just so much scarier in the public imagination? Polio was actually less deadly than Covid. I think for people who have only known others with mild cases or who relished Trump in his steroidal high telling everyone how great he felt, Covid is too abstract a threat. How many people who have experienced the true ravishes of Covid in themselves or in loved ones or patients are anti-vaxxers?"
2021-10-12 16:15,"What is the point of this article? Should we stop boosters so, we can win over and cajole  “hard-core refusers” into doing the right thing. This is complete nonsense. Many long administered vaccines have boosters.
Please stop making up useless excuses for hard core refusers. Booster doses will help ensure that infection of the vaccinated will be truly minimized leaving only the unvaccinated and, they will have only themselves to blame for the outcome. Use the saved doses on people in other countries who don’t have access and would do anything to be vaccinated."
2021-10-12 16:22,"Do you assume that those who refuse vaccination are providing truthful or convenient excuses?  They may be on their 12th excuse, with the others demolished by reality.

Those saying that the boosters are needed because the ‘vaccines don’t work’ (insert sigh) are still exposed to and exposing themselves to the possibility of getting COVID-19. What part of that is not getting through to them?

Do they realize that you can get the shot now, but you cannot get it after you get COVID? 

Who knew that a year after millions of positive tests, thousands of deaths, and a vaccine to help - that we would be in the position of literally begging adults to get a shot? 

Sad."
2021-10-12 18:27,"Just today, I spoke with a healthcare worker who believes that all health workers do not need Covid shots because ""they know how to protect themselves."" She cited her own experience of caring for a Covid patient without getting sick herself.  Sure, a particular individual may not get sick, but we know that many doctors and nurses have died caring for Covid patients. They weren't all careless or lacking in knowledge of personal protection.  

It makes me sad when people cite natural selection in these cases (survival of the fittest), but in the end, they may be right, as people who do their ""own research"" remain afraid of the Covid vaccine no matter much false theories are debunked.  Me, I'll keep my shots up (got my booster a week ago) and wear my mask in public."
2021-10-12 18:51,"The “hard-core refusers” will probably never get vaccinated. Many of them are “anti-maskers.” How can you convince someone to take a vaccine if the person refuses even to wear a mask? It is simply inconceivable. 

I know of several people who were non-believers of COVID. Apparently, they would never get it, and if by some remote chance they got COVID, it wouldn’t be a big deal.

These same people railed against the vaccine - either because “it was no good” or because “no one can tell me what to do.”

Well, these people all got COVID and ended up in the ICU, gasping for breath, suffering the entire time. They are dead now, leaving behind their loved ones, including young children. Check out the story of Phil Valentine, Nashville talk show host. He thought his chance of dying of COVID was less than one percent. He was horribly wrong. 

As someone with a chronic health condition, I think about how it might go at the end. Gasping for breath is not one I relish."
2021-10-12 18:55,"My wife and I are 65+ and waiting for Moderna boosters.  We're in the SF bay area now, where vaccination rates are very high, mandated masking. After we find ourselves in crowded places, we occasionally work through COVID symptoms for a few days.  My feeling for some time is that the Delta variant is hitching onto those who no longer carry active antibodies, as well as the few unvaccinated.  Epidemic bodkins do not publicly factor one parameter: many of these unvaccinated have also had COVID some time ago and can still be carriers in the same way as those whose vaccinations were not recent.  We're at the endemic stage here already, where getting sick and dealing with viral loads are less of life and death issues but are public health and Quality of Life issues.  
To me, public health adheres to the same principles that prohibit yelling 'fire' in a crowded theatre.  So I'm incapable of understanding how, even beyond would-be influencers asking anxiety-inducing questions on social media and  Liberty-flogging on TV, are Governors even allowed to declare vaccination and masking mandates illegal in their respective States?  The virus crosses State lines, we can't choose to allow or disallow it in our particular States, like we did with Slavery."

Being vaccinated should be a requirement for receiving health or life insurance. 
No vaccine? No Insurance.

Being vaccinated should be a requirement for hospital admission and all medical care (not just care related to COVID). 
Not vaccinated? No Medical Care for you.

Being vaccinated should be a requirement for air travel. 
No vaccine? No Boarding Pass.

Being vaccinated should be a requirement for holding any job. We already require an SSN and proof of citizenship. We should require proof of vaccination as well. 
No vaccine? No Paycheck.

Assuming a pediatric vaccine is approved in November, do I get him vaccinated as an 11 year old with a pediatric dose (which may be 1/3 of the adult dose). Or do I wait a few extra weeks and get him an adult dose as a 12 year old?

Is a pediatric dose reasonable for a pretty large kid (but not an outlier huge kid - there are kids in his 6th grade class already over 5 ft 6)? 

He wants NOTHING more than to be vaccinated day 1 when it is available. But is that my smartest move?

Our pediatrician has no idea. She said we should just take him to a public vaccination clinic now and lie about his age to get an adult dose. I don’t like the ethics and kid is 100% truthful, so there no way we could do this, but it seems like she’s on the side of an adult sized dose for him."

Good parents trying to protect the health of their families are powerless in the face of the Republican politicians (whose own kids go to private schools with masking requirements and vaccinated staff) who are forcing schools to allow dangerous and harmful ""no masks required"" policies and not mandating that staff get vaccinated.

All good Americans are hopeful that not only will the vaccine be approved for little ones very soon, but that all states will follow the lead of the great state of California and mandate COVID vaccines along with all the other vaccination requirements for the coming school year"

We’re in a pickle!"

In conversations with other parents at my daughter's school, all we can talk about is our frustration that our kids are not vaccinated yet and how worried that continues to make us. Plus the kids remain worried since they can sense the state of the world. These kids are adopting anxious behaviors around cleaning that will affect them for years. There will be no trick or treating for us without a vaccine, no movies, no dinning inside a restaurant, and yet another year without a birthday party for our winter-birthday babies. The FDA needs to get going and let us vaccinate our kids and return to a more normal existence!!"

I can only endure the restrictions for so long.  We are looking at another winter of masked, outdoor gatherings, another winter of not gathering indoors EVER with other families because the kids aren't vaccinated.

They need to take their time to perform a very thorough review of the the vaccine to both ensure the health and safety of children, and to build trust in the public after losing much of that trust over the last six years.  Pfizer would probably love to start putting shots in the arms of 1 to 100 year olds tomorrow, because they will profit from it.  But as has been reported from the issuance of the 1st dose, kids are complicated, and age/physiological development are not perfectly aligned.  Let's hope the approval comes quickly, and that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks for what has now become our most vulnerable population."

The FDA can't review what hasn't been tested and submitted.  Pfizer, who remember, REALLY wants to sell their vaccine to kids has possibly JUST submitted their data, not stated that they submitted it months ago, folks.  The FDA is already accepting a much smaller trial size (3,000 kids vs 44,000 adults) in order to move this review along into the near future.  As a side note...I listened to the booster panel discussion a few weeks ago and was blown away by the fact that Pfizer showed up having studied a whopping 15 adults over the age of 65 (!!!), the main age of interest and priority, and were chided for it repeatedly by the panel.  This same panel, who everyone seems to be accusing of bureaucratic delay, STILL approved it based on risk to that population.

2021-10-07 19:47,"As a society we need to have a serious discussion about the rationale of vaccinating kids. COVID-19, thankfully, is not a serious disease in children. Therefore the only rationale of giving kids the vaccine is to reduce spread to protect adults. But most adults are getting vaccinated and the Pfizer vaccine is ineffective in stopping the spread. The vaccine efficacy drops dramatically over time and vaccinated people can get infected and spread the disease!   So what is the point of giving kids a vaccine that is not medically necessary and does not help us reach population immunity?

Unfortunately there is no rational discussion on this issues in the US while many European countries are choosing not to vaccinate kids. We have political ideologues and panic mongers in government who cannot think rationally and increasingly getting addicted to mandates. Gavin Newsom is mandating kids vaccination in CA with no understanding of current data. His own kids presumably have immunity from getting Covid and his mandate will require them to get a vaccine they don’t need! We have reached peak irrationality as a society."

On an individual basis, sure, it's sad.  Math gives us perspective though and I wonder if Dr. Grace is 500 times sadder for the other deaths.

A 5-year-old would be about 40 lbs, and an 11-year-old would be around 80 lbs, so shouldn't there be an escalating schedule based on mass?

It's distressing that children are the least studied and least protected in this pandemic. Early on, pre-Delta, it was deemed young children do not develop severe symptoms. A lot has changed over the last 2 years and this sentiment is no longer true.

With Facebook charlatans and others on the internet disseminating fake news and conspiracy theories, people lack a basic understanding about how their bodies work. Yes reproductive health education is needed but a basic understanding of how the body works like blood pressure, nutrition and yes a primer on how vaccines work.

In general, I'm hugely supportive of vaccines. In my opinion, miraculous is not too strong an adjective.

However:

[1]  Death is the prime metric of Covid severity. Because death is categorical; starkly objective.

[2]   125 deaths among children ages 5-11 implies 12.5 deaths in the entire country over 18 months among the ~27 million *healthy* children in that cohort.
  
[3]  The death of any child is an unspeakable tragedy.

[4]  But, on a risk/benefit basis, can we justify vaccinating ~27 million *healthy* children in order to prevent 12.5 children from dying every 18 months?

Why are we vaccinating kids?  Well it's to protect old people, primarily.  The data is clear on this.  

Maybe we need a reality check on this virus -- it's just not that lethal, unless you are over 70 and unvaccinated.

This has to be traded off against the small risk of a heart condition that these vaccines can cause in young children in rare cases. Currently, you can make a legitimate argument that for a young child, this risk of dying from covid is lower than a serious side effect from the vaccine. Therefore, why the rush to vaccinate until we have more data - why take the risk with such young kids! This is not anti vax, just balancing risks. For adults the balance is clear, the minute risk of vaccine side effects is far lower than your risk of dying from catching covid."

The team of analysts that reviews the data is Small, Overworked, and have pulled Nights & Weekends to comb through all the data on side effects, dosing, the control group, the results on the real vaccine vs. the placebo. The list goes on and on. 

So for Pf/BnT to have waited a week to submit the request was honorable, because they wanted to let the FDA have some runway on reviewing the data. The October 26th date was not selected simply because that’s when the committee could meet. They scheduled that date because that’s when they expect the individuals reviewing the data will be ready with their final report and recommendations after their analysis. 

Do I wish it was a faster process? Yes. I have a child who is 11 y and 9 m. It’s been a long wait. But for the pristine dose of 10 micrograms, rather than too strong a dose at 30, the adult dose, starting at age 12 and leading to a small risk of myocarditis in males, I’m trying to be patient. If it takes too long and my child turns 12, we’re suddenly at the adult dose. Hurry up FDA… but I understand they’re not wasting time. They’re working very very hard."
2021-10-08 1:21,Is there any information on the 2-4 year old population? Or even the 6mo-4y population? I thought originally they were testing 2-11 then suddenly it was only 5-11. Grateful for any leads!
2021-10-08 1:28,"24 hospitalizations out of 100,000 for this demographic.  Why rush this vaccine through on such a tiny sample size?  Kids have supercharged immune systems.  Who knows what the vaccine could do to them on a larger scale?  

This is the equivalent to forcing kids to wear helmets walking down the street to avoid tripping."
2021-10-08 2:33,"""Pfizer said in July it expects revenue from its COVID-19 vaccine to reach $33.5 billion this year, an estimate that could change depending on the impact of boosters or the possible expansion of shots to elementary school children.

That would be more than five times the $5.8 billion racked up last year by the world’s most lucrative vaccine — Pfizer’s Prevnar13, which protects against pneumococcal disease.

It also would dwarf the $19.8 billion brought in last year by AbbVie’s rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira, widely regarded as the world’s top-selling drug."" - AP News, Sep 25, 2021

No, I'm not getting my children vaccinated."
2021-10-08 2:42,"Pandemic vs individual thinking:

The faster everyone gets immune through vaccine and/or natural infection, the sooner we are not in a pandemic.

The greater good got us to this point in history. Me me thinking can take us back to unnecessary deaths"
2021-10-08 1:32,"COVID will get worse this winter, unless herd immunity is achieved this fall.
The only way that will happen is if children can get immunized.  The #1 priority should be approval of one of the COVID vaccines for children ASAP, and encouraging all children to get it."
2021-10-08 4:12,"Correcting and clarifying some earlier statements I made in posts based on too quick a read:
1) Yes, it appears Pfizer used a very small sample in the US - the articles in medical journals mentioned, or the NYT seem to ignore the vast amount of data available from Israel - that said, there does seem to be something causing the vaccine to cause swelling in the heart and lungs of an estimated low-single-digit of 100,000 vaxed very young people, especially boys, a phenomenon seen in an order of magnitude (n in 10,000) persons in the same group who suffer COVID infections. As I haven’t read the Med journal papers yet, I don’t know if there was a control for vax recipients who had suffered asymptomatic COVID either simultaneously with their vaccination or more than 6 months earlier, leaving them possibly more open to the syndrome or suffering it due to the virus and not the vaccine.
The numbers as presented would indicate valid statistical data, not just noise.
I will still recommend to parents of children 5 and up who are members of my extended family that they get their kids vaccinated as quickly as possible. @3 (don’t have multiple windows on this phone) out of 10,000 young COVID sufferers affected is a lot higher than <3 per 100,000 sufferers of the syndrome after vaccination. COVID also leads to many more lasting effects than have ever been reported post-vax.
I regret my mis-reading, but still see vaxing 5  as the only way to end the crisis that’s killed 700,000  in the US."
2021-10-08 1:42,"Go ahead and mandate (and you know that is where we are headed don't you) 5 year olds receive the vaccine to go to school and not only will you have an all out war on your hands, you will also absolutely have Donald Trump firmly back in the White House in 2024."
2021-10-08 4:18,There is something off when it takes a month to schedule a meeting and then weeks to decide. All other age groups much faster. There is something we are not being told.
2021-10-08 3:32,"So this vaccine has been tested in less than 3,000 kids. A lot of commenters want to give a vaccine to their own children that uses a new technology that has been tested on less than 3k kids, and they berate parents who want to wait as insane or evil. I would fine this hilarious if it wasnt so sad. Millions of kids have got Covid, and 125 died. Over 125 kids died just in the last three days from various accidents. Even better, hospitalization and severe disease are so rare in kids thay Pfizer could not even test if this vaccine actually even preventes severe disease! That is ridiculous. As far as Im concerned, this vaccine is a placebo to make parents feel safe, not an actual necessary or effective medicine."
2021-10-08 11:52,"This semester for my grandkids is already wasted .  If government knew it would take that long and hard to approve vaccines, why not spend more effort to stop virus spreading?

I also can understand why some people are reluctant to take shots.  With this new method, long term (>3 years) effect is unknown.  

Our government should take precaution and prepare another vaccine using conventional approach with a proven record and well known long term effect in retrospect."
2021-10-08 12:17,"I am glad these age groups are being vaccinated. Speaking of vaccines - boosters. Media act as if millions of us who received two Moderna vaccinations don’t exist. There is no word of when (if) this booster will be available. I heard in passing that next week is a tentative time for the F.D.A. to consider this, and there has been much off/on news about J&J. My CVS pharmacist knows nothing about it. 

News people who write endlessly about vaccines, what’s up with the Moderna booster? I would rather hear about this than six more stories about Afghanistan and 20

2021-10-08 14:13,"The vaccines that kids wanted could come, as Dr. Richard Besser just said on the National morning shows, ""sometime in November."" He was very optimistic about it. I think he is right because kids should stay healthy and even data from the F.D.A. is under a further review."
2021-10-08 10:19,This is an alarming report. I am thinking of not going back to my local YMCA facility since there is no vaccination mandate. To find that the infectious nature of Delta is not necessarily slowed down by shots puts a damper on things. The appeal of more caution has just been strengthened.
2021-10-08 10:41,"This article illustrates the point that you are not going to vaccinate your way out of the pandemic.  If you can vaccinate 83% of your people and still have outbreaks, then the virus can definitely circumvent any vaccine the scientists can devise.  The statement that the vaccines reduced hospitalizations and the more severe effects of being infected with COVID is not a false statement, but one that could be biased depending on who is reviewing the results.  Given that the death rate is around 2% or below of those infected, that means 98% of the population survived COVID and this was before vaccines arrived on the scene. Many of this 98% were never hospitalized, a great many asymptomatic.  Of those who suffered the more serious effects of COVID infection had underlying conditions such as obesity or were old with compromised immune systems.  This article also illustrates the short comings of trying to reach what is called herd immunity by mass vaccination.  By all means vaccinate the most vulnerable of the population and those who want the shot, but to mandate the shot for all is not going to end the pandemic."
2021-10-08 10:54,"This is a bit of an odd report. The problem for Singpaore is that it has been so successful in controlling the disease and keeping deaths low that it set 0 covid as its goal and has now found that is impossible. However, it also sounds like it continues to do a fantastic job on managing the disease. Remember, the places that are ""normal"" are often places where ""living with the disease"" means that a lot of people are going to die and people just accept that. Also, at least part of the problem is that vaccination rates in Singapore are still too low. They are only at 80%. They need to be 90-95%, at least. I live in New Brunswick, Canada, where our government made the mistake of lifting all restrictions at the beginning of July. The govt now admits that was a big mistake and we are currently going through the worst surge we have had in the pandemic. We have about 800 cases of C19 in the province, about 50 people are in hospital, roughly 25 in ICU, and the situation may get worse before it gets better. The govt has also brought in stronger restrictions, including partial lockdowns in some places, a vaccine passport, etc. Our present complete vaccination rate is over 80%, one doses almost 90%. We still need more vaccinations to really get this under control. Now the govt wants at least a 90% vaccination rate and that seems to be what Delta requires."
2021-10-08 12:05,"As someone who moved to Singapore two months before the pandemic began, I think Singapore is a cautionary tale in early success begetting subsequent failure.

Early on, Singapore was way ahead of the curve with vaccinations and contact tracing, but these early successes have now turned against us. It is through contact tracing, that we are uncovering thousands of asymptomatic cases. Let's think about that - 98% of the people diagnosed with Covid would not have even known they had Covid had the government not aggressively tracked them down and told them they were unwell. In other countries, these cases would not have been identified and the case numbers would have been lower. Also, from the 2% who actually exhibit symptoms, most of those who are vaccinated do not experience severe symptoms. So while the vaccination can't prevent infection AT ALL, it does a great job of preventing death or severe infection. 

One would think that with 83% of its population double vaxxed, the Singaporean government would rethink the way that they track and monitor Covid, to focus on the number of genuinely impactful cases, but so far we are clinging to the old ways of reporting and inciting fear in the general population who only look at case numbers (and not what they mean in reality).

It is also important to note that in Singapore, the population is not allowed to protest against the government, so many people are suffering in silence with mental health being a genuine concern."
2021-10-08 12:18,"Well what can I say. Singapore is a victim of its success. For decades, the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) has upheld an ultra-efficient, perfectionistic brand of governance. The party has instilled in the heads of Singaporeans that the country must be nothing but the very best in any and every indicator. The cumulative effect of this style of governance is that the population now holds the government to a very high standard when it comes to the management of anything including the current Covid-19 crisis.

Opening up means more case numbers inevitably, something that would be a blemish for the perfectionistic-minded ruling party and public. Fortunately, the ruling party was pragmatic enough to begin touting a ""living with Covid"" strategy even at a time the public was still weary of opening up. 

But now it is the public which is fed up of the government's repeated about-turns when it comes to reopening. I sense that the silent majority favour a faster reopening even if there is some ""collateral"" in the form of higher case numbers. People have been exhausted since the first circuit breaker came into effect last year. The rest of the world has learnt to take the virus in its stride. And Singaporeans were told an 80% vaccination rate was the magic number needed for a phased reopening. So why the delay?"
2021-10-08 12:38,"I am with the governments of Singapore, New Zealand and Australia. Their cautious approach are becoming increasingly unpopular, even with some of their own people. However, their people have avoided the most damaging situation during this pandemic.  And I think, by staying cautious, they are not giving up their duty of care to their most vulnerable citizens, even though these people are a minority. To find a better approach is necessary, but to do it in a cautious manner is the right way."
2021-10-08 12:48,"I don't know how readers are supposed to make sense of an article like this when the writer isn't clear about what the numbers actually represent or about the sequence of events. The result is an article that will mostly be useful to those who want to spread misinformation about pandemic management.

National health officials in other countries, such as the US and Canada, were calling for a higher vaccination rate, all ages, than 80%, and a combination of vaccination and masks, at the same time that Singapore was removing all restrictions.

Johns Hopkins says that Singapore's actual vaccination rate, all ages, is 79.5%, notwithstanding what this article suggests, and notwithstanding the remarkably limited vaccination data available on the website of the Singapore Ministry of Health.

Singapore apparently has a population of 5.7 million, densely packed. Just looking at the numbers that the Singapore Government  *has* seen fit to release, there would appear to be at least 1.1 million with only one shot and at least 900,000 who are completely unvaccinated.

 We would know the actual numbers if the New York Times made the effort to tell us."
2021-10-08 12:49,"I have to laugh reading this.In new york we are required to wear masks on buses and trains.Everyone is still wearing masks in stores,even though it is not mandatory.Libraries require patrons to wear masks.In order to see a movie,a show,or eat in a restaraunt,we have to show a vaccination card.Nobody has suffered more than New Yorkers.Children are forced to wear masks all day in school.However,you can go dancing in a club with no mask."
2021-10-08 10:38,"Could it be that Singapore has a low level of natural immunity from having had Covid, compared to most other countries?  And sp, even with a high vaccination rate, trouble looms."

2021-10-08 12:52,"The number of suicides with the scary-sounding increase was 452. I don't want to minimize the suffering and tragedy of those deaths, but it is a small number compared to deaths from Covid when you decide to just ""live with it"" which really means ""let a certain percentage of the unvaccinated and at-high-risk die"".  My state has a population similar to Singapore and claims over 11,000 deaths from Covid and 1.22 million cases (the state is almost certainly under-counting deaths).

It sounds like Singapore is trying to find an approach that minimizes cases and deaths, and is acknowledging the truth that vaccination is not a magic bullet.  Good for them. What we're doing is inhumane, sacrificing people for profits and politics, with media turning a blind eye to our choice to accept large numbers of deaths. Our media's recent take on Covid: downplay the virus, over-sell the vaccine (no other interventions needed except masks in schools, maybe), and criticize countries that put a higher priority on saving lives -- and have successfully done so."
2021-10-08 13:12,"It is obvious that the Singapore government has every intention to protect its people, and it is treading a very difficult position to balance the competing interest on one hand of businesses and public's expectation of going back to life before pandemic; and on the other hand reasonable as well as responsible public policy to protect its people. All countries face similar difficulties, but for Singapore, with limited natural resources; huge dependency on tourism and global trade/investment; global interconnectivity as a hub for the region, the challenges are magnified substantially. 

Vaccine was the big hope in early 2021.  Unfortunately, despite more than 93% vaccination rates in Singapore for all age groups except for children under 12, infection cases jumped (less than 30 in July to over 3000 now) with continuing deteriorating hospital situation after marginal removal of some restrictions. It will be irresponsible for any government to continue opening up in this current circumstance. After all, which government, whether State, Municipal, or national government, has not walked back and re-introduced restrictions; I know my local municipality and state have, and many other countries--including, most notably, Israel--have. 

Overall, there is no easy way out of it. A complex issue cannot be solved by a simple expression through an article."
2021-10-08 13:04,"Since we now know that not all vaccines are created equal, especially in their ability to sustain protection after many months, one might have expected the article to have illuminated WHICH vaccines the residents of Singapore received. I kept reading and re-reading the article for this information. Did Singapore use the Chinese vaccines (Sinopharm, Sinovac) or the RNA-developed vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) or the AstraZeneca vaccine?"
2021-10-08 13:05,This when the wisdom of Sweden and US states that did not do strict and long shutdowns will really show.  Places like Singapore will still be frozen in place while places that didn’t shutdown too much will be moving on.  It’s not as simple as shut down and wait for a vaccine.  Herd resistance through natural spread is a necessary component of a population that can truly move on from COVID.
2021-10-08 13:57,"To me, avoiding hospitalization and prospect of death from the covid is the main benefit of vaccination. It should not be 80%, but 99%, and then we all would be back to normal life as just caring the virus without getting seriously sick is all that matters. But no, those 20% of covidiots, they spoil the life for the rest of us. Locking down again just to save that stubborn population of covidiots? No, thanks, I don't care about them any longer."
2021-10-08 14:20,"I’m going to have to go to a statistical report to understand what’s really happening in Singapore.  I’ve really appreciated comments of those living there, they’ve helped explain how the great amount of testing Singapore does has led to increased positive numbers.  I have to wonder if as the vaccine ages, resistance wanes so more positives show up.  But it doesn’t seem to mean more bad illnesses or deaths, wish more data was present.  Being in a pandemic is hard.  No one has prior experience because the disease is new.  No way to be sure when a deadly variant will appear.  Survival has to be the goal, and maintain health.  Not be saddled with a debilitating side effect that prevents employment or a good life.  This whole experience is crazy-making, but, crazy is manageable, death is not."
2021-10-08 14:15,"How does a state that depends on a daily migration of workers from the adjacent country ""close its borders""?  Somebody is being economical with the truth."
2021-10-08 14:30,"Huh? I found much of this article frustrating and incomprehensible. According to the article, covid and hospitalization rates are dramatically up - but no numbers are cited. It says that the vaccination rate is 83% and then is unclear as to whether or not restrictions were actually lifted; the headline about getting cold feet about re-opening implies they didn't.  And a quote from an official that vaccines don't stop infections.

So - what exactly is the take away? if the population is vaccinated and is practicing social/economic restrictions, what accounts for the increase? Which vaccine is being used? Etc."
2021-10-08 14:25,"Since children under 12 can’t be vaccinated yet, are they playing a role in transmission?"
2021-10-08 15:02,I think it’s fascinating all the different ways countries have handled this pandemic. All trying to do their best. And all the naturally forming social experiments. I hope someone is documenting all this for the next pandemic.
2021-10-08 15:04,"I don't know what more Singapore can do to deal with this virus. Their vaccination rate is 83 percent , almost herd immunity level but covid cases are doubling up every 10 days instead of declining. The government has almost restricted everything but still, cases are going up.
  Combating endemic diseases requires long-range thinking, sustained effort and international coordination. Stamping out the virus could take decades — if it happens at all. It takes time, money and, most of all, political will.
  We have to accept that this virus is here to stay, the question is how do we live with it safely. Coronavirus may neve go away even with vaccine."
2021-10-08 15:18,"It is not true that Singapore closed its borders. The government here has refused to do that, unlike that of Australia, New Zealand, and China, etc, citing economic reasons. The country has allowed visitors to enter throughout the pandemic, though most have to undergo quarantine for 14 days (now reduced to 10). I said most because not everyone have/had to. It appears that some senior business executives were exempted when their PCR tests were negative. The criteria were not known nor was the government transparent about it.
It was during earlier part of this year that travellers from the South Asia region were still entering the country as employment pass holders, or dependent pass holders, or whatever reasons. Despite news of the pandemic ravaging India due to the Delta variant, the airport authority didn’t separate travellers from these high risk locations from the rest nor prepare the airport staff adequately. It was only when an infected cluster formed among airport workers that the government stopped the entry of travellers from that region. By then, it was too late, the fox was already in the henhouse. 
The Delta variant has since been spreading among the community, regardless of the high vaccination rate and the mandatory mask wearing. 
Separately it is interesting to read about dissenting views from the medical community in this article. I wouldn’t have known about it from the mainstream media, which just quoted supportive views of the government policies."
2021-10-08 16:39,"It is clear that COVID-19 is now endemic in the world. Countries—even Singapore—cannot be in a lockdown forever. The best we can do at this point is to vaccinate people based on mandates of various sorts and then open up. With vaccines, the likelihood of hospitalizations and deaths are close to the seasonal flu and that’s about as well as any vaccine could possibly do with a coronavirus. Few countries in the world did such a good job of preventing wide-spread infections, they become something of a prisoner of their own success. When the rest of the world did not do their jobs, they imposed a ceiling on what countries like Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, and New Zealand could do: live with an endemic pathogen but with a population that’s been vaccinated and, therefore, protected. With all this, it makes abundant sense to open up these countries, making sure that all new arrivals and departures are fully vaccinated."
2021-10-08 17:04,"Talking only about vaccination rates is a huge mistake.

The number to watch is the combined vaccinated plus the previously infected percentage of the population. 

For example, a large percentage of unvaccinated school-age children in the US and Europe have been previously infected (mostly asymptomatic) and thus have the same or better immunity than the vaccinated.

The rates of natural acquired immunity is much higher in the US and Europe than in Singapore, Australia, New Zealand.

I find it unconscious that governments and the media do not report on the combined (natural + vaccine) immunity. A population survey on antibodies is all that is needed."
2021-10-08 17:57,"For one thing, Singapore is a densely populated country.  Everyone is in close contact with one another.  Even vaccine shots reach with herd immunity level, virus could still find weak spot and spread through fast.

China is another good example. Even with its tough policies to stop virus, one careless slip from international travel in the Nanking airport caused Delta spreading through several provinces. Government afterward actions were fast, efficient, and very organized. With testing, tracing, tracking, and quarantine, the viruses were subdued after three weeks or so.   

Italy is a loosely populated country. Travelers have choices."
