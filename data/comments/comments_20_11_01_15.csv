2020-11-17 14:51:04,"This morning I didn’t fuss at one of my kids (age 17), for starting class under the covers and with his camera off. 

Last spring that would have been unimaginable. He is a top student and his class president. He’s doing okay all things considered, but all of this is really hard."
2020-11-17 15:19:40,"It isn't easy but think about those in Europe at the start of WWII. Kids schooling in England, but worrying about german bombs. French kids knowing the German army was moving towards them, then actually being there. I know it isn't easy but it's been worse. And with vaccines on the horizon, it just might be over before next Fall."
2020-11-17 16:12:37,"It is not just adolescents who are feeling this. My 24 year old daughter is living at home, working part time and searching for  a full time job to utilize the skills she developed in college and pre-Covid work. Her life has stopped, she gets ""ghosted"" by companies accepting her applications and wants to move forward with her life. It is crushing her (and me). It will take a long time to get life to feel normal again."
2020-11-17 17:28:08,"I think less time needs to be spent on the screens to begin with. Get outside for some air - parks, meadows, forests - as long as you don't congregate with friends in groups. Also, movement and maybe some interaction with the other humans and non-humans in the household, if you have them. Maybe play a board game or read a paper book. But the fresh air is absolutely essential. There is too much focus on keeping people on screens and sedentary."
2020-11-17 17:57:35,"My son, a junior in High School has been in online school since the beginning of the Pandemic.  He has been losing motivation and is increasingly unhappy as time passes. He really wants to return to in person learning. San Francisco Unified School District is too inefficient and financially strapped to figure out how to reopen safely.  It is a horrible realization that he may do a year and a half of schooling from his bedroom.  San Francisco needs to prioritize opening schools including High Schools safely."
2020-11-17 18:28:28,"This will impact our kids for years. I am doing everything I can to provide a stable home for my son who has been deprived his high school experience that everyone takes for granted. The losses are real. We can say ""well, he didn't die"", but that would negate the real losses felt by him and his peers. We need to be patient and do our best to help them cope with the losses these kids are struggling with."
2020-11-17 21:17:18,"As a Teacher, this sounds horrible, but children have actually lived this way for centuries. Rural children, particularly in America, have been homeschooled in isolated settings for generations and yet we have no long-term research regarding the affects of isolation on them. Indeed, we often see these children entering college more prepared than their public school counterparts. As someone who spent two years in homeschool, seeing only a small group of friends on the weekend, I can attest that the attitude of parents is the true difference. My parents had us help around the house, we grew things, cooked things, repaired things, and learned through our video home schooling program. Ask any child of Abeka video homeschooling and they'd laugh at the concerns of those who think this is hurting our children. Parents make the difference and to be blunt, teaching in person, some kids come back to us without any issues and some come back like Zombies. From what I can tell, those who come back in a healthy mental state had parents who ensured that they, not the screen, was the real teacher at home. Those who were left to screens turned into the depressed Zombies. Parents, I blame us. We can change this. Kids have been isolated for centuries without issue."
2020-11-17 21:37:34,"As an high school student this year has been really hard. I have always been very motivated but lately even waking up for lesson can feel meaningless. I felt really close to the kids interviewed, in particular the ones talking about missing friends and having boring routines. I am lucky enough to have a therapist and the possibility to cultivate -somehow- my hobbies. I really hope we all can get the best from this situation, both as individuals and communities. Thanks NYT for the attention brought to me and my friends. Hugs from Italy!"

Saturday night, see a first run at the Coronet - $5 - sit in the balcony, with our feet up.  At 2 AM, buy the thick Sunday Times from the newsie, head down to West 4th, get a hot sausage & peppers hero at the open-air storefront up from the leather shop with 'After Bathing at Baxters' wafting out into the street.

It’s good brain food."
2020-11-18 00:38:18,"As predictable, there’s a lot of adults here suggesting kids toughen up or otherwise failing to lament kids’ milestone events being forever lost. This generation of young people will not only have come of age during a massive global pandemic, but a continued era of failing public schools, rollbacks on health care, a widening income gap, corporations running roughshod over the environment, renewed racism and government leaders ripping apart the very fabric of our democracy. I doubt they’re too surprised to see (and read) about most adults failing to consider their needs now in any meaningful way. Hopefully, their families are giving them as much as they can while society continues to fail them. Honestly, I’ll be rooting for these kids—somewhere down the line—to hold everyone and everything to account for the overwhelming selfish nature of too many Americans, which has been laid all the more bare by the Covid pandemic."
2020-11-18 00:52:55,"I get concerned for the kids who live in homes where there is a lot of strife, maybe even abuse or violence, because they often rely tremendously on friends and school contacts for their emotional survival. And what of those like  that young man sharing a home with many people, and not enough food?  

But perhaps those adolescents with fairly well -functioning families will not be permanently damaged  by a year of reduced in person social contacts. With a little creative guidance they may look  back on this passage as a unpleasant stage, but one where they did have personal growth in independence and problem solving.  It'll be their version of walking  5 miles to school in a blizzard, or surviving  the Depression.   

Someone else mentioned something about how rural kids, or home schooled ones, face a certain amount of isolation as a norm. As a farm kid who did at times have a lot of time alone, I think this was in part what turned me into a voracious reader. But I don't recommend large stretches of time without seeing friends - -  it can be a sad and lonely time, and it occurs as they are beginning to separate  a bit from parents."

When my children were born in 1989 and 1992, as soon as I could I taught them the lessons of our involvement in Vietnam as well as my own family's and extended family's involvement in WW2.   Suffering and sacrifice with a capital S . I know that Americans want everything in it's right place all the time.  Schools as the center of socializing and babysitting and the whole community isn't an option anymore.  So much whining and upset has become the norm .... and that's just by the parents.  If 2020 isn't a learning moment then we need to admit that parents' only function is birthing these future citizens.  In that case, the state should take over and house them as well as school them with the goals of character development as well as academics; and strive to make then useful human beings that we'll need desperately to not extend their childhoods into adulthood like us Boomers did.  Resilient and smart Americans will be needed in order for them to survive."

My daughter and I take a lot of walks and I’m trying my hardest to be here mentally physically emotionally here for. I also wanted to bring up another issue that I’m really scared about right now is that the predators know that these children are the Internet most of the day. So please check your child’s platform messages and make sure you go over all the rules good Warning signs of being on the web with your child. And not meeting people you don’t know from school anybody could be behind that computer. It only takes a few minutes to make sure your child is safe on the Internet! And please do parental controls. 
My daughter Got caught up on these platforms and was not doing her homework. I am now looking into doing book work from home. No zoom. No more Internet. Since taken away Electronics my daughter is doing better she said there was a lot of pressure on all platforms, The zoom was really uncomfortable and she wasn’t really learning anything.

2020-11-18 02:39:33,"What if pandemic and quarantine is good for teens and school-aged children?

Maybe they no longer take school for granted? Maybe they apply themselves or find more camaraderie with classmates when we get to a better place with covid? Perhaps they will reflect on and remember their suffering, and become more empathetic adults?

They may not have lived perfectly blissful days, but really, this is not Armageddon. 

Remember—Some families have lost members, and others are going hungry. Others are or will be homeless."
2020-11-18 03:00:33,"I can see both sides of this... on the one hand, no, it’s not a bad thing for kids to be bored... but on the other, they didn’t create this world of phones and the internet, etc. And even for those of us who grew up without all that, something like this pandemic would still have been devastating. 

It’s unfair to expect teenagers to have an all-encompassing big picture view and think gosh, I could have it so much worse... it’s just not how most teens are wired (you know, non-fully developed prefrontal cortex and all that). Not saying they shouldn’t be reminded of it, but realistically, who among us can live permanently in a state of gratitude for what we aren’t suffering?

And what of the kids who are literally alone all day? My friend and her husband both have to report to work (outside of their house) each day and their son, an only child, is home alone all day, every day, expected to monitor and motivate himself through online schooling. That’s an awful lot to ask of a 14-year-old, even one (like this boy) who knows how to make himself a grilled cheese sandwich and has been a good, responsible kid and student. He’s now failing several classes and is sinking into a depression and his parents don’t know how to help him.

COVID is spreading quickly throughout Nepal's rural areas, where not only is there no medical support, sanitary conditions can often be rudimentary. And the spread from India is pretty much what we hear on the ground from Nepal, from family and friends there.

That our young people, without the aid of mentors or support of a news business enterprise, have taken on the role of thorough-as-possible coverage of not only their campuses but college towns, is both heartening and a reproach to their elders.

2020-11-04 18:40:48,"I live near Ithaca NY, home of Cornell University.  I have found the student reporters at The Cornell Daily Sun to be a very reliable source of local pandemic news. It's heartening to read that the same is true of young journalists at other colleges and universities. What is not so heartening is that the local papers where many of these young journalists could, in days past, have found employment and a chance to further hone their reporting skills are now either nonexistent or else have been stripped down to mere shadows of their former selves. I hope that dedicated young journalists will find a way to revive our dwindling local news sources, online if not on paper. It is critically important to have responsible journalists covering not only community activities, but also town board meetings, hearings, etc. Democracy begins at the local level and change generally occurs from the bottom up, not the top down. Moreover, if we want good journalism at the national level, then we need a robust training ground at the local level where young journalists can acquire the experience needed for excellence."

2020-11-04 20:54:04,"Campus papers at big universities have always had an edge on local community papers by their shear numbers of journalists and better student contacts for sources. Given that the big story on campus is, how many students have contracted Covid, or aren't following the rules, it's easy to see why the campus papers are getting the scoops. This is in no way meant to diminish the importance of their work both in getting the information out there and in holding administration and public health authorities to account.

2020-11-03 17:41:46,"So... does shortness of breath count as a symptom? Aches and muscle pain? Sniffles? 

If pregnant women have to develop more severe symptoms for them to be distinct from the usual ill-feelings of pregnancy, especially late pregnancy, it makes sense that flagrantly *symptomatic* pregnant women might be quite sick."
2020-11-03 18:25:42,"The same thing is true for influenza.  Pregnancy is immunosuppressive.  The mother's immune system is depressed in order to tolerate the fetus.  Proteins and other antigens from the fetus cross the placenta in minute amounts.  If the mother's immune system did not down regulate to tolerate them, she would reject the fetus.

Influenza can be catastrophic in pregnant women, so it seems likely that Covid would do the same."
2020-11-03 18:28:14,"A study that confirms the obvious: pregnancy places a woman’s body under stress; thus the challenge of fending off covid-19 while pregnant is significantly increased.

Until the advent of 20th century advances in medical care, complications of pregnancy and childbirth were a leading cause of death in woman of childbearing age. We may transcend superstition, ideology and misogyny; but there’s no denying the innate anatomy and physiology of the human female."

As if we don’t have to face enough difficulty being pregnant (especially while caring for other children); the additional stress of contracting Covid is not ideal for fetal development. I wish I could say I am more excited for their arrival but honestly being pregnant has been so anxiety and fear inducing during this time, it’s definitely not like a “normal pregnancy”. Not to mention the fear of the babies contracting the virus once they’re born! I just hope that we have a change in leadership today- leadership that can appreciate the importance of eradicating this deadly virus."
2020-11-03 19:50:27,"As a retired Ob/Gyn, I am not surprised by this finding. Pregnant women are generally healthy and pregnancy is not an illness. But is is a major stress on the cardiovascular system and the dynamics of respiratory function are impaired in late pregnancy. As resident I nearly lost a pregnant woman from varicella, chicken pox, pneumonia, a rare complication that that is far more common in gravid women. Much of the lung in pregnant women is poorly ventilated because of poor diaphragmatic excursion resulting in an increased susceptibility to pneumonia."
2020-11-03 20:24:50,In July I tested positive for covid during my first trimester. I am fairly certain I was exposed at work. I work with prisoners. My husband never tested positive and I don’t think I spread the virus to anyone else. Now I am five months pregnant and my baby is developing normally. I am going through the appeal process with my HR department to try and get a teleworking accommodation for the duration of my pregnancy. My initial request for accommodation was denied because pregnancy is not a disability.  I have been told there is not enough information about covid and pregnancy for my HR department to approve my accommodation request. I hope I am approved so I do not have to take leave without pay or risk being exposed again. I was tested for covid antibodies and I do not have them so I have no reason to believe I’m immune. The other pregnant woman I worked with felt forced to resign for her safety. Thank you for this article I hope employers are listening.

But those who are quitting because of the stress of working in a public health emergency, honestly, I feel it's a little like soldiers saying I want to quit because now there's a war.  But the overwhelming numbers of health care professionals have stepped up ( not stepped back) during these awful times, and they are working in conditions that are more difficult than they need to be.  It is so imperative that we have programs and resources to support them and their families  concretely as they care for us all in these dark days.."

I continue to be totally disgusted at how ""disposable"" the federal government and many constituents seem to believe the health care professionals are!  There was never a proper defense production act implemented to make sure that everyone, everywhere, from the largest hospital to the smallest office or home care nurse had enough high quality PPE.  Parts of the general public still don't seem to understand the point of ""flattening the curve"" is to save the hospitals from total collapse, which I'm afraid is becoming imminent esp in parts of Texas and the midwest.

Also hinted at in this article, not related to the pandemic, is a new ""trend"" whereby medical practices are being taken over by venture capitalists!  I can't see how this is going to end well, when in a few years, we find that most of the medical practices have been sold to venture capitalists, whose main concern is making more and more money, using the patients and physicians as pawns in their schemes.  The point of medicine is taking care of people's health, not making money for the already rich."

2020-11-16 11:55:12,"The shortage of doctors and healthcare support staff was at a critical stage even before covid. Now add burnout and deaths among healthcare workers we are seeing a catastrophe in the making. Then on top of that Trump limits on immigration affects the many supporting staff who are immigrants, including doctors who come on visas for residency and often take up practice after. The pipeline for future doctors and support staff has been greatly cutoff. Some foreign doctors are looking elsewhere due to the political turmoil of this country. Add to a country with poor health compared to other countries and we are in a world of hurt!"
2020-11-16 12:00:43,"The medical establishment greatly restricts the number of students allowed into medical school.  They claim that is done to keep the level of talent high.  That may be true, but it is also true that doing so reduces the number of doctors in practice which keeps demand high, work loads high and consequently, pay high.  Then they go one step further and restrict the number of residencies to the point that graduates have can have a very hard time one acquiring one, further choking off the pipeline of adding doctors to the work force.  Not only that, many resident's salaries are funded by Medicare and Medicaid, both strapped for cash.  

Then there is the high cost of medical school which keeps lower income people out of the pipeline, further restricting the supply of candidates.

Then there is the corporatization of medicine which is driving private practice physicians out of business and forcing them to work as employees.  This results in a monopolization of the practice of medicine turning it into another Wall Street ploy.    

And now we are in a pandemic and there are nowhere near enough doctors to handle the load.  There is no reserve capacity.  Doctors are so overworked and understaffed that they are closing up shop or just leaving.

Medicine has made its own bed and all of us are suffering for it."
2020-11-16 12:05:25,"This timely article gets at one of the most disastrous costs of the pandemic's mishandling in the USA: utterly decimating our heavily-trained healthcare workforce from COVID-19 exposure, attrition and severe exhaustion, and why new lockdowns are now inevitable. In the Pacific Northwest we've been hearing horror stories of nurses, doctors, PA's and other health care personnel working 50 hours straight or more, 125 hours a week to deal with the overwhelming wave of COVID patients on top of flu and other medical issues, even as administration increases their workload of documentation and billing. I know many physicians and they're saying this unmanageable stress and load are literally killing them (it's been proven in studies to damage their cells and tissues), even causing them to fall asleep at the wheel from exhaustion.

Yet it's even worse in states like the Dakotas, Oklahoma and Iowa where foolish governors and politicians (all Republican) fail to issue even common-sense mask mandates and restrictions, causing an explosion in new cases and an ever-accelerating wave of cases. Even more than the fatigue, it's this sense of demoralization and futility--that they're expendable political pawns--that's doctors to quit for good. These short-sighted GOP politicians fail to realize that their uncontrolled COVID-19 is causing their state economies to crash anyway, and devastating their healthcare workforce, a highly-trained and irreplaceable resource. And we're all paying the price."
2020-11-16 12:07:31,"It doesn’t surprise me at all that medical professionals are taking a year or two off because of the stress and anger.

2020-11-16 12:12:59,The arithmetic of this should set off alarm bells galore. I’m now in my 10th of 11 years of medical training. You can’t flip a switch and make new physicians overnight.
2020-11-16 12:19:18,"Just as soldiers don’t leave the military when a war breaks out, why would doctors abandon their posts during a pandemic? I agree we need to provide these doctors with all the resources they need, and that’s not being done. Let’s focus on getting them what they need. But as for me in the future, if I find a doctor who took a hiatus between 2020-2021...I will not put my trust in him or her because I know that of things get difficult, they won’t stick around."
2020-11-16 12:29:55,"As a Nurse Practitioner/Nurse-midwife, the pressures of practice lead me to academia prior to COVID. Billing, reimbursement, the number of clients to see, long hours, call hours, malpractice and our “fee for service” system all led to burnout. 

I live in a state where Nurse-practitioners do not have full practice authority. Our Governor, like Governors in many states, gave an executive order to allow NP’s full practice authority during The pandemic.  (Which has an expiration date). 

NP’s, if granted full practice authority, can open practices and serve in those remote and rural counties where there are provider shortages. The number of physicians is dwindling. We need Nurse Practitioners and Nurse-Midwives to help treat the population. But in many states, NPs and CNMs are legally restricted from practicing to the fullest extent of their education, certification, and scope of practice. 

NPs and CNMs are a crucial part of the healthcare team. Have we as a nation not learned that we need preventative care? The American people need access to care and there is literally an army of certified providers in dozens of states who are restricted from
Autonomous practice. NPs and CNMs can help reduce the health care disparities seen in the US."

2020-11-16 12:19:50,"Like all frontline workers in the pandemic, heath care professionals have been treated like  they are expendable. Pressed to work inhuman hours under unnecessarily unsafe conditions and expected to endure unrelenting high levels of stress, they need to say ENOUGH. Their physical and mental health - and their very lives - should not be sacrificed while the Trump administration, governors, and far too many of Americans downplay the danger of COVID. Maybe some surgically precise strikes would get their attention, preferably while the virus deniers, anti-maskers, and adherents of “natural immunity” need care."
2020-11-16 11:46:49,"These are the servants that are on my mind each time I witness a verbal assault on mask-wearing.  The physicians, nurses, ancillary providers (respiratory therapists, physical therapist) who entered their fields of study because they wanted to make a difference and save lives are effectively trashed on the altar of personal freedom.  They, on the other hand, have precious little personal freedom in their vocation and are often faced with the decision to 'do or die'. I would shutter too given that fateful choice."
2020-11-16 12:07:32,"Wear a mask. Keep your distance. Wash your hands. Health care professionals have been telling us to do these things since early March.

2020-11-16 12:12:39,"How difficult it must be to work in this terrible environment of COVID-19.  We certainly can understand that human beings can only handle so much stress until it just becomes too much--with no assured end at this time.  How sad it must be for those medical  professionals to watch this president refuse to wear masks, refuse to inspire the nation to wear masks and stay home, and continues to hold his virus-spreading rallies.  He says he takes no responsibility.  Nor do all those people who continue to attend those gatherings, with no consideration for the doctors and nurses who are exhausted from caring for the infected who are so sick and dying.  Having to wear a mask would be infringing on their freedom!  God bless all of the medical profession who care for us.  THANK YOU!

It was very apparent they had gotten up for work, gotten ready, and were dropping in the streets. It had to be a severe respiratory illness. More investigation at that time confirmed the cause was unknown. Being in healthcare simply endangered myself and my family to a degree I could not tolerate. As the story says, I feel on my sword for my family. I don't regret it. I don't know if I'll ever return."

I am neither a doctor or nurse. I am a retired lobbyist who personally witnessed the chess moves and mob hits of the players who eventually determined for all of us the current policy, now failing, that rules our everyday lives. And deaths, especially if we can't come up with the money to covour medical expenses.

Medical maloractice  Look at the German model and save billions of ""health care"" expenses, by removing the flow of money into the plaintiff's bar industry. 
Administrative costs  Look at Taiwan. There every individual receives a smart chip embedded card for medical usage. All medical and pharmaceutical information is contained therein. One swipe gives the practicioner all the necessary data. At the conclusion of the appointment another swipe delivers full payment.
Look at the Swiss model for at least a preliminary reform of drug costs. The Swiss authorities called in the CEO's of the several Drug Companies headquartered there. They were apprised of the fact that significantly more was spent on marketing and advertising than on research and development. Cutting those costs meant lower drug prices immediately."
2020-11-16 14:22:04,"okay, first this story was on the front page, now relegated to the science section.

   there have been periods of nursing when the u.s. had to recruit nurses from phillipines (sp?)or from eastern european countries like romania.  they had language deficits that were difficult for them to overcome but they did.
  nursing professors have to have a doctorate to teach.  most of them are either dead or unavailable anymore to teach. yes there are PAs , and nurse practitioners but many of them dont do the care on the floors and ICUs or in nursing homes except to do rounds.  
  many of them are working 12 to 14 hr shifts. also many nurses have died.  at least 2000 health care workers have died. respiratory therapists, docs, nurses, nurses aides, emts and many who keep our health care systems running.  where is compassion for them."
2020-11-16 14:22:42,"This is one of my greatest fears during the pandemic.  That my wonderful and caring doctors will be unable to continue in their practices due to financial hardship and unavoidable burnout.

Even if our country throws them another lifeline with financial aid, it's unlikely to stem the tide of closures or stress-related burnout.

We weren't prepared for this pandemic and we've continually undervalued our doctors, nurses, medical professionals and support staff.

It's time to reevaluate and for us to create a new healthcare model that treats all people, doesn't put anyone in the poor house and adequately compensates our doctors and nurses, not the insurance industry."
2020-11-16 14:31:06,"The issue of burnout for our medical folks has been on my mind since the coverage of the CV appeared regarding the situations in Italy and then NYC in the spring.  Highly skilled, experienced, compassionate practitioners of all levels are the definition of a valuable, finite resource.  We can't just manufacture more overnight, or in a month.

While our healthcare system in the U.S. may be maligned by many, most can agree that doctors and (especially the) nurses provide a decent, consistent level of care and comfort to the infirm.  

A nation, for whatever reason(s) one can identify that does not heed warnings and attempt to take care of itself is placing an undue burden on those who have made their life's work to care for others.  This is a travesty."
2020-11-16 14:36:38,"Just before COVID hit, I visited my wonderful doctor of ten years duration.  I'd been watching her caring face grow increasingly tense as she struggled to keep up with the pressures corporatized medicine had foisted on her.  Shorter visits, an electronic screen to look at instead of me.  These unrealistic expectations were starting to cause her to miss details that she would never have otherwise.  
How I wish we could evade the Wall Street- ization of healthcare and have some form of the medicine that all other advanced  nations have."
2020-11-16 14:57:39,"Medicine is, after all, a business as we are told. This is to be expected. The important people in the medical business are CEOs, and administrators, not doctors or RNs and certainly not patients. These empty suits who never went to Med school, took a nite  of call or made a tough decision are interested on return on investment or protecting their tax exempt status. The poor worker bees are just getting in the way of this. I’d love to see a comparison of how many hospital administrators vs health care providers who have been killed by covid. AFA all these practices closing and people retiring, the market place has spoken."
2020-11-16 15:00:29,"I am a hospital based clinical medical technologist. Loved my job, spending time with patients was my joy. I do not plan to return to a clinical setting, probably ever.

2020-11-16 15:08:03,"As with so many other things, Covid accelerated pre existing trends. The independent medical group models are not sustainable. The hospital systems have all the advantages of scale and can deliver care more cheaply and effectively - even if patient and care providers are united in their disdain for such systems."
2020-11-16 14:56:30,I have to go to doctors to fix what other doctors have done to me just from practicing lazy medicine.

2020-11-16 14:31:43,"The medical industry sold itself to the insurance industry and we are receiving medical care from a green lizard who speaks with an Australian accent and like melania doesn’t care. It is about making profits for their shareholders and is increasingly disassociated from health.

2020-11-16 15:32:59,"I am struck once again at how all the disparate dots are related: anyone reading this article should be even more compelled to help the Democrats win in Georgia and help give the Biden/Harris Administration the political and legislative resources that are critical to saving independent medical practices and preventing the widespread burnout and retirements of men and women who have been heroic in the face of tRump's utter disdain and dismissal of anything to do with actually governing and leading America through its pandemic crisis.

And then perhaps with a better-managed pandemic response, the underlying problems in our health care system can also begin to be addressed.

Instead of a Senate incapable of legislating under McConnell, we need a Senate with a Democratic majority -- or else America is heading over an economic cliff, as well as suffering from a medical crisis of ever-rising proportion - vaccine or not."
2020-11-16 15:33:04,"Well before the pandemic, tectonic shifts were occurring in the practice of medicine; two in particular. Hospitals were merging, trying to achieve economies of scale. At the same time, to firm up referral sources, the hospitals were buying up private practices from doctors who wanted to be independent, but the frustrations of maintaining a private practice made working for a paycheck an preferable, if not inevitable, alternative. So today most medical practices are owned by a hospital corporation. Before the pandemic many doctors have told me that the primary reason doctors who could are retiring and the reason is office technology. Many doctors who made their bones in a paper world are having difficulty adapting to a digital world, which also motivates them to sell their practice to a big medical center which can provide the technology, the coding and so forth which the doctors hate to do. Readers who live in cities might find this hard to believe but I can tell you that for years now docs have constantly expressed frustration at today's practice of medicine, such as having to carry a laptop in to patients instead of quickly flipping through a familiar chart. I remember a time when the doctors ran the hospital, often through an organized medical staff; now it seems the other way around."
2020-11-16 15:42:21,"Yes, the financial, mental, and physical stresses of the pandemic have taken their toll, and many physicians have quit medicine, or are looking to sell their practices to hospitals or large health care networks.
However, even before the pandemic some doctors have left practice because of their severe disaffection for the changes that have taken place in medical practice.  
Over the past two decades, medicine has slowly lost its humanitarian roots. Insurance companies have intruded and exerted undue influence on how doctors practice and how they are paid. Clearly, they have put a business- orientated blueprint on how doctors are paid, that forces them to see large numbers of patients to make a decent living. This cuts into the time they need to talk to and examine their patients; many of whom complain that their doctors seem distracted and rushed.
The biggest intrusion is the electronic health record system that insurers pressure doctors to use. It is distracting and time-consuming, and can even lead to medical errors.  It was intended to improve health care by making doctors accountable for their care and outcomes, but has done nothing to improve patient care. It does nothing but add administrative drudgery to physicians’ work. 
It is hard enough for doctors to keep up with new knowledge and taking care of patients, but insurers have made it so difficult that some doctors, like myself have quit practice."

2020-11-16 15:57:18,"This will be the end of caring medical care as the US has known it through the last half of the 20th century.  The for-profit medicine model had resulted in a significant reduction in quality care in the US as related to other advanced nations before the pandemic.

As a medical student in the 1970's at one of the best medical schools in the country, I never heard a single staff member/mentor say anything about money.  It was all 'above all, do no harm'.  The researchers who found insulin and penicillin did not have patents on them.  Medicine was not a way to make money.  It was a profession that expected society would compensate them well depending on the good that was done for society.

This started changing in the mid 1990's.  By the time I retired it was in flagrant bull horn stage.  No one can be paid enough to do what the trump administration has asked them to do.  Risk their lives and the lives of their families by pouring accelerant on a national epidemic and not even pretend to protect the medical personnel with adequate supplies.

The surviving medical industry is going to be a much more profit driven parasite of the society than is the military industrial complex.  

It is going to be a bumpy ride."
2020-11-16 16:13:01,"I know two ER doctors, two ICU doctors, and one anesthesiologist who retired in May.  My GP switched over to a concierge service, which I can not afford.

It's a ton of experience walking out the door."
2020-11-16 16:32:22,"Good riddance!  It's hard to have much respect for physicians who are quitting now in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Unfortunately, each one took up a slot in medical school that could have been used by a student devoted to the practice of medicine.
I'll bet that none of these quitters ever considered spending a year or two in national service or in helping in a third-world country."

Their response is as predictable as it is regrettable."
2020-11-16 16:45:23,"The National Academy of Medicine has made clinician well being a priority even before the pandemic, now it’s even worse. One of the identified problems is all the time clinicians DON’T spend with patients doing documentation. I work in the home health environment and it is ridiculous how little time we spend with patients and how much time we spend on Medicare mandated documentation. The vast majority of which is not related to the reason the doctor asked me to go see the person in their home. When I am able I’m retiring because the bureaucracy of healthcare has taken away the “meaningfulness” of the work for me."
2020-11-16 17:04:49,"I was just discharged from a short stay at UW Hospitals for a non-COVID emergency condition. My care was substantially substandard because of COVID. This included 13 hours on a gurney in the ER hallway screaming in pain before I could receive adequate pain meds and be admitted to a room, because they were in short supply due to COVID. When finally admitted, I continued to receive substandard care—pain meds not given with adequate frequency, meals brought hours late, no gown or toiletries offered for 24 hours after admission. 

While in bed at UW Hospitals, I watched a national news broadcast from outside the hospital reporting how the hospital was being overcome by COVID patients. I received a letter from my insurance company the morning after discharge stating that all claims were denied because the hospital did not state why I was admitted. Hm, maybe the hospital is a bit busy right now? They’ll probably get to it eventually. The cruelty of that letter stunned me. The insurance industry exists to deny you what you are paying them for. But, I digress.

I don’t blame the healthcare workers at UW Hospital. They were kind and caring and did their best under horrifying conditions. I hope no one else has to suffer like this, but if you need emergency hospital services right now, be prepared for it."
2020-11-16 11:53:20,My SO is in the medical profession. He too is considering calling it quits.  This is another slow motion coup is process. But this one is legitimate and entirely legal.   Medical professionals are no longer interested in risking their lives for stupid people who won't wear a mask because it is their personal right not too.  It's the professional personal right to also want to work and not risk their lives when it can be almost totally avoided.

2020-11-16 17:18:23,"When I chose my career path years before COVID-19 emerged, I knew it was the only specialty wherein I would be able to serve patients and survive being a doctor.

2020-11-16 17:47:31,"I work as an ER Doc and remember following COVID very early/closely to the point where people were telling me I was driving them crazy talking about it!  At the beginning I advised many that if they wanted to quit they should do so before things got bad.  A couple of my co-workers left.  One was pregnant and I was happy for her decision because I was worried for her.  Most of us stayed.  ER work can be imperfect to say the least, but I feel I have a commitment to my community to stay and do the best I can.  That all said, I have never judged those who have left in any way as front-line medical work can be a real suffering, and I pray for the end of this pandemic as well as for true peace in our country."

2020-11-16 18:03:15,"There are basically 3 kinds of insurance in the USA. Medicare, private insurance and Medicaid. Medicare sets costs its the biggest payer. Next private insurance which is still mostly attached to your job for profit. And lastly Medicaid which is based on low income. The ability to buy cheaper private insurance and expanded Medicaid happened with the ACA.  Private insurance has fought tooth and nail to stay our primary insurance for profit.  I think a few senators from the south come from either those big insurance owner families or hospital chains. Now we have a pandemic. Our system is for profit. And strangely because of massive lay offs and catering to a few types of diagnosis most private insurers have still made a profit. Medicare by the way pays 80% and has a monthly fee that comes directly out of your social security or disability. The rest is paid by current taxpayers. Medicare is heavily subsidized by the USA government using current workers taxes. There is no savings account. Also just since we are on the subject Women although live longer and have children use half yes half of the money men use for health care. Men have have more serious illness and when they have an illness they cost more. Plus they have more accidents and injuries overall. Most not work related. I can see unless we have a public option on the ACA all private clinics will be closed with no profit. Telehealth doesnt work for most things.  Say good by to health care in non profit areas ie the country."
2020-11-16 18:15:44,"Once upon a time, long, long ago, my brother on the faculty of Yale Medical School at the time, referred my to a physician in Manhattan.  It was a whole different standard of care.

If I had a 10 am appointment, he saw me at 10 am.   Not at 9:59 and not at 10:01.  He spoke with me in his office, examined me, and then we spoke again in his office.  Of course, he only saw two patients per hour, but he really took care of his patients.  And lab tests and consults merely served to confirm what he had already learned from his examinations.  He ran his practice with only one person in the office.  He is the model of who we want as a physician.

He retired in the covid-19 pandemic."

2020-11-16 21:04:37,"I think if this pandemic had occurred 30 years ago, doctors would not be walking out in such numbers.  I didn't work back then, but clearly things in medicine were much better in the old days.
Morale prior to Covid was not good.  Doctors everywhere were dissatisfied; having become cogs in a corporate wheel designed to maximize profits for hospital administrators and insurance companies.  We had lost our autonomy and decision making capabilities.  
So the baseline is a bunch of demoralized docs and nurses and here comes Covid.  Now the same hospital administrator who is always hounding you about whether you saw enough patients (and is doing this while making double your salary) is suddenly appealing to your humanity: ""First of all, we are cutting your salary because hospital revenue is down.  Second, it's your duty to serve patients.  Go work on the Covid wards even though you're a dermatologist. Society needs you!""
While those sentiments may all be true, doctors are expected to function in this perverse system as money machines and then convert to altruist mode when the situation gets sticky.  This is why doctors are upset and they're finally calling it quits.
You can't have it both ways."

Those who went into medicine for money probably are not the kind of physicians you want.
And those physicians who truly care about their patients probably don't make the right amount of money for all their work in the current system.

Funny how the populace has grudges against healthcare workers when most truly care about giving their best for their patients."

Our practice has seen a surge in stress.  The primary stressor is our patients.  

They have grown increasingly rude, dismissive of sound medical advice, and, in many cases, delusional.  Trump's encouragement to flagrantly disregard expert medical advice that patients find inconvenient or unpleasant has made things significantly worse.  Now every opinion is not just equal to a physician's, it is superior.  And the patients can't wait to tell you how it is. 

Some days, it is everything I can do not to blow them out of the intelectual water and expose their absolute delusional thinking and general stupidity.  It would be easy and, I suspect, very satisfying.  

Instead, I tolerate it for as long as I can (in the name of professionalism), hoping they'll come around, before just discharging them from the clinic."

This confirms her belief that the Governor is a dictatorial idiot bent on destroying the state’s economy.  So there you have it. 

I cannot wrap my head around her anger and how the response to the pandemic got so politicized.

While I understand the dedication, hardwork and committment required to complete medical school and residencies, I find far too many doctors to be greedy, self-serving and compassionless. Dedication to healing and helping others is secondary to having five luxury cars, large homes, exotic vacations and a healthy stock portfolio. I actually had a neurosurgeon complain with genuine seriousness, that his income tanked with Obamacare and doctors are now nothing more than 'workers', hourly wage earners, employees. When I asked him what someone like me was supposed to do when I needed healthcare, he said just go to an ER at a public hospital. I watched him pull out of the parking lot in a 100K Maserati. I've read the Hippocratic Oath (both versions) and I don't recall seeing anything about country club memberships, expensive watches and large bank accounts.

Interesting article and interesting comments. I'm a self-employed Chiropractic Physician in rural downstate IL. 

My best wishes to all of the Medical personnel dealing with the Rona on the front lines. 

I've been absolutely loving every day of practice since August 1st (other than all the sanitizing and mask wearing).  We're as busy as we desire to be.  Since I'm spacing patients farther apart time wise than pre-Corona I'm spendind fewer 8 hour days and more 11 hour days at the clinic.  I'm anything but burned out after 27 years of practice and after 24 years of self-employed solo practice.  I'm truly blessed to have a job, to be in demand and to be living my passion. 

Stay safe out there, folks.  Admittedly we have had 40+ patients cancel since August 1st due to awaiting results of Rona Testing, possibly being exposed or quarantining for other reasons."

At the beginning of our global pandemic - what did our government focus on? Rescuing the stock market & corporations with access to unlimited funds back in March - it worked - for now - especially for the $$$Billionaires$$$ who had a record year!

Yet, what about us who live in our cities, states & need access to health care during a pandemic? With 1,000's dying daily for months on end. Our hospitals turned into ER centers trying to keep people alive from a novel virus.

In the year of an election, the President & too many politicians focused on the politics at the cost of our public health & the long term health of the USA!

This is a national tragedy reinforcing what my 84yo immigrant aunt says, ""In the US, it always comes down to money!""

But when you are talking about a bespoke suit or even an off the rack so to speak suit, it is not the cut nor how it is put together.  It is the fabric.  I have a blue/black baby cashmere suit.  It is a special occassion suit as the cashmere likes to rest between wearings.  It is actually an understated fabric, but people who really love mens clothes notice.  Tailors also notice.  They want to feel it, to caress it.  I do myself.   Thankfully the British, French and Italians can weave some fabric that can take your breath away.  And so will its price.  Like a K-50 .

Culture is not to be wasted. We lose a part of ourselves when we lose culture. Culture's many forms are the children of a people. And by that same token, consider that in countries like Britain, and the US, such places house a plethora of cultures.

Note that the men's shirts buttons are on the right side of the shirts and they are on the left side of women's blouses.  WHY - because when people were wealthy enough to afford to have either a shirt or blouse it was common for a woman to have a slave or indentured servant to dress them.

Now ties came about because before buttons, men's clothing came together with ties of material that were tied together down the front of the costume with their private parts showing.  So to be proper, a man had a broad piece of cloth down the front of him so his privates did not show.

Now how did those ladies wearing those bustled dresses that went down to the ground manage to clean themselves after performing #2.  Well they used a stick and the old saying was, ""Don't grab the stick by the greasy end.""

Material of course matters, but the ability to have the fabric fit the person is really a treat.

States have the ability to raise taxes so funding should not be an issue. Cold chain distribution will be a major issue. Pfizer vaccine must be shipped and stored in 1000 dose containers at -94F. Not many facilities have ultra cold freezers, and in MA there is already a shortage of dry ice and the carbon dioxide required to make it. CDC has provided ample notice. States have their collective heads in the sand."

According to wikipedia, this is ""a network in the U.S. of community-based units initiated and established by local organizations to meet the public health needs of their communities. ... As of January 2020, there are 839local MRC units and 175,283 volunteers.[1] MRC units are present in all 50 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., Guam, Palau, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.""

A long time ago I was a volunteer. There was lots of training, and a few practise events. One of its roles was to help in distributing vaccines. 

Through all of this pandemic I've heard about Trump engaging businesses. But not once have I heard mention that the MRC is going to be used. If the government isn't going to use the MRC to aid in this vaccine distribution, then all of the paid employees of the MRC should be laid off and the program terminated."

2020-11-14 20:34:05,"Well, that's an understandable problem. After $800 billion per year for the Department of (War) Defense, there isn't much left. 

I guess the best solution if to have more citizens on Medicare and Social Security die. That will free up additional funding. That can then be forwarded to the States to get the remaining population vaccinated."
2020-11-14 20:57:02,"It’s getting harder and harder to justify sending five figures every year to a federal government that favors rural states over cities and has refused to protect all Americans.

2020-11-14 21:00:14,"This Operation Warp Speed was never about public health.  It is (or was) a PR stunt for Trump to use in his re-election bid.  ‘Look America, I created a vaccine’, he’d declare.  ‘It will be widely available to Americans (except those I dislike)’, he’d boast.  ‘Everyone will get it for free’, he’d promise.  Well Pfizer’s vaccine wasn’t created with OWS funding so there is no certainty of the cost.  Even if effective and affordable, its availability is restricted due to the rigid old chain that must be preserved.  Most major hospitals are not equipped to store it, let alone rural clinics.  So is it any surprise that the States would get any funding to actually inoculate the public?  This is classic Trump.  It’s all smoke and mirrors.  Unfortunately, many people have and will continue to die for one man’s ego."
2020-11-14 21:08:06,"It is likely that COVID will get much worse this winter, and so will its economic impact across the country.  We cannot expect a vaccine to save us.

It is also likely that McConnell will retain control over the Senate in the next Congress.

Congress needs to pass a bill immediately that targets aid to states and localities to help them deal with COVID, as well as to hospitals and public health systems.

We cannot expect Trump to lead on anything, but it is unlikely that he will veto a COVID-related bill in the next 2 months.

After Jan. 20, President Biden will present a coordinated program to control and defeat COVID, and restore the US economy."

Of course, because that's difficult administrative work.  Shoveling public money to your patrons and friends is fun and easy, and who cares about these details."
2020-11-14 21:02:59,"It should be kept in mind that the US manages to vaccinated half the population against flu, so it’s not that much more of a stretch.  And because of the ineptitude of the current administration, which is blatantly obvious from the exponential rise in case numbers, nearly everyone who is going to be infected will be infected by the time the vaccine is widely available – so that reduces the pressure to get it distributed at warp-speed.  Although that isn’t much of a silver lining."
2020-11-14 21:16:34,"If you viewed the front page of the NYT today, you should have noticed that the instances of COVID are rising exponentially. This is not a gradual rise, rather, as the curve bends towards vertical, the number of people infected goes off the scale.

Inexorably, breakdown of all mediate systems will come to a screeching halt as supplies are exhausted and personnel too sick to help. Hospitals will overflow and trailers will be used to store the dead, and the waiting to be dead, because there is no room inside the buildings.

Unlike Trump, math doesn't lie and what we're seeing is a disaster that will make the 1918 Spanish Epidemic look like a flu outbreak in Buffalo.

And the blame for all of this belongs squarely on Trump and those republicans who failed to impeach him, failed to criticize him, and even today, fail to implore him to sign the Defense Production Act and activate a myriad of tools to resolve his crisis."
2020-11-14 20:13:29,This should surprise nobody. Trump wanted to enrich big pharma so he invested billions in big companies owned by his lobbyists. Distributing the vaccine is not his concern as he cares little for the average citizen.
2020-11-14 21:33:51,"Pfizer's press release unscientific announcement of it's allegedly 90% effective vaccine was all about the Benjamins as their CEO quickly sold 60% of his company holdings.

Pfizer's alleged COVID-19 vaccine uses a new m- RNA delivery vaccine method of a portion of spike protein.  It requires two shots. And it degrades at room temperature in 3- 5 dsys. While it maintains it's alleged efficacy for 14 days if stored at -100° F.

None of the Pfizer's representations have been peer reviewed for safety and effectiveness for a lsrge diverse broad based population vis three phased clinical trials over a year or more.

As long as his trade was not made based upon material non- public information and the representation about effectiveness wasn't fraudulent then it was probably lrgal.

But what should really embarrass and shame most Americans is what is legal."
2020-11-14 22:26:02,"It's time for Congress to pass a bipartisan Health Care Emergency Act that will pay all the medical bills for the treatment of the Covid-19 virus, including mental health treatment by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists for survivors, and for the distribution and injections of the vaccine when it's available, and extended and enhanced unemployment benefits.  With cases and deaths skyrocketing this is a national emergency and not the time for partisan political bickering.  Despite all that Trump has done to make it so,Covid is an equally opportunity disease of both Democrats and Republicans and blue states and red states. Congress cannot stand idly by while millions are getting sick and thousands are dying. It's both immoral and irresponsible."
2020-11-14 22:46:44,"Sounds like the  vaccine and the administration of the vaccine will be like everything else about COVID - everybody and every state just does their own thing!  So far that hasn’t worked very well, has it?  

Trump had so much fun negating Cuomo, he and his vaccine associates have not thought much about any of the actual logistics.  Surprise, surprise.  

He just said enough to pat himself on the back - for what will yet to be seen.  And he said it would be free, right?"
2020-11-14 22:56:54,"The agency that has planned vaccine distribution in the past has been the CDC but of course, they were excluded from taking the prime role in pandemic planning starting back in February. You have no idea how complicated distribution is to coordinate even with a cooperative administration."
2020-11-14 22:57:46,"Some jurisdictions are already investing their own state and local money to establish the infrastructure to distribute vaccines. Obviously, states, counties and cities can choose to do as they like instead of continuing depend solely on the federal government to solve each and every problem that arises. One would have thought that would be self-evident eight months into this crisis. It is astounding to see the differences among counties and states in their willingness and ability to come up with their solutions. Unfortunately, many - including governments around DC - have decided to focus their efforts on blaming others for problems they are readily equipped to solve themselves."
2020-11-14 23:15:08,"Is this a surprise ? giving millions or billions of taxpayer money to corporations is never considered welfare, and done with little discussion or oversight, especially if you also happen to own stock or receive donations from those very same beneficiairies.
Public health, on the other hand, is considered welfare with all the GOP/Libertarian’s negative connotations, even though it is the first and critical step in reviving the economy."
2020-11-14 23:34:52,"It seems clear from the way in which Mr. Trump has politicized what should be an apolitical response to a national health crisis,--even stooping to emphasize that New York State would not be receiving the vaccine--that confidence in a safe and effective Corona Virus vaccine, rushed to approval in order to aid his re-election-- may take more than his ability to ensure it. I am a nearly 72 year old retired physician who will not be rushing out to receive the vaccine until I am reasonably sure it is safe. I have been fortunate so far, in avoiding infection, by adhering to the CDC recommendations of wearing a mask, washing my hands as directed and avoiding large gatherings and unnecessary travel."
2020-11-14 23:51:13,"This article, to me, proves how badly we need to revamp the government..  Why should corporations that are for profit only be the ones working on the vaccine.  I don't want to see Bill Gates or any other self interest group given money for it.  It should be developed at Universities and distributed through a government agency or even better some non profit. The money they have given the Pharmaceutical companies could have easily done this."
2020-11-15 00:15:00,"This article talks about distribution logistics and challenges, but what about manufacturing/ production of vaccine?  Once a vaccine is approved, how are the companies going to produce the x millions (billions?) of doses needed??"
2020-11-15 00:36:04,The virus is spreading nearly out of control.  At this rate we will all be infected before we get a vaccination.  Shopping for Thanksgiving and Christmas will feel like a nightmare.
2020-11-15 01:12:23,"I’m skeptical of the RNA vaccines because of the cooling requirements. The need for ultracold freezers throughout the transport chain, as well as enough dry ice once out of a freezer, seriously limits the locations that can offer the vaccine - not to mention actually getting patients in for both doses. Those issues seemingly make the RNA vaccines suitable for deployment to contained populations (e.g. healthcare workers and prisoners), but not the general public hoping to get a shot at CVS after work."
2020-11-15 01:47:14,How many people will refuse the vaccine simply because the government is tracking them in a database?

It would be possible to accurately measure the costs and trace the results. Right now, Trump is standing in the way.  Soon it will be Biden standing in the way. So what is the real problem?"
2020-11-14 22:26:21,"I watch CNBC from 4-7am every day and the vaccine has been covered extensively since April with Moderna, Pfizer scientists with Meg Tirell, etc.very informative. Ironically Wuhan China was covered extensively by Eunice Yoon on CNBC last December and nobody cared(Dem or Rep) except for 2 loutish Senators(both Rep) who dumped their stock holdings.  The other channels(CNN, FOX, MSNBC, PBS, Networks)think if the talk about Trump all day the are reporting ""news"" but in the case of Wuhan and Vaccine they have failed the public. I watched the""60 minutes"" and ""overtime"" with General Perna and the military distribution logistics plan last Sunday and am confident the vaccines will get to the state.  In Connecticut there is a plan(download of 77 pages..easy to do) and I believe every state has the similar plan.  The money must be provided regardless of debt incurred and we will be somewhat OK but wearing masks through the year and if we can stimulate travel and entertainment we can rebuild airlines, hospitality, sport, entertainment, restaurants, college, schools and get our country rolling again.  I never voted for Trump but the myopic coverage of Trump and even these comments who all mention Trump are part of the problem.  He is gone soon, and he did help(a little) with the vaccine.  Now is the time to forget about this and move forward..educate the public to take the vaccine and move heaven and earth to get it to the right people in the right sequence."

""The study also will evaluate the potential for the vaccine candidate to provide protection against COVID-19 in those who have had prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as vaccine prevention against severe COVID-19 disease. In addition to the primary efficacy endpoints evaluating confirmed COVID-19 cases accruing from 7 days after the second dose, the final analysis now will include, with the approval of the FDA, new secondary endpoints evaluating efficacy based on cases accruing 14 days after the second dose as well.""

Unless I am mistaken, the 90% effectiveness was obtained from participants in the study who had a mild case of covid-19.  The study has not yet evaluated the vaccine effectiveness on people susceptible to severe case of covid-19:  people with comorbidity, genetic mutation that prevent the immune system from mounting an adequate response to the invader, and older people.  Also, the 90% effectiveness was only recorded a week after the the second dose was administered.
Basically, the 90% effectiveness is unlikely to apply to everyone and may not be achievable in the real world where you cannot cherry pick your patient/study's participant."
2020-11-15 00:00:54,"This is the essence of Trump's best effort. He throws money (taxpayer's money, btw) at a problem, has the recipients race each other for the win (shades of The Apprentice), but has no strategy, no follow-through, no sense of logistics and the complications of a task. Any task. His majesty hires no-nothings who have never been involved with similar projects themselves, and decrees, ""Make it so,"" in less Trekkie lingo. Then he bows and waves to the masses waiting to pay homage to his goodness and brilliance. 

But those hosannas don't last long, because the project collapses entirely--or serves a fistful of his cronies--because of the details. What about the details, you ask? There are none. He has no taste for the nitty-gritty, doesn't even ask questions. So the big roll-out comes and Trump claims a massive victory for himself. More ventilators than any country on earth! Thanks to him. More masks! Perfect, free tests on demand for everyone! He's the best! 

Same with this vaccine initiative, it seems. As usual, the billions given to the manufacturers came from taxpayers. Congress wasn't involved. The logistics is handled by...the army? Will the army give our local communities the freezers to keep those vaccines fresh? How about vials and all the rest of that unimportant stuff? Maybe Biden's team can fix this up, but we'd be foolish to rely on the currently installed crew. They're consistently inept."

They have the empathy and skills, but, our so-called national ""leadership"" has denied them the money and the tools to help people stave off evictions and keep food on the table. 

January 21st cannot come too soon.

2020-11-14 23:21:18,"Haven't you heard or noticed yet? The states have been and remain essentially all on their own to figure out what to do, and how to get what they need. The federal government washed its hands of any responsibility months ago. 

And 72+ millions applauded this absurd, suicidal, policy.  

Though I suppose it's also conceivable that because of 
diligent journalism like that of  this article, congress may 
act to minimize these problems of state distribution of vaccines between now and January. But who really knows. Since it's complicated and time is of the essence.

This structural funding of priorities absurdity  is called sound management that tens of millions of voted fo. They had no clue then, and they'll always have no clue why they can't get

By spring, memories of the experience these past four years having been while  trapped inside trump's foul and chaotic mind  will have quickly dissipated.

Will there be anyone capable of explaining this situation to them? Will any of them listen or believe what they'll hear?

Way back in the 1960's they developed the Sabin polio vaccine.  It was far superior to the existing Salk version.  Consequently, the decision was made to provide this vaccine on a mass distribution basis.

Within a few weeks this distribution was organized and implemented nationwide.  I remember lining up with my parents and siblings at the local high school to get the vaccine.

It is dumbfoundingly astonishing that *ANY* Republican politician - no names please - wouldn't now instantaneously commit publicly to *immediately* voting for conviction were President Trump to be impeached a 2nd time.

Having received three surgeries, a hip replacement and two cataracts, in the last year from superb surgeons under Carte Vitale, I can attest to the competence of French medicine.

In 1965 Lyndon Johnson began the MediCare program for over 65’s in America. His original intention was to have MediCare provide a national health program from birth to death, but was unable to pay for it due to the cost of the American war in Vietnam.

58,000 Americans died in Vietnam and the burden of that unnecessary war included lost health care for millions of citizens."
2020-11-15 04:45:57,The effort to distribute and vaccinate the nation will be another complex and difficult task but hospitals ( I know this for sure about NY-Presbyterian) are gearing up as are pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies. This will be a more difficult task than other vaccine programs since the epidemics before were not as pervasive or as lethal as this is and the vaccination programs easier. The ingenuity and skill and energy that produced therapeutics and a vaccine in an incredibly record time should not be underestimated with the vaccination effort. This nation surprised the world in WW2 with its response after Pearl Harbor. I do not doubt there will be chaotic times ahead and ugly incidents with obtaining a life and death vaccine for 330 million people but we will accomplish it. Remember therapeutics were dismal with HIV from 1983 to 1993!! and there is still no vaccine. Only a cockeyed optimist would expect this massive effort to go flawlessly but it will succeed.
2020-11-15 05:20:41,"Was the Sabin vaccine superior to the Salk vaccine?

""Way back in the 1960's they developed the Sabin polio vaccine.  It was far superior to the existing Salk version.""

I got both. I remember asking my mother, just  before we got the Sabin vaccine: ""Why did we get shots last year, and this year they give it to us on a sugar cube?"" Her answer: ""The sugar-cube version wasn't out last year."" 

I also asked why we needed another vaccination, since we'd had one the year before. I don't remember her answer, but it was NOT because the Sabin vaccine was better than the Salk vaccine. Was it better?

The reported Pfizer vaccine results are encouraging for a second reason. Even the people who got a placebo didn't get  COVID-19 much -- roughly 1/5 of 1%, combined -- 94 out of nearly 44,000. I'd thought the number was much higher: 2-3%, certainly not 1/5 of 1%. The big ""vaccine news"" was that only 9 people got the virus who'd received the vaccine, but even the people who got the placebo didn't get sick very often. Very encouraging."
2020-11-15 05:20:50,"I observe from here in Australia, the country with no doubt the best universal public health system in the world and no virus cases for about a fortnight that even before a vaccine becomes available to our twenty six million people we have just about beaten the virus. Did we have lock downs? Yep, did business and individuals comply? Yep. Did it affect the economy? Not much after government stimulus and our economy is bouncing back quickly but our bounce will be sustainable because there is no virus. I'm also a lot more confident of getting a  vaccination and for free when it becomes available than I would if I lived in your country as our government has already paid up front for enough vaccine for the population. Goodness you even had to pay for tests in your country. For the richest country in the world you sure don't put the wealth to use in a way that develops a united society, that is obvious from our TV screens every night."

""All of the vaccine distribution logistics and costs should have been included in operation warp speed!""

Even Pfizer said this. It denied that the U.S. government (or anyone else) funded its development, but Pfizer admitted that it will receive $1.95 billion to distribute the vaccine.

The real question is why weren't development costs funded by the U.S. government. In most cases, they were. Not so with Pfizer, but I don't worry very often about Pfizer; it will do just fine without government funding."
2020-11-15 06:46:48,"""The government has sent billions to drug companies to develop a coronavirus shot but a tiny fraction of that to localities for training, record-keeping and other costs for vaccinating citizens.""

This kind of response seems par for the course with the Trump administration - make a big splash with cash in hopes of a vaccine could be developed and manufactured but not caring, considering nor even being bothered with the pesky details like ""training, record-keeping and other costs for vaccinating citizens"" at the local level.  

Not paying any attention to the logistics and details to the distribution of this vaccine is not unlike how the Trump administration approached the pandemic from the beginning.  There was never any organized plan of action to address the critical shortage of PPE materials which health care workers across the country have been begging for from the start.  Now, nine months later, there continues to be a vast and alarming shortage of PPE.

The Trump administration never cared nor wanted to be bothered with the details because they haven't a clue how the process should or has worked in the past.

Honestly, this administration's denial and then grossly inept response to the pandemic since February is indicative of how poorly the process of vaccinating people will be.  It's almost as if their priorities were with drug companies and no one else."

2020-11-15 10:13:54,"I recall President Trump wanted to have a uniform policy across all states to give guidelines and implement solutions. The pushback from the state's Governors was quick, fierce and non-negotiable. Nor did this paper support it - dig back into your stories before opinionating your reports. So what we are faced with are 50 different non-coordinated policies finger pointing at each other and pointing back at the Feds. From what I gleaned from the media - reported or not or simply hidden from us is that there will be distribution with assists from the military to designated sites - mostly public that is fairly accessible to most citizens in the US. In rural areas, the National Guard  will have it's role to do so in their states. Writing stories that are deliberately and continually negative serve to scare the citizenry and no longer serves the public what they are entitled to, honest, unbiased news that they can plan and make decisions to address their needs. The vaccine has been announced and I would hasten to add that reporting on the suggestions to improve what is being done and what your readers should do or watch out for  is what I want to hear instead of the constant war drumming to fight your ideological foes. It sells papers short term but you better get ready to get honest about who you supported right along."
2020-11-15 10:34:47,"Florida tends to be about 20% behind Massachusetts in getting flu vaccines, even with Publix Super Markets giving out $10 gift cards with flu shots at its in-store pharmacies.  So maybe there won't be so much demand for the coronavirus vaccines when they arrive.  Then again, our state has lots of infected people, the governor has been following Trump's advice, and Thanksgiving might stuff the hospitals.

At times I've wondered whether the governor (who did run for the office as Trump's best friend) has toed the Trump line obsessively out of fear of getting on the president's bad side and perhaps losing coronavirus funding, which has been extraordinarily helpful.  Trump seems to wield carrots as well as sticks.

This state does not have a strong public health system.  It does have a hospital industry that quickly consolidated behind a few huge chains (locally, Cleveland Clinic).  Smaller counties have Walgreen's, CVS and always Publix.  The state has an accurate vaccination registry, and our hospital has run a large coronavirus testing program. 

Will the state allocate early vaccine supplies fairly?  Judging from very high rates of covid-19 in agricultural workers back in March,  I suspect affluent retirees will get at the head of the line."

I am sure that I am not alone with my concerns."

In third grade, even though I lived in the second largest city in Indiana, I got measles.  And not just me.  I never met one single child in my entire childhood who did not have measles/mumps/chickenpox by 5th grade.  It was a right of passage.  

We have been at this pandemic going on 9+ months now and we are still trying to get folks tested.  Remember how long it took before anyone in your area could get tested?  Have you been tested?  I have not and neither has just about everyone in my building.  

Even if there was a flawless vaccine released tomorrow, it will be a long, long time before we all get it.  The reality is that COVID-19 will be a part of our lives just like measles was for both my brother and I and all of our friends and classmates.  It will be a reality just like AK-47's in the schools or drunk drivers (until auto-driving becomes a reality).  

It really is not difficult at all to don a paper mask before entering a store.  Or to spend more time alone writing that book we always talked about.  

I have had a great lockdown - its my ""Buddha wandering the jungle"" phase of my life and I have spent it working out in my apartment and studying advanced jazz theory.

Nowhere to be found in my area.

Is it really possible that people still don't grasp that nothing we're told about this pandemic ever translates to reality or lived experience? Schools were supposed to require testing and do regular testing as a condition of opening. None in my area do either. If we can't even supply schools with tests, how *exactly* are we getting these vaccines out? W ho is paying for them? What is the plan for the anti-vaxxer movement?

Instead of lavishing over-generous pensions on their armies of often barely working state and local employees, and instead of corrupt state and local politicians lining their pockets and those of their supporters, state and local governments should have operated responsibly to address the real needs of the people in an efficient manner.  Then if some unforeseeable disaster struct, they would have reserves or would have the ability to borrow (and actually to do the unheard of...later repay their loans) to meet their needs.

Instead, the states and cities ever have their hand out for more free money taken from taxpayers in other states.  Meanwhile, their corruption, waste, and inefficiency continue unabated.  And government employees continue retiring early on over-generous pensions."

The exact same policy is carried out by government from the Federal level to local governments. Now we see what happens. The nation struggles for money to handle what nature, being nature, throws at humans by chance. And as we are learning by one particular negative incident just how dangerous not being prepared is. Iron rusts, moving water change landscapes and causes floods, machinery wears out, polluted atmosphere kills, etcetera we are well aware of natures ability to destroy and not one human can be blamed for the negative events that nature brings forward so since we are aware of what nature can do why are we not prepared?

One effect of the 16th Amendment has been to reverse the definition of the word ""apportionment,"" which originally was intended to levy taxes upon the states to fund the national government.  The income tax created by the 16th Amendment obviated that levy, but left intact the obligation to ""apportion"" to the states  revenue from the U.S. Treasury, in direct proportion to the census.

The whining is all on the Republican side of this health issue.  Dems, med. professionals, are wholly rational in how they're addressing the WH debacle handling this natural, national disaster. Repubs and Trumplodites are the ones whining, about scary masks and any rational attempts to contain epicenters of outbreaks.

As to the delivery logistics of a brand new, politicized vaccine; not only are there physical constraints (cold temps demand proper packaging, shipping, and proper storage at point of public contact) but also how to reach diverse, dispersed populations that are at higher risks. Elderly, the poor, rural locales, etc. Who in the more accessible zones get positions at the front of the line? Then there are the security issues. We know wealthier people will pay for a place in the front of the line, while not at risk.

2020-11-14 15:50:50,"""Employers have added almost three million jobs in the last three months,"" We didn't add three million jobs. We restored jobs that were lost. The unemployment rate was under 4%. Now it's about 7%, hardly a cause for celebration. And what about wages? A job isn't worth anything if people can't support themselves. Here we go again. Another four years of bipartisan gridlock. And supposedly third party candidates are the spoilers."
2020-11-14 15:53:51,"Our difficulty is caused by the fact that the vast majority of people do not understand how the federal government pays for things. If you understand that, you see there is little downside to spending. 

Here is the basic fact: 

The Federal government can create as much money as it wants out of thin air. It will NEVER run out of money. 

And here is how it works in practice: Suppose Congress were to pass the Democrats' $3 TRILLION relief bill. As soon as the President signed it, someone at the FED would wander over to a keyboard, hit a few keys, and $3 TRILLION would appear in the Treasury's account. 

It has to be that way. We need the money now. We cannot wait for a tax bill to be passed and the money collected. We can't wait for the Treasury to hold an auction, sell bonds and collect the money. 

Another way to see that the usual idea that the government must tax or borrow to ""pay for it"" is just wrong is that the money to pay the taxes or buy the bonds will not be in the economy until after the bill is passed. First the government spends, Then some of the money is taken back by taxes and selling bonds. The usual description gets the cart before the horse. 

This money will increase the deficit, but it is not ""debt"" in the usual sense. It is owed to nobody. It never has to be repaid. There is no cost to the taxpayer. All that has to be considered is inflation and inflation is running under 1% and the trend line is down. Before you yell ""Weimar"" show me the figures.

2020-11-14 15:59:08,"The complexity hides major problems beyond just the unemployment numbers, which aren't great, just better than we thought.  Evictions, discouraged workers, the unevenness of the recovery to name a few.  Add in that we seem poised for another lockdown and direct cash to the people is what is required.  And not a one time round, but a real guaranteed monthly UBI for the duration of the crisis.

And please stop with the Republicans care about the deficit nonesense.  They ONLY say that when they are out of power."
2020-11-14 16:05:07,"It is likely that COVID will get much worse this winter, and so will its economic impact across the country.  We cannot expect a vaccine to save us.

It is also likely that McConnell will retain control over the Senate in the next Congress.

Congress needs to pass a bill immediately that targets aid to states and localities to help them deal with COVID, as well as to hospitals and public health systems.

We cannot expect Trump to lead on anything, but it is unlikely that he will veto a COVID-related bill in the next 2 months.

After Jan. 20, President Biden will present a coordinated program to control and defeat COVID, and recover the US economy."
2020-11-14 16:26:14,"""Republicans have cited concerns about the record budget deficit in opposing another large round of government spending""

2020-11-14 16:47:49,The content is extremely important. McConnell always wants the lion's share of the aide to go to the rich. Pelosi wants it to go to the people but McConnell doesn't care how much the people have to suffer.
2020-11-14 17:00:55,"Republicans continue to gauge relief efforts by looking in the rear view mirror.  

Sure the economy improved somewhat during the warmer months (not difficult considering the crash that had occurred), but like the virus' daily infection base load going into the winter, the economic toll of this pandemic has created close to 4 million chronically unemployed, myself included; 800,000 to 1 million weekly unemployed and growing, and now new shutdowns and closures being announced across the country.   

One does not have to be an economist to see the impending crash and economic pain on the horizon.

Mr. Biden and Nancy Peolsi would do well to negotiate whatever they can with the Republican Senate now and provide some sort of meager relief for those that face eviction, bankruptcy and ruin.

They can always renegotiate again after 1/20/21 if need be."
2020-11-14 17:05:48,"I'd be interested to see reporting on the concern that Democratic strategists are worried about a compromise bill that the two embattled Georgia Republican Senators can support. Claiming a win there might boost their re-election chances.

Leading Democrats will deny any connection, of course. But what would curious reporters find out?"
2020-11-14 17:38:14,"The economy is not as bad as could be or doing whatever you said.  Corporations are highly leveraged, the Feds spent $7 trillion yes trillions dollars giving 0 percent or low interest to corporations who bought back their stock to raise stock prices and reward shareholders who are mostly millionaires/billionaires and bought corporate bonds to help corporations stick to us while paying CEO bonuses and very high salaries that we would not make in a life time.

2020-11-14 17:45:15,"Government-backed municipal bonds always seemed to me to be an effective response to the republican displeasure of bailing out so-called blue states.  I was happy to see Senator Romney float this idea last month.
 Eventually, states will have to pay off this debt in good times but can enjoy the necessary relief now.  They can also borrow at historically low-interest rates. This proposal can lead to the compromise needed to bridge the gap between republicans and democrats."
2020-11-14 17:46:16,"Think about Georgia and their upcoming election to determine which party controls the Senate. Democrats can argue that only they will restore the economic well being of our nation by bringing relief for the unemployed and for states and communities, and then bring wide spread prosperity through the projects advocated by President-elect Biden,(and, of course, a host of other issues).
Now consider the Republicans telling the voters of Georgia how they forced the Democrats to cave, providing the ""right"" amount of relief, and how if they keep control of the Senate, they will make sure the Democrats do not waste tax payer's money with unnecessarily large expenditures."
2020-11-14 17:58:53,"The case for a huge stimulus bill that sends checks to everyone and hands out funds to businesses with no accountability (as the CARES Act did) is not that strong.

2020-11-14 18:15:12,"Republicans were all on board to pass a huge stimulus spending plan when they thought it would save the economy for a Trump victory. Now that Biden is coming into office they are willing to let the economy crash hoping he gets the blame. 

Democrats should play political hardball, let the economy get so bad that the American people demand action and the Republicans are forced to accept a real stimulus plan that will help more than just their corporate cronies."

1.  COVID-19 hospitalizations have not gone down by at least 20% (compared to the current number)

2.  COVID-19 deaths have not been reduced by at least 20%

3.  COVID-19 positivity rate has not been reduced by at least 20% in most states

The unemployed need help now. The coronavirus vaccine rollout needs funding now. Small businesses that can be expected to survive long-term need help now."
2020-11-14 18:46:44,"I suggest that you all might try walking a mile in the shoes of independent restaurants and other small businesses that are hanging on by a thread.    If you will be happy with the option of going to either Taco Bell or McDonalds for your restaurant options when the pandemic ends then stay the course, because that is where we will be.     40 years in the restaurant business and watching multiple colleagues close their doors each week.     Surviving on 25% or less of our modeled revenue creates unsustainable losses."

Message 1:  ""Please give me another month to pay the rent because I need the stimulus funds which Congress has promised by the middle of December.""

Message 2:  ""Please give me another three months to pay the rent because I need the stimulus funds which Congress will be able to agree to after Joe Biden takes office on January 20.""

Which message is more effective?

Did you say Message 1?  Then you understand why we need to do SOMETHING now, and perhaps more after January 20.

Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley should be ashamed of writing such a slanted article.  For example, they say:

""The need is particularly acute among historically disadvantaged groups that have been hit hardest by the recession."" 

That is irrelevant.  This is an emergency.  We need action.

It illustrates how Congress can be so ineffective.  Instead of acting, the Democrats and Republicans each take nonnegotiable positions, appear on the talk shows touting their particular proposal.  And nothing actually gets done.

We've seen this story play out many times.  Congress gets deadlocked.  They shut down the government for a week or more.  People are furloughed.

Then politicians get on the talk shows and hawk their hate speech against the other party.

Down with partisanship!  GET SOMETHING DONE!"

We can replace a president who is seriously ill or “incompetent,”  but not one who encourages Nazis and racists and far right extremists to take over government. We haven’t needed it before now.  I  certainly hope that when the dust finally settles on this election we will take steps to address this. Trump should be removed RIGHT NOW because he’s fomenting violence every hour.  Trump is not in denial here.  He understands very well that he lost. He wants every bit of attention and revenge he can drum up. And as for running in four years, if he isn’t in jail, he’ll be so fat he’ll need to be transported from one rally to the next in a flat bed truck."
2020-11-14 19:16:48,"I’m looking at the chart that says how many Americans are getting the virus daily and the rate looks steeper right now than it was in the beginning of the pandemic. We do have better strategies to aid those sick with the virus and some better behavioral norms, but it seems to me we’re just letting people die at this point rather than shutting down more, in part due to the lack of aid from the federal government. Shutting down—especially keeping people from eating indoors or doing indoor activities where there isn’t sufficient ventilation or space to distance or mask-wearing is impractical—seems imperative if we want to save needlessly copious lives from being lost. All we need is the government to care enough about people’s lives to sufficiently keep businesses from failing and people from losing jobs and starving or going without other needed resources like psychological care. We know this is temporary, which is why it would be so tragic not to try to save all the lives we can."

There are multiple relief measures that, standing on their own, are largely bipartisan, or could attract enough bipartisan votes to pass.   But Madame Speaker takes the position that, unless there is enough for all, no one gets any.

No wonder she lost members from her caucus.   In 2022, she could lose even more, as is the usual case when the Presidency changes parties.

McConnell wants Biden to fail, and he does not care how many people he must kill or injure to achieve that failure, since his key funders are going to stay rich, and his key voters are (mostly) going to keep voting their emotions and false narratives. 

The election in Georgia of two senators is all that stands between untold misery from an out of control pandemic and a rapid post-vaccine-wide-availability recovery. Otherwise McConnell will single-handedly keep the country in a near or actual depression, and blame it on Biden. 

The first COVID package perhaps worked too well, preventing wide-spread misery and allowing a (sadly premature) rapid bounce-back. McConnell does not want a rapid recovery from the COVID economic damage because that would help Biden and Democrats in the next election."

There's  no mandate from the voters for anything
the Democrats would like to do. The consequences of 
the many losses in the House and the inability to flip the Senate testify to the rejection by far too many voters of anything they thought the Democrats were offering as a  
plan of national action.

It's not at all clear if the congressional leadership realizes this. They may be in as deep a denial as the  WH child. The only voices to be heard come from
the few progressives with  national recognition who seem to believe, as all devoutly self righteous politicians do, that theirs is the one true road to follow, if only others would join. 

As usual, the poor belabored centrists are on the defensive, especially since they don't really have a coherent program and have to deal with districts that contain many  skeptics about green new deals, medicare for all, defunded police,   and other well known forms of nefarious socialist practice that will  subvert the American way of life (or is it death?).

Moreover, it will take all of 5 seconds after Jan. 20 for congressional trumpicans to   have rediscovered their former selves and  suddenly insist upon budgetary discipline. It's too bad the news channels can't add laugh tracks when such 
individuals pronounce upon the need of such rigor.  

So will some reality quickly descend and convince House democrats that it's wiser to get whatever is  possible, not what's needed?"

2 ) The Democrats didn’t really win anything other than the above.

2020-11-14 22:42:36,"It seemed clear to me that as the election approached Pelosi was risking losing a decent, if not perfect, Covid relief bill in the 1.8 trillion dollar range, against the need to take down Donald Trump. If Trump had been able to deliver this second shot in the arm to the electorate, and made some hay with it like a normal politician would, I think it could have kept him in the presidency, especially considering how close the election turned out to be.

So I think that though Pelosi was talking nice she had no intention of signing a ""flawed bill"" (show me a bill that isn't flawed by the way) and hurting Biden's chances. An unspoken pact, IMO.

McConnell knew what was going on. Now he is once again in the driver's seat (has he ever really left it?) and talking about an economy on the rebound that doesn't need substantial help. He wants Biden's economy to start off with both feet in the grave. That is how ruthlessly he played it with Obama and I expect he will do it again.

Trump tweeted today about a relief deal. Maybe him and Biden and McConnell and Pelosi will sit down and talk this over,  four old wealthy white people, and do what's right for the rest of the country.

Now that is magical thinking, is it not?"

If she takes a short-term deal, she knows a third round will be even harder and GOP shrieking over a growing deficit will drown out the desperation of ordinary folks.

Congress must pass an Emergency Health Care Act to provides full coverage to all Americans for Covid testing and hospitalization as well as mental health coverage for therapy provided by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists.

It could have been a bipartisan response to the pandemic  and we could have avoided millions of people facing bankruptcy, eviction and generally utter economic devastation. But, nope.

Most Senate Republicans- and certainly McConnell- see national prosperity and security through a purely political lens.

He has never cared about America beyond the borders of Kentucky.

He has no ethics or honor, whether with respect to the protocol for holding Supreme Court hearings, or for acknowledging the President-elect, or defending Americans.

Mitch almost broke a hip to cut trillions of taxes for corporations in 2017, before the global pandemic and at the same time Trump was crowing about the strength of the economy.

Corporations now only pay $250 billion of a $5 trillion annual budget. 

Now that his boy lost re-election, he could care less about the fate of the nation he again left in ruins, just like 2008.

Georgia should embrace the two Democratic Senators to get Washington DC working to clean up the mess Trump-Pence-McConnell left.

The pandemic is 5 times worse in the US because the GOP called it a hoax. Over 1,000 Americans are dying a day due to Trump-Pence incompetence and lies.

Georgia can change the Senate’s mismanagement and ineptitude, uphold national security and get the country out of this nightmare."

The traditional 60 votes to end debates will be the senate rules.  Dems will need more than a Romney, Collins, or Murkowski to get anything passed. McConnell doesn’t even have to allow a vote.  Ask Garland."

Speaker Nancy Pelosi made her only big mistake in a long and enormously productive leadership when she refused, at the end of negotiations, to accept the pre-election offer of Secretary Mnuchin.  No one apparently polled for it but arguably the lack of a pre-election stimulus contributed to a disastrous House election for the Democrats.

To use the same argument ""we'll get a better deal later"" is the equivalent of a Hail Mary pass when a new  Biden administration needs a long term game plan to prevent a renewed burst of unemployment that will hamper not only recovery but Biden's drive to repair and modernize every aspect of our failing infrastruction. 

It would be wise for President-elect Biden, Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer to adopt a saying from the basket of quotes cited by JFK, ""A Journey of a Thousand Miles Begins With A Single Step"", and go for what they can get by way of stimulus in the Lame Duck. Waiting will not help with the Georgia election and may aid the morally challenged Republican Senators who profited from the pandemic.  

By the way, conservative economists want to go low, not because they believe parsimony helps the economy but because low balling a stimulus hurts Biden politically.  For them, patriotism is an alien sentiment. 

To make this country whole will be a long slog. Get what we can now.  Marshal public support for the rest in 2021."

I’ve been out of work since the end of March and this political game had been old for months now. At this point, the only help we’ve gotten since the enhanced benefits expired was the roughly $1200-1500 from Trump’s executive order. 

Dems blew their leverage and they need to deal with that reality. Im tired of being a bargaining chip. They failed for months so now it’s time to deliver literally anything. This is an across the board failure by our elected officials.

Dem's tell us what is in the bill and what the objections are so we can make up our own minds based on fact's. listening to the now deficit hawks when it serves them is beyond disingenuous.

2020-11-15 08:44:30,"Democrats have to join Republicans in preferring nothing to a relief package of the wrong side.  Otherwise they will get the Republican package, which many Republicans will oppose as too much frivolous spending.  Republicans love getting a package more generous than they say they want; the economy gets a stimulus that voters will like and the Republican base does not have to learn anything about what is wrong with their views and admit that the stimulus was government spending that had results they like.  For Democrats, the small package is not large enough to do much good, and its lack of success will give Republicans a talking point about government wastefulness.

Democrats should hold fast for a big package and blame the lack of a deal on Republican fear of deficit spending for anything but tax cuts. This irrational, Republican-stoked fear of deficits will make most things impossible until it is dealt with."
2020-11-15 09:37:26,"The unemployment rate is misleading at best. Without looking at labor participation, falling unemployment doesn't really tell you anything. There are 149.8 million employed Americans in this country. The unemployment rate says there are 11.1 million unemployed. The labor force is 160.9 million. That's how you get your 6.9 percent unemployment. However...

We need to add discouraged workers back into the mix. They aren't counted in the labor force. Neither are marginally attached workers. Throw them in too. Now we need to account for slack workers. People who effectively became part-time or no-time without actually losing their jobs. A $30 per hour job is great but you need hours greater than zero to have an income. Last but not least, we need the workers who could only find part time work.

You add all this up and you have 20.1 million unemployed or marginally employed Americans. Compared to the working age population, that gives us an adjusted unemployment rate of 11.7 percent. Apples to apples, that same figure was 6.7 percent last year. The official reported rate was 3.6 percent.

Now we can slice and dice the demographics however you want. Some groups are doing better than other groups and so on. Here's the bottom line though: Wherever you were last year, you're about twice as worse off now. The stimulus we need is the stimulus which reflects this change."

At some point we could end up with the worst of all possible worlds--a weak economy and runaway inflation.  What will we do then, enact yet another stimulus bill?

Is it a high crime to withhold money from States to distribute a COVID vaccine?

The only remedy we have for removal of an errant  president, impeachment, has a time frame inadequate to the pace of events. If we wait until January 20th, 2021, the horse will be  far out of the barn. Pence will never do his 25th Amendment duty.

In 2009, he and President Obama inherited a wounded economy brought on by the fiscal ineptitude and loose banking regulations of the Bush Administration.  Now he faces an economy riddled by a criminally incompetent handling of a public health crisis delivered courtesy of the Trump Administration.  I for one am confident that he will gradually bring both sides together to provide federal support to ailing businesses and  municipalities as well the resources needed to keep our healthcare system afloat.  Returning tax rates on the wealthy to pre-Trump giveaway levels and readjusting the corporate tax rates to make sure that all American based businesses pay their fair share will assist in funding the efforts without borrowing more and adding to the deficit.

Democrats can win in Georgia by making the runoffs a referendum on GOP/Perdue/Loeffler obstruction of Covid relief.    Pelosi should reconvene the House, pass significant benefits, and walk the bill with House Dems to the Senate to demand a vote.  McConnell will refuse.   Schumer should commit to putting it to a vote (via Budget Reconciliation, only 51 votes needed) if Warnock and Ossoff win the day after Harris becomes the 51st vote on Jan 21.

To this point, it has not been clear what Pelosi has been holding out for. 

Who won't help? If Trump and McConnell can't get on board, and they won't, run hard against both in Georgia. McConnell's Senate is demonstrably the other half of America's broken government.  As a plurality, we voted to fix this. Georgia has a chance to get it done."

PS - Although most of you have only met my type in movies, in life I literally had no family, no friends, so my death was my own little project and I didn't leave any mourners, etc. In fact, I jumped off an abandoned building on the outskirts of Reno so as not to harm anyone or anyone's property, or burden first responders, etc. Just so the few of you ready to ""tsk tsk"" me understand I took care to keep it low key, etc. 

Anyway! Good luck! And oh! Yes, you can still still do this after you die! Cool, right? I know! I'm actually in a FedEx Kinkos store now using their PC. I'm a ghost, so they cant see me, of course. Had I known how easy it was on this side, I would have checked out during Bush II but was happy to here for Obama."

You too, Chuck.  If you had cut a skinny deal when they offered it at the end of July - even when they went as low as $300 / week - we would have had received $5000 or so by now.  Which is a lot better than the nothing that we got.  Oh, except for that $1800 from Donald Trump.  Your centrist House members, many of whom just lost their seats, were begging you to pass something for their constituents, but you wanted to hold the most vulnerable hostage to big bill of which you got exactly nothing out of.  Think those seat losses and the l game of chicken that you lost might be related?

In an interview with Politico, Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) said she won't be voting for Speaker this time around.  Hope others follow suit and join her, the Dems desperately need new leadership and Pelosi lost the plot long, long ago.  Like in 2010."

Thanks to Operation Warp Speed and progress on the vaccine candidates, we are months away from broad vaccination of the American public. Had Trump listened to Democrats and shut everything down all year, we'd be at 20% unemployment. Fortunately he got American working again, just as Biden's team suggests alternatively a national or regional lockdowns. Trump reduced unemployment from 10.2% to 6.9% in three months, a feat that took Obama and Biden 46 months (Jan 2009-Nov 2013). All we need to targeted unemployment insurance, PPP funding and state funding for vaccination programs. That's it. Total price tag under $1 trillion. No blue state bailouts, Doctor handouts or liberal porkfests. Why can't Nancy do the right thing for America?

2020-11-13 17:23:12,"Great article and highlight of how ISPs and utility companies have accepted federal tax payer funds for over a decade to expand broadband yet nothing has happened. Rural ISPs like Windstream, Frontier, along with giants like ATT all have received funds but yet old copper lines still hang on lines and fiber is no where near those whom can benefit from it in rural areas."
2020-11-13 18:02:26,"Clean drinking water was once reserved for the rich who could afford plumbing. Private companies existed to lay pipe and expand water services to paying customers. Eventually municipal governments took over this task from private enterprises and, through tax dollars, provided clean water to all residents. The long term benefits easily outweighed the short term costs. Same thing happened with electricity in the 1930s through federal initiatives (ie TVA). These services (water, electricity) started as a luxury, but in time became public utilities. We need a federal initiative to provide affordable access to the internet. Like other utilities, the long term benefits will easily eclipse the significant up front costs."
2020-11-13 18:07:25,"Republicans blocked municipal broadband supply in NC, and has no other plan for improving broadband access other than to leave it to the private sector. And yet, rural North Carolina continues to vote red. In every way they are sawing off the branch they sit on. I wonder how many of the rural families dissatisfied with their situations would even dream of voting blue. 

I am curious where the writer got the statistic that North Carolina has the second largest rural population in the country.  I could not see that statistic on any other source - e.g. the US Census Bureau web site.  I would be grateful if they could reply and clarify."
2020-11-13 18:11:34,"I'm glad the Times ran this piece. I am an English prof in the LA junior college system. When the pandemic hit, I lost nearly one quarter of my students, not only because some didn't have laptops or smart phones, but because they had no wi-fi connection at home. Our campuses did their best to get laptops to students, but the problem pointed to how poor many of our students are - as well as what they lose when they can't access school. I encourage Times readers to imagine their undergrad years without a laptop (and I don't mean those of us who remember when laptops didn't exist); imagine living with no wi-fi at home. The sudden switch to digital education last March was complicated enough that some people fell through the cracks. I hope when/if face-to-face classes are again permitted, that we'll be able to lure former students back to school. If the return to the classrooms is hobbled for whatever reason, we need to make sure these students aren't permanently lost in the shuffle."
2020-11-13 18:34:51,"Great article and very relevant for those of us who live in rural America. No internet or unreliable internet makes distance learning very problematic. In fact, in this day and age, it makes almost everything more difficult.  It would seem to be be a very worthwhile infrastructure initiative, along with all the other infrastructure that needs work in this country."
2020-11-13 18:37:12,"I've lived in a very rural area of Montana in a town of less than 100 people with the nearest towns of less than 1,000 residents 10 miles away. We had excellent DSL internet service through a local phone/ISP company of around 6 MBps, which was more than adequate for streaming video over YouTubeTV. (The connection was always reliable, more so than the 600 MBps service I receive from Xfinity where I live now).

As DSL uses the same copper wires as traditional phone lines, I wonder why AT&T (who appears to be the traditional phone line provider in this area of NC) or a local ISP doesn't at least provide DSL service to this area. 

Of course we all know the answer."

2020-11-13 19:09:09,"We need to do something for broadband similar to electric utility regulation, which requires utilities to provide universal service at  roughly equivalent rates for all. Post office -- same thing.  What this means is that folks living in denser areas will cross -subsidize those living in rural areas, but that's just how it is.   City folks don't complain about how they are subsidizing  rural folks' electric service or postal delivery, and rural folks don't express gratitude that they are receiving those cross subsidies --  because, frankly, neither group realizes that's what's happening; it's just built into the system. In the big picture of national unity and progress, it's what is needed. What we have now is a market failure, and one of the chief roles of government is to step into market failure scenarios and fix things: everybody benefits."
2020-11-13 19:21:34,"There are and have been for a very long time plenty of empty and heavily-subsidized buses running around many American cities. The real infrastructure project we need is close to universal internet access so people do not have to physically move around and burn fuel so much in the first place. 

Few investment would help the less fortunate as much while not being politicized as a subsidy for wealthy big cities. It would also help those big cities outsource work and be more competitive while reducing pressure on their own public services, infrastructure and housing. 

Any action on this front may come too late for this pandemic. But there is no reason to think there will not be another or that such access will be a luxury in the society that emerges from this one."
2020-11-13 19:25:05,"This is not just an issue in rural areas. Plano's school district provides access to wifi in some of its school's parking lots. Everyone must remain in the car while on the school property. Too bad if the driver of the car must work. 

(And yes, this is a case of a family being unable to afford broadband, not that it is unavailable. Still, Plano has 28 such parking lots available. Not every school has such wifi available.)

Too bad the Plano MotoMesh wifi mesh network (for first responders) wasn't left in place. It would have come in handy for some of these folks. I bet that hardware is getting good use in some developing world country."
2020-11-13 19:31:59,"Yes I agree that Internet is now a public utility that should be available to everyone like municipal water. 

In the meantime, you can potentially help internet access in your area by opening up your home WIFI so that people can connect as guests.  That doesn't give them access to your computer and doesn't increase your cost.  You could also contact your local school and offer a password for student use."
2020-11-13 20:22:41,"Last year, my husband and I visited my hometown of Manitowoc, WI.  We were going to meet other family members at a restaurant outside of the town.  While en route, we developed car trouble.  We tried in vain to contact them via our cell phone, but we continued to get the same message ""no signal"".  Almost an hour went by when finally a county sheriff's car approached us.  It was my brother-in-law, looking for us because he was afraid we had an accident.

I kept thinking, what if we had a real emergency and needed to get to a hospital ASAP?

For ANY small town, rural area to NOT have steady and reliable internet service is an issue every local and state legislature should be arguing and pressing for.

The really annoying and deplorable aspect to this entire situation is that the entire country has been combating the COVID virus since February.  It's now November but nothing positive nor effective has been accomplished in kids receiving a decent and full learning experience via remotely in untold number of rural areas throughout the country.

Just how DO kids in these areas learn anything when they cannot access direct learning?  Sure puts even more pressure on them and their parents."
2020-11-13 20:38:24,I wish the article had named the companies serving these particular locations so citizens could look up how much in federal universal service subsidies they receive to build out their networks.  Billions in subsidies from ratepayers are provided to rural broadband companies yet residents still do not have access to adequate service.
2020-11-13 20:42:16,"Sigh.  

In a small, rural town in South America, high-speed fiber-optic broadband plus digital phone costs less than $50 per month. 

On the Big Island in Hawaii, over-the-air broadband costs $52 per month. 

While $50 per month can be a large expense for many persons in the USA, it would still be better than the lack of access or extreme costs that many of the USA-based companies are charging. 

One other thing - schools and teachers need to look at how much their content costs - on a metered connection, the slimmer the content, the less it costs the recipient in download fees."
2020-11-13 20:45:36,"I find it so frustrating that internet access is actually nonexistent for so many in our rural areas.  School children have the right of access to education-it is a law and yet these disparities continue to exist.  Handing a kid a ""hotspot"" with lessons on it or whatever is NOT equal access to education.  And this is not just a problem in North Carolina-it is a nationwide problem.  Every state has rural areas-with no internet access.  Maybe with a true advocate as Secretary of State under Biden, schools will have a chance to deliver educational services to all of our students-as the law of the land requires."
2020-11-13 21:05:53,It is the same story everywhere.  Fixed or mobile broadband hasn’t been a priority for commercial providers in rural areas because there are too few customers spread too far apart.

That service becomes basically unusable if more than one person in the house tries to connect at the same time. At this point, AT and T doesn't even pretend to care when I call to complain or ask about future improvements. It's not profitable for them to improve the service, and the GOP blocks every attempt to allow anything even remotely resembling a competitive marketplace for connectivity. Until Internet access is treated like a utility, nothing will change. Our lack of reliable, fast, affordable Internet access across this country at this stage in the game is an embarrassment."

In 1936, the Congress endorsed Roosevelt's action by passing the Rural Electrification Act. At the time the Rural Electrification Act was passed, electricity was commonplace in cities but largely unavailable in farms, ranches, and other rural places. Only 11% had electricity. Within 20 years 90% did.

2020-11-13 20:08:18,Broadband access should be like roads where the gov maintains the accessibility.  What a joke this country boasts the mightiest military strength and advancement but cannot provide to its citizens.  Well it is certainly easier to keep  control with the restrictions in flows of information in check.  The less informed the easier to manipulate.
2020-11-13 22:11:34,"Believe it or not, one of the promises made by the ""Baby Bells"" back in the Eighties was to provide broadband connectivity to all households in return for allowing them to re-merge and to enter into other, non-landline businesses. Then in 2000, one of Bill Clinton's last acts was to sign a multi-billion dollar bill to provide high speed internet access to all Americans. The agency picked to lead this was the RUS - Rural Utility Service, the new name for the old Rural Electric Agency that delivered electricity to rural America under FDR. Despite all that, the goal was never even slightly achieved, even though all this funding was allocated. Then in 2009, after the Crash, the RUS was given another few billion to initially provide broadband internet to 50 million rural and underserved households, but by 2015, after many stalled efforts they pared that number down to a few hundred thousand. And some of the funds were used to install internet in areas that already had high speed access!

So we have over 30 years of a complete failure to deliver something that's as vital to modern life as electricity was in the Thirties, despite billions of dollars allocated! Millions of Americans are being shut out of full participation in the modern world because the private sector providers have successfully prevented the government roll out of competition. Billions of dollars and decades, and where I live I'm ""lucky"" to get 10Mbps via radio waves! Ain't progress grand!"
2020-11-13 17:26:17,"“In 2016, Republican state lawmakers won a legal battle to halt the spread of municipal broadband providers, which had increased competition by serving residents where commercial networks had been unwilling to go.”

I decided to purchase two laptops that can be used inside the library that is connected to our public printer. 

Next Monday I will be talking to T-Mobil about setting up hot spots.

But this offers the opportunity for a Digital New Deal – building a large network of broadband cable and cell towers across the country, which would employ thousands of people in rural America and could help incentivize all kind of companies to re-locate their operations to smaller towns in the US, thereby helping even further to revitalize rural America."

Some of the people in this article are still alive thanks to Australia's policies.  If strong measures hadn't been taken, and the towers had become a Covid hotspot, authorities would have been attacked for racism too, but this time with deaths."
2020-11-12 12:59:59,"Australia has been very strict in handling this virus from the beginning, and have low deaths to show for it.  This measure, though extreme by our lax response, seems in line with what they've been doing all along."
2020-11-12 13:16:56,"And that’s how a proper lockdown works, if there’s a tick in cases for a particular building that’s exactly what should happen. It would contain it very quickly. Granted they could of use drones to make light deliveries."
2020-11-12 12:56:31,"As the NYTimes has printed the ongoing actions of this President, commenters from Australia, Canada, the EU have sympathized, been shocked. And rightly so. 

So much like our locking up immigrant children at our border, this is worse. These are citizens, these were born there or welcomed, led to believe in what Australia promised of equal treatment. And even as we locked down our nursing homes, I hope we didn’t steal their laundry, deny them food, medicines.

So now I sympathize, and am outraged for Australians. And wish them a quick response to this grossly inhuman imprisonment. We’ve had to wait four years. Your justice should be, quicker?"
2020-11-12 14:07:38,"If accurate, the manner in which these towers were locked down was appalling, in that it was designed to protect others from the residents when it should have been the other way around."
2020-11-12 13:25:30,Thank you for this story. It is incredibly important. This coverage made me buy a subscription to the NYTimes. I live in Melbourne and I was deeply concerned when this happened. While it got some local coverage nothing like this level of detail and human stories. I have heard from police officers that it was very badly handled by their leadership. It is always concerning when your government takes such severe authoritarian action against disadvantage minority groups. My birthplace is Canada and the racism in Australia concerns me. This did get picked up by BLM protesters and videos went viral in the US. We are very fortunate that we have 13 days of zero covid cases. Transparency and rule of law is important. Currently all of these incidents are being examined in a public inquiry. The truth will come out.
2020-11-12 14:20:18,"A number of people comment that these draconian measures were necessary to contain the spike in infections.  The story says the towers were no more a hotbed than anywhere else.  So, were residents of high rise apartments buildings in affluent areas treated the same?  Masses of police vehicles, no advance notice to bring in supplies, no one allowed in or out, laundry disappearing (by the way, who collected the laundry and washed it in the communal areas?).  Give us a story about how a comparable wealthy apartment building coped."
2020-11-12 14:32:59,"In the absence of pharmacological prevention, suppression is the only means society has for effectively controlling the spread of a novel pathogen in a fully susceptible population.  Clearly, Australia's program wasn't handled well in this particular instance, but the end result is a triumph for public health ... in marked contrast to the U.S., the coronavirus basket-case of the world."
2020-11-12 13:37:27,"They could have given their 3,000 poor citizens and legal immigrants a 24 hour notice so they could make arrangements. Imagine that your food, toiletries, prescription meds and diapers were low when suddenly told you're on lockdown. 

But no, part of classism and racism has always been to view designated ""lesser"" people as diseased and unworthy of being treated humanely. This was barbaric and inexcusable."
2020-11-12 13:19:48,"Where is the paragraph on the difference in construction and hvac between public and private towers?  A person asked to stay in their apt tests positive well into the lockdown...is covid-19 spreading thru the air handlers, or were people outside of their apt, mingling?  No instructions on airing out the apt -- could the windows be opened? Lots of missing info here that would give us the real story.  This one reads like the early part of Legionnaire's."

2020-11-12 14:25:56,"While there were aspects of the lockdown on these towers that were worth serious criticism, nobody was shot, or maltreated by those police, who were there to make sure the containment worked. The real issue, as far as I can tell, is that having police rock up, and without adequate supply of interpreters, etc, is where problems emerged.

The residents themselves, they were perfectly able to comprehend the nature of the emergency...so long as the appropriate people were dealing with them. People who have escaped terrible political strife, are generally reticent to interact with anybody who looks like the same kind they fled in the first place. A bit more cultural sensitivity, and perhaps using police in the background, rather than front and centre, might have helped.

My understanding is that virtually all of the residents, when they understood the situation, were willing to accept the temporary but strict conditions. The reason the tower blocks had been ``targeted,'' that was because of an outbreak of the Covid-19 in a meat processing plant that had a very large contingent of migrant workers, living at the towers.

I hope that the enquiries into our Covid-19 response do put a focus on how authorities should interact with affected communities, especially immigrant or Indigenous communities. It wasn't handled well enough.

PS: Australia Pop: 25.5 M; Covid-19 case fatalities, about a 1000."

2020-11-12 13:52:19,There is a very dark racist side to Australia which does not get enough coverage
2020-11-12 14:38:45,Australia and NZ are curious examples where the population overwhelmingly accepts complete state control in the supposed name of a greater good. Its very likely that the virus will return there again and again and I hope some people then reconsider what they have done.
2020-11-12 15:17:34,"I am aghast at people calling this a ""racist act.""  It WASN'T.  Loads of white European-origin Aussies live in those State-supplemented housing towers, not just migrants.  In Australia we learn, from an early age, that we are all AUSTRALIANS...and I am writing this as a child of migrants myself.  
In July Melbourne was tackling a devastating second wave of Covid19.  The apartments were at the epicentre of the new infection wave and this was proven by genetic analysis.  The residents were locked down but the state government supplied ready-made meals to the residents, all staple foods and their utilities for that time period, free of charge.  The lockdown went for two weeks only.

I wonder if you Americans would have tolerated Melbourne's lockdown.
-Curfew at 10 pm.  No driving beyond 2.5 miles of home.
-Only food shops, pharmacies and doctor's surgeries were open.  Take out food only in restaurants.
-Mask wearing compulsory.
Our economy took a huge hit but we beat the virus.  Most lockdown provisions have now been revoked, apart from mask wearing in public.  We've now had almost two weeks of NO new infections.  To date, in Australia (pop. 25 million) we have had 26,699 infections, 25,464 full recoveries and 907 deaths.  Compare that to Trump's handling of Covid.  As of today there have been ZERO new cases in all of Australia.  You see, we accepted scientific advice.  If the whole world did that a lot more people would still be alive."
2020-11-12 15:26:12,"More whining after Australia did what they felt needed to be done to stop the virus, successfully. Whatever their tactics, they seem to have worked and to have saved lives. They are alive and seem unhappy about it all."
2020-11-12 15:34:57,"Australian authorities were totally irresponsible and borderline criminal for not allowing these residents to prepare, or to ensure basic services were available, for a total lockdown. People died, were totally traumatized, and suffered immensely. Let's not sugar coat it - they were singled out and treated like criminals because of race. This should be a reminder to all countries, including ours, to treat everyone with decency! What if this happened to your family?"
2020-11-12 15:14:45,"This housing project lockdown was poorly handled, obviously. I agree that bigotry and xenophobia were the impetus for the special treatment — Australia has shown itself to be a nation not fond of immigrants. But Mr. Hassan chose to not go to the hospital, when he had the chance. You can’t blame that loss on the authorities."
2020-11-12 15:09:51,"There are a few omissions that should be included in this article to give it context.

These people were locked down because testing and contact tracing had detected a serious virus hotspot, not because they were in anyway different from others.

There was widespread concern that the pandemic was getting out of control, as in the US model.  Cases spiked at 700 per day with the majority linked directly and indirectly to a few groups. Action had to be drastic and immediate, the rapid spread of the virus threatened to overwhelm resources and the ability to bring it under control.

And to be honest, nobody had relevant experience in these circumstances. They were learning, largely from what they were seeing in overseas news.

The whole city of 5 million experienced significant degrees of lock down. The State’s borders were closed. 

All People have been inconvenienced in many ways and to different degrees. It took months to get restrictions lifted. But the goal was to keep people alive and well, and all actions were undertaken with that in mind. 

A catastrophe was averted. The number of infections dropped steadily. Deaths were minimised. The city has not had a new case of the virus in two weeks.

 I’m sure it is planning a new assault. Hopefully our response will be seen a more humane."
2020-11-12 16:06:20,"People need to be treated with dignity and respect. I remember vaguely hearing about this in the news but it is disturbing how they were given no warning, some displaced and no means to get the necessary survival items for them. There has to be a human rights angle looked into with this decision and why these people were treated so differently than other citizens."
2020-11-12 17:48:17,"As we know now, it isn't always about race, but the type of work groups of people do and where and how the employer's protect them.  The towers may be where they found the spike but the common denominator for spread may have been their jobs.  
   Once locked in the virsus could have spread like wildfire through the buildings, as it did on cruise ships, but that didn't happen.  Probably because the towers really weren't the original source, but their work out in the world was.  In the US we found this was true of  our agriculture workers who are primarily immigrants from Mexico and central america.  They work in food processing plants where they were infected and took it home.  It was the facility that was spreading the virus not the workers living conditions.  In addition they were more likely to have older people among their immediate family members.  Employeer took no precautions early on and the work was deemed essential.  The outcome killed more of these workers and their family members because we were slow to test and trace the disease to it's true source.  
Now we know better, but testing and tracing are still riddled with problems here in the US.  

Yes, Australia got it wrong.  But at least now you have very few cases.  But here in the states we still lose hundreds every single day.  Mostly because our President didn't want to infringe on freedoms.  As a result thousands have died.  Consider that when you say ""people died"".  Freedom kills too."

2020-11-12 16:56:00,"The decision to completely ignore the rapidly deteriorating Coronavirus Pandemic context in this story, is so astounding that one might question the motives. The journalist ignored and has failed to develop the much bigger story, that has immediate relevance to the equally astounding explosion of Coronavirus in the U.S.A. today.
The situation at the Towers was a symptom of a dysfunctional and incompetent Health Department in the State of Victoria, much the same as in the Federal U.S.A. Administration.
 
A lockdown of the entire Melbourne ( 5 million) population was implemented ten days after "" The Towers mishandling"". Two weeks after that all Melbourne was under an 8 pm curfew, and official non-essential activities were restricted to a 2.5 mile radius, the most draconian in the world, with a "" ring of steel "" police blockade of Melbourne from other regions.

Melbourne coronavirus infections peaked at 700 per day in September. 
In Wisconsin ( population twice Melbourne) yesterday infections peaked at exactly 700 per day. 
For the last 12 days straight there were  zero infections and zero deaths in Melbourne with prospect of a complete re-opening within Australia and with safe New Zealand.

Scientific testing has proved virus escaped from a Quarantine Facility for returning International Travelers, at first into The Towers and then rapidly into the entire Melbourne Community. 
By yesterday the Health Department Public service head & elected Health Minister had resigned."
2020-11-12 17:03:04,"I notice that this article is succeeding in its aim of misrepresenting an attempt at dealing with a health crisis as simply an act of state sponsored  racism.

Let’s get the record straight. There was panic, confusion and quite a few mistakes. An inability to communicate exacerbated some of these.

Unfortunately this housing estate Contained a high concentration of the  virus and these people were inconvenienced a lot. This was part of an attempt to help them (and indirectly the whole community ).

This incident is one component of a disaster where millions of people were inconvenienced to varying degrees for three months. 

I am sorry so many readers have been misled."
2020-11-12 18:09:31,"I’m sure everything in this article is true.  But as on the ground comments show, there is a lot more to the story. 
Yes, these people were treated badly. But how many of them, let alone others, would be dead if this hadn’t ben done?"
2020-11-12 17:19:06,"The police didn't have the resources to handle this situation. There was an urgent need for containment, within a densely packed ethnically and linguistically diverse population.

I bet these buildings didn't have anything like block captains for emergencies. Those are volunteers on each floor to help with outreach. 

As an ordinary resident, if I thought I'd be locked down with no food or services, my first reaction would be to pack a bag and flee. Which is the last thing you want.

 It takes time to explain to 3,000 people why such quarantine measures are necessary. That would probably mean 3,000 social workers who spoke the right language. They didn't have staff, or time, obviously, and since it was a low-income immigrant building they just slammed the door shut. That wouldn't have happened at a luxury condo where everyone could afford big lawyers.

Locking people in their homes, so they can't get food? That's crazy."
2020-11-12 17:03:28,"The experience of public health as a scientific field is that you can't beat a pandemic through approaches that are ethnocentric, that are based on analyses of ""disparate impacts"" or that ""privilege"" ethnic victimization narratives. Unassimilated immigrants, migrants and other minority communities that could be said to be living and working in ""parallel societies"" separate from the mainstream have been hit by the virus for a variety of reasons---some of them racist and others cultural. Sometimes a strict and swift  quarantine is necessary; I'm sure the authorities in Melbourne wouldn't have enforced that city's crackdown in the way you describe unless there were epidemiological evidence supporting those measures. And don't forget: this was the city's second lockdown experience. The first had been undermined by the laxity of the immigrant communities in those towers, compounded by the laxity of enforcement officers, as per your own reporting from the late summer and autumn. Basic epidemiology is at odds with the demands and the instrumentalities of identity politics; no way around it."
2020-11-12 21:46:27,"From afar and through the filters of multiple agendas and points of view one can’t know the true details of this situation. However, my guess is the people responsible for planning and executing the lockdown have little training or understanding of the logistics and communication requirements of the mission.

That said, the military should have been called in to handle that mission, with all weapons left on post. Good logistics requires trained, capable people, who care about those being supported. Good logistics cost money and there in lies the real problem, politicians are loath to spend money on people that may not provide a political return. That is a problem in all former British colonies, including the US."
2020-11-12 20:48:35,"There are dreadful errors in this article which as a NYT subscriber And a Victorian I find immensely disappointing. The tower lockdown was not 14 days, it was only until Every one of the 3,000 residents had been tested and the results confirmed - which was done within 3 days. Only those who tested positive remained quarantined for 14 days as was the case for everyone throughout Melbourne and indeed Australia. This contained an outbreak in one towerblock, others in the surrounding suburbs were not affected, and the rest of Melbourne soon followed into lockdown which has saved lives and we are now at zero cases and zero deaths. I for one am grateful."

2020-11-12 21:21:07,"If the allegations / insinuations of the article were true it would be disturbing. Actually, it's also disturbing that they aren't. There were a few articles like this at the time in Australia but that's only to be expected as people have their own local agendas and also this was an extraordinary action that demanded scrutiny and scepticism. However 3 months later in a one-off summary article, when it's clear the lockdown ended after the standard two-week COVID cycle, it's a bad loo for the New York Timesk.  An article that steers clear of the salient facts, which are a) that COVID had got into that group of towers which were determined by the pandemic medical  advisors to be a high-risk super-spreading environment, b) the two-weeks it lasted were dictated by the spreading cycle of the virus c) it worked - the lives and health of many in those towers, and many more in Melbourne, were preserved d) Melbourne beat the second wave and has gone 13 consecutive days with ZERO new cases - a city of we'll over 4 Million people.
The man who did not want to die alone in hospital made his choice and it's one with which I empathise greatly. Coronavirus can be deadly and was in his case."
2020-11-12 20:46:20,"An extremely disappointing article, that seems to misunderstand the crisis at had. These towers are a high risk setting for rapid transmission and increased morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 and did experience high numbers of confirmed cases.  And there is no doubt there was a contributing cultural context to this and other high rise clusters and the North West community outbreak. 
There are multiple risk factors that make comparison to Joe Blogs in his 2 bedroom house a nonsense. And the article also fails to mention multiple agency supports on the ground.
This necessary public health action (it was not house arrest) successfully contained further spread and succeeded in mitigating public health risk."

2020-11-11 12:04:27,"In Afghanistan the medivac plan that was routinely executed moved injured soldiers from the field, to Helmand, to Germany and ultimately to CONUS for medical treatment. 

The risk for Covid to our nation is the overwhelming of our hospital systems.  This risk is causing many governors to make the unfortunate decision to lockdown their states to avoid this risk.  Why don’t we use our military capability to set up one giant field hospital in the center of the country or several regional centers.  We could then use our military logistics airlift capacity to move surge patients from around the country for treatment.   We could also use the hospital ships on each coast as surge centers, possible ICU surge centers, without having them leave port. These surge facilities could be manned first with military reservists and then with augmentation of contract nurses/doctors or a paid voluntary force.    

This system would allow us to more aggressively open up without potentially overwhelming our medical system by concentrating surge medical personnel in one location rather than having each state compete to develop their own surge capability."

2020-11-11 13:48:49,Leadership does matter.  Leading by example does project a powerful image.  When will Trump’s big boy pants be ready at the dry cleaners?  Could they be holding them until he pays his past overdue balance?
2020-11-11 13:56:39,NJ says the Covid case numbers don't include the results of the rapid results tests. (NJ just got hundreds of thousands of rapid tests from the fed govt.) Assuming numbers here in NJ may actually be a lot higher.
2020-11-11 13:01:05,"Americans die of Covid-19, Trump golfs. That's all that needs to be said of our ""federal leadership,"""
2020-11-11 14:16:48,So...how’d that businessman president idea go?
2020-11-11 15:52:40,"The White House is citing its efforts to produce a vaccine and therapeutics? Last I heard it's the pharmaceutical companies that are producing the vaccines and treatments....And let's not forget that a vaccine that must be shipped and stored at -80F, requires two injections, and with 20-30 million doses initially available is not a panacea."
2020-11-11 15:37:14,"What isn’t being discussed here is that covid is now, according to an article in the Times last week, hopping species. It had been found in cats and now in minks in Scandinavia. This means the possibility of mutations grows, producing a more deadly strain of covid and one the new vaccines won’t cover. I believe that is what happened in the second wave of the 1918 Spanish flu.  Would someone please address this?"
2020-11-11 15:40:36,When I look at the Coronavirus map I am struck by the fact that the red hotspot states are also the red political states. Coincidence?
2020-11-11 15:47:31,"""Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, urged his officials this week to stay focused on fighting the pandemic.""

I would expect a similar message would/should have been issued by the president as well.  

But no, he's only concern and focus is on himself and pedaling his falsehood that the election was stolen by the Democrats.

How 71,000 million votes still believe him?"
2020-11-11 15:34:13,"Media, when this awful mistake leaves office do not cover his rallies nor publish his tweets. We’ve had enough."
2020-11-11 14:48:13,Those of us who pay attention knew that the next to last thing Trump wanted was to be elected President. The last thing? Criminal indictment. More about that in coming months. His decision making ability is limited to 8 iron or 7. Trump looks at the pandemic as an inconvenience rather than the threat it  represents. There is some good in the virus situation. Trump’s non-handling of it helped us get rid of him. We’ll survive Covid...4 more years of Trump...nope!
2020-11-11 14:48:25,"trump is annoyed that the positive news about a potential vaccine came after the election.

The good news is that this vaccine is being produced without federal funding.

So, if successful, trump would have no claim to virus resolution fame that he so desperately wants the general public to buy in to.

The question is: where did all the federal vaccine funding go?

Somebody must have gotten a nice pay day."
2020-11-11 15:46:15,"So, by being so upset with Pfizer for ""delaying"" the news about the vaccine, isn't Trump admitting that he lost the election, or am I missing something?"
2020-11-11 16:00:23,"Even now there seems to be no effort on the part of Trump and his administration for properly addressing this tragedy.  One would think they would be all hands on deck and working with Biden to get things rolling ASAP.  But, no, I'm more worried about losing the election than I am about saving American lives.  Gee, wonder why I lost?"
2020-11-11 14:42:42,"In the final days of Trump's campaign for re-election, Mike Pence traveled extensively. He claimed that his campaign work was ""essential.""

The campaign is over. Pence is still head of Trump's coronavirus task force. What is Pence doing? Isn't combating the virus ""essential"" work? Cases of COVID-19 have been growing exponentially since mid-September. Where is Mike Pence?"
2020-11-11 16:00:49,"If Pfizer did withhold information that could influence the election I quote Mitch McConnell:  ""There is nothing illegal about it."""
2020-11-11 14:25:20,"Can we just stop thinking and reporting on the pandemic already? The Federal and State governments are all going through the motions.  Governors, Mayors and police are publicly stating that they will ignore any and all policies established to fight it.  75% of the population (and 99% of those under 30) just are doing everything in their power to get around as if it is not happening , even in the populated and educated states.

At some point homo sapiens will probably prevail, though hopefully our rotten culture will be utterly destroyed."
2020-11-11 15:38:23,"""The pandemic caught the nation flat-footed in March,...""

Every nation was caught flat-footed. But how do you prepare for a virus which was/is way beyond our existing science and medicine. Hopefully we are catching up. Any response to something we know nothing about is always going to seem chaotic. People seem to think man kid can do anything. The truth is we are still pretty puny compared to Mother Nature. The reporters who have been writing about that pandemic for months never seem to understand that."
2020-11-11 15:49:20,Funny how its the State leaderships that are in charge of getting this equipment. What have they been doing since June?
2020-11-11 15:52:47,"As we honor veterans today, including those of the Greatest Generation, the contrast with the situation now is stark. We are fighting a war against a viral pandemic and are seeing the disastrous consequences of failed leadership, lies and selfishness. We know that masks protect others and oneself, yet leaders failed to equip Americans with that gear. Masks could have been called ""Freedom Masks"" (before that term was taken by opponents), as universal use would have freed us to engage more safely in commerce, education, and recreation. Today, we have evidence that restaurants, bars, and gyms are more likely to spread the virus, yet schools are being guided/instructed to shut down. We deprive our children of developmentally-appropriate educational venues, while people can get their served lattes, beers, meals, and do bench presses. This is proof of our short-sided, egocentric society, epitomized by the occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. We clearly have the Selfish-est Generation around us."
2020-11-11 15:56:41,"This is an major abrogation of Trump’s sworn duty care to the people of the United States, and be sufficient to bring about Trump’s immediate removal from office.

How more innocent people have to die before action is taken?"
2020-11-11 14:12:39,Looks like the majority of hot spots of COVID-19 in the nation are states that voted for Trump - not wearing masks or social distancing has consequences.
2020-11-11 14:52:39,"There has been a federal leadership vacuum ever since Trump was inaugurated. There will be a leadership vacuum until Biden is inaugurated. That is the weakness of America's strongly politicized system of government. Trump is too occupied with defending his self-image to bother with the business of controlling the ""pandemic"" and save American lives. More people have died during/from Trump's mis-handling of Covid19, than have died from all the military mis-adventures American presidents have initiated in the 21st Century."
2020-11-11 14:21:45,"Trump wants the federal effort to fail. 

He was never up to the job to begin with, never understood how bad things were or how bad they could get, and now doubtless sees an out-of-control pandemic as a form of political payback that will hamper the Biden administration. It would be great if he saw this as a public health problem rather than a political issue, but that’s Trump."
2020-11-11 14:35:41,"Of course what we really need is action and leadership to confront the crisis, and we're not getting it from Trump. 

But doesn't it speak volumes about him as a human being that he has yet to utter a single public expression of sympathy for the families of those who have died? After all this time. I'm left to assume that he just thinks the majority of deaths were Democrats and therefore of no use to HIM."
2020-11-11 14:37:04,"America has too many cases of coronavirus and “we are not going to control the pandemic,” through masks, but it can be controlled through vaccines and treatments. We now have a vaccine with 90% effectiveness. This should be approved on an emergency basis without waiting anymore and start to distribute. The military is ready. Election is over. Still, governors like Cuomo still want to wait until Trump is out. We could have started to distribute it already if Democrats were not playing politics with Trump getting credit for a vaccine before the election."
2020-11-11 15:56:45,"This Administration (if you can call it that) is so preoccupied with overturning the election results and insulating their offices with loyalists that nothing substantive is being done in the last 70 days. Clearly, little is being done to prepare for the onslaught of new Covid19 cases given the winter months. This will lead to tragic loss, illness and collapse of hospital systems. The high rate states - ND, SD, Utah, Idaho, Montana are already seeing hospitals overflowing with patients, and now influenza will burden the systems even more. 

Trump must allow the Biden administration to act on behalf of the nation, if he is not going to do more, before we lose another 200,000 and Trump is blamed for the largest loss of American life ever."
2020-11-11 15:44:19,"Once again, Trump is more concerned about himself, i.e., aggressively fighting the election results, than he is about ALL American lives when it comes to the pandemic.

Records continue to be broken in terms of number of cases per day per state.  The increase of new cases continues to climb and we are now seeing ""1,000 deaths PER DAY.""

And once again, ""Governors are once again competing with one another and big hospital chains for scarce gear.""  This pandemic has been in full force for over 9 months and yet, medical supplies continue to be scare for hospitals and nursing homes.

Apparently, Trump truly did believe COVID would ""simply disappear"" on his watch."
2020-11-11 12:40:01,"Pfizer delayed the announcement to remain neutral in a presidential election. Releasing the results prior to the election might have tipped the scale for Trump, but also could have discredited the vaccine. Discrediting the vaccine could have discouraged people from taking the vaccine, potentially adversely affecting public health. 

Pfizer took no government money to develop the vaccine; it was not part of Operation Warp speed. It’s only reporting obligations were to the scientific community and the public.

The right call by Pfizer, on all counts."
2020-11-11 11:49:31,"Mark Meadows is correct.  We will not be able to control the virus
until everyone wears a mask and practices social distancing.

And that is not going to happen.  Forty percent of the people are adamantly opposed to wearing masks.  Forty percent don't think going to crowded restaurants and bars is the cause of higher numbers and don't think social distancing is necessary.

As for the vaccine.  As a former vaccine nurse and who generally approves of vaccines, I don't consider 44,000 an adequate percentage of the population to determine that the vaccine is either effective or safe.
Those 44,000 are healthy young adults.  It has not been tested on seniors, children or people with underlying health conditions.  
After it has been given to very large numbers of people across the population, young, old, sick, healthy will I consider the vaccine."
2020-11-11 15:50:55,"Donald is bored with coronavirus. He surrendered to the virus ages ago and went with herd immunity. His Dr. Atlas is preaching it like gospel. Hospitals are again overwhelmed, yet they stay silent. Lest we forget, this is why we shut down in the first place.

If you believe in herd immunity you want people to get infected, you don't care if some die and don't care if you get it. A Trump supporter was interviewed. I'm paraphrasing, but he said ""If I get it, I get it. If I die, I die, but it's worth it to save the economy."" 

Looking at the staggering new numbers, it looks like we're going for herd immunity whether we like it or not. Courtesy of Donald J. Trump."
2020-11-11 13:59:30,"Have Pence and Kushner, the dynamic duo of the task force, already left town?"
2020-11-11 14:45:38,"Pelosi should be all over the airways begging McConnell and the Aministration to continue relief talks.  They won't and this will just further illustrate incompetence and intransigence of the GOP relative to the virus.  Instead, the GOP leaders talk about insignificant or non-existent voter fraud.  We have long known that all they care about is power.  Resolving this national crisis with leadership is not on their radar.  By discouraging shutdowns, distancing, masks, etc. for months, they have crawled into a hole from which they dare not now rise from with bold action.  They are all now the lamest of ducks."
2020-11-11 15:37:06,We wouldn't have a federal leadership vacuum if the GSA would just authorize the transition. The Trump Admin and the GOP have been playing with our lives since the pandemic started and it will only get worse in the next two excruciating months. The fact that the Trump Admin has just given up is sad. The solutions are right in front of their face but they won't do it because they have to stroke a man's ego.
2020-11-11 16:05:39,Trump's dereliction of duty is a crime against humanity. He must be prosecuted at The Hague!
2020-11-11 14:30:36,"Biden has a Covid task team. Trump's team has Covid. Says all you need to know about who is ready to take on this pandemic.

11 months later and this mal-administration is still playing footsie with the truth and abdicating responsibility. Lack of competent leadership has cost us a quarter million lives! 250,000 fellow citizens are dead because this disaster of a president is incompetent! How many more dead by Jan 20? 

I've never been so excited for a new president to be sworn in. We'll Finally have leadership that makes decisions based on science, with compassion."
2020-11-11 15:43:38,Is there any actual governing going on? Seems they've ceased even pretending...
2020-11-11 16:09:00,"At the very beginning, Trump said he'd handle the crisis.  The Democratic governors threw a fit saying it was a state rights issue. Then Trump had daily news conferences starring Dr. Fauci and  Dr. Birx, every day telling us what to do and how to do it.  Now, he's a lame duck President with two months to go and being blamed for silence on the issue?  What would you have him say or do with just two months left?  Why is Biden, the presumed President-elect, silent on the issue?  Did he have no idea of what to do until he formed a task force?  With the pandemic the number one concern didn't he say how he'd address it during his campaign?  Evidently not.  But the media should be asking Biden what the next steps are and not Trump."
2020-11-11 14:58:55,A gift from Trump and the GOP to Biden. One that keeps on giving.

2020-11-11 16:07:55,"Azar and Redfield have no credibility because they allowed their agencies to become politicized. 
10 months in, there is still not enough PPE, hospitals are at near-capacity, testing is a joke, there is virtually no contact-tracing, masks have become political, the White House is a coronavirus hot spot, and Scott Atlas is still spouting his herd immunity ""strategy."" 70 million Americans want 4 more years of this. We are doomed.

But, the President has added to his brand recognition. The newest product is the Trump Virus. ""I've killed more Americans than any President!"""
2020-11-11 15:51:40,"When I look at the Coronavirus map, I am struck by the fact that the red hotspot states are all electoral red states. Coincidence?"
2020-11-11 13:49:05,"Trump's federal government showed his incompetence already and persistently; it is highly unlikely that they can turn CDC people who, to use Fedor Urnov's assessment, ""failed basic molecular biology"", into a clutch of Jennifer Doudnas and Feng Zhangs. Nor would they kick out Jared and his red-tied stormtroopers out of procurement and logistics. My question is: where is our self-advertised Savior Cuomo on that? He was promising this East Coast consortium of states, banding together on production of PPE and other elements of pandemic response. Ain't got anywhere outside of issuing travel advisories together. No progress on producing masks, gloves, or gowns. No state-wide effort on genomic surveillance of cases - still! No effort to engage academic labs in testing. In the meantime there are month-long hiccups in getting PPE, and testing supplies (RNA- and nuclear-free tubes and aerosol resistant pipette tips), no preparations for securing freezer equipment for vaccine storage - basically nothing. At least his book sells well."
2020-11-11 15:33:41,"In Trump's mind we all let him down, so why should he care if we all get sick and die?

After all, personal, and one-way, loyalty is the only thing that's ever mattered this selfish, self-centered, self-indulgent, self-absorbed, self-serving, self-dealing, it's all about ""me, me, me"" President from the very beginning.

He's always been a leader who led only for himself and his own enrichment and no one else.

The amazing thing is how many voters this consummate narcissist was able to con into thinking he actually cared for anyone other than himself.

Compared to Trump, Joe McCarthy was a contrite, self-effacing altruist."

2020-11-11 13:55:36,"Americans aren’t dumb.  When Trump, the president of the United States, condemns Dr. Fauci, the only honest, specifically educated and experienced representative that ever made sense to Americans regarding COVID, many in the country totally gave up.

I will never ever forget seeing Trump looking for waves and cheers as he was on a LOA from Walter Reed - a Sunday night special ride.  It was the height of disgust.  

Right then and there he slapped the faces of every family member that mourns COVID losses and struggles, every American healthcare worker, every nursing home resident who has not had a visitor for months, every citizen who has isolated themselves not able to see friends and family, and all our global friends who want things better.

We no longer look to anyone in the Trump line for any instruction, consolation, advice, or care for COVID.  It just is void and has been for a long, long time.  

He can have his maskless folly in the Rose Garden for a few more days.  He can call COvID a hoax.  He can try to praise those who have no clue.  

We’re not watching, we’re not hearing, we are not paying any attention to Donald Trump. 

And please, Donald, don’t wonder why we voted for Joe Biden.  Long and short of story - Biden cares and recognizes COVID a threat to all Americans.  And he has already done something about that.  In earnest."
2020-11-11 16:03:23,"I wonder if Mr. Biden is on the phone, or has someone on the phone, working those supply lines.  He's done it before."
2020-11-11 16:06:01,"While the (current) President continues to cry fraud, it looks as though his administration has thrown in the towel on CV-19. And still most of his party remains too frightened of him to utter a word. Even an acknowledgement of Biden's victory and helping hand to a smooth transition to a new government eludes them. This is patriotism? History will not be kind."
2020-11-11 16:09:35,"Words can’t describe how I feel about this. Trump and his administration have just turned their backs on the health and lives of all Americans. 10 million have caught COVID-19 and more than 230,000 have lost their lives. In normal times, they would be held accountable; in my view they are all personally responsible for these deaths and they should pay a heavy price.

Even more unbelievable, 70 million Americans just seem not to care. How did we ever fall so far so fast. There must be someway to charge these government officials with a crime. If not a crime, a civil penalty. Something, anything. How can we all just sit idly by until Trump leaves office is beyond me."
2020-11-11 13:26:29,"Tragically these are are the types of in depth news reporting that Trump voters do not read. Surely if they knew the half of it and the real danger he has put all American families in, they would not have supported this man. 
Am I being naive?"
2020-11-11 13:42:10,"Does Trump’s attitude surprise anyone? He doesn’t sweat the small stuff. All he cares about is winning, as though the election were a gold medal sport. But the results are in, Biden won, and Trump is beside himself having to carry the word “Loser” around his neck forever. So, how can we expect him to be engaged in the peoples’ business when he’s fully engaged in his own. It doesn’t help us much right now, but in just two short months we will have our nation back."
2020-11-11 16:11:49,"While Americans are dying, people in power continue to indulge in a fruitless “us-vs-them” struggle. Spreading divide and confusion.

Last I remember, Trump suspended stimulus talks to make way for a speedy confirmation of Justice Barrett. Now, that is done, why are the stimulus talks not resuming?

The ultimate winner here is obviously the virus which doesn’t care if you are a Trump supporter or a Biden supporter. Sad days indeed!"

2020-11-11 15:47:31,"Our Mr. Trump is hurt and he is angry with us for depriving him of vindication.  He sees his loss for the second term as the first real domino that will mark him as a loser for all of history and eternity.  On that, he is not misguided.

2020-11-11 15:22:09,"The multiple plane crashing analogy doesn't take into account the destruction of the planes, materially objects, and the adverse affect on the bottom line of the aviation industry. Congress would act instantaneously to prop up the industry and the market if this was happening. Random people dying throughout the country doesn't interest them much or that Cares Package would have overwhelmingly helped the 99%, instead the bulk of that was written to shore up the stock market and corporations.

Even the NYT chose to do a long article the day before the election about a tractor burning in Nebraska - and accusing Dem operatives/antifa with no evidence - focusing on a material thing instead of using that front page space to detail the thousands dead through deliberate policy to play down the virus. Weren't these deaths and future deaths more important than the dozens of combine fires that happen regularly with losses of up to 20 million dollars per year? 

Oh wait . . . I get it now. 

Just seems the focus of thousands dying isn't a priority to the media or our political leaders and sadly that's expected in this hyper-capitalist society where it's only the bottom line that matters. When these deaths start affecting the bottom line, then we will see more action."

COVID should not be political, but it is under Trump.  Contrary to Trump, real men DO wear masks!

President Biden can start the healing, both medically and politically.  In addition to working with other countries to defeat COVID worldwide, he should also create an international program to prevent the next pandemic from getting off the ground.

But Mitch McConnell will try to make Biden a failed President, as he did with President Obama.

Georgia voters, please vote for Warnock and Ossoff in the January 5th Senate runoff.  America needs to dump McConnell as Senate leader!"
2020-11-11 15:11:23,Why would the deaths from covid and the things done to migrant children not be considered crimes against humanity. Perhaps an online petition by American citizens to the International Criminal Court asking for an investigation could be started. Trump could not pardon himself out of that one.
2020-11-11 15:50:49,"The Trump administration is so distracted with filing meritless lawsuits to overturn the legitimate election of Joe Biden that they have no time to address the massive surge in COVID-19.  Once again, Trump's fragile ego is a much higher priority to Republicans than the lives of many thousands of the American people.

This is a particular outrage, since Biden's top priority will be dealing with the pandemic, but the Trump administration is blocking the peaceful transfer of power that would allow Biden to address an existential crisis that Trump is ignoring because he's having a temper tantrum."
2020-11-11 14:51:51,"Trump’s insanity is on full display.  If he won on election day as he declared, then the late announcement had no effect because he did not lose.

Moreover, if he now accepts that he lost and now claims the late announcement of the vaccine is the cause of the loss, then he is now acknowledging election fraud had nothing to do with his loss.

This is his problem and the problem of his cult followers:  They have no grasp of causation, logic, truth, or the short term memory of the lies Trump tells.

Worst part of this:  If Trump won as he falsely claimed, then why is he failing to act like a winner and take action on the rising COVID third spike?"
2020-11-11 16:12:12,"""Somehow, as a nation we’re not outraged.” 

Really?  Tens of millions of us are outraged, but Dictator McConnell is not, so timely legislative action is blocked.  A system that gives such extraordinary national power to a man elected solely by the residents of Kentucky must change.  America now relies on the citizens of Georgia to rescue our most vulnerable nation.  If they do, it will be time to change some rules in the Senate, to grant statehood to DC, and put an end to minority rule by an anti-democratic, anti-science GOP."
2020-11-11 14:17:08,"During the height of the crisis earlier this year I found better information was coming from Cuomo rather than the gaslighter in chief.  We had a federal leadership vacuum then and still have  that vacuum.

The governor in my state finally, months later, mandated masks statewide.  The timing is somewhat questionable  with the mandate coming on the heels of the election.

Nevertheless it will be refreshing to have new and responsible leadership in January that hopefully will not broadcast false hope the virus will just magically go away, only a few will die, and the administration has great control, better control, believe me, than any other country.

This Veteran’s Day, today, I reflect back that many of us will remember that 58,000 plus of our brothers and sisters lives were lost in war long ago.  The demonstrations to end the war referenced the dead.  Yet we are content to allow our politicians, particularly the  lame duck president* to discount the dead, to not energize and lead with common requirements across this nation.
All we hear from Trump and his minions, save for the few who dare speak the truth, is nonsense, lies and gaslighting."
2020-11-11 16:03:43,"Early in the pandemic Vice President Pence conducted press conferences that were informative, very interesting and positive. When Trump saw the ratings he took over and the new format was to have Pence grovel and praise the master and then let Trump use it as a chance to voice his grievances and boost his re election.  Now that the election is over Pence takes a vacation, Trump spends his time firing qualified members of the government and filling the vacancies with yes-men. As to the pandemic --well it's ""nearly gone,"" ""rounding the corner,"" and seemingly of no great importance to Trump and his enablers."

Increase testing capacity? Laughable. Turnaround is often 5 days. 
Start up PPE supply chains for healthcare workers? Nope
Clear public health guidelines and mandate masks? The opposite. 
Prepare more staff and hospitals for a second wave? Nope, staffing shortages everywhere.

2020-11-11 16:10:15,"We are on track with trump’s pandemic plan: herd immunity.

I have read often that trump and his sycophants have no plan. This is the furthest from the truth. His plan has always been to keep as much of the economy open while pursuing herd immunity prior to the release of an effective vaccine. 

He does not care how many people get sick and die or live the rest of their lives with chronic health issues. His only concern has been and will always be the economy and the stock market.

He has been defeated at the polls because the majority of voters disagree with his plans. We want life, safety and security.

Once again, Democrats trying to snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory.  Democrats need to figure out their messaging and aggressively tell people what's going on.  Stop bringing a butter knife to a gun fight.  Come in w/ the big guns... that would be TRUTH.  TELL THE TRUTH.  Tell it in all outlets and keep repeating the message so that we can quickly get someone in power who can actually work on the pandemic, economic aid for many who have lost their jobs and so many other things Trump and his Republican enablers have ignored.

Democrats also need to start pouring money into GA Senate runoffs.  We need to get the vote out in full force there.  Show GA voters EXACTLY what inept leadership looks like and get them to vote for the two Democratic senate candidates.  McConnell's leadership of the Senate must be ended."
2020-11-11 16:11:45,"Trump should respect the will of the American people. They voted him out partially because he did not respond effectively to Covid.

Now, he should invite Biden's Covid team in to run the show and start saving lives. It's a way he could end his presidency with some (but not a lot) of grace. Otherwise, another 75,000 will die between now and January 20th, which is a war crime.

And if Trump pardons himself, as he must to before leaving office, pardons only apply to past crimes, not future ones. Therefore, he could still be prosecuted for the time between his pardon and the time he leaves office."

The N95 was invented in the US.   The N95 was produced in the US until, on the advice of liberal trade economists (notably Paul Krugman) tariff free trade with low wage countries commenced.

Then production moved to China.  As it has its own needs, the supply line broke down - an event not considered by these economists who did not think things trough

Efforts to restart production in the US failed 

GM was ordered by the Trump administration to produce N95.  I could not

To cite  the Washington Post

""The first N95s GM made were rejected by NIOSH. The second design didn’t correctly fit most people.

Other potential manufacturers went through the same challenges as GM, failing tests and making flat-fold N95s that experts worry do not offer a tight enough seal.""

                            Washington Post, Sept 21  , 2020

The N95 is a high tech product - the fibers that make it up have a diameter of 1/50th of a human hair AND must charge up with static electricity when air moves to trap the virus AND must allow free breathing while catching a virus 1/200 of the diameter of a human hair

But with all the warning we've had that the autumn and winter were going to be worse than the summer, when that's exactly what happened with the Spanish flu 100 years ago, his inaction and callous disregard AND out and out hostility to science and history should have put the nail in his political coffin.

After all, Trump spent more time trying to scare Americans during the campaign than he did actually putting together any sort of a coherent plan for a second term. What’s worse though is that Trump’s desire to win at all costs means he is simultaneously trying to eliminate your vote retroactively, accepting politically convenient results while challenging inconvenient results even though everything was on the same ballot, and ignoring a pandemic that is an actual threat rather than an invented one."

Also, the grueling hours nursing home workers are putting in because the demand is increasing while the amount of nursing home workers is not could be a real benefit for them, physically as well as mentally.

If my husband was in a nursing home, I would jump at the chance to care for him, to see him, to talk to him so he could feel a sense of safety, security, comfort and love from his wife.  There isn't anything I would not do for my husband.

It is why half of Trump's White House staff members have tested positive for Covid-19.

2020-11-11 16:59:46,"Trump has put very low priority on informing the American public on what are the true risks associated with everyday life in this pandemic. In January, when he received a detailed briefing, Trump could have formed a separate agency to tackle this thing, to address all the needs our nation has. Corralling industry to make masks, test kits, respirators, etc. Collect data wherever it is located and use science to make sense out of what is happening and what is statistically significant. Assist governors and states by providing relevant state by state, region by region data and information useful for each state's needs. And so on. 

But no. Trump decided to play, act or remain dumb on the entire Covid-19 pandemic. And to trash talk anyone who wears masks or tries to take anything regarding this entire pandemic seriously. And to force Governors to fend for themselves trying to get any of the stockpiled supplies that Trump was not replenishing, and to come up with strategies for dealing with this national emergency. 

Trump decided not to work on this, because it is too darn hard of a job. His daily routine at the WH has been: wake up at 9, have breakfast and watch Fox News. On weekends, he takes off to one of his hotels, and plays golf. That is pathetic. 

We as a nation have chosen someone who knows how to corral America's resources to address a national emergency. Let us move forward with Joe to prepare for this next wave of the pandemic."

I’m not a wide-eyed progressive but the system is failing and needs to be changed.  And speaking of change- the world changes too fast to enable our government to be mired down in political mud slung by  the current administration and its evil psychopathic leader.  If and when we remove trump and his sycophants there has to be some serious thinking about how our government can be improved so a similar situation cannot reoccur. The nonsense that our constitution is an immutable document to be interpreted as if it were written yesterday is unresponsive to time and change.

The President was only interested in how news of this vaccine might have affected his chances at reelection.  He made the timing of the cautious release of information about this vaccine all about him, rather than the good news for the world it potentially is.  Trump wasn't interested in the vaccine saving lives, as always, he was interested in what would have been in it for him.
Right now Trump is a dangerous ego wounded animal thrashing about looking to blame and looking to find a way to keep power and the presidency no matter the cost.  He and his fellow Republicans are willing to take down our democracy to keep him in office.
We are totally adrift in this epidemic and on our own. There is no one in charge and no national policy on wearing masks or anything else for that matter, just guidelines from the embattled CDC.  There are only patchwork systems providing PPE supplies which go to the highest bidder. With rising cases and hospitalizations it is all becoming chaotic.

Criminally negligent homicide, also known as involuntary manslaughter, is commonly defined as when a person acts in a reckless, dangerous or negligent manner that causes the death of another person. Sound familiar?

In the current context, as we all know, we're not talking about the preventable death of one person, but the preventable deaths of hundreds of thousands. And the abdication of presidential leadership has been unconscionable, as in ""I take no responsibility for this at all.""

Even now, almost 10 months after he was made aware of the severity of Covid-19 and its deadly threat to the American people, he remains in a state of willful denial, preferring to watch cable TV, send rage tweets, play golf, enrich himself and take active measures to undermine our democracy. If there ever was a definition of moral bankruptcy, that's it.

The damage Trump has done to our country is irreparable, the wounds he has inflicted won't heal anytime soon, and the quarter of a million Americans who have died in the pandemic -- a toll that will rise dramatically -- aren't coming back. What a legacy.

Selling mask use as ""protecting others"" was not only a hard sell, but an inaccurate one to boot.

Where are the free to the public, government issued N95 masks?

Trump refused to try to CONTROL his first national crisis, instead choosing to only try controlling the narrative.

And his failure rapidly turned into multiple national crises in the form if economic meltdown, social unrest, and several constitutional crises.

It is arrogant and negligent beyond comprehension to think that planning for a transition, even if you abide the fallacy of recounts and the right to pursue legal avenues to overturn the vote, is not a national priority. 
It looks like the trump transition plan is to add gasoline to the fire as they walk out the door and then blame Biden and the democrats. If we are in a war with the virus, trump is a war criminal."

Trump surrendered to COVID-19 without a fight while destroying the credibility and reputation of the CDC, FDA, USG, USPHS and HHS. Leaving the NIH with Francis Collins, Anthony Fauci and Kizzmekia Colbert standing brave, honorable and strong.

This nation crossed a dark threshold in 2016 when Trump took his oath of office - something I can guarantee you he doesn't remember or care about in the slightest.

Indeed, the “leadership’s” work has been counterproductive: let states compete with each other for PPEs; promote quack cures (Clorox and hydroxychloroquine, anyone); model the opposite of recommended behavior (no mask wearing, no social distancing); hold super-spreader events like political rallies and White House gatherings; mock people who wear masks; tell people to go about their lives and pretend the virus isn’t around; silence Dr. Fauci, the world’s leading expert on infectious diseases; encourage gun-toting lunatics to attack state governors trying to get the virus under control.

As coronavirus infection rates rise to never-before-seen levels, I expect nothing less than continuing failure of leadership from Trump and his acolytes.  In this setting, there isn’t much that the scientific experts still left in our government can do."

We just got off the phone with one of our medical advisors, a board-certified epidemiologist, who, for the first time through this whole awful pandemic, is showing real signs of anxiety.  He told us that he has ordered more N95 masks for his workforce (we need them too) and learned that they are back-ordered.  What?  An apolitical guy, he expressed shock that the government wouldn't have taken steps to prepare the nation for the winter wave, which was predicted and anticipated by pretty much anyone alive except for you-know-who.  Thank goodness our hospitals are better at treating COVID, so there will be fewer deaths.  But a lot of people will get sick and others will suffer or worse because the medical system's capacity will be overrun by COVID cases that could have been avoided.  Meanwhile, our president is in a funk with nothing on his mind but how to reverse his challenger's electoral gains.  We humans can normalize anything, even gross incompetence."

So he decided to salvage some of his legacy by knuckling down and aligning all federal assets to fighting the scourge.

Traffic is nearly back to what it once was and pollution is on the rise again. We hit one million cases in Texas, with twenty thousand deaths, and people think it’s OK to run around without masks simply because they are weary of the pandemic. Not one of our leaders is setting an example, encouraging folks to hang in there, or offering any path to financial relief that will allow people to hunker down again, protect themselves, and not worry about paying bills."
2020-11-11 18:31:47,"I believe that things are worse than what is reported in hospitals. Most hospitals in the US have pretty thin margins. So over the years, they have shrunk their workforce, implemented efficiency processes and tightened their supply chain. This leanness was effective to staying open in normal conditions. But this isn't a normal situation, its a pandemic. Hospital operations were not capable to meet this demand and even with some time from the initial cases, there hasn't been that much of a change with these. There is a tipping point for each state where the number of hospitalized patients is maxed and people are going to be turned away. When we reach this point, the death count will take off. Each person is going to have to take responsibility for their health. Wear a mask, wash your hands and keep your distance from others. You needed to have started back in March to improve your health by exercising and eating better. This could have helped your immune system. Most have not done this and in the end, the states will have no alternative but to shutdown their state. We are in a war with this virus and our government cannot help us, if you have not prepared for this winter, then at least prepare or update your will."
2020-11-11 18:46:56,"The original prediction was that Pfizer would have their first early preliminary results on efficacy by Thanksgiving.  They needed a certain number of treated and placebo subjects to become infected before they would be able to make claims on efficacy.  

The fact that they got to that point 2 weeks before predicted has nothing to do with the election.  It is the simple mathematical consequence of two things.  First the pandemic has gone more downhill than predicted, second the vaccine was more effective (90% vs. 70%) than predicted.

It has been said by a journalist that people underestimate about him being smarter and less incompetent. But to me,  it's more like he does not really care one iota for American people or the country he leads UNLESS it serves his own interests first.

Donald J. Trump could, without hesitation, sell or damage the US national interests for his own. Even if the highest  bidder is a state enemy of the US. That's not hyperbolic.

Therein lies the real character of being conservative. It's just a facade to cover their bottomless greed."
2020-11-11 19:20:48,"The infections map looks like the red states map during the election count, imagine what all those rallies may have done in terms of spreading the virus!  If Article 25 is referring to someone who is a danger to the country, because of their inaction, perhaps new leadership could start to reverse the trend.  The counties of Iowa are not yet at their peak, for example, and a little more freedom does not make up for the suffering."
2020-11-11 19:17:51,"It is not surprising that we continue to operate in a leadership vacuum.  Trump and his administration continue to lie and deny that we are in a serious crisis.  To the best of my knowledge I have not seen  administration officials speak to the public about what plans if any they are going to undertake.  Their focus is on vaccines and therapeutics. Trumps focus is on remaining in power   In the meantime infections, hospitalisations, and deaths are increasing at a rapid pace.  We are on our own here. January 20th can’t come soon enough."
2020-11-11 19:31:55,"There's a Federal Leadership vacuum, but we also need to talk about the ""Followership Vacuum"" with respect to the broad swath of America, mostly Republican, that can't be bothered to do anything to stop this from happening.

It's fair to fault Trump for not leading, but we've also had very respected public health officials, doctors, pundits, and leaders across all sections of society that have been speaking about the importance of wearing facemasks and keeping space from people for months.

Republicans, especially in rural areas, can't be bothered to do anything helpful - despite months to learn and prepare.  We continue to see many of these areas with bars full of people taking no precautions.  And they're going to do nothing but fill up the hospitals in areas that are behaving more responsibly once they've overloaded their own healthcare facilities.  

The city I live in has mandated masks for quite some time. 
 It is surrounded by counties with major outbreaks.  Our ICUs just hit capacity yesterday.  After months of staying in, taking precautions, etc... there's a high likelihood that people like me who don't deserve COVID so much will not have any hospital resources available to us if we do contract it.  And it's going to be in no small part because our hospitals will be full of these rural Republicans who, from the way they've been behaving, do deserve to contract it.

Republicanism has been sick for decades.  COVID is just making it contagious."
2020-11-11 19:22:54,"As far as I can tell there has been a federal leadership vacuum on this since day one at least at the top levels. To the extent there has been leadership it has been at professional staff levels and their efforts have been ridiculed, made fun of, played down, and contradicted all while threatening and/or firing that same staff.  Key Stone Cops could have done a better job. And now instead of leadership in the White House and Senate we get a rehash of the 2016 elections witch hunts and a hysterical search for illegal votes in the 2020 elections but only where the GOP lost."
2020-11-11 19:32:33,"Perhaps, if when cases were lower ( for example, September  when they were less than half daily they are now) the messaging had been that mitigation efforts were making a difference, then the stark warnings wouldn’t fall on deaf ears. 

To be sure, the messaging would have had to be specific to say ‘ you’re doing a good job keep it up a while longer’.

But when the constant beat of the news is it’s all awful, people can tune it out.  It’s a little like the boy who cried wolf.  People worn Lauren now because when things were better there really was not an acknowledgement . Biden said distancing should be like a dial not a switch."
2020-11-11 20:15:06,"Maybe the ""vacuum in Federal leadership"" is not that different from what happened before?

Whatever the downside in the post-election federal government, not having Trump and various other con artists on TV downplaying the virus, holding rallies, touting miracle cures or making mask-wearing a culture war issue is probably a net benefit for the country."
2020-11-11 19:26:35,"Considering how little we knew at the beginning of this having a prospective vaccine is good news.  We still need to be careful, wear masks, and take the usual precautions like social distancing.  

However, as a further note, this entire crisis, which is two crises  rolled into one, has pointed up the flaws in our current health/wealth care system.  People need to be able to see their doctors without worrying about copays, deductibles, surprise out of network charges, etc.  We need to update our sick policies nationwide and stop expecting people to tough it out and come into work sick.  Our social safety net has proven to be inadequate as well. 

I think that one of the biggest problems we face as a nation is getting to the point of realizing and implementing policies that are for everyone, even people whom we don't want to help for whatever reason.  Policies that are for poor people only remain poorly funded, poorly understood, and do not benefit the poor or anyone else.  There is no shame in needing assistance.  The shame is that our country is so willing to throw lives out."
2020-11-11 19:32:13,"Congress needs to do its job and the media needs to focus on congress just as intensely as it focuses on the presidency. 

Congress makes the laws and what local representatives do can be just as important or potentially deadly. In NJ many people had been complaining about conditions at nursing homes  for years but were ignored by local politicians getting votes or payoff  from those who control those institutions. Then there were the closings of public hospitals and further privatizing for profit health facilities. Still no stimulus and a December budget deadline just around the corner.

Something could be done about the looming disaster on various fronts but good luck finding a Roosevelt in these times willing to make the tough decisions or a congress willing to do the same. Stock up, strategize and learn how to stretch your budget and meals. We are on our own."

If his supporters cared more about the nation than their little pet projects and peeves, we wouldn't be here either. 

If just a few Republican Senators on that impeachment board had said, ""this guy's nuts - he's outta here"", even if it had meant their jobs, we wouldn't be here either. Well, I don't think we would - Pence may be working hard to shove his Bible down everyone's throats, but I have to think he's at least marginally competent otherwise

He never took the initial wave seriously, and couldn't care less about this 3rd wave!!

Wisconsin has also faced reality, and North Dakota's governor wants health-care workers to still report for work!!   Meanwhile, Trump has, what could be, a Wag the Dog moment planned due to suffering from a severe case of egomania and authoritarianism.

I voted for Joe Biden because he has a mature, sensible and realistic plan to combat the challenges of this virus and I voted for Biden because he is a leader.

2020-11-12 02:51:10,"Apples to oranges here, and not an attempt to minimize the medical/health crisis this country faces. Just an observation. 

President Trump could have gotten down to business here, in the waning days of his presidency, salvaged his reputation and demonstrated love of the United  States and all Americans, by buckling down and devoting every ounce of energy to saving American lives. The comparison would be how Jimmy Carter spent his waning days as a 1 term lame duck, devoting all of his time and resources to bringing the American hostages home from Iran. Carter could have went to the golf course, or the peanut farm, or whatever. But he went to work. There were some maneuverings by the incoming Reagan-Bush team to affect a release. But to the best of my memory, Carter never complained about it. He was on the team. 

The pandemic is a much larger and devastating crisis. If Trump could save 3 lives they would be 3 lives worth saving. If he could build a pandemic infrastructure in the next 2 months and save hundreds of thousands it would seal a legacy for him.  But it’s just beyond his capacity and awareness. 

Listen Trump supporters, and those already in the know. The man hates America and Americans. He is exactly what he accuses left-wing  Democrats of being:  an America hater. He has turned on over half of this country and he will turn on you, his supporters, when his convenience dictates it. He does not care. It is his war against his opposition. The weapon is the Coronavirus"
2020-11-17 18:14:35,"Great piece, Apoorva. As usual. It would be good to stress further how inaccurate antibody tests can be and thus why a new test like this T cell test for assessing the shape of past infections could be helpful. Also important to mention is how the overly high CT issue with PCR tests, which you’ve also highlighted, results in PCR tests being primarily a diagnostic for the shape of past infections also. That said, is there much need for this new T cell test?￼"
2020-11-17 20:28:20,"After having had Covid and having donated my antibodies (for research per my local blood bank), I wonder which researchers have access to such blood donations? The blood bankers don't seem to know. Wouldn't it speed up research if all institutions could access those pints for their unique projects? Also, I would love to know specs of my own T cells vs just the presence/absence of antibodies which is the only info the blood bank offers. I would think the travel industry is super interested in the research vis a vis the safety of travel for those of us who survived Covid and who now  have the useful/preventative antibodies. If only there were federal coordination to make this info/testing widely known and available...at some point, we all must enter the 21st century..."
2020-11-18 00:08:02,The key thing is whether this new test unlike old tests can actually diagnose asymptomatic covid-19 patients from the first day of infection and help end this pandemic.  Can you answer that question?
2020-11-10 21:15:02,"This is remarkably similar to the first vaccine for smallpox.  Someone made note that while milkmaids sometimes had sores on their hands which looked a little like smallpox, those resolved, and they never got the deadly disease.  The closely-related disease, cowpox turned out to create antibodies to the deadly and disfiguring virus, smallpox.  And so, inoculating people intentionally with cowpox became the first scientific vaccine.  Note that the word vaccine is based on the Latin word for cows.

If they could isolate the cold virus that is resulting in these antibodies, we could have a not-only inexpensive, but contagious covid-19 vaccine which we could just all give each other in a matter of weeks!"
2020-11-10 21:18:47,"How about the presence of antibodies in teachers who, as an occupational hazard, are exposed to a great number of colds throughout each year for their entire careers?"
2020-11-10 21:20:05,"Or maybe one of the childhood immunizations helped, one that older people never had. I always thought the scientists should take a harder look at the childhood immunization/less covid illness angle."
2020-11-10 21:26:10,This makes me wonder two things. Are parents of young children less likely to get very sick because they too presumably are getting exposed to more colds than the general population because of their kids? And many people have said they have not gotten sick at all since lock down--could lockdowns and social distancing have the unintended consequence of making the pandemic worse by limiting people's exposure to colds that could give them some immunity to Covid?
2020-11-10 21:32:43,"Teachers are notorious for bringing home the bug going around school. I would be fascinated to see research on teachers of younger students to determine if they have antibodies that fight off the coronavirus. Nonetheless, everything I have read about coronavirus leads me to conclude that the answer is not simple. Still, great insights and worthy news reporting."
2020-11-10 21:42:59,"This possible explanation as to why children are less seriously affected by covid-19 than adults has been obvious from the beginning. In fact it suggests that a person might be effectively ""vaccinated"" against Covid-19 by deliberately exposing them to a coronavirus that causes colds; much as a person who was infected with cow pox was protected from infection by small pox."
2020-11-10 21:49:31,"It has to matter which viruses, how many, and also if children who have had whooping cough vaccine, might have immunity from that, not unlike the Hib vaccine, which is given to all toddlers in China.  You see, during the last Pandemic of 100 years ago, it was the babies, children, and young adults where most of the deaths were, not the seniors.  My almost 100 year old mother, had an uncle, her mother's brother, who died at college back during that Pandemic at the age of 25."
2020-11-10 22:52:08,"This journey has been deadly and excruciating, but my goodness we are learning so many things about the immune system that we did not even envision before.

This is what protects us from harm. I pray these new Tory Monarchist ""Republicans"" don't succeed in tearing the whole thing down."
2020-11-10 23:17:37,"The most damaging symptoms of Coronavirus appear to be the immune system attacking itself in people of all ages. 

The effective steroid treatment now used to save many works by suppressing the immune system attack. 

It may be that the immature immune system in most children can't yet generate the massive response that results in the self-attack that kills COVID patients. 

It is claimed that there are many more adults and children who have asymptomatic bouts of COVID than those who display COVID-specific symptoms. (and an asymptomatic case might well present as a ""cold"" in either an adult or child) 

This article appeared to be logically inconsistent. Not clear if it is because of the way it is written, or because the premise is flawed (or this reader did not understand)."

2020-11-10 23:43:52,"The questions I have are:
1) A cold last year does not protect you from this year's cold
2) So you have a family of antibodies from the yearly colds.  Is it one specific AB or the whole family that gives the protection?3) How long does this immunity last?"

I try to lead a healthy life, and I am being very careful about masking etc. during the COVID crisis. Sometimes I wonder if the flu shot, or those colds gave me some degree of immunity. But I won't quit wearing a mask, especially since I volunteer at a hospital."
2020-11-11 00:07:56,This is what was suspected in the early days of the pandemic.  We should have just selected a relatively benign corona virus and made it available to those willing to be exposed to it.  I’m disappointed that the government hasn’t pursued this concept as a temporary option before a vaccine could be available.  So many lives could have been saved.
2020-11-11 00:19:10,"Interestingly, this paper was received by Science in late July which means it's been already reviewed for 3 months - meaning the research is better vetted than most COVID news in the press.  Furthermore, there is no money to made out of this, unlike most news about medications which is pushed out ruthlessly.

What I wonder is, with what frequency does the ""right"" cold develop the ""right"" antibodies?  What is the distribution of antibodies developed against any cold - (a) within one individual, (2) within a group of individuals?  That would be useful background to add to this article (or the next)."

2020-11-10 21:43:43,"we still dont know a lot about this virus.  we know how it attacks the body (also attacking the vascular system, the endothelium of the vessels themselves, down to the smallest capillaries) and organs. however, long term effects of the virus are still not known.
  chickenpox can lay dormant in the body and come back later as shingles. wonder if this could happen with covid.  just speculating."
2020-11-10 23:14:42,"The idea of prior exposure to other virus causing protective immune response against SARS-COVID-2 has been used from the early days of this pandemic in efforts to explain dramatic differences in mortality among nations.

2020-11-11 02:23:35,"The Covid testing kit may have gotten a false negative test or if the exposure to the virus was under the radar for the testing process and thus the children were not ""infected"". But all the same their immune system was perhaps on overdrive to generate antibodies to the virus."
2020-11-11 10:36:25,"My first thought when I heard that children weren’t as susceptible to the virus as was that maybe they were being protected by all the vaccines they receive as children. That idea might be worth exploring. As adults we are too far away from those childhood vaccines. 
If children were getting immunity from colds, the adults in their families should as well because colds are easily shared among family members.  That needs to be studied."
2020-11-11 10:42:29,"The constantly-resurfacing question is whether immunity can be progressively acquired by prolonged periods of low-dose exposures  -- such as those facilitated by mask-wearing and social distancing. 

This study suggests that children demonstrate an alternate method of facilitation --  repeated exposure to cold viruses picked up in schools and daycare.  

It would be interesting to hear how these suspected mitigation strategies affect high school and college-age young people who both  experience  fewer colds and are more willing to forego masks and social distancing."
2020-11-11 13:00:24,"I am thinking that the ubiquitous 'cold' could be not only a virus but a fungus.  The blastomycosis seems to be associated with results that are many and varied, even to testing positive for TB.  It may even have been a killer from prehistoric times."
2020-11-11 13:50:26,I am wandering if all the medicines and yearly vaccines that kids and adults take actually is the cause of the antibodies.   This could be a prolonged side affect in the bodies that were exposed to vaccines for many years.   It is worth looking into .
2020-11-11 15:03:31,"Well not to brag but that has been my theory since the onset of the pandemic.  It would be interesting to look at the antibody profiles of preschool teachers, daycare workers, pediatricians, and pediatric nurses."
2020-11-11 16:06:41,"When I read news stories about research on corona viruses and antibody responses I wonder if I as a 60 year old have retained any T cell memory; I've definitely had my share of colds over my lifespan. 

Sadly, the back story on SARS Cov2 remains relatively opaque because there is a long history of developing pathogenic strains of corona viruses in the lab for the purposes of anticipating a really bad corona virus coming along: another version of the 2003 SARS and later MERS.

Would it help the scientists seeking cures for our novel SARS Cov2 to know about the earlier research for which numerous patents on corona viruses have been filed? Since the ""spillover"" event that enabled SARS Cov2 to emerge into human populations is unknown, and so far all we can say about the origin is that it amounts to an immaculate conception, it leads some to wonder if our novel corona virus did come from a lab that applied gain of function tech.

Significantly, the CDC sought to identify all the corona viruses circulating in the human community when it designed its Covid test to include a ""pan-corona virus"" element; this is the part that failed and caused CDC to never produce its own Covid test. A sad day in epidemiology.

Let's get the full back story on the history from between 2003 and 2019; maybe there is something there that will keep scientists from flying blind, as it were."
2020-11-11 16:47:14,We knew there was an age component since March.  The Princess Diamond gave us an idea of what to expect from this virus that didn't mesh with the modeling.

2020-11-11 16:47:10,"Was this a natural virus, or one modified in a lab?  While I think it is true, adults get but a cold or two a year, I would strongly disagree children get many a year.  I worked in daycare.  Some did get colds often, but most kids did not.  I would argue those sick often in fact were not healthy kids.  So compromised to begin with.  I had a son with asthma.   Very sick.  He DID NOT get many colds even though in daycare.  When he did, it nearly killed him.  Also this.  Those of us born before 1957, are NOT required to get a measles vaccine.  They say we are immune.  The measles virus has apparently not mutated all these years.  One more thing.  Doctor and his brother and wife all for Cov19.  Doctor was hospitalized, others not.  Doctor wife, also a nurse, never got virus.  All these people OLD."
2020-11-11 12:00:35,"Pre-Covid children were germ factories going through life blissfully ignorant of the army of invisible antigens circulating in their classrooms, playgrounds, schoolyards and sippy cups.

Fast forward to today.  Wild debates on whether children should even be in the classroom setting raging across the country, those who do attend must don rash inducing masks, avoid contact with each other, constantly wash their hands, develop fear and anxiety of other children and only see non household friends and relatives from a distance. 

Which situation is more preferable for our children’s physical and mental health?   

What have we done?"
2020-11-11 20:34:45,"Children share the same thoughts, games, songs over broad distances. It is no surprise if the need for antibodies could also be communicated through their ""unconscious"" connections to each other."

2020-11-11 21:37:50,"How do you ""follow the science"" when the science won't even understand what's going on for a few years at best?"
2020-11-11 21:41:10,"This shows why avoidance harms the immune system.  It needs to be exercised like muscles, bones, digestive system and your brain.  If you ""protect"" these with avoidance, you get weaker, not stronger.  

Trying to trick nature into survival of the least fit is sure to end poorly."
2020-11-11 22:15:00,"""..“We focus on those who get really sick, but 95 to 98 percent of those who get the virus don’t have to go to the hospital,” Dr. Elledge said. “There are a lot of people who do get better.”

I wonder if many folks who are causing unnecessary alarm over this pandemic have read this quote.

In particular, Dr. Fauci who has gone on to create an industry of alarmists - who in the long run will be proven as wrong as all these pollsters who told us about 2020 election.

As to the kids having an inane immunity - not surprised at all.

Many of us adults -  I am 71 - run to a pharmacy or a doctor at the first sign of a sniffle.  Most of the time, these medicines either mask symptoms or probably kill natural defenses.

And with no such options, kids and their bodies fight it out these viruses on their own.

It has been observed that folks who are extremely fastidious about cleanliness (Howard Hughes comes to mind) - actually end up getting infected more often than others.

I have traveled to some 114 countries and lived in over 10 countries from Indonesia, Scotland, India, West Africa among many - I think my body has been assaulted by many viruses.

And knock on wood, so far - while living in Bogota, Colombia  - I have fended off Wuhan virus."
2020-11-12 15:45:00,"This doesn't quite add up.

For it to work, we need effective contact tracing and a fast, available test, but we don't have either. Most people have no idea that they are sick until they have symptoms, and it still takes two or three days to get test results. Getting a treatment when you test positive 10 days before showing symptoms is a pipe dream.

Later, when we have enough control to do contact tracing and fast turnaround testing, it will be quite the thing. Until then it is like using American wrenches to work on a metric automobile."
2020-11-12 16:23:07,No contest: front line medical workers should get it.
2020-11-12 18:32:43,"It was fodder for late night comedians, but it's not a joke. Why in the world would Eli Lilly name a drug Bamlanivimab? How is a consumer, already anxious about getting a positive covid diagnosis, supposed to be able to ask for the medicine that is supposed to save his or her life? 

Yes, I practiced for a couple of minutes and I can say it now, but I didn't just receive news that I have covid. Why put a patient through this?

Two years ago I had to learn to pronounce ""spondylolisthesis"" but that's a piece of cake compared to ""Bamlanivimab"".

Did no one at the Times think that it was worthwhile to investigate why this particular name was chosen? Does it have some biochemical significance? Is it a mashup of the names of four researchers? (I really hope that's not the case) 

Come on NYTimes, this IS information that's Fit to Print."
2020-11-12 20:15:06,"For this to work for society, we will need new leadership at the national level who will install contract tracing protocols nationwide.  Let the medical profession make decisions regarding who get treated in what order.  Having said that, I think people who refuse to wear masks should be last."
2020-11-12 20:51:39,But why isn’t it Regeneron? What is different about this drug?
2020-11-13 03:48:36,"I don't see how you would go about accessing this drug. Who would administer the intravenous injections? Who administers them now if hospitals don't? Also, this treatment makes it imperative that we have fast turnaround times for PCR tests since it won't do any good to find out you're positive 10 days after testing.

We need national leadership engaged in solving these kinds of problems. The Trump administration is ignoring the pandemic entirely."
2020-11-10 13:35:40,"Please don’t be so optimistic that Biden, Harris and Democrats are going to occupy the White House as usual. Be realistic about darn serious effects of Republican resistance against Biden becoming a legitimate president. They are ready to swallow the worst scenario: divided Union and divided people. With this readiness they can do anything to destroy a transition of power, smooth or not-so smooth."
2020-11-10 14:18:19,"Until the vaccine is released, what can actually be done? personally, I believe the country has to accept the rise in virus rates until people start receiving the vaccine. Masks are not 100% effective or anywhere close to that. Yet, people should keep wearing masks to slow the spread, and that is important. The biggest issue is protecting those most vulnerable to the virus; the rest of us have to accept we may get the virus in the short term. Americans are not going to accept some sort of complete ""lock-down"" as a measure. The biggest thing we can do is learn from this pandemic and adjust our strategy in preparation for future events."
2020-11-10 15:25:30,"Epidemiologists DO disagree about the effectiveness of masks; not everything Trump says is wrong.

They agree that masks are better than no masks, but not about how much better.  That surely depends on the mask (N95 is better than your bandana), how well it is fitted, and lots more, all unquantifiable.

Don't confuse the yes-no question (does wearing a mask reduce risk, to which the answer is certainly ""yes"") with the quantitative question (by how much?).

Wear a mask, but don't expect a miracle.  The current increase in cases, when almost everyone is wearing a mask of some sort in public, shows that masks are only partially effective."
2020-11-10 14:35:06,"My prediction about Trump:  Right now he's giving no thought to the pandemic, and is instead fully focused on himself and his inability to accept his loss.  

After he gets past this stage, his thoughts about the pandemic will be solely focused on how he can use his remaining time to mold the pandemic to maximize pain for Biden, even if it means another 100,000 deaths that could be avoided.  His presidency is a tragedy."
2020-11-10 14:10:34,"This much is certain. When Biden decides on a COVID policy, the entire media establishment will mobilize to suppress dissenting views, for example, by castigating skeptics of reigning orthodoxies as “anti-science” or conspiracy theorists.

We can also expect social media to suppress heterodox views about masks, vaccines, and other COVID policies. How do I know? Because they already do.

Science journals  which have become highly politicized can also be expected to push the party line — both by what the publish and by rejecting studies or opinion pieces that refute establishment canon — making it seem as if all “experts” agree on officially approved policy.

The CDC, prior to changing its position on universal mask-wearing, had previously cited 10 randomized controlled trials that showed ""no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks."" Now, the CDC and other elite institutions would have us believe that coronavirus is somehow different.

A group of Danish researchers were the first to actually study the effect of large-scale universal mask-wearing specifically against the spread of COVID-19. Currently, the group is unable to find a journal willing to publish their ""controversial"" findings.

Biden, bereft any ideas that are actually novel or helpful, will call for mask mandates, just to give the impression that he doing something about Covid-19 that hasn't already been done during the Trump administration."
2020-11-10 14:30:46,"My sense is that the nation is finally waking up to the fact that this pandemic is just that--a pandemic. Although my traveling is limited, what public places I go to, I see a rigid adherence to mask wearing and people going out of their way to social distance. Sadly, Trump's macho man rebellion against mask wearing caused a lot of unnecessary deaths, but, just with a few days as President-elect, I feel we can defeat this virus."
2020-11-10 15:25:05,"Pandemic out of control, and even Trump too, as he (Trump) still not willing to leave the White House by accepting his defeat gracefully. What options still left for Trump to stay in White House?"
2020-11-10 14:21:34,"Hospitalizations have doubled nationwide since late September, and there's renewed talk of rationing care.

Show some discipline, America, and get back to flattening the curve.

Wear a mask and social distance to slow the spread."
2020-11-10 14:58:35,"This wearing mask thing is hysterical! Anyone in healthcare knows it helps when in close proximity but it is by no means the end all. 
Biden can wear talk the talk but he’s not going to have any better handle on this virus. It’s a pandemic. It has a life of its own. It doesn’t respond or recognize ordinary measures. You’re all talking as if this was a cold. It isn’t. Look around the world. 
Best advice is cleanliness and sanitation and yes avoiding close contact. But even that may not be enough. We need therapeutics and a vaccine. End of story! 
There are no absolutes about who is more susceptible. As in any sickness, younger is better, a more active and vibrant immune system. 
If Biden wants to unite Americans then he should stop talking as if he has the answers here. He doesn’t! Another group of medical experts is not going to change a thing. You all bought into a fallacy."
2020-11-10 15:25:44,"Republicans must be scared to death. A fierce and disciplined acting may put the virus back to low levels in about 2 months. Others did that before. Then the first distributions of the vaccin appear and society can reopen in the course of april. Biden will get the credits. It kan be speeded up by two months if the outgoing presdent cooperates.
Instead they try to cut off financial resources for the Biden government. Sabotage behind a veil of austerity. Stagnation of growth will follow. Can Biden break this political game or will the GOP put politics first and America second?"
2020-11-10 14:55:19,"It's America and we are free to do as we please. No matter who is president there is 1/2 of the population who disagrees with them on some level. Biden will never be able to mandate masks or vaccines. Nothing will change except we the swamp will be able to take over the government once again. The states should rebuke any lockdown efforts by Biden as they any benefit will be offset by the further destruction of the economy for families.

I'll add that who in their right mind is going to take a rushed vaccine for a virus that may or may not affect them, much less kill them. I will be taking a pass on being a tester."
2020-11-10 13:44:28,"it is awfully interesting that the vaccine news came out just days after the election.  Now before you start shouting at me, let's not forget that you have been on the trump conspiracy theories for the past 4 years.  And the anti trumpers are not without conspiracy guilt.  See HC and the Steele dossier, the whole Russia-gate influencing nonsense and you can't think theres not even a little hanky panky with Hunter.  And let's not forget the media has proven, and this particular outlet has even admitted, to being anti-trump and worked every day to discredit him.  While I'm sure you disagree, ponder this, in the past 4 plus years, has this outlet ever written 1 single article praising trump on something or even saying he did the smallest thing right?  We all know the answer is no. My counter is, no one is that perfect all the time. No one can be wrong every single time.  Its statistically impossible.  So before you fly off the handle, take a deep breath and think about it.  I didn't say it happened, I just said its an awfully interesting coincidence."
2020-11-10 13:41:09,"On the NYT homepage this morning, stories about Trump dominate the entire upper half. I count seven. 

This story concerning the president-elect, COVID, public health and the new vaccine is relegated to third-class status. 

Usually at this point in a presidential election, the news is all about the incoming administration and future plans. Surveying various media, including NPR, over the last few days, that doesn't seem to be the case. 

I often think that Trump is the right choice for the US today. If we are honest about wanting to turn the page on this era, we need to engage in a lot of self reflection."
2020-11-10 14:56:22,"It’s still a free country so … I would like to have laws passed requiring everyone  to social distance in large public gatherings and wear masks, with the exception of supporters of Donald Trump who believe that their souls and the souls of their children, parents, friends and coworkers  are badly wanted in Heaven."
2020-11-10 13:34:06,"Because of Trump’s abject failure to use his powers under the DPA to order the production of a sufficient number of coronavirus testing kits (indeed, Trump actively worked against testing because “the more you test, the more cases you find”), his complete failure to insist on contact tracing and quarantining of infected individuals, and of course his refusal to model proper behavior (mask wearing, social distancing), the US now has a a record number of coronavirus cases and deaths — and the situation is growing worse by the day.

President-elect Biden has a moral obligation to do what he can prior to taking office to implore people to wear masks, socialky-distance, wash their hands, and not gather indoors.   

And for those spreading lies claiming masks don’t work because “87% of people are already wearing them” — have you been to North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, or Missouri lately?  If so, you’ll see with your own eyes the opposite of mask-wearing compliance.  Or perhaps just watch two White House superspreader events on TV —where virtually none of the invitees are wearing masks.  Kinda hard to deny the absence of mask-wearing and social distancing, and the refusal to comply with crowd size limitations.  And kinda hard to deny the entirely predictable results — a huge number if Covid cases."
2020-11-10 15:06:22,"The pandemic is not of control. What is out of control is the absolute hysteria and fear mongering by the Pravda press and Democrat leaders.  

I live in a small rural town of 2000 and have had the virus.  Many of my friends have had it as well and we are all fine.  The virus needs to run its course and weaken enough to die out.  Putting on the brakes and reducing the host counts is not good science, it's panic.  It will only assure another ""wave"" when we come out of our cocoons."
2020-11-10 14:51:51,Thanks to the republicans it’s already too late.
2020-11-10 15:59:40,Many like Socrates believe strongly in the benefits of the mask.  I agree with wearing the masks too however there’s a wide range of mask types being worn and many are of no use.  The stylish mask and the bandanna are examples.  Plus the effective masks are not 100%. So what we will see is more media support for Biden no matter what he says or does relative to covid.  Trump encouraged vaccine development and although the liberals voiced doubt and negative discourse then they will now embrace the vaccine. It’s an odd mix of politics and health.
2020-11-10 15:45:23,President-elect Biden is doing the work Trump should have done but we have to wait an excruciating 2+ months in which we will have a spiked death toll while Trump whines in self-pity. This is a legacy of depraved indifference to human life.
2020-11-10 16:40:07,"Certainly more than a few bitter Trumpsters posting here.  I guess the fact of the Biden-Harris win is too much for them to take.  Perhaps they've forgotten that presidents who treat all Americans and international allies with respect, and actually work for the money taxpayers send to the federal government on their behalf, tend to produce better outcomes than serial grifters, liars, traitors, and cheats."
2020-11-10 16:18:28,"Biden taking charge is all well and good but he's not ""in charge"" until Jan. 20. We don't have two months to spare under the current Covidiot-in-Chief. States will have to take charge."

Biden got it right from his first speech."
2020-11-10 12:39:55,"Joe may be moving quickly on naming his pandemic team, but he can't do anything until inauguration day.   Lives will be lost between now and then, because Trump is acting like a king in exile with an extraordinary grip on maintaining the fantasy that the election was fraudulent.

We are far out of the woods when it comes to the pandemic, because if Biden can't transition smoothly--which seems to be the case--he can't even start to tackle this virus and prepare the vital distribution plans for the number of promising vaccines that may soon approach the approval stage.

Trump's decision to prevent any transfer of powers is endangering pandemic response.   Even if Biden does finally get installed, 70 million Americans aren't going along with their responsibilities in containing Covid-19."

I was going to take a weekend vacation at a B&B. The area it is in is melting down from COVID-19, and it's in a county were people don't really wear masks. Why? Freedom. 

I canceled the reservation, and the owner was hysterical. She had 6 reservations, and all of them are canceled. I was the last one. I wanted to tell her, if I wanted to vaycay in a hot zone, I'd pick somewhere more exotic.

“One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

“I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

After seven months of fighting this, community spread is returning. Cases are beginning to surge, hospitalizations are increasing, and the number of people in the ICU and on ventilators is growing in our area. We never had it down to zero, but we did flatten the curve somewhat over the summer. Yet, as the premature push to ""get back to business"" and force people to work under dangerous conditions continues, and with a recalcitrant Senate refusing to pay people to stay home, the situation is not looking good for Americans."

His administration is arguing to destroy the Affordable Care Act in the Supreme Court today.

Thanks to this administration’s determination to encourage the spread the virus, it is now unlikely anyone will ever be able to prove where they got it.

Secondly, I don't have to ""work"" from home either!

If I were still in the working population though, I'd so much want to be in the office -- provided of course that it's ""safe"".

""Going to work"" each day had meaning.  It helped me order both my daily routine and overall life balance.  Back then, I'd much rather stay late in the office and work than ""violate"" my personal space with job-related tasks other than may a bit of reading.

I don't envy people today who either have to or want to work from home.  I liked having a job and a career.  But it didn't define ""who I am"" such that I couldn't draw boundaries between ""the job"" and ""me""."

How does their HVAC system connect to other tenants in the building, and are other tenants taking all the same precautions?

I’m sure the work they do here is *easier* with in-person collaboration, but don’t toy companies regularly collaborate across oceans with overseas factories? Mail out some material swatches to everyone in a meeting to decide what your next bear should feel like. Smart leaders are making an effort to embrace Zoom and other virtual tools to support their employees by prioritizing their safety. This guy comes across as a Scrooge focused on making sure his rent isn’t being paid for nothing. I sympathize, but he’s far from alone in paying for an empty building right now and this denial that we’re still in the thick of a pandemic by insisting a shift back from remote work is not the move. As others have said, he doesn’t employ surgeons.

I think a primary question from job seekers to potential employers moving forward should be “what steps did you take to protect your staff during the pandemic, and when did you take those steps” - I plan to ask it well after  the pandemic is over. The answer reveals a lot."

If the answer is, ""We never skipped a beat,"" there's not a good reason to make employees come to the office. My company reopened the office in June, but we're flexible on work arrangements. The state's guidance says we can operate at 50% capacity, but on any given day we probably have about 25% of our employees physically present. It's not a fun place to be right now - daily health screenings; no break rooms, refrigerators, water coolers or coffee makers; one microwave for the building; no more than three people for an in-person meeting. If our folks can get the job done from home, why make them deal with that?"
2020-11-10 13:45:54,"Most of the other commenters have said what I was thinking, but my favorite point is that the project manager who wasn’t comfortable going into the office found a remote job that paid her more (a no-brainer, to quote her). A good reminder that a job is a job."
2020-11-10 13:51:43,The health protocols sound perfectly adequate. I’d like to know if he made any arrangements for the employees dealing with remote school and cancelled childcare? That is what keeps me out of my very safe office.
2020-11-10 13:54:20,This kind of move is only really feasible where the schools have fully reopened.
2020-11-10 13:55:45,"Mr. Foreman says it was all about efficiency, yet he will fire people who won’t come to work in his office everyday.  He whines  about the cost of office space. This is about money, power and control, nothing else.

I have directed and worked on creative projects remotely for more than 20 years. Being in an office, where 25-30% of the time spent is wasted or non-productive, is much worse than working remote."

2020-11-10 14:04:09,"I wish them all well.  If they are careful and respectful of one another, if they follow the rules and document what and how they are working together, it will likely work.  My partner and his brother, who lives with us, have been in the workplace every day since the beginning of the pandemic.  We all have to be very careful.  So far, so good."
2020-11-10 14:05:54,"In addition to the measures like masks, distancing and hand sanitizer, etc., has Mr. Forman instituted a testing  & contact tracing protocol? If someone tests positive, is there a quarantine policy? What if a family member of his staff becomes ill and the employees has to quarantine? Or is it going to be up to individual employees to get themselves tested? Lots of unanswered questions. And, btw, insisting that someone living with a family member undergoing cancer treatment should return to the office is positively inhumane. Expecting her to expose her spouse, whose immunity is now compromised, so that she can ""collaborate"" at the office is callous and selfish. But hey, he's got rent to pay, so it's all good."
2020-11-10 14:09:29,"I'd 100% be looking for a new job. And I was a job-seeker who interviewed here, I'd be asking what the company did to protect workers during the pandemIc and when I heard the owner was  requiring all people back in the office because ""remote work is hard"" and ""commercial rent is high"" then I'd withdraw."
2020-11-10 14:18:43,"No mention of ventilation and/or filtration in this article.  That should have been asked about by the reporter. 

It's great that they're wearing masks, they're effective, but not totally.   There's not excuse for not also doing more to change or filter the air."
2020-11-10 14:21:31,"With the right measures in place, they should be ok. Good for him and his company. Others have been working through this Pandemic because that us the nature of their jobs. Healthcare workers are exposed to this virus on a daily basis."

2020-11-10 14:34:31,"His excuse he is paying rent is lame. Either way he pays rent. But his employees working from home is actually SAVING him money! His electric bill, water bill, phone bill, internet bill, etc should ALL be less with people not in the office. Also the chance of a workplace injury goes down (think someone who trips at the office and the ensuing medical bills). In addition, employees worrying if someone in the next cube has covid and bringing the virus home. Many employers are actually finding they are Saving money by having their employees work from home. One other last expense he is forgetting about, if a coronavirus outbreak occurs these employees will be using his company sponsored health insurance and HIS rates will increase next year. Good luck to those employees to stay safe. I'd be looking for a new job."
2020-11-10 14:40:02,"Businesses are required to comply with health and safety guidelines.  San Francisco, for example, currently requires employers of office based workers to ""strongly encourage all Personnel who can perform their work remotely to telecommute to the greatest extent feasible"".  In other words employers can't unnecessarily require staff to travel to/from and work at an office.  The personal preferences of employers or employees are not relevant any more than they are to the question of whether to wear a hardhat on a construction site.  Jay Foreman argues that it is essential for his staff work on site.  It is a dangerous argument and for many employers not easy to defend.  The risk for employers is they return to the office, fail to comply with health guidelines (guess what, accidents happen), employees contract the virus and sue.  Or they comply and employees sue anyway.  It's not just about getting CV at the office, it's about getting it and spreading it to children, spouses, grand parents etc who then die.  General liability insurance policies don't cover employers for risks arising from employees suing them over Covid.  Good luck."
2020-11-10 14:40:57,"This may work for people who can drive to work and are the sole occupants in the building, or at least the floor.

No matter what safety protocols my employer puts in place I still have to walk the gauntlet to get to my desk."
2020-11-10 14:44:52,"Teachers were forced back to work in August and September. If we are back at schools with students who refuse to consistently wear masks and socially distance, I don't feel bad for office workers who face fewer risks. This is why you all were so desperate to force a return to in-person school, right? So you could work without interruptions? Go in to the office."
2020-11-10 13:55:50,"One employee illness, much less one related death, make this argument moot."
2020-11-10 13:38:24,"Even though the employer says he voted for President elect Biden, he sure as heck seems to follow the Republican beliefs on the virus; false narrative on in person collaboration; expense of rent as reason to make employees return instead of CDC guidelines on safety; take it or leave it policy for the October in person requirement for his business.

I wish the author of the article would have addressed the following; did the employer apply for and receive any PPP funds? I noticed he started making employees return to in person work in June; Florida experienced its highest outbreak of coronavirus in July and August; did the employer reverse his decision until infection rates fell back down? 

Don’t pat yourself on your back too hard Mr. Foreman, you might injure your elbow."
2020-11-10 14:15:01,"Everyone is bringing out the pitchforks for this guy. But, do you not get food from the grocery store? Household supplies from Target? Clothes, shoes, gas? Medical care? Dental care? All of those places are filled with people who are going to work every day, and most have been without a break since last March. Even if you use a delivery service, you are sending a worker in to crowded stores every day. So tired of all of this false outrage. Or do we only care about the lives of people whose absence from work doesn't impact the convenience of our own lives?"

2020-11-10 14:44:29,"There was no mention of sick leave  benefits, co-pay coverage, etc. I doubt Mr. Foreman is going to make up the difference in income should his employees get sick.  Probably just another ""tough luck, I didn't rent this building so you could stay home"" comment is all they'll get.  

That conference room, unless specially ventilated  is a petri dish after 20 minutes, sitting every-other chair is worthless.  Worthless.  If ventilation upgrades haven't been made, if the AC isn't running in ""full fresh air"" mode, which is expensive, it's not a safe workplace.

Is every member of Mr. Foreman's family in the office all day?  Somehow I doubt it.

It's hard not to look greedy when that's what you are."
2020-11-10 13:15:42,The cost of doing business should not include peoples' lives.
2020-11-10 14:51:21,"Just wait until the first employee gets sick and dies and his family sues them into oblivion. Even if nobody gets sick, this type of attitude will lead to a lower quality workforce. Why work for someone who puts profits over health when there are many companies embracing WFH and finding it is productive and makes employees happy?"
2020-11-10 14:52:00,"So much mischief in the name of a return to an old normal that is gone for good. A once in 100 years pandemic infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands should inspire some fear and radical behavior change. And we are seeing in real time what happens when too many let down their guard.  The other sadly recurring event is our inability to keep up with the rapidly changing science about covid.  Hand sanitizer and masks yes but now also how many people packed for how long indoors with no mention of air circulation, meeting spaces, lunch time, etc. Ironically, the workers wanting a change, shot down for seeking flexibility to work a few days at home, are the very ones who by decreasing the number of people in the office would likely save a few lives in the bargain."
2020-11-10 14:52:33,"Mr. Foreman is right when he says he has made his offices as safe as being at home. He's just not right in the way that he means. 

Gatherings at home as we go into fall have been tagged as one of the biggest culprits when it comes to coronavirus transmission. People indoors, with the windows closed, and not having masks on continuously creates an ideal atmosphere for the virus to spread. That is precisely the environment Mr. Foreman has created. Telling people to wear a mask only when they're up walking around is next to pointless - he doesn't think they're shedding virus when they're at their desk talking on the phone or conversing with a co-worker? And without either the windows open or an exceptional ventilation system, those particles have nowhere to go. 

There's a reason experts are saying to skip family gatherings this year, and it's the same reason offices like this one need to remain closed. 

As for the risk-benefit analysis that apparently convinced Mr. Foreman to make this move, it's clear he was not considering the risk to his workers. Even if you assume the risk of anyone dying is relatively low, what about the risk of someone getting sick for months, or longer? Developing long term impairments that make impossible for them to continue to do their job and destroy their quality of life? Somehow letting an office building sit empty for awhile longer seems a very, very small price to pay when you consider the REAL risks employees are running by working in person."
2020-11-10 14:54:13,"I have no issues with Mr. Foreman safely returning employees to the office. However, do none of these people have children?  My kids are on a hybrid school schedule and at 9 and 6, I can’t really leave them home alone to return to the office.  No mention of how he is accommodating the working parents."
2020-11-10 14:55:13,"I am working from home until next summer. I am fine with that. My body is apprecating the rest. I am organizing my home, eating better and started practicing yoga. I will be ready to go back into the office in Fall 2022.

That said, a significant percentage of my colleagues are not doing well and want to get back to the office. My employer is working on a solution for those employees to go back in early next year. 

Mr. Foreman could have come up with options for his employees. They  could have come in for collaborative meetings only. He only wants them in to justify the rent payments."
2020-11-10 14:57:38,"As someone who's been back in a workplace setting since June, I had more questions the story doesn't answer:

1. What is their HVAC situation? Filtered? Externally sourced? Recycled? Etc. 
2. Masks and distance are fine. But are they doing temperature checks? Symptom accounting?
3. Rent is never a good reason. Couldn't people be on-site as needed?
4. What is the health care/insurance situation at this company?

I have others, but overall, I felt a lot more context was needed to fully understand this specific return to work scenario. 

Where I work (in higher ed,) only a handful of us have returned. Most people have remained remote. The remote people don't seem as busy as the onsite people, as we are directly providing services, but they also aren't able to know as much about what's happening, as they aren't here. A strange imbalance for sure. More people could return, as they have private offices, but they've been able to choose not to return. (Also, our HVAC is garbage.) 

I suspect a lot of companies will make the opposite move as Mr. Foreman. They will keep people remote, stop renting office space. Look at NYC. Why pay that much for offices when everyone can be at home where the company isn't paying for phone/data/etc. If people need to meet, pick a Starbucks. (Something I see in my neighborhood all the time when I grab a morning coffee on my way to work.)"
2020-11-10 15:01:02,"Think about this:  almost every doctor office is open, but they are taking safety precautions e.g. daily temperature checks, mask wearing, hand washing, and social/work distancing.  If this were not safe, then we would be hearing about doctor offices being “spreader” events. 
In other words, you can open offices if you are safe about it. 
Look Trump was incompetent. He and his staff are non thinkers. They are not problem solvers. Their only concern was marketing and profiting. The rest of us can be and are different. There are safe ways to work in an office. It may take some trial and error and it will require constant vigilance and readjustment. But it can be done!"
2020-11-10 15:07:08,"This is exactly why testing is still important.  PBC does have a few testing sites, probably more than other areas because of Trump's close relationship with the Covidiot governor. But still not enough.  Our numbers here are rising since the Covidiot decided to open up everything.   And he has done nothing since Day 1 except try to find ways to hide the cause of Covid deaths.  He even refused to mandate masks.
Now the Republican governor of Utah went even further and made students and teachers report to work even if someone tests positive. That was in Sept/Oct.  Yesterday he had to declare a state of emergency and actually mandated masks...maybe since Trump lost he felt comfortable doing that.  
Had testing been Trump's main objective,  most businesses and schools would be open.  But Trump wanted to hide the numbers.  (Still trying to hide numbers with the election!)
When people start to get comfortable, that's when the problem starts!!"
2020-11-10 15:13:08,No way. I would find an attorney if I were to lose my job because of working remotely. Until a vaccine is administered this is straight up workplace abuse.
2020-11-10 15:13:33,"Near the end of the article, I noticed that he is allowing all employees to work from home on Fridays. So it is not quite the absolute Full Time that the beginning of the story implies.

As for this company? The owner has more than rent to pay, like property taxes, liability insurance, electric and heating and AC all stay about the same, since if the building freezes so do the pipes, which then burst. If the building overheats then the computers fry. 

For employees, working from home requires extra space, money, especially for families with multiple people working/going to school, so I am left to wonder if many of your commenters all have large homes? 

Whether this business owner should be asking people to come back or not, is a hard question and I don't like him forcing the last woman mentioned....but it's not as simple as some commentators make it sound either."
2020-11-10 15:15:58,"I predict Mr. Foreman and Basic Fun will be served with a lawsuit within 6 months.  All it takes is one case, one death. And the US is the most litigious nation on earth.  Is going back to the office and hanging around the water cooler really worth it? 

I would suggest leaders and managers everywhere focus on managing the work, not managing the people, and everything else takes care of itself."
2020-11-10 15:17:03,"My newly college-graduated son is working his first job in his chosen field at a company that pays lip service to Covid protocols but does not, in fact, pay attention to them. People are continuously getting Covid, recovering, and returning to the office - and all the while, masks and social distancing are not only ignored but mocked. He is actively looking for a new job. In the meantime he shows up every day wearing an N95 to try and protect himself.  He has no student loans and is living at home for his first year post-graduation in order to save money. Should he stay or should he go, right now, without another position lined up yet? He is turmoil asking himself this question every minute of every day."
2020-11-10 15:18:04,"Sitting in an office with hundreds of people is as safe as sitting in your car because your wearing a mask and have access to sanitizer?  I’m not sure Dr.Fauci would agree.  

Horrible that this man is making his employees choose between the health and safety of their family and being able to make the mortgage payments because they “need” to be able to touch the toys."
2020-11-10 15:02:06,"I’m disappointed with the reporter. 

As many comments have pointed out, what about the shared HVAC system? What about employees with small children? What is it about his business that is soooo unique and  special that it can’t remain productive when so many other similar companies have figured it out?"
2020-11-10 15:20:37,"Thank god Silicon Valley companies have more sense than Mr Foreman.  We have been wfh since March and that isn’t likely to change anytime soon.   

No one is complaining.  Companies have adjusted and support employees."
2020-11-10 15:21:13,"Many professionals work in services that are largely computerized, and where the end product is words and numbers. So, I try to have empathy for workers in manufacturing and sales. Even if most work is electronic, sometimes, it really helps me to meet to engage with the product.

However, it would be a lot better if people were still home part time and agreed on one or two days to be in the office to have essential face-to-face meetings, rather than come in every day like zombies.."

2020-11-10 15:27:20,"This article continuously quotes Mr. Foreman saying it's necessary to work in person in order to be efficient and collaborate, but nowhere does it quantify it.  How much business has he lost due to his team not being able to deliver because they are less efficient?  While I can appreciate his sleepless nights, I'm not confident Mr. Foreman has even crunched the numbers on the risk/reward of his decision."
2020-11-10 15:32:15,"I hear every so often the argument about ""active cooperation requires in-person interactions"". I worked on international teams for years, never meeting in person and I'm personally very comfortable with it. I've also never been a very social person, and as a scientist require focus for my work more than chatter. 
But I understand some people are starved for that interaction and are finding it very difficult to work remotely. However, it seems to me like it is mostly managers arguing for in-person and they are usually the ones to make this decision, but it's not surprising, they tend to be people persons.
Do we have unbiased data on the efficiency of a remote meeting versus a live one, maybe depending on your position?

(Also, wouldn't it be great if managers acknowledged we don't teleport to work and can't always eat our lunches in seclusion at work?)"
2020-11-10 15:35:43,"I work for a large company with many locations that has been back in the office/factory since July, and despite my own initial skepticism, there have been no outbreaks or transmission of any kind.  Masks, increased distancing, virtual meetings, temperature checks, and the flexibility to work from home if there’s any minor symptom seem to be very effective.  I would have never opted back in to the office if I had my druthers, but I do find productivity and mental health benefits from having a separate workspace."
2020-11-10 15:35:52,"The continued ineptitude and lack of creative leadership displayed by CEOs during the pandemic will lead to a reinvigoration of labor unions.  Big Fun’s CEO did not present data or proof that productivity had fallen when his employees worked from home, or take into account the lack of productivity if (when) the virus infects his entire office and his skyrocketing health insurance costs if that happens.  CEOs do not deserve to make 287x more than their workers when they continue to make myopic decisions that will not only endanger their employees, but also the future of their companies.  Companies are the employees, without them, companies fail."
2020-11-10 15:36:49,He really needs to invest in a good virtual reality system. With the right virtual reality system his employees could all still work from home but be virtually in the same room and able to interact with each other in a much safer manner. In the long run this will save him a huge amount of money as well.
2020-11-10 15:39:45,"Universities in Oklahoma are making NO provision for vulnerable faculty or staff. Employees over 65, or with diabetes or heart conditions, in cancer treatments, etc. are told that they must be found disabled under the federal law before any accommodation will be made. Our cases are burgeoning, doubled in number per day in the last week. But these teachers and workers must come daily to work with students most likely to have the virus and least likely to show it. If you can be remote, if you’ve successfully worked that way—the bosses don’t care. They want to ignore the virus here—and people will die of it."
2020-11-10 15:42:58,"It's always fun for me to see the executives making decisions like this, and then they go back to their private offices with walls and doors. It's hilarious to me that they thing nothing of requiring employees to be comfortable in their cubicles with plexiglass dividers, all while breathing the same air as their coworkers. 

Sorry, Mr. Foreman, but your employees' lives are more important than your frustration at paying rent for an empty office. Unless you can show that productivity has dipped in the past few months, then this is about nothing more than your crankiness about paying rent."
2020-11-10 15:43:21,"Fear may be a bad reason not to return to work, but staying home is not about fear. Cases of Covid-19 are exploding exponentially. The reality is that the virus does not care who fears it, and the economy can not recover until the virus is controlled. If we all stayed home for a few weeks and wore face masks outside of the home, the opportunity to return to the office would come that much sooner."
2020-11-10 15:41:32,"I love how the NYT spends all year telling readers that Trump isn't taking the virus seriously because he wants people to go back to work, and then when Biden is elected there is a front-page article telling people to go back to work.

No wonder some people don't believe the news.  The virus is totally out of control and wearing masks is not a panacea.  Staying 10 feet away from everyone outside works.  That's what I'm doing."

2020-11-10 15:46:05,"Another article about how we all need to go back to the office to save the office real estate market.

Not much creativity required to produce Care Bears and Marios that look just the same as 40 years ago.

It's cute how Mr. Foreman has his sleeves rolled up, showing he is ready to get to work."
2020-11-10 15:55:42,"As expected most of the comments here are thrashing Mr. Foreman for his decision.  I'd bet most of the people commenting have never owned a business (and consulting out of the spare bedroom office doesn't count!).

Most of us have been paycheck recipients, few have been responsible for issuing them.  Until you are faced with making decisions about how to keep your company afloat you are seeing only one side of the equation.  Mr. Foreman understands his business and if he was seeing a drop in productivity without in-person collaboration who are his employees to doubt that?  They don't see the balance sheets.

Mr. Foreman should be applauded for blazing the trail that will put US business back on track.  He is not alone in the idea that in-office collaboration is an essential part of many types of businesses.  By being brave enough to research the best ways to provide a safe working environment and asking employees to come back he is helping all businesses going forward.

I attended a kayak symposium that took the same approach.  Even though Michigan was seeing case increases last July, the organizers did reasonable things to keep us safe and to my knowledge not a single case of illness resulted (even though a lot people kept forgetting to pull up their buffs).  Some people canceled their attendance because of fear.  That was their choice based on their circumstances: I attended based on mine.

We have to get past the fear and back to business."
2020-11-10 15:56:29,"In my 30 years in corporate America I have rarely met a manager comfortable with employees working from home.  Very few can trust people enough, or manage by deliverables.  If they are not “alpha dogging” and actively watching people they don’t feel in control.  Recalling employees to the office is more for their comfort than to increase productivity."
2020-11-10 15:58:23,"Even if Mr. Foreman's workplace is safe, for a workplace, it is definitely not as safe as working from home.  Workers do not have N95 masks.  Asymptomatic spreaders can easily infect others.   Workers are touching surfaces that others outside of their household have touched.  When working from home, I have control over many, many things that I would not have control over in my office.  It's not a matter of fear, it's a matter of safety, and the fact is that some people are more vulnerable than others.  Most of them don't want to get COVID or give it to others and some would do anything they could to avoid it.  That's not fear, it's common sense."
2020-11-10 15:58:25,"There are many of these little companies around the country — a lot of them private — where the CEO is the founder or something of a father figure, and everything he says or does is gospel inside the offices.  While they are valuable to the national employment picture, they are often not the best or most advanced places to work in terms of salaries,  benefits and other employment practices.  Rather than looking at state-of-the-art Human Resources trends and applying them, these companies turn to the CEO for all the wisdom in how things are run.

The fact that Mr. Foreman has deemed himself an epidemiological expert and thinks that masks, sanitizer and six feet are all that’s necessary for his employees to avoid infection tells you all you need to know about the place.  I wish the employees good luck.  I would be looking for another job."
2020-11-10 15:58:42,"Fantastic piece, and one that hits home for many of us.

I found myself reacting poorly to this business owner's decision-making and communication on this issue.  I have no reason to distrust his claim of having sleepless nights over this issue, he has put his employees in a position of having to choose between a paycheck and personal & familial safety.  What a horrendous position to put people in unnecessarily!  

This idea of a safe workspace is a great one - until the first employee contracts Covid-19.  This is especially concerning in the cases mentioned of sick or high-risk family members back home.  Is that male employee seriously expected to put his daughter's health at risk just so that he can sit live in a conference room?  Are there not exceptions that can be made in such cases?

I also work in a highly collaborative industry, one that has many similarities to the processes described here.  And we have made things work.  In fact, my company is reducing its office space and is now planning to transition to a blended home/office routine once the health crisis has passed.  

Some business must be conducted collaboratively and in person.  A product inspection and prototyping and all that involves a physical product that must be vetted, sure.  Meet safely.  But the world of ideas and communication does not require that we all breath the same air.  As nice as he seems, I found myself feeling grateful that I do not work under a CEO with this level of inflexibility."
2020-11-10 16:06:48,"Even if employees were wearing N95 masks all day, wouldn't they have to remove the masks to sip water or to eat lunch? Or do they have to go outside to do that? This doesn't seem practical or safe."
2020-11-10 16:09:30,"Would definitely be seeking another job if this were my boss. His choice shows that he cares more about minor conveniences (and the sunk cost of his building) than about his employees' lives and health. 

He could have found creative solutions like holding meetings outside a few times a week (they are in Florida where that would work in winter). Instead he is dragging people together into an enclosed space full-time. Wearing masks helps, but they are sharing air all day, so it's not a 100% solution.

This pandemic has killed 200,000+ Americans and left countless others with debilitating health problems that they may have for the rest of their lives. The wish to avoid unnecessary exposure to the virus seems pretty logical to me. It's not an unreasonable ""fear"" on the part of employees."
2020-11-10 16:13:43,From the picture it looks like a run of the mill office with everyone in their own cubicle. Now perhaps every other cubicle. So where's the all important collaboration happening or was it always about rent and control. Why not let those who want to return do so and others work remotely? The result will speak for itself. We recently have had many employees start coming in instead of remote working. I haven't noticed an up tick in quantity or quality of work just an increase in the noise in the office.
2020-11-10 16:28:35,"“Fear is not an appropriate reason for not being at work”

I hope this man takes a step back as a human being and takes a good hard look at that sentence. People are terrified of death, permanent disability, or harming their families and yet you're asking them to work under those conditions just to make yourself feel better about ""productivity"" and ""collaboration."" It's cruel and it's selfish pandering to his own emotions over those of his employees. 

It's 2020. Get creative about how people can work and collaborate. Paying too much rent? Maybe consider ways to downsize the office you don't really need.

The thought that cheerful toys are being made by employees being forced to work in unsafe conditions is horrifying."
2020-11-10 16:29:02,"I am disappointed that childcare and schooling is not mentioned in this piece.  I am working from home, managing my child’s attendance at remote kindergarten, and being urged to “get back to work”, meaning the office, by my leadership in my the same way as talked about in this article.   Even if I felt it was safe (and I don’t, nor does my state currently recommend it), I wouldn’t be able to because of remote schooling.  This single issue has got to be the biggest barrier to getting Americans back to the office - disproportionately affecting women, and it’s not mentioned once in this piece."
2020-11-10 16:34:33,"Unfounded fear is not an appropriate reason to not go to work. People's fear about the pandemic and catching the virus is real. It should not be dismissed. It is based on science, facts and a public health crisis we are in the middle of that is getting worse. To be honest I understand him wanting to bring people back there is a degree of collaboration that is better in person but what I don't like is dismissing people's real fears, circumstances and choices. People should have a choice until this virus is close to being gone."
2020-11-10 16:36:11,"In Colorado 1.5 people out of 100 have Coronavirus. I have to believe the ratio is greater in Florida.

This means that his office stands a very good chance of having at least one person in the office with Coronavirus every day. Unless everyone is wearing an N95 mask and face shield the risk of the virus spreading is high.

Imagine the concern for high risk employees like myself. If they contract the disease they stand a very good chance of dying or at least having life-long, chronic health issues.

I hope the owner has good liability insurance. He will need it."
2020-11-10 16:37:42,"I have been in the office since the beginning of April, and the rest of my department works at least one day in the office a week. Before the pandemic, our department had issues with communication and collaboration because a few people can't get along. Our department communication has been terrible, we just had an employee quit and the training for their job was handled poorly, and our payweek suffered because of it (I work conjunctly with payroll). We are all already overworked, and adding another overworked person's work on top of us was a recipe for disaster. Some departments can work remotely and still collaborate and communicate just fine, but mine is not one of them. Now I have no right to be the judge of when my coworkers should come back to work, it's really not that important to me in the end (of course their lives and families are), but I am looking forward to the day when we are all back in the office together, even if it means the catfights start again. This pandemic has brought out a lot of issues and I hope our department heads have seen that."
2020-11-10 16:43:24,"Not willing to risk his business, but certainly willing to risk the human beings he employs. I can't blame him individually – the system is rotten. It just isn't important to make toys."
2020-11-10 16:50:07,"That’s all well and good until the first person in his office tests positive, whether they contracted Covid at the office or somewhere else, and everyone has to self-quarantine for 2 weeks. Then no one will want to come back as cases soar this winter. Also, five feet distancing is not sufficient, the bare minimum is six feet, and 20  feet ideally recommended to keep people safe. No mention of ventilation in the place and whether he retrofitted his A/C system with expensive high quality HEPA filters that clean the air multiple times every hour. He’s got cute toys but definitely they’re none-essential products and the company’s name will be more than ironic - extremely sad - if any of his workers get severe cases of Covid. I applaud efforts made to keep people safe but it seems like an all or nothing set-up. I don’t agree that more of the work couldn’t have continued to be done remotely or he couldn’t have had more of a 50/50 compromise so workers who wanted to work remotely could have at least only had to come in 2-3 days at most. How much touching of a toy truly is necessary on a daily basis? Most product lines don’t change weekly or even monthly so that argument that his entire staff has to be there four days a week to touch the toys is nonsensical. Sounds like a big part of this decision to reopen full time was based on rent he was paying, but having a full office won’t change that equation given his business - unlike restaurants - could function remotely."
2020-11-10 16:56:01,The tech sector has found a way to work effectively from home. Some companies have found working remotely so effective they don't anticipate going back to the office - ever. Getting people back in the office is more about control than productivity. Seems Basic Fun lacks creativity and imagination in getting people to work together while staying apart.
2020-11-10 16:57:33,"We've just done the opposite after trickling back into the office these past two months - we're all back home. What we miss in connectivity and community is made up for in not getting sick. I feel for those not able to do the same. This will get better, but not for a long while."
2020-11-10 16:59:26,"I don't recall seeing any mention of any company based healthcare for the employees being in place to support them if they get sick.

Do they have a ""swear jar"" fund they use if someone gets the virus and needs hospitalization?"
2020-11-10 17:17:00,"I dread the possibility of having to return to the office because I'm high-risk and would almost certainly become very ill from COVID 19, and likely would not survive it. So I have no room for error in the actions I take to try to avoid it. I try to imagine how to mitigate the risk if I were forced to work onsite; I still would need to call or video into meetings from my desk because all meetings are in small shared-air spaces. I would not allow anyone into my cubicle. I would not print anything, use the common kitchens, or even walk around. This makes it seem extra-ridiculous that my presence would be required onsite, but people have to implement ridiculous decisions all the time.  But the only risk I couldn't mitigate is the shared bathrooms--those tiled-in airlocks. I suppose I could don an N95 mask and goggles, which would naturally inspire some degree of ridicule, so business credibility lost there.  I know how many at Basic Fun must have struggled with the same decisions--not out of fear, but out of rational risk assessment. I feel very sorry for the employees who realized how little their lives and those of their family members meant to their employer as they walked back into that building to do a job they were likely doing just as well from the safety of their homes."
2020-11-10 17:17:42,"I work in Corporate Finance, a function that is highly conducive to remote work.  My employer started calling people back to the office in June, and my group began returning in July.  I, however, have remained at home only because I’ve consistently voiced my concerns and criticized my employer’s approach, all at great risk to my job security.  I’ve been subtly pressured to return to the office ever since, and I continue to offer evidence and logic supporting my concerns, none of which is ever rebutted.  I feel like I’m under siege and could be fired at any time.  My office has reported 13 COVID cases in the ensuing months; each time they follow the CDC protocols and move on.  I’ve never been so outraged and insulted in my 20+ year career.  These people are completely obtuse and delusional, unable to comprehend the gravity and unprecedented nature of this historic moment.  I can’t believe they can so brazenly ask employees to risk infection by returning to the office to do a job they can safely and productively do from home.  My spouse is also working from home, and our 2 kids are doing 100% virtual school for at least this semester.  This “back to the office at any cost” cult is on the wrong side of history.  When working from home is a viable option, even asking employees to return to the office is an illegitimate, abusive, egregious overreach of an employer’s traditional authority."
2020-11-10 17:23:59,"I agree with Mr. Foreman and I applaud his having the backbone to take measures and make a decision in the face of no clear Federal and State guidance.  I think the longer you wait to get people back in the office the harder it will be to get them back in and the re-adjustment will be that much harder.  Of course, any return to the office has to be predicated on implementing safety measures to ensure social distancing, ventilation and mask wearing.  Good luck Mr. Foreman - wish you and your employees well!"
2020-11-10 17:27:47,"Our CEO has a completely different approach - the safety of our employees is number one. All 1600 of us are very appreciative of this. I don’t understand how a creative company can’t figure out ways to keep people engaged, motivated and still delivering cool toys. I agree seems to be a justification for the owner who can’t seem to accept that he is paying rent for an office that is empty."
2020-11-10 17:30:45,"Humans are social animals, regular face to face interaction with your ""pack"" is essential for a well functioning team.  This is particularly true where creativity and collaboration are required.  Notice I did not say ""everyday face to face interaction."" Each company will have to find the right mix of home vs office work that is right for them."
2020-11-10 17:35:48,"Dying for a stuffed animal? NO.  

What an awful situation for Foreman's employees.  Where is OSHA in all of this?

Under Biden, I hope there will be labor laws added to protect workers from choosing their life vs. their paycheck  when it comes to termination threats during extraordinary catastrophic public health events. 

Threatening employees  with termination, when there is no way that  this toy company can 100 per cent claim that their office will remain coronavirus free, should be against the law.

Who pays the hospital bills when an employee becomes critically ill?  What benefits does Foreman offer his workers?

And what about the venilation system in the office?  Has Foreman made  those expensive upgrades?

Toy companies do not provide an essential service.  I am appalled."
2020-11-10 17:35:55,"There certainly is a lot of armchair quarterbacking in the comments here so I'll add mine. From the reporting Mr Foreman seems to have done his homework, thought it through and through and came to a decision that's best for the company and his employees.

I wish those against his decision thought as much about the employees who manage the building Foreman leases from. Their jobs are every bit as important and would be lost if Foreman closed down the office."
2020-11-10 17:36:59,"I didn't see any numbers in this article on whether there was actuually any measurable drop in collaboration or productivity at this particular company, or any rise after he forced his workers back to the office. This leads me to believe this decision is all based on gut feelings, worries over sunk costs (rent) and ""that's how it's always been done"" thinking. I worry very much that all over the country this kind of selfish hunch-following is driving decisionmaking and jeopardizing lives. More than 1/4 million people in the US have died of COVID - forcing your workers back into the office on such thin evidence of necessity is absolutely villainous."
2020-11-10 17:48:02,This guy is the type of guy who doesn’t believe an employee is working unless they see them hunched over their keyboard 9-5. Being a manager is about being a leader and removing barriers that prevent employees from doing their best work. It’s not about making sure they’ve clocked in. This type of thinking is antiquated.
2020-11-10 17:49:06,"For these creative-type jobs, it’s hard to have everyone not working together. Dude probably tried to renegotiate his lease and couldn’t do it. Nevertheless, the highways are still full of traffic and Walmart’s parking lot is always full and never missed a beat during all of this, not for one day. America was on lockdown for maybe six weeks from March to the end of April, then everything started re-opening."
2020-11-10 17:57:26,"I can appreciate this company owner's struggle and I believe that he had a lot of sleepless nights over it. He seems to care and is genuine.

He absolutely should not say that he can guarantee that his employees are safe at work or safer at work than their homes. 

It sounds like he's done his best to create policies and a work environment that mitigates exposure to COVID, but no one can guarantee much at this point and he is foolish to say what he says."

2020-11-10 18:04:49,"Everyone disparaging the business owner for wanting people back at the office using CDC guidelines really needs to try owning, managing and growing a business. It takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice, and not all work can be measured with metrics. There is a lot to be said for maintaining company culture because frequently that is what contributed to the success of said business. Our loved one’s 20-year old business has not succeeded  because 60 people sat isolated at home; there is something to be said for in-person collaboration done safely.  Zoom does not fix everything. I would encourage you to consider what the business owner is going through as well, especially  as they fight for survival for both themselves and their employees."
2020-11-10 16:09:18,"Obviously the most important thing for that boss is to make a profit, he would not blink an eye if a worker got covid. I cant believe forcing people back to work is really good for the bottom line or for team building. He sickens me, I hope those workers form a union. Who cares if toys are made anyway, it is not like they are essential employees. Kids have too many toys as it is."
2020-11-10 18:06:19,"If at all possible, employees should be allowed to remain working remotely. The ""it's more fun when we are all here"" comment was very similar to ones made by area churches. One I'm familiar with has had multiple quarantines involving staff. They are having in-person and streaming services, so doing almost twice the work to produce worship each week. And elderly members are showing up during weekday office hours almost at record pace because they are lonely/bored and uncomfortable with technology. We really do need a bit more caution if not fear about the pandemic. Fatigue has set in, in both professional and relational communities."
2020-11-10 16:29:01,"What did he do about ventilation? Do workers need to wear masks at their desks alone? Has he head of aerosolized virus? Also, if he is so confident put a contract in place that if you get sick or die at work, you get a fixed amount of money. No thanks bro."
2020-11-10 16:35:53,"This is exactly the wrong time to ask people to come into the office. Republicans threw away all of our efforts and sacrifice from the March lockdown with mask refusal, parties, bar shopping, and giant campaign events, and they are still having indoor superspreader events at the White House. THEY may immediately get “all the best therapeutics and medical care” but WE have to wait until we are so sick we are hospitalized. And then the drugs don't work.

The callous disregard for employees during a health crisis is all you need to know."
2020-11-10 16:13:01,"His claim that the office is as safe as employees' homes is an absolute farce - people have no control over what their coworkers do outside of the office that would potentially (and unnecessarily) expose them to covid. People DO have control over the level of exposure in their own homes. Plus we're in a period of averaging over 100K new cases a day in this country! Just because people are tired of it doesn't mean it no longer exists. I'm so sick of ""business"" running the show to this point that I pretty much hate the word ""business"" now."

But they are the very things that make life meaningful. Human connection, community, love. They seem more “essential” then gathering with coworkers in an office space for “collaboration.”

If it’s not safe enough for me to be able to gather with my loved ones for the holidays, then I have no patience for employers who demand their workers return to the office, when the work can be done remotely."
2020-11-10 18:57:33,"It is not FEAR that is making people question whether it is safe to return to an office setting but the very sane and logical calculation that exposing yourself to 60+ or even hundreds of people every day in an office setting will put you at greater risk of contracting a disease than working from home and being exposed to only your core family group.
My office reopened in September, and right now me and my team are back sitting at home on 14 day quarantine, because we had a case of COVID in the team. Was that worth it for the alleged productivity increase of being together in the office? I doubt that very much."
2020-11-10 18:58:59,"In person work is important to production and effectiveness in most corporate settings. While some flexibility for remote work is still needed due to employee fears about their health/those they live with, the virus will be with us for years so we do need to learn how to live with the covid while managing both community spread and who gets infected.  Almost all COVID-19 mortality models focused on number of deaths, without considering age structure and co-morbidities. This can give very misleading inferences about the burden of disease in terms of quality-adjusted life-years lost, which is far more important than simple death count. For example, the Spanish flu killed young people with an average age of 28 and its burden in terms of number of quality-adjusted person-years lost was about 600-fold higher than the covid-19 (at least as of November 1, 2020). The majority of covid fatalities are in their 80s and 90s. The problem in the U.S. is half the country thinks we can ignore the virus and the other half thinks we can hide from the virus. A balanced approach to living with the reality of the virus is needed."

I’m so tired of the “can’t be done” mentality. “Experiment” is not a dirty word.

2020-11-10 17:20:19,"The fever that employers have for unnecessarily forcing employees back to unsafe work environments has been almost as high as fevers from COVID. This is understandable for physical jobs that one has to be present for, but the gamesmanship that executives are playing with public health departments is disgusting when it comes to work that can be done remotely.    

The reasons are all nebulous, and they're all the same:  Culture, productivity, innovation, etc....  Kind of like how Republicans use words like ""freedom"" or ""liberty"" for why we should do something when they either don't have a real reason, or the reason is too odious to spell out directly.

I work for a large company that recently backed off from bringing employees back to the office after a loud and highly unusual revolt by employees. In our case, the plans didn't account for how parents were supposed to cope with kids out of school, for high-risk employees who realistically need an accommodation to continue working safely from home, and the plan was behind the times on requiring masks and other measures that help promote safety.

This is a huge issue, and one that I wish all levels of government would address. Many of us, even if we aren't at higher risk, view it as a sense of civic responsibility to stay home and out of circulation. Our current dynamic of letting company executives dictate returns to the office to avoid the harder work and innovation of adapting to our current circumstances is not working."

2020-11-10 12:52:03,"Like many business owners around the country, Mr. Foreman has chosen what is good for his business over what is safe for his employees. Masks help and social distancing help, but it is simply not true that these measures eliminate the risk that is inherent in having dozens of people gathered for hours each day in an indoor environment. If someone in his workforce catches this virus, it is highly likely that they would spread it to their co-workers. I hope for his workers' sake that no one dies from this foolhardy decision. There are some businesses where there is no choice about working remotely and everyone must make the decision for themselves about what they must do to provide for their families. This is not one of those situations. This work can be done safely and clearly has been done safely for months. It is just not the optimal way of doing things. A collaboratively-created Care Bear is not worth a person's life."
2020-11-10 12:41:44,"It sounds like a rough choice for Mr Foreman - I can appreciate his point about needing in-person interaction for certain aspects of the toy manufacturing. Being able to feel the texture of a toy is critical to making it.

However there are many many businesses which do not require this level of physical interaction that are still requiring office workers return which I disagree with. Just because you’re paying rent for an office that’s not being used does not mean office workers need to return for you. Just because older managers are incapable of doing THEIR jobs remotely due to lack of technological literacy does not mean your workforce should bend to your inadequacies. 

This pandemic has clarified many priorities for people - for me it’s working from home and seeing my kids more. I’m not interested in returning to a 9-5 office job , it feels so contrite and unnecessary now. If anything my office gets more hours working out of me way more now than they did when I was in the office. If they can’t / don’t recognize this and decline to be flexible about continued working from home arrangements, I’ll likely be looking for somewhere that does."

I am now home awaiting the results of a Covid test taken late in the day Saturday when I learned a beloved co worker of mine tested positive and is quite sick at home.  We had a good 5 month run where everyone remained healthy.  But this latest episode has created an increased level of anxiety and we closed our school for the rest of the week to clean and disinfect it thoroughly.  If any of you have reservations, they are not without merit."
2020-11-10 14:14:36,"I live in Australia where covid cases are incredibly low. And even here forcing employees back to the office is unfathomable and our government highly recommends working from home. This terrible excuse for a human being is forcing his employees who live with vulnerable family members to risk illness and possible death. There is absolutely no reason for office workers with laptops to return to work. Working from home is inconvenient, it's difficult - it requires a creative boss who is willing to think outside the box and ultimately find alternate ways of working which utilize and harness technology."
2020-11-10 16:46:34,"I work in this category and our company faced similar challenges.  During this time, we have grown our business portfolio by a factor of four, and delivered more product on shorter turn times than ever before.  We have been so successful in figuring out how to collaborate digitally that we are going to eliminate our office space and just keep a warehouse for distribution.  The perceived issues that Mr. Foreman is facing are those of optics and feelings.  If the team can't collaborate digitally, it is highly unlikely being next to one another will change that.  This pandemic has forced us all to face radical change.  Clinging on to old ways under the guise of productivity shows a larger problem at the heart of the company.  Considering the established brands of this toy line as well as the shelf space they already cover in major stores, bring in the office or at home should have no effect on their ability to move product."
2020-11-10 14:18:13,"I work for a company in Boston that has delayed sending employees back to the office until at least next summer. Two of the biggest reasons: Childcare and transportation. 

Until the schools fully reopen, how are parents supposed to go back to the office? 

How are your employees getting to work? With public transportation service cut drastically and employees not feeling comfortable riding it, how will they get to the office? The commuter lines have stopped express service, increasing the commute time from 1hr to 2hrs in some places. So why don't employees just drive? Many don't have cars, or the biggest reason, there simply is not enough parking in these buildings for everyone to drive into the office. Parking in the office buildings is also cost prohibitive and can be as much as $500-$600/month in Boston. 

Mr. Foreman does not seem to be looking at the full picture of what it takes for his employees to return. His strategy seems incredibly shortsighted and will damage company culture for years to come. Employees will not forget how companies treated them during this time."
2020-11-10 19:10:32,"I think he was thoughtful, and has done the right thing.  We just can’t work from home forever, and we need some normality back.  Boca is well suited to doing this, provided everyone has their children in school.  Good for him."
2020-11-10 19:19:40,"I believe Mr Foreman’s decision was very well thought out and that his approach with his employees was reasonable. 

I’m a soon to be 62 yr old construction manager and my wife (retired) and I have been on the road the entire year, first in Florida until June and now in Kentucky through December.  The majority of my company working in design and support functions have been working from home since March and my personal opinion is it has hurt the continuity of the design team, not unlike what Mr foreman described.  There is a collaborative effort that is missed when individuals only interact over zoom or MS mtgs. 

There has been an added component of stress in my field position as we work with various trades and multiple individuals that we’ve never seen before a project and never will again. Temps are taken and masks are worn as a rule.  But there’s still a few who need constant reminders and buck the system for whatever reason.  

Thankfully we’ll be home in Vermont for good as retirement in some form is coming quickly"
2020-11-10 19:21:56,"The owner made it perfectly clear why he wanted his workers back in the office. It wasn’t about collaboration or their well being, rather it was about his rent.  To say otherwise would assume he actually really cares about them.  I’m interested in seeing how much of that collaborative experience pays off, when an employee gets the virus, and could easily argue it was from the workplace. I guarantee you, that his “care” will be in the form of denial and blame."
2020-11-10 19:36:54,"In a month, when the office has a case, then two, then five, and someone in the extended family of an exposed employee dies, then perhaps this heartless business owner will ponder his role in the spread of Covid-19 that led to yet another death, or more. 

I'm certainly not going to purchase anything that this company makes now.

Entire teams can work remotely and still be productive. This is just unnecessary, and may very well turn deadly."
2020-11-10 19:48:54,"Humans are not very good at making predictions about the future - leave alone what the future workplace will look like. I, for one, am looking forward to being back at the office - I don't miss the commute, but I do miss the normalcy, routine, and just getting out of the house . ."
2020-11-10 19:53:38,"Fear is an emotion that evolved to keep us alive in the face of lethal threats.

There are such things as irrational fears, but fear of Covid-19 — an extremely contagious and deadly threat — is not one of them.

Infection rates are currently skyrocketing, thanks to people oblivious to the threat.

Which, sad to say, will lead some to oblivion."
2020-11-10 19:53:53,"I know that an article like this is not the appropriate place for coming up with a list like this, but the article is what brought the idea to mind.

I wonder if there is a listing anywhere of companies that are indeed encouraging their employees to work from home.  I would love to be able to prioritize purchases from such companies (that encourage the well being of their employees as well as of their business itself).

I would in no way boycott this particular company or others like it, but I would certainly buy a toy from a company that handled issues like this in a way that fit my values (of putting people's safety first) while still taking care of their business.  

Does anyone know of such a list (or lists)?"
2020-11-10 19:59:35,"Oversimplifying assumptions are the biggest risk with COVID, because there are still plenty of unknowns.  Assuming masks and distancing work when you're in the same airspace 40hrs a week is not necessarily correct - but with low rates of community transmission, it probably is.  Assuming every job can be done completely remotely is also not necessarily correct, but many jobs can and part of most other jobs can be remote.

I have to agree with those who are saying that forcing everyone to come back is a one-size-fits-all approach that reflects a belief system more than an evidence-based conclusion."
2020-11-10 20:00:03,What about ventilation system? unfortunately the office work probably won't last despite masks and distancing.  first positive case is just a matter of time
2020-11-10 20:04:36,"Good for the owner this company.  Sure, public companies can operate inefficiently because the inefficiencies are borne by shareholders, whom management cares little about, and employees can be sanctimonious because they like hanging at home without the risk of owning a business.

Everyone who objects to what this company did can start their own companies with their own money and do what they want.  They'll find it is quite hard.

The comments that are critical of this company are hilarious.  my favorite is that this company only cared about paying the rent."
2020-11-10 20:15:05,"I work for a small medical supply company and we have not lost one day of work at our facility.   A facemask is required upon entry and at all times within the facility, there is surface sanitation a minimum of three days per day and distanced maintained at all times. hand sanitizer at every turn and hand washing strongly encouraged.  It is not the same vibrant space with everyone eating together,  sharing cake for someones birthday and lingering in offices to chat but we have all made it work and all remain healthy.  It is what employees do outside of the workspace that threatens the work environment.  For 8+ months all employees have taken their actions seriously, stayed safe and we have all been rewarded for it."
2020-11-10 20:41:16,"I design complex financial services products and apps. It is as collaborative as any work could be collaborative. 

There is no reason that this company's work could not continue remotely apart from a manager making up his mind that the work could not continue. 

The office is not the same or as safe as being at home. When you come into the office, you're in effect merging your entire pod or network with every other colleague's. 

Mind you, we're continuing to exceed daily records for cases. Going to the office certainly would've been a no-brainer if our country had been like so many others and implemented any strategy whatsoever beyond ""it is what it is"" and ""I've got a helicopter and free healthcare, the rest of you can deal with it"""
2020-11-10 20:42:43,"Many workplaces such as factories never shutdown during the pandemic and rightfully so. These provided good data points that you can keep running essential infrastructure in a safe manner if proper protocol is followed. One big hindrance to people coming to work has been lack of childcare/school. If that problem is solved, most people would show up. Business owners should not be allowed to force people to show up for work without considering the support structure. This particular example is classic Republicanism - I take all the profit and you bear all the costs. Lastly, a toy designer (especially if he manufactures everything in China) should not be given a free pass to put employees at risk."
2020-11-10 20:43:30,"To be fair to the situation - this workplace sounds a lot like my daughter's middle school. She goes every other day - and the safeguards sound very similar.

Public school has made a decision that some amount of in person activity is necessary. Likewise exclusive remote learning was not working. 

I think Foreman should be given credit for attempting to do the right thing for both his business and his workers. 

At the very least it seems disingenuous to have one set of ethical standards for schools and an entirely different set of standards for businesses."
2020-11-10 20:54:56,"What's most disappointing about Mr. Foreman's decision is the fact that he didn't allow his employees to even make the choice to return to work. I'm sure Steve is not the only employee with family members at home with a compromising health condition.  Can you imagine the guilt those employees will feel should their family members become sick? As schools begin to reopen, what do you think will happen next? It's the lack of forward thinking that's most disappointing. This office isn't even a standalone office. The employees share a building with other businesses increasing the exposure to these employees as they enter the elevator or take the staircase . Sometimes it's hard to understand until someone close to you is impacted by COVID.  The arrogance of even saying the employees are as safe as their own home. I pray those employees and their families stay safe. If employees do get sick - sounds to me like a Workers' Comp claim - I hope squeezing that Care Bear was worth it Mr. Foreman!"
2020-11-10 21:02:13,"This man can undertake all the logical twists and turns he'd like to persuade himself that he's right to play God in the midst of a pandemic, but at the end of the day it's hard to see his assertions about his office-place being as safe as anyone's home as anything aside from laughable. Glad I don't work as part of that ""team."""
2020-11-10 21:17:04,"I'm an architect who has helped a lot of clients adapt their spaces and operations to COVID. Based on our expertise and that of our HVAC engineers we will probably not return to the office until around June 2021. 

The weak link in sharing an office during COVID is ventilation. In a large majority of buildings it is poor. A very small fraction of employers have expended the capital to meaningfully improve ventilation or add effective measures to sanitize recirculated air. 

Case studies of virus spread in indoor environments have demonstrated that one can receive an infectious dose via air circulation when the contagious source is over 10 feet away, and potentially much farther. What makes offices risky is duration of exposure. You may not get infected from a transitory exposure at the grocery, yet exposure to the same virus source for an 8-hour work day will yield a heavy infectious dose. 

One thing I infer from this article is not everyone is continuously wearing a mask while seated at their desks. This is not safe, and a six foot distance will not protect you. It's certainly not as safe as my own home, where I do not share the coughs, sneezes, and exhalations of 65 other people."
2020-11-10 21:50:39,"I'm also curious to know what the working parents at this company are doing for childcare while they're back at work. Are all the schools and childcare centers open Boca Raton? If so, that seems like potential double-exposure - work and school/childcare. If not, who in the family is bearing the brunt of this decision on the home front?"
2020-11-10 20:20:42,"Sounds like Mr. Foreman needs some CareBears to soothe his overwrought money worries. Relax, guy, it's obvious that your priorities lie more with the rent money you're spending than the safety and wellbeing of your employees! What a grinch! A good many commenters have questioned the ability to work ONLY in the office. And they rightly question whether this says more about the company's questionable position in the marketplace. If the biggest worry is money, the company is already set up to fail, Care Bears or UnCaring CEO."
2020-11-10 19:21:12,"With 130,000 cases a day and rising no office, school or home will be safe from Covid.

This is a tough problem for employers and employees alike. The lack of available data on what COVID infections look like in the workplace makes it hard to justify a decision to go back to work for an employer, and hard to trust those decisions for employees. 

For that reason, we've created a software tool for employers to model COVID outbreak scenarios in their workforce, and compare the impact from different safety measures. Users can also change the infection rate to gauge what variable conditions mean for them. It's totally free, and I hope it helps companies like Basic Fun provide an epidemiological basis for their employee health-related decisions.

2020-11-10 22:45:21,I’ve been working from home since 2012. It was my employer’s decision to close the office and send the employees home. In order to save on the overhead costs. And guess what? It worked just fine. The tools to connect in meetings have gotten better and better and COVID has just forced the rest of the world catch up to us.
2020-11-10 23:07:18,"I work in an office that did this same exact thing back in May before our governor’s PAUSE order was even up.  The reason?  We weren’t sending reports out fast enough remotely.  

I felt so disregarded and disrespected over this decision and I lost a lot of respect for my employer.  Report yield was coming before our safety. We proved we could do the job at home, yet we were forced to come back with “all safety precautions being followed”.  Sure, masks, hand sanitizer and temp checks are all great but still don’t come close to not having to expose ourselves to large groups of people in the first place."
2020-11-10 23:48:24,"When Mr. Foreman says he can “guarantee” a safe environment, he clearly isn’t reading what scientists say. There is still too much unknown about this novel virus. All we know so far is that the best way to protect yourself is to mask and physically distance - AND to avoid groups of people outside of your family unit as much as possible. This is especially true if you or a close family member is 50  or has any number of common pre-existing medical conditions. We also know that even daily testing is ineffective. Check out the current Covid outbreak is at the White House if you’re in doubt. So much for the current CDC guidelines he says he follows. 

Mr. Foreman should consider what the disruption and outcome of his business will be if his actions wind up creating a super spreader event in the community and he has to close again. 

I and possibly his employees would like to know whether he’s be legally liable if that happens or whether he’d consider himself morally liable. And oh yeah, what’s your employee healthcare coverage like?"
2020-11-11 00:55:59,"Ahhhhh, the ever reliable corporate greed. I am a Registered Pharmacy Technician for the major grocery store in Florida, headquartered in Lakeland, well known and loved for their deli subs. I’m on the higher end of part-time (good luck getting full-time) and qualified for my own associate health insurance for 2020. I’ll miss qualifying for 2021 by approximately 75 hours. In the midst of this pandemic, when I have been showing up for work, certainly having been exposed to COVID 19, my employer is cutting my health insurance. Just irresponsible and reprehensible. But hey, they also stopped the constant cleaning of touch points, too. Did I miss that COVID has poof disappeared!? No doubt pharmacy hours were negatively impacted after the national COVID emergency was declared back in March. Elective procedures were cancelled; all of those prescriptions didn’t come, nor did the patients picking up maintenance meds, as they were staying home. I tried to pick up hours cashiering, but my employer had gone on a hiring spree as groceries were flying off the shelves; they needed workers. My employer has enjoyed massive profits during this time, but chooses to leave me, and certainly others, high and dry without health insurance in 2021. And yes, we will, whether employee, patient or consumer, remember how corporations chose to treat their employees during this hellacious time."
2020-11-11 04:48:41,"Toy companies may be a bit different, I suppose, but the notion that most office workers need to commute into a shared space each day to get their jobs done is really being tested.  For many of us, it’s simply a better experience to work remotely.  I’m saving money and stress by not commuting, I have newfound family time, and I feel just as productive as ever.  Do I miss the water cooler banter?  Sure.  But I still find time to shoot the breeze with coworkers over video.  I feel bad that companies have invested so many resources into maintaining  their buildings, but given the available tools for online work and collaboration, it’s just plain inefficient to continue with the same office culture.  I have no idea where that leaves the downtowns that rely on those workers, but I trust we will figure it out.  Change is painful, but it’s happening."

The CEO guy who doesn’t like or trust Trump and supports Biden is getting advice on opening his business (when 230k Americans have died from Covid and 100k people are getting infected EACH DAY) by talking to the current CDC folks. Smart guy. And wishful thinking. Or selfish thinking.

Does he give employee satisfaction surveys? Or does he have to read about them in the NYT?"
2020-11-10 22:12:53,"“Fear is not an appropriate reason for not being at work""

Ha! Fear is *exactly* the right reason for not being at work. 

Mr. Foreman: there is a deadly pandemic raging across our country, and across the world, with no end in sight! I don't care how much rent you pay. You can't run your company if your employees are sick or dead.

What kind of person are you? Have you no empathy?"
2020-11-09 13:41:49,"Great news. Now, precisely how long will it take Trump to claim that the drug companies were conspiring against him to delay the announcement so that he would lose the election. Anybody think he will express even one word of relief about how this development will help average Americans? Start the stopwatch."
2020-11-09 13:44:25,"As a Professor of Medicine, Public Health and Nursing at Johns Hopkins, I have been very concerned about efforts to undermine our most stellar Infectious disease authorities, Dr. Fauci with 4 decades of experience. I have also been stunned at the efforts to contaminate scientific studies with political ambitions- the likes of which I have never witnessed in my entire career as a physician. I applaud Pfizer for getting it right and allaying our fears of the US becoming a country that is never trusted again. Thank you for this article."
2020-11-09 13:46:18,"Apparently good news!  Also shows that Pfizer's instinct to bet on the German mRNA vaccine by BioNTech  was on target.  Hopefully, other mRNA-based vaccines by Moderna, Curevac and otters will show similarly good data. One major upside of this type of vaccine is that you don't need to grow viruses (which are either modified or inactivated before use), these mRNA ones are synthetic and scale faster. That also hopefully means that if COVID19 changes into COVID2x, a vaccine can be adapted rapidly."
2020-11-09 13:47:31,"Exciting news. But even if enough people get the vaccine to eradicate or hugely diminish the virus in the coming year-- what's to stop it from coming back? Will we have to get these shots every year, like the flu vaccine? What about all the people who will refuse?"
2020-11-09 13:49:26,"Sounds encouraging, and the team working to develop and test the vaccine(s) deserve our thanks. If you want the wary public to accept the vaccine as safe, the first civilians to receive the vaccine should be Trumps immediate family.
As for me (a physician), when Anthony Fauci looks the data over and agrees to gets vaccinated, then I'll get vaccinated."
2020-11-09 13:49:26,"It is imperative that this process goes forward in a scientific manner, accelerated as much as the technology will allow. Politics must be kept out of the process. Any indication that politics has played a hand if the efficacy of vaccines that come to market will just serve to diminish their acceptance by a skeptical public."
2020-11-09 13:50:18,"This is an enormous achievement for humanity, like a combination of the moon landing and the four minute mile!

The previous record for vaccine production was 4 years. Most scientists thought 12-18 months was possible, but exceedingly  optimistic. The folks at Pfizer and BioNTech have done it in about 10 months!

It goes to show that anything is possible when the full focus of humanity is set on a problem. With this sort of funding, international cooperation, and dedication, imagine what else we could accomplish!"
2020-11-09 13:50:19,"I've read 3 news articles this morning about this exciting development.  This one is a model to me of well-informed journalism, touching on the necessary cautions which readers need to be aware of rather than just the 90% which most other articles you'll see this morning are doing.  Well done."
2020-11-09 13:46:49,"I don’t like this at all. Does the vaccine cause long-term side effects, especially in the vulnerable populations who will be first in line to get it? Too early to say.

How long will the vaccine last? Will we have to get a new dose every few months, every few years? No one knows. And now that Pfizer’s going for an emergency use application this month, it could soon have to “unblind” its study, because it’ll face an ethical obligation to inoculate, as it were, the people who got the placebo. Pfizer may close down the study before we know how the long the vaccine lasts! 

Pfizer calls this a “great day for science and humanity” and a “historical moment.” I call it hype that’s tempting fate, if not stock market manipulation."
2020-11-09 13:46:39,"It's great to see a joint effort by Germany and the US. Hopefully under Biden this will become more prevalent, rather than an exception. Ontopic, these are amazing news!"
2020-11-09 13:44:58,"Notably, while the article claims 15-20 million doses will be ready this year, Pfizer's own press release says 50 million doses in 2020 and 1.3 billion in 2021.

2020-11-09 14:02:35,What a great start for a renewed trans-atlantic partnership. I hope that we will stick to that when it comes to distributing the doses.
2020-11-09 14:02:59,"This is terrific news--I have worked on developing vaccines for 40 years and I never thought that a vaccine could be developed, tested and shown to be efficacious in less than a year.  Clearly we need to examine the Pfizer COVID-19 data on efficacy and safety closely--also there will be many remaining questions, most important being the duration of protection and whether the vaccine prevents both disease and mild/asymptomatic infection. Some vaccines mainly prevent severe disease (for example, influenza) and have much less effect on decreasing mild infection, which limits the ability of vaccination  to prevent spread of infection to susceptible (unvaccinated) populations.  Stay tuned but it is a good day to be grateful for science."
2020-11-09 14:09:19,"In a continuance of Trump's flops, no government funds were used in this breakthrough.  Compliments to the partnership for this great scientific achievement."
2020-11-09 14:12:48,"I want to trust this, but the CEO sounds delusional a) in assuring Trump about safety as though that’s truly his concern and b) in suggesting that he and Pfizer can save all of humanity. There are so many more serious problems to be tackled before any company or CEO can claim to “save the world.“

If we have learned anything from the last four years it should be that both honesty and humility are critical for earning public trust."
2020-11-09 14:17:04,"Excellent new, buoyed hope. The obvious question is medical insurance coverage. Flu vaccine is virtually free to all. 
Will the same be true for the Pfizer vaccine assuming the results hold up? Based on pre-market price for PFE (up 16%), investors think PFE should do very well. Hopefully Republicans and Democrats can unite in making a successful vaccine universally available."
2020-11-09 14:23:18,"Great news! 

When Dr. Fauci and other respectable scientists check the data and endorses the vaccine one won't hesitate to take it.

The necessity to keep the vaccine in ultra cold temperature may limit its use in many parts of the world. However, this is a moral booster for other vaccine manufacturers to confidently proceed with their approaches. 

I hope multiple developers become successful in their efforts."
2020-11-09 14:25:05,"Logistically, the vaccine can be administered.There is a clinic giving shots at Mt. Sinai that is part of the trial. It would be a matter of ramping up the distribution of the coolers.

2020-11-09 14:28:49,"Let's wait for the real data.  There's a big difference between ""the vaccine prevents 90% of all infections"" and ""90% of patients saw some benefit"".

Also, let's wait and see how much this is going to cost us.  No participation in Warp Speed means Pfizer can charge whatever they want.  Everyone's insurance premium will go up by whatever that price is, because there's no spreading the cost when everyone needs it."
2020-11-09 14:28:49,"Congratulations and the greatest of respect to the scientists and all else involved in this monumental effort. But an effective vaccine is only part of the solution. Reducing spread effectively reduces the work that vaccines need to do. We are not effectively reducing spread in the US with the tools at hand, such as masks, distancing, etc. When the vaccines come they will be tasked with tamping down an overwhelming and unfettered spread. The virus is accelerating and the Trump administration is clueless. Biden will attempt to change that but he cant have any real effect until February at the earliest. I fear we are heading into a dark, lethal time which vaccines, coming in after the great wave, will not be able to prevent. Sometimes when fighting a fire gone out of control with limited fire hoses you just have to hold back and limit it around the edges as it burns up its available fuel. Unfortunately the fuel is American lives."
2020-11-09 14:31:13,"These people are heroes. Their work will end this pandemic, even if it doesn’t fully eradicate coronavirus for years to come. And with Trump out, we can finally stop hyperventilating about the trustworthiness of these results. It’s time to acknowledge that the actual *science* behind these vaccines has always been run by career scientists with the highest qualifications and best intentions."
2020-11-09 14:32:58,"You described it perfectly right in the article, but I read: Pfizer’s vaccine everywhere.
This vaccine in terms of R&D and IP is 100% BioNTech and Pfizer is the study and logistics partner.
According Ugur Sahin that was the main condition for the partnership.

2020-11-09 14:32:59,""" the company — unlike the other vaccine front-runners — did not take any federal money to help pay for research and development.""
I just wonder if Pfizer's board, will want to price the vaccine , to recover their R&D costs . 
At say  $ 100,000 a dose only the wealthiest will be vaccinated once the ""free"" doses allocated to Health Care workers run out.
Of course, one can always wait for more ""free"" doses, if they are distributed."
2020-11-09 14:35:10,Terrific; however efficacy is only one-half of the standard. What about safety?
2020-11-09 14:35:37,"These companies keep making announcements like this to boost their stock price.

Sounds like insider trading to me.

I read that drug companies almost never used to make an announcement like this about how one of their drugs is doing at this stage because there continues to be significant uncertainty about whether or not the particular drug will ultimately be the answer to the question of whether or not it will do what they're making it to do."
2020-11-09 14:40:03,"Wonderful news, in a time when so many of us have grown so accustomed to being lied to so relentlessly.  And this comes from an entity that will make tons of money if we'll just believe them."
2020-11-09 14:41:38,"Am I the only one concerned that it was “Pfizer” that announced these results? I’d like to hear from the people who conducted the study and/or invented the thing being tested. I’d like to see results and, preferably a journal manuscript. Experience Tells me that a corporate entity trumpeting results is not the same as science or data."
2020-11-09 14:42:25,"There are other vaccines also approaching the finish line.  If the Pfizer effort is the winner and if 90% (or somewhere close) is real, the problem will be making and distributing 7 billion doses worldwide.  Someone needs to decide on the ethics of this.   Who gets the doses first?  In my view it should be medical professionals worldwide regardless of their countries' ability to pay; then those most at risk while helping the world to recover its normal function - schoolteachers, food workers, even politicians - and finally hoi polloi.  Some of us may have to continue keeping our heads down for a couple of years or more.  And we need structured cooperation at all levels: if the Pfizer effort is the best then they have to be adequately rewarded but they have to give the recipe to every manufacturing facility capable of producing it."
2020-11-09 14:43:15,"Pfizer is a major pharmacy manufacturer and would not damage their name with a false claim.  This news is very important to me as I am 79 years old and a type 2 diabetic.  I just got back from Northside Hospital and made copies of this article and sent them a email copy also.  My physicians assistant has had over 30 patients with Covid 19.  If this vaccine turns out to be effective to these 90% levels, Our new president will have the green light to get this country and world working again!"
2020-11-09 14:46:59,"While it is good news that the vaccine shows ""promising"" results, lets remember that it has been rushed, and Pharma has a huge financial stake in the outcome; not to mention the politicization of the entities. Call me skeptical. I'd like to see some more effort in the development of safe and effective therapeutics for the general public in the interim; in hopes of saving thousands of lives until a true vaccine is available and can take affect."
2020-11-09 14:49:17,"I hate to be the wet blanket here but as someone who's worked in small molecule development and safety evaluation, the timetable on this vaccine has been far too accelerated to be considered safe. Vaccines historically have taken a decade or more to develop safely, and their history is littered with candidates who started out promising in the early data just as Pfizer's has, only to demonstrate dangerous and frightening safety threats when the long-term data was evaluated. The 2009 swine flu vaccine was eventually found to cause narcolepsy, a horribly debilitating disease in a large number of patients, and promising vaccines for dengue and the respiratory syncytial virus (which affects infants) were later found to be deadly for recipients.

These vaccine candidates had  promising early data, just like Pfizer's vaccine now has, but their lethal side effects in many recipients became apparent only many years later. This is why vaccines, which are given to healthy people, cannot be rushed out like this. The human immune system is still very mysterious, and especially with something like the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, there are ongoing dangers from phenomena like antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and other reactions we're barely beginning to understand, and which take years to observe. Even if we shorten the normally decade-long development process, a year or two is way too little to gauge these critical factors."
2020-11-09 14:49:33,"Great news, but though Pfizer was ""were never part of the Warp Speed,” and ""have never taken any money from the U.S. government, or from anyone,"" that's not stopping the current administration from saying otherwise on Twitter right at this moment, because they want to take credit for something they have no part of, naturally. Ivanka in particular seems to be living in an alternate reality. It's disgusting that they are allowed to try and credit themselves after such a dismal response these last several months."
2020-11-09 14:52:35,"Vaccines are very tricky things. Each vaccine is unique. There is no vaccine for HIV. Some pathogens mutate so quickly, that an effective vaccine is impossible. Tuberculosis vaccine is available, but quarantine and drug treatment is what is practiced in the US. Malaria kills one in three, in the third world. Vaccine researchers have been working on Malaria for a hundred years, and ...nothing. I suspect that a Coronavirus vaccine will not provide a long lasting immunity."
2020-11-09 14:01:34,"Such hopeful news about a vaccine.  Meanwhile, as infections and deaths continue to rise during this terrible pandemic, let’s keep doing the masking and social distancing to keep those numbers down."
2020-11-09 14:40:27,I sure hope this proves out. An effective vaccine would do wonders for the world. We need this.
2020-11-09 14:45:25,"Before the election, Trump asserted that a vaccine might come by Election Day.  His detractors scoffed that this was another Trump lie, supported by no facts.  Saturday, Biden was declared the election winner, and this morning, less than a week after Election day, Pfizer releases this welcome news.

1.  Was Trump in fact telling a tall tale lie?
2.  Was the timing of this public disclosure delayed for political reasons?"
2020-11-09 13:53:53,"It would be very foolish to take a for-profit pharmaceutical company at its word, when the reality is so vague on the specifics of the data and the incentives for misrepresenting are so high.

2020-11-09 14:13:01,"Wow, 90%?!?!?! I was hoping for something around 60%, but 90% is an amazing rate. I hope this is the one that gets approval soon and starts distributing sooner than later so the world can get back to normal."
2020-11-09 14:28:37,"Pretty shocking that Pfizer would wait until a week after the election to release this.  I guess Trump was right in that immediately after the election the coronavirus issue would go away.  All of a sudden we have a ""light at the end of the tunnel"" and a highly effective vaccine right around the corner soon after Trump loses."
2020-11-09 14:54:14,"I’d heard on sports radio (which unfortunately tends right-wing and spreads conspiracy theories) that a vaccine would be announced after the election.  Now this is already adding fuel to that particular theory ... But why in the world would a pharmaceutical company favor the Democrats? unless Trump made medical research so difficult with his anti-science views, political pressure, and baseless claims of ‘cures’ that they can’t envision another 4 years with him?"
2020-11-09 14:35:50,"If it is approved by Dr.Fauci to take, I will be first in line to be vaccinated. But the Pfizer trials were the ONLY trials that Dr. Fauci has not had access to."

Ummmm the election isn't over. Results are being challenged"
2020-11-09 14:13:40,"Where is the photo of Ugur Sahin, the owner of the company (and genius) responsible for the inception of the vaccine being developed in partnership with Pfizer?"
2020-11-09 14:49:10,"Hope begets more hope, first we get new President and now promising results on covid vaccine.  Maybe America has turned a corner."

2020-11-09 14:22:52,"Nobel Prize Material.  If they pull this off, we should build statues of these men.  Still, 20 million doses by year's end is achingly small, far less than 1 percent of the world's population."
2020-11-09 14:38:25,"Hmmm didn’t Trump say a vaccine by the end of the year? And the media and democrats said no way? I’m sure the mainstream media will credit Biden for a vaccine that comes at the end of the year.

2020-11-09 14:29:41,"NB Pfizer and Dr. Jansen are distancing themselves from “Operation Warp Speed,” not to be confused with Operation Warped President, pointing out that, unlike other companies, they did not receive any federal money for research and development. Heaven forbid that commander “just-a-shot-away” might take credit where it’s not due."
2020-11-09 14:42:43,"And guess what, climate deniers. Science is making this happen."
2020-11-09 14:20:03,"Trump has been telling the American people, since April, that the vaccine is “two weeks away” . The efficacy doesn’t matter if people don’t trust the distributor. As my new Vice President-elect said, if Trump tells her to take a dose she won’t, if Biden recommends one, she will participate. These are the effects of Trump’s 22,000 lies. Nobody with a brain wants to respond anymore to “the boy who cried cure” for nine months now."
2020-11-09 14:35:18,Expect stories in the right wing media alleging a conspiracy to withhold these data until after the election.
2020-11-09 14:38:08,What about Covid21? This won’t be the last pandemic. We need a strategic effort to de-code the RNA and DNA behind virus and bacterial infection. We have strategic nuclear weapon stockpiles. Time to amass microbial global defense!
2020-11-09 14:45:19,"This is of course encouraging news.  Hopefully, subsequent data will support these initial results.

A vaccine is the only thing that can end the pandemic nightmare.  A major problem is the politicization of vaccine development.  At present, some surveys show that over 50% of the US population would choose not to receive a vaccine.  This anti-vax mindset threatens to be a true tragedy with the potential to cause tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths in the US alone.

It is worth remembering: half our population declines to receive the very safe seasonal flu vaccine.

Blame for politicization of a vaccine against the corona virus can be attributed to both sides of the aisle.  Trump hoped early vaccine availability would have enabled him to win re-election.  But the liberal media, including articles and headlines in the Times, also injected unhelpful politics into the vaccine development process.

One can speculate what would have happened if the results had been released one week ago. It probably would not have changed the outcome of the election, but it was a close election, so who knows. 

Today, the election is over and the winner decided.  We need to move ahead with vaccination as fast as the science allows.  Tens of thousands of lives or more,  and the world economy depend on it."
2020-11-09 14:18:35,"The virus has run rampant, thanks to a lack of leadership by Trump.  His failure was his only contribution to this study because, as the article says,  participants became infected at such an unexpectedly-fast rate, the analysis could be accelerated."
2020-11-09 14:52:46,"This is great news. I suspect that the coronavirus has changed vaccine development permanently. And, although many are pointing out that Pfizer didn't participate in Warp Speed and didn't take any money from governments. It is also mentioned that ""Operation Warp Speed...has promised Pfizer $1.95 billion to deliver 100 million doses to the federal government, which will be given to Americans free of charge."" So, they may not have taken money at the development stage, but will still benefit from Operation Warp Speed. It is funny to me that in all my years of reading the NYT comments, these last 8 months have been the only time that I have seen so many anti-vaccine comments; so much for follow science and listen to the experts when you think doing so will be supporting a politician that you don't like."
2020-11-09 14:54:07,"The only way to go by Pfizer or other Big Pharma interests is to engage  contra experts who have a  serious stake in these data being wrong, cooked up, partial  or otherwise flawed.For instance: are their tests run in a sizeable sample of elderly? pregnant women? adolescents? who all have different types of immunity ."
2020-11-09 13:55:08,"“If the results hold up, that level of protection would put it on par with highly effective childhood vaccines for diseases such as measles.”

That doesn’t seem strictly accurate. The measles vaccine is 97 percent effective. Pfizer’s 90 percent figure, arrived at on a mere 93 infections, would be Russian roulette."
2020-11-09 14:44:47,"I’m not an anti-vaxer but I will wait for more information to come out before I get happy. I will not believe anything Trump says about it, he lost his credibility 4 years ago."

2020-11-09 15:04:27,"These subjects were not intentionally exposed to the virus to test efficacy. That's probably not ethical. 

Therefore we have to wait until a target number get the virus and see if almost all of them were in the placebo group. Or more specifically, if significantly more of them were in the placebo group.

Do I have it basically correct?"
2020-11-09 15:05:18,"It is difficult to believe that the timing of this announcement is entirely coincidental. But rather than believing that Pfizer is part of a conspiracy to deny Trump a victory, I think it is that Pfizer wanted to avoid being part of a very nasty election process.

They will have only a relatively few number available for a long time, assuming that the final trials are successful. The governments (more than just the US is interested) need to support both their expansion and the continued work by the other companies. After all, about 1.25 million people have died of covid thus far, and the number only grows daily."
2020-11-09 15:07:58,"Kudos to Pfizer for taking the risk and running these studies.  And kudos to its scientists and participants.  Of course it is only the first step, but it’s an important one, and one delivered by the private sector.  It’s too bad politics has infected common sense, and news that runs counter to political views is denigrated."
2020-11-09 15:08:12,"A vaccine is the only certain solution to the demise of the coronavirus pandemic.  Pfizer's announcement is in keeping with the best of science and comes at a time just before the Winter holidays where crowding without social distancing will be the highest of the year.

Between Pfizer and BionTech let us hope that a working vaccine becomes available before the end of 2020."
2020-11-09 15:09:43,I believe it was Trump who said the vaccine would be ready by the end of the year.  Pfizer says it will have 10 to 20 million doses ready by then.  And it appears to be 90% effective compared to 50% for the flu shot.  But I'm sure Biden will be given credit.
2020-11-09 15:09:55,"I have spent my career in medicine, first in teaching and practice, then in pharma and biotech.  I have led dozens of clinical trials.

What you see here is good news.  Everything I can see looks like careful, thoughtful work.

First, the endpoint is infections, not antibody seroconversion.  Due to the nature of corona viruses, simply having antibodies may not indicate protection.  Infections are real; no one ever came to me and said, ""Doc, my antibody titers are just too low.""  Symptomatic infections are what we care about.

Second, there is a data safety and monitoring board.  They have communicated good interim efficacy and no important safety signals.  These people are experts, and independent.  Yes, there still are people in medicine and drug development who are honest and well-intentioned.  They do not work for the company, generally they are paid just a small (and I mean small) honorarium for their time.  No upside for any particular outcome.  Go look it up in the FDA website.  There are rules and charters for data monitoring committees.

Finally, in this social and political climate, Pfizer will have been very careful in their optimistic press release.  Just imagine, if they went overboard on this, the clean-up would be far worse than any bump they get now.  (NB: I never worked at Pfizer, nor do I have any stock.)

This is not a guarantee of success. It appears to be well thought out and executed science. I am optimistic that the final data will mean a breakthrough."
2020-11-09 15:10:02,"This is not the only vaccine in clinical trials. I am convinced that in a couple of months we will have several vaccines that are reasonably effective. But right here and now,  I foresee the next culture war. Lefties will be unwilling to take it because “Big Pharma” but will insist on the federal mask mandate and lockdowns, so the rest of us an pander to their delusions. They will join hands with Trumpists who will refuse because they don’t believe the pandemic is real. But in this war, as in any other, the sane center will win. I’ll get the first vaccine approved by the FDA (or one of its European equivalents), and ditch my mask immediately. The people who cannot or wouldn’t take the vaccine should simply stay home. Incidentally, that was the way to fight the pandemic to begin with. The countries that protected its vulnerable populations while letting everybody else live their lives are doing best in terms of both infection rates and economic damage."
2020-11-09 15:11:10,"BioNTech received 320 M€ from the German government to develop the vaccine. They called the project ""Lightspeed"". Therefore Pfizer is right: they never received money from the US government and did not participate in ""warp speed"". Also, as far as I know, the vaccine will be produced in Marburg, which is not in Austria. BioNTech bought a Novartis plant there and are planning to make 750 Mio doses per year."

2020-11-09 15:25:23,"As a clinical researcher in vaccines (running phase II & III trials) for 30 years I have two observations. Generally it takes fewer subject if there is a high incidence of the disease in phase III group to prove efficacy.  I takes a larger cohort over time to sort out serious adverse reactions. Sometimes the FDA mandates a phase IV which is basically a registry of adverse reactions after the vaccine is out.

Also, what is the endpoint of a phase III trial; death prevention, serious illness prevention, illness prevention or a surrogate antibody titer. Down the road question of frequency of boosters, dosage & boosters in different age groups, in the immune compromised are factors that need to be sorted out. Initial subjects in phase III become more valuable as time marches on to help answer these questions"
2020-11-09 15:25:55,"Ok, it may be  my  age showing but I wouldn't inject any vaccine into my body that was developed this fast (in less than a year or so).

However: 1) This is a press release, not a peer-reviewed scientific article. 2) We are only a little more than 3 months out from the initial inoculations. What if protection wears off after 6 months? It will be a long time before we know whether the vaccine provides enduring protection. If we have to vaccinate 200 million people every year, because the vaccine wears off, and vaccinate each of them twice, this adds up to 400 million doses per year. This is about 20 times the number of doses that might be available by January."
2020-11-09 15:30:04,Very promising news. I wonder though how those skeptical of the massive amount of data and math used to project the winner of the Presidential election can put great confidence in a vaccine that is projected to be effective based on a population of 40K.
2020-11-09 15:30:16,"That we (and the world) will have an effective vaccine for COVID far sooner than ever done before, will be a stunning achievement for humanity. 

That we couldn’t wear masks as the simplest way to mitigate while we wait is a giant blot on America. 

But never mind that for a moment. 

Is it just me who has literally been breathing better? It’s as if that tight band squeezing my rib cage for the past 8 months has finally snapped. 

Being a realist I’m aware this is temporary. All is better but not well. Not yet. 

Oh but how wonderful it feels to wake and read all that Biden intends to do on the first day - the ethics pledge reduced me to tears. 

How wonderful again to have some hope that maybe even one aspect of my life will improve like maybe testing or not worrying about hospital supply issues. 

How wonderful it is to read the world is closer to a vaccine. 
I’m starting to re-trust some of these companies not just because they took a pledge but because there is going to be a decent man at the helm of America’s sinking ship. 

I’m cautiously hopeful. But for today, I’m going to be unabashedly hopeful for better times for all of us. 

Just for today."
2020-11-09 15:31:01,"Two points: this company did not take part in Warp Speed. So no conspiracy. And second, it needs to be transported and stored at -98F. So this is not a panacea."
2020-11-09 15:31:15,"I'm so grateful for scientists and doctors who are researching vaccines and treatments to save us from this virus.

I am thrilled that these trials had nothing to do with Operation Warp Speed; if they had been, we know Trump would say they waited until after the election results to state their success!

The past few days are boding well for the USA and the world; we have hope on many fronts now. What a difference a week makes!"
2020-11-09 15:34:07,"It would be good if such articles explained what a “90% effectiveness rate” actually means!

The brief details suggest that 90% of those who came down with the virus had NOT had the vaccine — which seems exactly backwards for determining  efficacy.

What we want to know is:  What % of people who *were* vaccinated got 
the virus?  And, how does that compare to the rate for those who weren't vaccinated?

Right now, the information and data are the exact opposite — they're telling us what % of people who got the virus were NOT vaccinated!  (In fact, that’s not even true as people have extrapolated from the stated 90% rate.)

There are other complications and omitted information.  Were the participants deliberately exposed to the virus?  It doesn't seem so as the number of cases are so low and that would be unethical.  So, if this was done naturalistically, it raises questions.

Were the participants living in virus-surging areas? 

How virulent were the variants of the viruses they were exposed to?

What were the age distributions and preexisting conditions of the groups?  How did the “efficacy rate” vary by age and condition?

How long a time period are we talking about?  Perhaps, the vaccine provides only short-term protection.

How did the mask-wearing, safe distancing, and behavioral habits differ between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups?  Without knowing that, we may be inflating the vaccine's protective abilities when those other actions made the difference!"
2020-11-09 15:34:29,"I’m wondering about the process of declaring 90% efficacy at this point. Were volunteers exposed to Covid to see if they became ill after getting the vaccine? Did they have antibodies showing they’d had it and due to the vaccine did not become very ill? Or did they not have antibodies, in which case they might not have contracted the virus at all? How old/vulnerable were they? How long will they be watched for safety’s sake before the vaccine is given to millions? I hope we have answers to these questions soon."
2020-11-09 15:34:36,"Would like to see a breakout of the fine detail of participants...is there more or less an equal distribution across a broad spectrum of age cohort?  Are people over 60 well represented in both the placebo and vaccine groups?  Encouraging, but awaiting granular analysis and a much longer trial horizon."
2020-11-09 15:34:48,"This sounds promising but a few months of data won’t exclude longer term consequences and less frequent adverse reactions of a novel vaccine technology. Nor will it tell us how durable the immunity it produces and if it will benefit all groups regardless of age, race, and underlying health. It’s also tricky logistically due to the very low storage temperatures it requires. Other vaccines could still prove to be cheaper, more effective, safer, or easier to store and administer.

Meanwhile, we already have the public health means to dramatically curb coronavirus spread. Proper masks used consistently and combined with social distancing, hand hygiene, good ventilation, testing, and contact tracing could dramatically reduce and then control our disease burden pending full vaccine deployment. These measures need to be maintained until infections are rare, and definitely not abandoned on vaccine news or its initial deployment.

Lastly, if you bet big on Pfizer stock, selling on the news might be as good a strategy as any."
2020-11-09 15:36:00,"What is suspicious about this timing? It’s early data, they are a little over halfway to the required number of infections.  Certainly not yet approved. 

Also there is pretty much widespread bipartisan support for OWS (despite Pfizer not having received US R&D money, they are guaranteed a 1B order) so even if this came out before 11/3 I don’t see how this would have impacted the election. 

Everyone needs to chill. This is encouraging news, especially as cases are way up. Have we forgotten how to be happy?"
2020-11-09 13:46:16,"I think it would be best to put China, Russia and Iran right at the bottom of the list of those we help distribute/sell the vaccine to until every single American has taken it.  And when we do distribute it to them, if we ever do, I'd sell it for good $$ too."
2020-11-09 13:48:18,"If this were announced two weeks earlier, Trump would have won.  It's all good though - conservatives control the Senate and Supreme Court, so there will be no tax raises or Green New Deal."
2020-11-09 15:38:01,"Fantastic news. It's likely that we will shortly have a slew of competing vaccines - all effective - but with a variety of characteristics. No monopoly to be had there. Good.

There's quite a lot of skepticism about this '>90% effective' claim - that would be very unusual for any vaccine. Expect that number to fall as the clinical trial enlarges and progresses.

This German/US vaccine is going to pose a real transport and storage challenge, though. Minus 80 degree-C facilities will have to built up from scratch. Conventional vaccines (like the UK's Astra-Zeneca/Oxford product) don't need anything like that. Apparently that's just about ready to go, too."
2020-11-09 14:10:42,"Talk about nation divided.

Many have said they’d never get a COVID vaccination under Trump’s reign, but they would under Biden.

Interesting when Pfizer made this announcement."

I wish we listened to science on everything else."

Talking about safety: We know, that on average between 2 and 10 of the people, that get Covid-19, die, and that an even larger fraction develops long-term health problems. Even with only 22.000 participants (that half, that received the vaccine, not the placebo) it should be possible to prove, that a vaccine is safer than the virus."
2020-11-09 15:40:17,"This terrific, albeit early stage, news on the efficacy of a new vaccine comes six days after the election. It may not have come fast enough to save the administration that made it happen."

I don’t know if that will sit well with the Trump supporters since they are science deniers.
And why would they want to take a vaccine for a virus that they are convinced is a hoax?

Also ....since physicians can’t be trusted (they lie about Covid deaths for money per Trump).
I don’t know who they will turn to when they need a doctor and professional medical advice.
They really have painted themselves in a corner, haven’t they ?"
2020-11-09 14:59:28,"This announcement is ""marketing"".  Show me the science."
2020-11-09 15:07:23,"This is going to be a hard sell even to those who are opposed to anti-vaxers.

A new vaccine using a new process? Hard sell."
2020-11-09 15:23:00,It must be an incredible feeling to learn that the virus is out there and then be able to turn around and start working to defeat it. I had this wish but no ability to do anything about it as did the head of BioNTech. Maybe I should have majored in biology as I loved it more than any other subject!
2020-11-09 14:58:47,"Wearing masks and social distancing are even more effective than the vaccine.

Too bad our so-called President and his coronavirus political party refused to recognize that reality.

2020-11-09 15:14:14,Phizer indicated they were not part of “Warp Speed”.  I will take this as true but I suspect the competition that “Warp Speed” created motivated Phizer to work really hard to be the first to market a vaccine.
2020-11-09 14:56:44,Biden should declare executive national security order for drug companies producing vaccines to share production rights with the feds determining distribution of vaccine and any profit distribution if any.
2020-11-09 15:08:21,"Just to put things right: it's a BioNTech vaccine, not a Pfizer vaccine. Pfizer contributes with testing knowledge and logistics infrastructure. The development of the mRNA vaccine was entirely done by their German partner. And: BioNTech already started with mass production in Germany."
2020-11-09 15:08:53,"The U.K. is already saying to expect a rollout of 10m doses by the new year. Incredible. No one knows the long-term health risks or long-term efficacy. Other vaccine studies will be forced to unblind their own studies as placebo recipients demand the vaccine. And you won’t be able to stick people with a bunch of different vaccines, because you can’t know the interactions. So this is it. With one press release, Pfizer is cornering the market — and, I would argue, potentially conning the world. If this vaccine doesn’t work, no one will trust the next one."
2020-11-09 15:03:33,I applaud all the Democrats here loudly emphasizing how government should not get credit for this and underscoring how private industry in a capitalist society is fully capable of solving massive societal problems without government! Always nice when your side gets turned on its head in desperation to avoid crediting Trump.

2020-11-09 15:48:59,"An American pharmaceutical company (with a British partner) developed this vaccine. Let's remember the Democratic primary challengers (not Biden) vilified this industry for excessive profits.

Those profits recruited the best people. Those profits enabled them to buy the best equipment. Those profits enabled them to develop the best quality control system-from the CEO to the shipping of their products.

Let us be reminded it was not the Canadians who developed this vaccine. Every month HealthCanada turns down innovations the FDA approves because of cost. Our survival rate from stage III-IV cancers exceed every other first world country by 5-10%.  This is true because we have the most innovation and we have the highest profit margins. Immunotherapy for cancer exists here in wider scope and available to more patients than anywhere else.

Our medical system has its problem. But it has superior aspects. To a large extent other systems can provide more care to more people because they are riding on our innovative backs. This is true of Canada.

Medical care is a human right, as the Democrats kept reminding us. So is food. Do we all eat the same food? Shelter? Do we live in the same house? All Americans don't get the same medical care. Some of us get better care, but as long as we all get our needs met and no one goes without our system should be celebrated.

After one of the shingles vaccines had been out for a couple years, I took it.

2020-11-09 15:59:51,My greatest fear is not that this vaccine will be as effective and safe as has been reported so far. I fear the logistics of distributing a vaccine consisting of m-RNA that has to be stored at temperatures lower than that of ordinary freezers.Millions may get an ineffective dose of this vaccine because those responsible for its distribution were unable to maintain the correct temperature. The logistics of the distribution may be more difficult than the development of the vaccine itself.

So what we are being told is that within a few days of the peak level of antibodies produced by the vaccine candidate, the display of symptoms of a COVID-19 infection may be delayed, or actually less if you received the candidate. We are told nothing about the actual rate of infection, since it isn't comprehensively monitored, or whether the increased antibodies will be used by COVID-19 to actually make the disease (it does that in some infections in a number of ways).

But if the pandemic and its affects are indefinite as the result of there not being an effective and available vaccine then I think we would see a world-wide depression of mass unemployment and starvation."

Looking at my cell phone I see the giant news that a vaccine is 90% effective and FDA  approval will be requested at the end of the month.

Talk about having your big line stepped on!"
2020-11-09 16:19:05,"First thing that comes to mind is that Trump and his followers will complain and believe this was planned to coincide with Biden's election and that it is all a conspiracy to take the election away from Trump. 

Remember, Trump has been saying non-stop that the virus is a hoax, it is just the flu, we are rounding the corner, too much testing, herd mentality will fix it, etc....

If the virus is insignificant as Trump as said then the Pfizer vaccine announcement should be irrelevant !!!!"
2020-11-09 16:16:13,"Who in their right mind would take or not take a vaccine produced by Pfizer just because of who was president when they were working on it? This has to be just about the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. You think Pfizer, would jeopardize its reputation and its 53 billion per year income on rushing a vaccine to appease Trump or anyone else?"
2020-11-09 16:22:31,"Pfizer, like other Big-Pharma companies, seems geared up to mass-production of the virus just as soon as the FDA gives a green light. The Trump-Era Operation Warp Seppd is to be thanked for that."
2020-11-09 16:08:15,"Biden will get the job of distributing the Trump vaccine(s).  It had better be flawless.   Good thing Trump got Operation Warp Speed ready.  Biden's advisers said it would be years before we had a vaccine.  Eight months later, here it is.   What a bunch of experts."
2020-11-09 16:11:08,"Gee, isn't it interesting that the announcement comes merely six days after the election?

It occurs to me that big pharma knows that greater profit potential, even if the Biden family has to get their cut, lies with a Democrat in the White House."

2020-11-09 16:19:40,"Who will be our Elvis to take the vaccine ? Biden, Harris, Trump, Pence, Fauci, Gottlieb ??  The Pfizer announcement is potentially the best news of the year.  If I believe other reporting, Cuomo is trying to undermine the announcement. At this stage, Biden is the President and he preaches the triumph of science.  In this transition period - let science rule. The focus should be on how to move forward, not hang onto the past !!!"

Thank you."
2020-11-09 16:14:51,"The wuhan flu has served its purpose and can now go away. Seriously this is just the beginning of the change in tenor of the msm. Things are exactly as they were monday of this week. 

Even if you're happy with the results you should pay attention to the way our information feeds are tailored. Pre election the only stories were about political manipulation of the vaccine trials, the success rate was reported much lower and it won't be ready for months anyway.  It's naive to think news is used to inform and not manipulate but this is just insultingly blatant."
2020-11-09 16:15:19,I'll take it. Give it to me now :)
2020-11-09 16:19:57,Where did the whistleblower from China go? She was the head of some infectious disease department at a university in China and said she had proof that Covid was engineered by China at Wuhan and did not come from nature. I would be curious to know more about that.
2020-11-09 16:20:42,"How well does BioNTech's vaccine work on the elderly population, most susceptible to serious Covid effects? How well does it prevent Covid from multiplying in young people who may transmit the disease even if symptom free?"
2020-11-09 16:13:32,"The article states that the vaccine has not been ""conclusively proved to be safe and effective.' That's a throw away disclaimer. It has been proved safe and effective. I led a drug trial; the numbers here are ridiculously good. Every day the FDA bureaucracy delays getting it out is more than 1000 lives lost. It's unfortunate that the Democrats and the press made resisting the vaccine a thing. In terms of timing, it couldn't be clearer that by setting an arbitrary safety data date, as opposed to number of vaccinations, the FDA postponed the efficacy announcement until after the election, and halved the number of people who will get the vaccine before the end of the year. I don't know that politics was the proximal cause of the delay, but the health bureaucracy is very sensitive to atmosphere. We have seen this movie before. We delayed the Sabine polio vaccine so long that the Soviets had to make and distribute it. Dr. Fauci delayed the use of trimethoprim for pneumocystis prophylaxis in AIDS patients for two years while he accumulated ""more data."" He already knew that the antibiotic worked for other immunosuppresed patients."
2020-11-09 16:10:33,"When a vaccine is 99.9% effective in the general population--across all age groups, racial groups, and sexes, I'll be the first to cheer.  Until then, a company claiming a potential result, which might mean a 1-in-10 death, is a horrible stat."
2020-11-09 16:26:45,"I'm concerned and alarmed that ""Pfizer, which developed the vaccine with the German drugmaker BioNTech, released only sparse details from its clinical trial"" while having plans to ""ask the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization of the two-dose vaccine later this month.""

Once again, this hurry up, warp-speed kind of rush rush testing and requesting for ""emergency authorization"" but not giving a lot of necessary details makes me worry and wonder.

EVERYONE wants a vaccine.  BUT it MUST be proven safe and effective.  I frankly have more questions and concerns than feelings of hope and excitement at this moment."
2020-11-09 16:27:26,"This news is very encouraging. 

 In science, quantitative measurements are accompanied by an estimate of experimental uncertainty which include estimates of systematic and statistical uncertainty.

90%  +/- what ?"
2020-11-09 16:28:52,"Friends and colleagues with backgrounds in virology, immunology,  drug R & D, and public health have recommended we approach these new vaccines and therapies carefully. I will wait and watch on the first go 'round."
2020-11-09 16:32:18,"Congratulations to BioNTech, the small German company that developed this vaccine and has started small scale manufacturing of it.  Credit too to giant Pfizer for adding its resources once it learned of need for them and found the vaccine promising."
2020-11-09 16:32:09,"The article is a bit confusing. It was not Pfizer who developed the vaccine but Biontech. 
The research and development was done in the most parts by the Germans, which also refers to the published results of their phase III study.

Pfizer, especially, does the marketing for Biontech."
2020-11-09 16:31:46,"I, for one, celebrate the diligence and resourcefulness with which these companies and scientists have worked to create, starting from scratch, a vaccine that can bring about an end to this scourge. If they profit, so be it. People, who otherwise would suffer and then they die, won’t."
2020-11-09 16:31:19,"The world should celebrate the speed, accuracy, and efficacy of this effort, as well as the novelty inherent in using RNA to induce immunity - everything about this represents forward thinking and a new and safer approach to vaccination that will impact many other diseases including cancer. 

Also, the article refers to ""Mr. Sahin"" who, in addition to having earned a Ph.D. is a medical doctor and perhaps should be referred to as such."
2020-11-09 16:32:26,"don't get your hopes up and look at the data. only 90 some people got infected out of 44,000. This is nowhere near what we see in the general population. Why is this? Were these people screened for rate of getting infected? Are the data controlled for social distancing and PPE behavior? These factors can greatly skew the data"

2020-11-09 16:47:38,"Normally, it takes a year to collect sufficient data to establish safety. This vaccine induces a powerful killer T-cell response. It is very risky to compress the time frame to collect sufficient data to determine T-cells do not attack human cells. I will not take this vaccine."
2020-11-09 16:48:44,"I don't know who knew what when.

But I do know that the world will trust Pfizer's analysis far more today than it would have a week ago. And that trust might save many, many lives."
2020-11-09 16:49:03,"It will take year's to get all Americans vaccinated. As a physician and over 70, I'll not be too quick to take the vaccine. Pfizer  stands to make mega millions on this; that's their motivation. I will not be lulled into a false sense of security and believe all's well if one is vaccinated. I'm happy to wait a year or two to see what happens."
2020-11-09 17:03:34,"Pfizer shareholders first in line?

There’s lots of ways to decide who gets first access to the vaccine but one I haven’t heard discussed is that Pfizer shareholders should get right of first refusal. Any thoughts on that?  

The argument would be the people whose investment paid for the vaccine to be developed should be close to the front of the line. I can see both sides."
2020-11-09 17:04:51,"It's impossible to trust this while the country's helm is held by someone who insists scientific and medical reports be optimistic. at the expense of truth. Whether Pfizer was financially helped or not, we can't know the real story until Trump is completely out of the picture."
2020-11-09 17:05:45,"I totally don't understand.  Were all the participants exposed to the virus?  In that case this is a tremendous result.  But, if they just had the participants go on with their lives without deliberate exposure, this doesn't mean much.  After all, what percentage of the total general population has gotten the disease?"
2020-11-09 17:11:26,"Given that older people are more likely to have serious complications and/or die from Covid, what age group(s) made up the participants in the study?  Can any conclusions be made about the effectiveness/safety of this vaccine in the 60+ crowd?"
2020-11-09 17:14:30,"While I am excited to see the vaccine appears to have efficacy, what I am really excited about is this may imply that other vaccines using similar technology will be as effective.  We may see several vaccines coming available next year."
2020-11-09 17:14:46,"Thank you Mr. President for getting the ball rolling so quickly and effectively on this issue !
Record time !"
2020-11-09 14:10:43,"A few commentators state that Trump should be given credit for this vaccine.  For heaven’s sake, reread the article.  Pfizer specifically states that it did not get one dime from Operation Warp Speed.  Trump supporters need to grasp that their champion has been anti-science throughout this crisis.  Never forget that emergency health workers lacked protective equipment, and that states had to bid against each other for PPE and ventilators, because of the lack of a national strategy based on science.  Trump failed, but scientists succeeded.  Period."
2020-11-09 16:53:34,"Wouldn't it be wonderful if 75 years after World War II, 30 years after reunification, it was a vaccine from Germany that saves millions of lives and billions of livelihoods?

Many thanks to all scientists in Germany, the USA and across the world. You are the best."
2020-11-09 16:36:06,"This is a great step forward for science, an achievement led by scientists.

That said I am somehow surprised about media not pointing this project out as a perfect example for:
1) international co-operation (technology being developed by a relativey small German company, clinical tests being rolled out by a US powerhouse)
2) global science (there are so many covid vaccines being developed around the world, so many efforts with so much ground laying information being shared globally (not all information of course but quite a lot). It was a question of time for one of these efforts to result in an effective vaccine that now comes close to admittance by authorities; Also, scientists from quite a large number of countries will have been working on this particular project. I don’t know this but media could probably confirm this quite easily)
3) successful integration of immigrants (if you look at the impressive vita of the founders of BionTech who are really core to this achievement)

Maybe media are not pointing this out because it might become too political. And it shouldn’t. But above points could still be made without making it overly political. Anyway, no politician should claim this achievement. Science should (or can)"
2020-11-09 17:18:29,"So Trump was right. Two weeks ago he said that a vaccine was imminent.  Had this announcement come two weeks earlier, Trump would have been reelected."
2020-11-09 17:05:55,"Is my understanding correct? 94 tested positive, 1:1 ratio of vaccine:placebo in the trial sample, this implies that 47 people were expected to be from the placebo group and 47 from the vaccine group (50% of 94 were expected to be from the vaccinated group). Therefore, to be 90% effective, 42 people from the vaccinated group did not contract the virus (42/27 = 0.9) and 5 people did."
2020-11-09 17:21:00,"Yes this is wonderful news ... but ""90% effective"" at exactly what?

A little more than ""sparse"" detail would be very valuable.  On such a small sample, in a disease in which very people die,  it is easy to produce an inflated percentage impact, depending on how one chooses to count ... and exactly what they are counting."
2020-11-09 17:21:24,"This is very interesting vaccine technology and it looks like we're about to find out if it's safe enough to use in people.  Seems to be powerful and relatively quick to develop and manufacture, though relatively difficult to store and transport.  I'm 68 and I'm ready to take it as soon as it's approved by the FDA unless I read something concerning written by people who might know what they're talking about, namely vaccine experts."
2020-11-09 16:51:35,The black cloud is lifting. Hope has arrived on the wings of eagles. Things get better from here.
2020-11-09 17:05:09,"Not sure how these trials work.  Once a vaccine is given to anyone, they wait to see who gets covid, right?  Do they actually deliberately expose some people to the virus, or do they just wait passively to see if anyone in either group gets sick or not?  Sorry if this is a stupid question."
2020-11-09 16:57:29,I smell a rat. These results could have been released before the election. They were going to tell us at 32 cases. There's only a political reason as to why they didn't.

2020-11-09 17:14:07,"Some of the comments about the timing of the announcement about the vaccine is ""dubious"".  Whether it was now or a month from now, the Trumpers would say the same thing. Why are they upset and making noise now? Where was their outrage when Trump blatantly attacked science, belittled Dr. Fauci to the point of death threats and ""lock him up"", politicized wearing masks and continually lied -- ""the vaccine is coming soon"", while hundreds of thousands of their fellow Americans were dying?  From the beginning Trump called the virus a ""Democrat hoax"", ""no big deal"", ""we have it under control""... So dear Trumpers, get off your self-righteous high horse and stop trying to divide this country. It won't work!"
2020-11-09 17:15:41,If Biden and Harris get a dose I will too. Very good news.
2020-11-09 16:54:57,How convenient this announcement and your coverage was made a week after the election.
2020-11-09 16:57:25,Great. The same people who say it's all fake and nobody is dying are already turning around and saying they waited until after the election on purpose and killed people.
2020-11-09 16:59:40,"If Pfizer didn’t take any of the one billion dollars earmarked for Operation Warp Speed, then who did? Where did the money go? Has anyone checked into the scams — ahem, I mean “businesses” run by Trump family members and their friends?"
2020-11-09 17:10:09,"Beware science via PR announcements. No one's seen  the data.

If people think ""the vax works; this is over!"" and drop social distancing, masking (to the extent anyone's still doing that), that's a disaster. Even if this holds up. 

I know: I'm Debbie Downer. I should just, like Trump, cheerlead you all."
2020-11-09 16:35:50,"So was Trump correct all along that we would have 15-20 million doses by the end of the year?

Did I just vote against the man who’s administration saved the world??"

2020-11-09 16:39:59,"The Grand Irony is that Trump and his supporters will claim credit Trump's Warp Speed despite Pfizer saying “We were never part of the Warp Speed, we have never taken any money from the U.S. government, or from anyone.” for a virus they claimed was a hoax AND they will refuse to take it. 

They want credit for it but they won't take the vaccine. 

Its a wonder of expediency."

This is all about the Benjamins."
2020-11-09 16:43:19,"Meanwhile in Denmark a new strain of the coronavirus has already been found in Minks. It can evade the immune response to the coronavirus. That means the current level of herd immunity and any vaccine that gets approved will be useless against it. 

Denmark is trying to stamp this strain out by mass murdering defenceless animals and isolating infected humans. They will probably fail. Even if they do succeed, a mutation that has already happened once can certainly happen again elsewhere."
2020-11-09 17:00:20,"This is exciting news of progress. Before people jump to “we have a vaccine!” remember the caveats: the efficacy rate could go down significantly as the trials progress, side effects could be found to be more serious, and very importantly, the need to keep this vaccine at ultra cold temperatures will mean significant logistical challenges. I am all for feeling the hope this news brings, but cautious optimism is what is warranted at this point. Oh, and wearing masks, limiting gatherings with those outside your household, washing hands, practicing social distance when you need to be out, all those things that we know help now!"

giant pharmaceutical companies are not always as reliable as some pundits are trying to make us believe."
2020-11-09 17:29:14,"This m-RNA vaccine produces exactly the same chemical present on spikes of covid19. That in turn generates T cell antibodies.
Dangers:
1. Is Ferritin level being measured in vaccinated? This stays in blood as inflammation of lungs, blood vessels marker for many months after vaccination. Not a good thing.
2. I expect uncontrolled cytokine flooding and death. 
3. m-RNA could cause unknown gene mutation in human beings (new antigen could affect our DNA). Truly unknown. We could end up modifying human genome to produce an antigen."
2020-11-09 17:22:31,"The more I look into Charles E. Triano, Pfizer’s head of investor relations, the more suspicious I get. When he was VP of investor relations at defunct Forest Laboratories, that company hid adverse studies about its anti-depressants making kids suicidal, and boosted a supposed Alzheimer’s drug that wasn’t actually working, driving its stock up. Triano sold /all/ of his stock in the meantime, and a class action suit accused of him of banking more than $1m in insider trading profits. (The company settled with the government.) 

Why should I trust the Pfizer press release put out by this man?"
2020-11-09 17:27:40,Great news at a last! What a shame the news wasn't released before the election so Mr. Trump could tell us all about it. A pity indeed.
2020-11-09 17:31:21,"While this looks like good news, which we’re all craving, there is a logistical bottleneck in delivering this type of modified RNA vaccine that sounds almost as daunting as its development.

As mentioned, this requires two separate doses of vaccine, which must be stored at super deep freeze temperatures very few facilities can accommodate.

Other than a 60 minutes report last night, I’m not hearing much about infrastructure progress being made to handle actual injections on a large scale.

Luckily, in case delivery of this doesn’t  work out, there is also another type of vaccine being developed (by J&J?) that will require only one injection and no complicated deep freeze storage."
2020-11-09 17:33:34,"It was Trumps desastrous handling of international relations , his Stupid America First and the constant hostility against Europe, in particular Germany. Who he wanted to punish with custom taxes, with pulling out the troops, with never visiting Berlin once in his presidency that prooves now to be just the wrong direction. We are one world, we are friends, partners, we share the same values and dreams. We need to expand our relations, we need to open up societies and defeat hostility and xenophobia. Because only together as partners we can be strong and impress those who want to diminish this freedom and friendship."

Before his defeat, I had predicted that the day POTUS announces a vaccine - Dow Jones will break 30,000 - last time, I checked it is only 150 points from that barrier.

While the credit will go to Biden - I think POTUS can take comfort that history will judge him more kindly.

And pethaps, in a future obituary, the first sentence might read a POTUS who delivered a Wuhan killing vaccine,"

2020-11-09 17:35:51,"Big Pharma is just awful. This vaccine should have been developed in a garage by people who don't know what they're doing. It would have been more egalitarian and sustainable that way. It is terrible too that it was developed so quickly and seems to be so effective, because that will make people think that Big Pharma, especially American Big Pharma,  actually brings benefits to the world."

I appreciate their forbearance."
2020-11-09 17:46:24,"While of course we need to await the complete data and its review by FDA's outside panel, this is very, very good news.

The bad news, I suppose, is that they will only have enough doses to immunize 15 to 20 million people by years's end - a drop in the bucket compared to the global population or even the US one. It going to take a while before vaccines put an end to this pandemic. Until then, we need to continue to wear masks, etc.

"" The company Biontech has presented the first results from its phase III study:

"" As the Mainz-based pharmaceutical company Biontech announced on Monday,  its vaccination offers more than 90 percent protection against the disease Covid-19. It also said that Biontech and the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer are expected to apply for approval from the US FDA from next week. However, this would not mean that the vaccine would be approved in Europe, where the data has yet to be checked by the European Medicines Agency.

The vaccine BNT162b2 had been developed by Biontech in the ""Lightspeed"" project since mid-January. The phase III study, which is crucial for approval, began in various countries at the end of July. More than 43,500 people have now received at least one of the two vaccinations, given every three weeks. According to the manufacturer, vaccination protection is achieved one week after the second injection.

A total of 94 cases of the disease were confirmed by Sunday. According to the information, the preliminary results will only be finally evaluated when a total of 164 cases have been reached. In addition, it will be checked to what extent the vaccination not only protects against Covid-19, but also against severe courses of the disease.

2020-11-09 17:50:26,"Has everyone already forgotten about the very effective - in animals so far - nasal spray developed at Columbia with other partners, announced just a few days ago?   It's cheap, stable, doesn't require refrigeration, and will no doubt work much better for the elderly, for whom vaccines aren't very effective.   If the research holds up in humans and testing, this will be the one that protects the world against the virus by using a simple daily spray."
2020-11-09 17:52:01,"The fact that the former head of the FDA, who resigned and within two weeks was elected to the Pfizer board of directors, may be relevant in early approval of the vaccine."
2020-11-09 17:52:54,"Influenza virus is more complex in composition than coronavirus.

This is TERRIFIC news!"
2020-11-09 17:54:11,"While this appears on the surface to be great news we need to dig deeper into the behavior of people who are participating in the trial.  If 90% of the people in the trial are wearing masks, social distancing and not coming into contact with anyone who is infected with COVID-19, then the results are inconclusive.

And if 10% of the volunteers got infected and they were all not wearing masks or social distancing, then the vaccine has an effective rate of 0%.

Let's not get ahead of ourselves.  Until the vaccine has been in trials for at least 6 to 12 months we have no idea as to the true efficacy and long term consequences.  We can only hope the first results are legitimate and not being skewed by the factors I've described above."
2020-11-09 17:54:12,"My thoughts are that I'm simply troubled beyond belief that Trump and Republicans stake their pride on a vaccine that won't be available in the numbers we need it for several more months, and are at the same time trying to make that vaccine obsolete by making sure to not take any precaution whatsoever.  

For all the nonsense about ""The cure can't be worse than the disease"", they're actively doing their best to make sure that everyone has the disease before the cure is even ready.

I don't want to take away from the fact that this is good news.  It would simply be even better news if we didn't rack up all the lost productivity, long-term injuries, and deaths that we're going to experience before the vaccine can be taken."
2020-11-09 18:02:04,"Would like to offer my sincerest appreciation today to everyone of the vaccine scientists, medical front line workers, ambulance  people, firetruck people, police, nursing home workers, home care personal assistants, and sorry for I'm sure missing many others.

This is the best news so far of this dreadful 2020 year that will long live in the history books. 

I salute you, with a tear in my eye, and a social distanced hug for every single one of you patriots.

Thk You,

From The Whole World."
2020-11-09 18:05:09,"When it is available which people should get the limited vaccine 1st?  
Propose: all emergency health providers - doctors, nurses, aides, EMTs, and hospital support staff including maintenance, followed by local health providers – doctors & staff, dentist, technicians and staff. Then grocery store workers, food packers, transportation drivers etc. ... all essential service folk who have kept it going for us so we could just stay home and wait. 

I would like to think we will share with other countries in distress.

Then teachers and maybe even restaurants and hotels and businesses that provide services that will bring pleasures and freedoms back to our lives and businesses that are struggling the most to survive.  Of course - people suffering with covid would be there too if the vaccine can cure.

2020-11-09 18:05:24,"Trust is not easily earned these days.  Pfizer?  Certainly not Turing, but..."
2020-11-09 18:05:51,"Leave aside the vaccine bit for a moment.  94/44,000 people became infected.  If the efficacy of the vaccine was ~90%, then 10 vaccinated people became infected and 84 placebo recipients became infected.  84 people out of 22,000 is a surprisingly LOW rate of infection, especially for a group who, presumably, took at best the same precautions as the general population and probably fewer."
2020-11-09 18:08:40,"Heartening, but it's still early in safety assessment. There can also be nuance to effectiveness, and with relatively homogeneous volunteer population with regard to race, co-morbidities, no representtion of children, the elderly, pregnant women etc., broad efficacy and safety needs fleshing out. 

So good news, but we need to digest it cautiously. Fauci suggests it's likely coronavirus will become endemic, and we should be prepared. We may also be chasing the target as strains mutate. Eclipsed by our election season is the mutation event Denmark is now responding to in dramatic fashion. 

Within only a few short months the mink-human vector has yielded a mutation with potentially negative consequence for vaccine efficacy. The Dutch government has locked down the Northern Jutland, roughly a 1/4 of the country, and is destroying ALL mink in the country which account for 1% of the Denmark's entire GDP. That is shocking. 

The US has 245 mink farms operating in 22 states. Mink infections have been found here already with 10,000 killed directly by corona and a forced culling of over 1 million infected animals in Utah. I hope experts and health officials are on top of this but I have doubt. 

Would or should the US undertake Denmark's strategy to pre-empt a viral sink from developing in this highly susceptible animal population or wait until a potentially catastrophic problem develops? A wait and see approach may be inadequate at best and deadly if it's the wrong bet."
2020-11-09 18:20:14,"I am a bit skeptical, the data released by Pfizer suggests that only 0.004% of the group receiving the placebo got infected with the virus. In a properly designed experiment one would expect the infection rate of the placebo group to approximate the much higher rate in the general population and the vaccinated group to have a much lower rate than the placebo group. While the study demonstrates the latter, before we rush to conclusions we need to understand why the placebo group had such low infection rates."

2020-11-09 18:03:55,The CEO not the real developers of the vaccine (scientists) are featured in the article's image.  If you removed either the CEO or the scientist from developing the vaccine which one is more crucial?  Which should be paid more in merit based capitalism? LOL

2020-11-09 17:47:38,Trump should get credit for this vaccine as much as he is getting for the latest iPhone
2020-11-09 17:47:08,Can someone tell me what we’re going to do with the three million doses of hydrochloriquin the president has stockpiled?
2020-11-09 17:59:18,"So, let's see. Sometime, in January of this year, work on the vaccine began in Germany by BioNTech.  Realizing how seriously deadly the virus could be, a 40-person team was assembled by them to work on the vaccine.  And guess the name given to this 40-person team?  Wait for it...Project Lightspeed.  A few months later, the Trump administration announces Operation Warp Speed.  Project Lightspeed, Operation Warp Speed.  My point?  You tell me."
2020-11-09 18:06:06,Would like to know who in the Trump circle bought shares of Pfizer and BioNTech when they were initially briefed on the deadly disease.
2020-11-09 18:16:42,"It is indeed good news that the effectiveness is as high as it is preliminarily reported. Congratulations are in order to the team members who developed this vaccine, and to others in other teams for their very valuable effort.

The new, coming as it does exactly a week after the election, it will undoubtedly by interpreted by the enablers of Comrade Putin's Donny puppy to say it must be the work of ""deep state"" that ""conspired"" with the ""deep corporation"" (whatever that means) to delay the announcement in order to hurt Donny puppy's chance for his continuing to sleep and watch TV in the WH for another four years.

On the other hand they can cheer themselves up that when the New York State criminal investigation of him and his company succeeds in court he will continue to be provided a government funded bed to sleep on and government TV to watch that may last longer than four years. Happy Government food and lodging to Donny puppy. Who knows once it gets to that he may not even have to pay back the $400+ millions debt to his bank. And that will be a free bonus."
2020-11-09 18:21:19,"Thank God Joe Biden will be leading the nation when the vaccine is distributed.

Trump would have surely delayed distribution to his enemies, the blue states."
2020-11-09 17:49:04,"Before the election I was among those wary of getting any Covid vaccine.  Trump’s shameless capacity to politicize everything meant I simply couldn’t trust it.

With Trump all but gone, and knowing Pfizer developed it independently, I am eager to get in line for this vaccine."
2020-11-09 18:15:16,"This is potentially—albeit premature—good news for the vulnerable amongst us. 

Don't forget, all of us will eventually experience natural exposure. 99.97% of us will get over it—AND have stronger immune systems as a result of being exposed to the wild virus vs vaccinated against it. But don't take my word for it, our national treasure, Tony Fauci said it himself.

The rest of us are free to line up for a questionable vaccine with unknown long-term side effects. 

Cue the petrified replies…"
2020-11-09 18:19:13,"Let's not talk around it... 
marketing a vaccine for sth like c19 is MEGA-Money for who strikes first.

Although a German company (BioNTech) is said to have done the development I've heard no news hereabouts (NL) that phase 3 of the trials is now concluded.

An 'emergency' authorization needs a real emergency. It might subject millions of people to (severe) damage not yet detected. We are in a crisis. Not in an emergency.

We should follow the rules for the authorization of drugs strictly. Even if it all works out fine in pahse 3 and the rate of effectiveness is similar to the common flu (ca 90%) it will take a year to vaccinate through the population. Even here
people cannot be compelled to get a vaccination if they choose not to.

Besides, c-19 (similar to the common flu) seems to mutate happily along > minkfarms e.g.). I doubt that most people know that what is offered as a vaccine against the common flu in 2018 was different from the cocktail of 2019 or 2020.

In other words: the common flu is highly mutable and the vaccine against it runs a year behind so to speak.
There is no reason not to think that this won't be the case with c19. 

Again: wonderful news if Pfizer can deliver a safe drug ! 
Your country has just chucked a 'president' who pushed drugs on prime time... let's wait this time and do it right ?"
2020-11-09 17:51:25,"Just congratulated my neighbor, a high raking Pfizer officer. She said they need to do a few more things but they are close."
2020-11-09 18:00:13,"This data presumes that the virus will not undergo a significant mutation in the next 1-2years. To date a major mutation has not occurred but they usually do in 1yr or so. The jury should hold its verdict until more data regarding RNA mutations is available. We have spent over $12 Billion on ""Operation Light Speed"" already and it could be a complete waste of money-- if a significant mutation occurs in the near future. We hope this vaccine is effective but we will have to wait and see to make believers out of the doctors who will be charged with convincing our patients to take this vaccine. I would not trust Dr,Scott Atlas' opinion on vaccines--he is a Neuroradiologist, whose only experience treating infectious disease occurred for maybe 1-2 months of his internship 40 years ago."
2020-11-09 18:22:56,"""But Dr. Jansen sought to distance the company from Operation Warp Speed and presidential politics, noting that the company — unlike the other vaccine front-runners — did not take any federal money to help pay for research and development."" - But of course the $1.95 billion to supply vaccine to the US govt was not a factor in the amount of resources Pfizer has deployed to develop the vaccine. Won't be surprised if Pfizer knew the 90% efficacy rate prior to Nov 3."
2020-11-09 18:22:00,"I am waiting for all  the gloom and doom fearmongers, who say that this vaccine will not work and that we are all doomed to get sick, no matter what.

Any takers? 

Yeah.....I didn't think so!"
2020-11-09 18:41:27,"This is good news, but a 2-shot vaccine that has to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures is unstable and probably impractical to use on a large population.  Perhaps it will be distributed first to essential workers and our health care heroes while we await the results of other vaccine trials."
2020-11-09 18:44:09,Trump cabinet members and  Republican enablers should quickly volunteer for the trials. If effective it might be the only way they won't  catch Covid-19.
2020-11-09 18:45:23,"I don't know why they keep announcing this kind of ""sparse details"". Moderna did that a few times already and now Pfizer. There must be a PR competition going on between pharmas. Maybe they are making the announcements to build the public confidence. Personally, it does the opposite: it makes me think that politics and marketing are the priority over science. 

Given the frayed confidence, I don't think too many people will take it based only on the preliminary data and EUA. But millions initial doses should be enough for frontline workers and some high risk people. The rest can wait till the final result is available in the Spring after the initial EUA roll out."
2020-11-09 18:46:37,"Here is another problem to deal with. In Arizona, one study (poll?) determined that 37 percent of the people asked would not take a vaccine. In Montana, a similar study (poll) turned in the number of 29 percent. I am sure these are some of the people who are not wearing masks. I don't have an answer for that."
2020-11-09 18:47:35,"Aounfs like good new, but I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere that 'efficacy' is not the same as 'effectivness' in drug trial terminology.  Efficacy is whether the drug has some effect, whereas effectiveness is whetherbit has a significant effect over placebo, or something like that."
2020-11-09 18:50:21,"Given their history, and desire for profit, I'd not trust anything from Pfizer, least of all something this good, almost too good to be true, and we know what that means."
2020-11-09 18:58:47,This continuing pattern of drug companies announcing their data without a true peer review only increases their stock and makes the stock market soar with invalidated data. There should be a rule they cannot do their announcements until the actual data is peer reviewed.
2020-11-09 19:05:51,"Let's be careful.  This is just one test and Pfizer may be announcing this to try to corner the market.  There is so much money to be made on a vaccine this could get ugly.

2020-11-09 19:08:12,"I wonder how critical the timing will be on receiving the 2-injection vaccine series. 

When Shingrix came out, people who received the first vaccine had a hard time obtaining the second vaccine.  They eventually advised providers that if you waited longer than 6 months, the second vaccine would still work.  Mind you this was for a smaller cohort population of people over 50 or 55, and a lot more was known about the length of zoster antibodies after the documented weakening of antibodies of those who received Zostavax, the original zoster vaccine.  

I think Pfizer has a lot longer to go to proceed into phases 2 and 3 trials by next April."
2020-11-09 19:09:08,"Can any readers offer a clear and accurate picture of what's actually in this vaccine?

Vaccines for other diseases have included mercury, aluminum, Thymerisol, and other ingredients whose safety for human consumption has been questioned in independent studies.

For example, the studies I've seen don't recommend any safe injectable dose for aluminum or mercury and none for their synergistic impact.

I'd like to read the label before I buy."
2020-11-09 19:11:38,They didn't take the government money because they did not want it to get in the way of what they are going to charge consumers for the vaccine.  Big Pharma no matter what is in it for the $$$ to say otherwise is not wise.
2020-11-09 19:19:03,"The numbers are very, very small at this point...both for establishing efficacy in prevention, and for assessing potential down-side complications.  Pfizer's stock soars, but there's a long way to go before we can really trust this result."
2020-11-09 19:26:29,This announcement coming after Trump has lost his re-election bid is a continuation of the good news that keeps coming in the post-Trump era. Everyone knows that he would have been claiming credit for this news even though his administration had nothing to do with it. It may have been enough to tip the scales in his favour. Hopefully this will hurt him to the end of his days.
2020-11-09 19:26:56,"I wonder how many times Trump has begun to tweet that the CEO and big pharma are against him, and it must have been a conspiracy to vote Trump out to withhold this information until now.

On the other hand, you can't rush things, and even if there was any leeway in when to release this information, bit certainly bolsters not only the economy but the mood of the nation that there is hope."
2020-11-09 19:33:19,If a Pfizer is touting a 90% success rate then the real number is probably closer to 50%. There is no way that there has been enough time to complete legitimate safety trials or to assess real-world clinical efficacy.
2020-11-09 19:14:38,As a German I am glad that there is such a successful cooperation on a scientific level.
2020-11-09 19:16:43,"It is great there could be a vaccine with such great success but the timing stinks.  I know many Trump supporters who were saying that the virus was a hoax and that a 'vaccine' would magically come out just after the election.

But then, it is 2020."
2020-11-09 18:27:39,"makes you wonder if Big Pharma could have a cure for other ailments ( e.g. diabetes , forms of cancer etc) if the pressure and incentives from government were applied to them.......

maybe there have them in a vault somewhere already waiting for the right profitable moment....."
2020-11-09 18:48:21,Very disappointing article and comments. We should be rejoicing not trying to take credit. Kudos to the researchers and to Trump.
2020-11-09 19:12:41,But wait! I guess gone are the days when scientific findings are vetted by peer-review. Where's the data? This sounds like an info-mercial.
2020-11-09 18:43:12,"Thinking from a purely selfish point of view, this information couldn't have been released at a worst time; a NZ company CVC.com is having a crowdfunding campaign tomorrow to get the public to invest money in their covid-19 vaccine. Think I'll still invest the small amount of money I was going to as I wasn't going to bet more than I was prepared to use. I still think NZ has a chance to discover a vaccine as well, and they'll need lots of these vaccines because covid-19 isn't like the flu and 90% isn't 100% or proven to be safe to be used on the population."
2020-11-09 19:36:20,If President Biden's team approves this vaccine I would get it. Couldn't say the same about Trump's team minus Fauci!
2020-11-09 19:43:42,The sample is way too small to determine effectiveness or SAFETY!
2020-11-09 19:49:12,"In a bit of irony, the fact persons who received either vaccine or the placebo are being infected at a much higher rate than anticipated is facilitating more rapid development of the vaccine. The highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 is what is powering rapid progress, not politics."
2020-11-09 19:57:53,Many thanks for waiting until after the election to make this announcement. We love you Pfizer!
2020-11-09 20:04:12,"What does Pfizer mean by their trial ""suggests"" it is robustly effective? SUGGESTS?
I've had some courses in statistics and science must use statistics to demonstrate that a science experiment, which is what the vaccine trial is, did not yield results that could have happen by chance. That is, there was no high chance of the results being a chance event.
I would not get this vaccine without more info and the removal of the word ""suggests."" I can't believe the stock market is jumping up and up over this. Relax investors, you are being used and abused!"
2020-11-09 20:00:16,This is promising news but...I don't want to be first in line for this and it's going to take months to get it to the masses IF it's approved. I'm still missing information about how we could develop something like this when we know so little about the virus.
2020-11-09 20:10:16,"With this wonderful news comes an uncomfortable moral dilemma for US authorities: approve this apparently effective and safe -- but difficult-to-distribute -- vaccine or continue with testing of other promising vaccines that may be cheaper, more effective or easier to distribute (such as in tablet form)? If the Pfizer vaccine, which requires refrigeration at a temperature of  -94 degrees, is authorized for widespread distribution, its availability (at least in wealthy countries) may kill trials of other vaccine candidates that may cheaper to produce and distribute (e.g. as a tablet or nasal spray that could be stored at room temperature).  Who would want to volunteer to test an unproven vaccine or, worse yet, a placebo, when a vaccine known to be effective is available? Sad to say, but billions of people in the poorer parts of the world will likely have no access to the initially limited quantities of the Pfizer vaccine for many months to come, so it is likely that other vaccine candidates will continue to be tested there. A sad reflection of global ineqaulity."
2020-11-09 18:58:27,"I know it's way too premature to get overly excited, but....it is SO nice to hear some positive news about COVID."
2020-11-09 17:04:50,"The irony of Trump’s lack of leadership in controlling the spread of Covid-19 is that, while the work of Pfizer  and BioNTech continued apace without financial or technical support from his administration, the dramatic surge in new cases (devastating for the American public in relative terms compared to other countries) led to the US/German partnership’s accelerated assessment of the random pool of actual virus-infected cases to reach statistically significant numbers. The dark cloud of his non-action had a positive silver lining in permitting today’s US/German  “interim” announcement. If Pfizer and BioNTech announced last Monday, Trump would have shamelessly taken 100% credit for something he had nothing to do with from a financial or scientific perspective, and the voting dynamics of last Tuesday’s election without detailed expurgation of the truth for the spur-of-moment and low-information threshold voters may well have been different. Whew!"
2020-11-09 20:17:38,Now Biden will be taking credit for it as well as for the economy which he inherited directly from Obama.
2020-11-09 20:21:24,Nope. Ya’ll get ahead of me in that line. Too quick. Let’s see what a couple of years brings...meantime I’m fine with the mask and social distancing.
2020-11-09 19:11:46,Use it first in the White House.  It's a super spreader site.  It seems like everyone who works there spreads the virus.
2020-11-09 19:58:46,"Whether it’s Obama’s or Biden’s or Trump’s Administration who approves the covid vaccine, I’d still be skeptical and let others take the bloody vaccine first. And wait for any long term health adverse effect. Furthermore, the fact BioNTech (Pfizer’s partner) used a technology that is not approved for human trial is daunting."
2020-11-09 20:34:03,"This is just the kind of thing James Comey pulled. In October of 2016 he made, for political reasons, an announcement that shouldn't have been political. His investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails should have been kept confidential at that important time just before an election. 

Here it is the opposite. Pfizer said it was going to announce interim results as soon as a total of 32 patients in the trial had been infected with Covid-19.  That point was reached before the election, it seems, but given that the announcement would have political implications, the announcement was delayed until today. 

That's wrong. James Comey should not have made his announcement. Pfizer should have made its announcement. Politics should not have played a role in either announcement."
2020-11-09 20:36:02,"Please realize that no one outside of the pharmaceutical company has seen the data.  The follow up is 7 days.  The report is only preliminary and not final as the study is not complete.  It is far too early to be anything but hopeful.  The issue for us all right now is that we are in the midst of a pending disaster way too soon for any vaccine to help.  Something must be done now to prevent spread.  This is not magic, it is science."
2020-11-09 20:12:58,Excellent. Now we need to wait and see about side effects that do not show right away.
2020-11-09 20:32:22,"Please don't think that this is a political move or a victory for Trump.  I used to work at a major pharmco--in their clinical trials department--and let me tell you--it's very easy to manipulate results in early trials.  Institutions, study groups, and whose results are statistically significant are frequently cherry-picked when private industry is involved.  Don't forget--Pfizer's acquisition of Wyeth was spurred by Pfizer having its ""blockbuster"" pipeline of 6 new drugs totally collapse in late stage 3 trials--5 out of 6 were found to be either unsafe and/or not any more effective than current standards of care.  Pfizer got a HUGE handout from the taxpayers and now they MUST justify it with anything at all.  Remember that most drugs developed in the US have at least some degree of Federal funding and therefore face much more scrutiny (check out any cancer drug development).  I would wait and see what gets approved in Germany and get that one instead; their drug development process is much less corrupted by money and politics."
2020-11-09 20:13:34,"These headlines are terribly misleading, if this is early data in terms of efficiency, and Pfizer really doesn’t know how long someone is Covid proof, or even how safe it is, or isn’t. Maybe the headline should’ve read, something like , “Pfizer’s Vaccine Shows Promising Results, More Testing Needs To Be Done”. The FDA changed the way drugs come to market mostly for the benefit of drug makers, they can use the “fast track” method of brining drugs to the market which basically means they speed up testing. We all know it can take years to bring a new drug to the market especially when pharmaceutical companies don’t have to spend their own money on research and development. Take the new class of HIV drugs, those were developed by the government paid for by tax dollars, but since the government can’t own a patent, they give it to big pharmaceutical companies to actually press into pills, or make an injectable drug. Then they turn around and gouge the only market left if the world where there aren’t price controls in place, as if they took the financial risk, it’s the United States. 

You can rest assured, Americans will pay a high price for this Covid vaccine, not only will the tax payer fully funded the research and development of it, but the consumer will be gouged for it because this country is the only one left in the world where big pharmaceutical companies can make billions of dollars because they with the blessing of republicans can gouge the consumer."
2020-11-09 20:23:56,"They announce in the media that their vaccine gave immunity of 90% in 94 patients they had followed for A WEEK!
They need results in many thousands who have been followed for 3 months MINIMUM.
This is not in a peer reviewed scientific journal but in the media.
Also this causes their stock price to climb rapidly.
This is NOT how this should happen."
2020-11-09 20:42:57,"@Atb
They have been working on a vaccine for Covid, there are 6,000 strains of the Corona virus, the common cold is a Corona virus, the flu, Corona. But vaccines need to be properly vetted as Saulk (the inventor of the Polio vaccine) found out when his initial vaccine actually caused polio. By the way, polio while it’s not a Corona virus it’s still a virus that is transmitted the same way as the flu is transmitted. But Jonas Salk fixed his vaccine and never made one dime from it, as far as he was concerned, he got paid twice a month, he was a scientist, he understood that sometimes for the greater good. It’s my guess that not only will the tax payer be on the hook for the full cost of research and development, then we’ll be gouged for it.  Because the U.S. is the only country left in the world where pharmaceutical companies can gouge consumers. Not so in Europe, Hep C treatment in this country is $80,000 for an 8 week course of treatment one pill a day. In Europe, that same drug is less than $50.00."
2020-11-09 20:45:05,"This announcement by Pfizer is the 4th or 5th such ""breakthrough"" this year.  So Pfizer has now cemented its first place status among the companies racing to get the vaccine franchise, until another company can top it.

The big-pharma company that comes up with a safe, effective, single-dose vaccine that does not need to be refrigerated, will make many billions off of international distribution.  But the sheer cost of it will ensure that many will never be able to get it - just like the high cost of getting COVID19 tests in the U.S.

Given the high-profit motive, I believe nothing that these companies claim. I will, however, believe an endorsement of a viable vaccine from the scientific community. I look forward to THAT announcement."
2020-11-09 20:53:05,"First, this is excellent news.
Second, the apparent high case differential between vaccinated vs controls means they will need less people enrolled and time to reach their predetermined goals.
Third, the big outstanding question is if this decreases severe cases as well as overall cases. The 9 cases are clearly not enough to make that determination, and it is not clear that they will know even after meeting their enrollment & case goals, since I don't think the study was designed to address that question. It would be nice to know if any of the 9 cases so far was severe or not.
Ideally, when vaccinated, even if you get Covid19, you will have a milder course, as is typical with Influenza."
2020-11-09 20:39:28,"Thought provoking tidbits from the article:

o BioNTech started work in January of 2019
o To be manufactured in Austria
o Pfizer role:  test trial wherewithal, production, gov contacts

- Mr. Sahin is one half of the team, the other being his wife (and fellow board member, scientist and doctor), Oezlem Tuereci. 

- both are the children are Turkish immigrants to Germany.  He was born in Turkey.

So the world will need other types of vaccines to truly rid us of this pandemic. A huge thanks to BioNTech, who started working on this way back in January, when most of us hadn't even heard of Covid-19."

2020-11-09 22:29:13,"What I would like to know is if each subject had an antibody test prior to getting the test vaccine to determine if they had been infected with the virus. Also, what was their measure for infection? Was it a positive PCR COVID test or an antibody test?"
2020-11-09 22:31:51,"I am not sure why they continue to provide limited or vague press releases. From looking back at articles, Pfizer’s protocol was to split the trial into two groups, and started counting cases seven days after the second shot. 60% efficacy is 164 COVID cases, according to the article. The 43,538 person trial had 94 COVID cases with 8 cases for the vaccine recipients. If I am not mistaken, then the placebo has better than 60% efficacy. The minimum from the FDA is 50%"
2020-11-09 22:34:57,"We should be hopeful but cautious. The Yale professor who expected 55% seemed stunned. And if the analysis is based on 94 infected subjects, ostensibly from the placebo group (as was inferred), I am left with a number of questions. There were 44,000 subjects in the study. Off the top of my head, what if those protected were age and sex segregated from those who were not protected (males/and older). At present we just have to wait for the details, and hope the appropriate comparisons were made to warrant the press release."
2020-11-09 22:37:37,"These data from Pfizer vaccine trial are not that impressive-There is much to learn yet and much more data to glean before anyone should think about having this vaccine. Pfizer, to their credit, was not one of the ""Warp"" vaccine producers touted by Trump. 

Americans should know that the Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinopharm has had their vaccine in clinical trials in other countries and because of the low levels of Covid-19 in China, gave the vaccine to 56 thousand Chinese persons slated to travel abroad. None of the travellers, who went to countries with circulating viral cases, have tested positive. This Sinovac vaccine would be my choice because it is a simple vaccine using killed virus-without all of the miscellaneous additions-such as MRNA and other extraneous materials. It is safe, without side effects, and works. If and when it becomes available in Canada, I will choose this vaccine as an immunology trained person. 

Americans must be careful to not rush into a vaccine which is being promoted by big Pharma-or the government. This is the time for people to think of risk versus benefit-by getting a vaccine with no long term history and with no short term history of how long any immunity from a vaccine will last. Of course, a safe vaccine will be useful but it is not a world wide panacea. This Covid-19 will not be vanquished by any vaccine soon. Only good response to known public health measures will end a pandemic."
2020-11-09 22:40:31,"Taking the population of the US as 330 million, the number of Americans who become infected daily as 111,000, and the number of participants in the study who received placebo as 22,000, I would expect 7 or 8 placebo-treated patients a day to become infected. Consequently, even if the vaccine were 100% effective (no cases in the vaccine-treated group), it would take 10 days or less to accumulate another 70 cases. Based on the formula for determining vaccine effectiveness, i would expect approximately 8 of the vaccinated subjects and 86 of the non-vaccinated subjects were infected in the data announced so far. The trials conducted so far make it unlikely that the vaccine will have common early side effects that are worse than mild and short-lived, but it will obviously take longer to identify rare rapidly-developing serious side effects and serious side effects that take longer to develop. It is also too early to know how long vaccine-induced protection will last. The Pfizer vaccine requires storage at less than -70°C; this can be achievable with dry ice (temperature -78°C) - inconvenient but not difficult in 1st world countries. Balancing storage issues, RNA vaccines should be easier and less expensive to produce in large quantity than protein vaccines. Even though 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine are required and other vaccines in development may have a better combination of safety, efficacy, cost, and convenience, this news is very promising and for me, better than expected."
2020-11-09 22:20:08,There is no info concerning how it would effect those who eventually get the most ill.  The 90% number should be taken with the fact that most most people do not get seriously ill from the corona virus.  The financial bonanza aspect of the story needs to be kept away from a medical crisis of this sort.  There is  obvious preliminary good news for Pfizer's stock holders but let all the  information of the vaccine's efficacy be seen before declaring victory.

2020-11-09 21:43:15,"I'm not sure what people wanted Trump to do. He encouraged the development of testing and vaccines, and let the states handle regulations, as they should. The quality of the testing has been very slow to materialize, and vaccines take time to develop and test. Viruses do not follow political guidelines, and are not prejudiced against the elderly, obese, and minorities. They are simply opportunistic and seek out susceptible hosts.

But that doesn’t mean you rush a drug through an abbreviated process without understanding how the vaccine will interact with different kind of pharmaceutical drugs someone might be taking, how effective is it, how long are you protected for. Just to produce a drug because of a pandemic is irresponsible. This country survived the Spanish Flu, if we replicated what they have done in Wuhan, Vietnam, South Korea, Australia, an enforced mask mandate, testing, tracing, quarantine. No one has the right to infect anyone else with disease, nobody has that much personal freedom. That personal freedom ends at their front door. John Stuart Mills wrote “Generally, a person should be left as free to pursue his own interests as long as this does not harm the interests of others. In such a situation, ""society has jurisdiction over [the person's conduct]."" He rejects the idea that this liberty is simply for the purpose of allowing selfish indifference. Oddly he was a conservative, who didn’t think much of other conservatives. He wrote “Conservatives are not necessarily stupid, but most stupid people are conservatives”. There seems to be a lot of truth to that statement. He said, “No great improvements in the lot of mankind are possible until a great change takes place in the fundamental constitution of their modes of thought”. and “Everyone who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit”."

The NY Times’  continuing use of the label “Pfitzer’s Vaccine” implies that the vaccine was invented in the US and will be produced in the US

Neither is the case

The vaccine,   BTN162b2, was invented by a German company.   The BTN in it’s designation refers to BionTech,  a company in Mainz

The vaccine will be produced in Austria

The US used to be the leading country in pharma research and production but has outsourced most of it. 

This caused Congressional concern

2020-11-09 18:52:13,This underlines that Trump was indeed being effective in combating the pandemic.  Only the most naive liberals or the completely deluded ones will not admit that this news was very likely held up a week or two to hamper Trump in the election. For the most part everyone in my state and city have been wearing masks and we still have the spikes.  Pretending that masks will prevent the spread is a dangerous fallacy.

Please explain why this ""roll-out"" of an unapproved vaccine is happening. Does Pfizer have an agreement of some kind with the Warp Speed project? Do the journalists on this piece understand that manufacturing mass quantities of a drug that's not yet approved by the FDA is...bizarre?

and:
""by the time the company had finished discussions with the agency and the independent board was ready to look at the data on Sunday.""
is just a roundabout way of saying that the FDA told them not to release the interim analysis before the election due to political considerations. I get it, prominent Democrats including Joe Biden were telling the public to be skeptical of any ""rushed"" vaccination announcements made before the election which was incredibly dangerous. That said, I'm dissappointed in how the FDA caved to that political pressure to delay the interim analysis. If the FDA had a problem with the sample size for the first interim analysis, they would have changed it when approving and reviewing the protocol."

2020-11-10 00:28:43,My understanding is that this vaccine needs to be handled in a super cold environment to be delivered to the patient. The lack of facilities that have such capacity may limit the speed and extent of its distribution at least initially.
2020-11-10 00:40:27,"The last bit, barely even mentioned - is a huge issue when it comes to delivery. Ultra cold temperatures doesn't communicate the constraints for delivery. You aren't talking a freezer or an ice pack, you're talking -112 deg F throughout its delivery or it won't work. 4x colder than freezing, carefully managed at every point in the distribution process or the vaccine won't work. 

All this while changing admins, where the side that won't admit defeat can't even book a hotel for a press conference. Not wanting to prove the boss wrong is not a recipe for success in logistics.

Throw enough money at vaccine research and you'll hit it eventually, is it is possible. Production and supply chain are a different animals, and you can't start scaling that until you're getting close to the bull's eye."

There is another German Biotech company called CureVac (owned by a big shareholder and founder of SAP) . They are also developing a vaccine against Covid19. So far they are not ready yet. They are testing phase 1 & 2 combined. Bill Gates Foundation has bought shares and Trump at one stage wanted to buy the company but was rejected by the owners."

In my personal opinion, Mr.Trump could have saved himself from the Sars CoVid 2 virus infection if he had developed the habit of wearing mask from the day he came to know about the pandemic and earned an edge over Democratic party in the election.
Mr.Trump's aversion to wearing the mask and his infection after the first debate have become a shot in the arm for  Mr.Biden, the man for mask mission.."
2020-11-10 01:01:09,90% effective is nowhere near good enough- it’s essentially useless.  Any Covid-19 vaccine must be 100% or all bets are off.

2020-11-10 02:26:29,"This article misses an important point. On October 27 the CEO of Pfizer told analysts on an earnings conference call that there had not yet been 32 Covid-19 cases among the patients in the trial. That was less than 2 weeks ago. 

Now this announcement says there have been 94 cases. And that Pfizer had changed its protocol to announce only when there were 64 cases, and then delayed even then. 

Why the delay? The only reason I can think of is the election on November 3. Pfizer, it seems, could have announced these favorable results before the election. 

To me, that seems unethical for the FDA and Pfizer to delay the announcement for political purposes. It should have been done according to the announced protocol. Either the announcement should have been made earlier, as soon as there were 32 cases, or the change in protocol should have been announced. 

To do this was wrong."

2020-11-10 02:46:02,"For everyone worrying about being vaccinated, don’t. This is all preliminary, and even if it’s finally approved, priority will go to essential workers and the most vulnerable, and as commenters have mentioned, distribution will be tricky. There’ll be plenty of time to expose glitches before it is offered to the average citizen."
2020-11-10 02:52:52,"With all due respect to the interim results, it is important to be cautious about their application to the real world:
1) The overall efficacy result is based on a broad range of ages of mostly healthy individuals who likely had only mild to moderate illness (this remains to be seen). The relevant efficacy is mostly in older and immunocompromised individuals having moderate to severe illness.
2) The ""placebo"" used in vaccine trials is with rare exceptions not inactive (saline) but another vaccine or vaccine component. Apart from masking side-effects of the treatment arm, if the placebo causes a reduction in immunity against SARS-CoV-2 then the treatment effect appears greater than it really is.

For these two reasons the external validity of the trial is unknown, and may not ever be known unless the vaccine is researched in subsequent (post-licensing) trials. And if receipt of a vaccination is taken to be a stamp of immunity that obviates doing Covid-19 testing, its role in ending the pandemic will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Achieving this picture-perfect finish is just a matter of getting the timing right."

China, meanwhile, with authoritarian glee, as announced by President Xi himself, has vowed, “Covid-19 vaccine development and deployment in China, when available, will be made a global public good, which will be China’s contribution to ensuring vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries."" Wow, brutal. 

Other than to highlight the numerical spread of COVID, I don't recall hearing any major U.S. official say anything about materially helping less developed countries cope with COVID. A small example: the Caribbean is in America's back yard; yet, and again yet, it is China, according to the Times that has dispatched large shipments of test kits, masks, and ventilators to the region PLUS upwards of 6 billion bucks in low interest loans over 15 years. 

I do recall, though, America's non-authoritarian democratically president saying (with $ signs gleaming in his eyes) what an economic boon it will be, ""If America develops the vaccine first!"" Oh, my! No belt and no initiative!"
2020-11-10 03:09:44,New Zealand is one of the few countries that has a pre-signed contract to be amongst the first in line for the vaccine. It will be safe as our government doesn't roll out anything unless it has been proved safe to use on the public. If it's available for kiwis to get then it's safe to use. Keep an eye on what our government does.
2020-11-10 04:11:40,"Excellent interim results, but they are interim results.
Things to keep in mind:
1) logistics - the vaccine needs to be kept at -80C... this is going to be very difficult to maintain and will restrict release to major centers initially.
2) We haven't ruled out Antibody Dependent Enhancement... it is essential that this is done in so far as is possible prior to any mass vaccination campaign given the obvious problems that would arise if ADE occurs.
3) Early vaccine results are often overly optimistic, just as early pandemic numbers are often overly pessimistic. 

Great work nonetheless.  Looking forward to more data."
2020-11-10 04:12:49,"I heard on National Public Radio that Trump's demon-seed offspring, Donald Jr., made the remark that the timing of Pfizer's announcement - after the election - was suspicious, implying that it was politically motivated. Hardly surprising remark - the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  The people at Pfizer and BioNtech were working as quickly as they could, without cutting corners or risking rushed results which would be good politics for Trump but bad science for the rest of us.  My thanks to those two companies."
2020-11-10 04:15:22,Is there ever an article or video about injectable vaccines that doesn’t feature a grimacing adult or screaming child? The images are harmful to any vaccination program.
2020-11-10 04:02:38,"It is interesting when thinking that Moderna was on this before BioNTech, yet Moderna's phase III trials are going to come out after the Pfizer/BioNTech partnership.  Is it that BioNTech has benefited from Pfizer's extensive expertise in conducting clinical trials as opposed to relatively tiny Moderna's go-it-alone approach which landed them in second place?

The second point I'd like to make is that I wish the journalists who tell this story emphasize that this is what happens when we increase the amount of resources that go to funding science and technology in the United States.  The whole world has become inured to the dismally slow pace of scientific discoveries because of the risible amount of limited funding scientists receive.  The US government pulled in $3.5 trillion dollars in revenue in 2019 and the budget of the NIH was only approximately $0.04 trillion dollars.  (My fellow scientists leap for joy when it goes up by $1 billion, yea mediocrity!) Yet, the pentagon's budget is $0.6 trillion.  What's wrong with a situation where the pentagon's budget is reduced to $0.5 trillion and we increase the NIH's to $0.14?  Or reducing the pentagon's budget to to $0.55 trillion and increasing the NIH's to $0.09 trillion?  More money to scientists equals more benefits to society.  Less money to scientists equals fewer benefits to society."
2020-11-10 04:47:25,"Actually, precisely because it's made from RNA is why this vaccine could be manufactured at hundreds of facilities around the world. Proteins -what vaccines are usually made of- are finicky and must be made by living cells, then purified. RNA can be cranked out by machines much faster and cheaper."
2020-11-10 04:54:51,"Ok, I am boasting a bit: not only has a German company developed the most promising vaccine - in January at the university hospital Charité in Berlin the very first test for the Corona virus had been developed (based on information provided by the Chinese). It was soon afterwards recommended and distributed by the WHO and used by countries around the world - except the USA which preferred to develop its own test, which took them several months longer."
2020-11-10 05:09:01,"Wonderful to read about companies working steadily and not proceeding at warp speed. I wonder about the people who got placebo’s and got covid. What did their placebos contain, liposomes? Was it mild or serious? This would be very interesting to focus on. Imagine if an empty drop of oil could tickle the immune system enough for it to efficiently battle covid. 

 I wonder if they have tried this on the poor mink population in Denmark that’s being culled. Would it not be a great animal model to study and challenge with covid, before humans."
2020-11-10 05:42:28,"This is good news, the world sure needs some help with this virus and if science comes to the rescue, well, that would be wonderful. Yay scientific method and yay scientists!

(I'm from the polio generation, one of my brothers got that and a doctor pulled him through and the next year Jonas Salk presented the world with the vaccine. I just remember lining up in the school, the whole town was there it seemed, and eating a little sugar cube and oowp, polio was no longer terrifying all our parents. Yes, science is good in my book. Thank you scientists.)"
2020-11-10 05:59:01,"Are we being misled? Other sources say the tests on 44,000 people were just 7 days long. How can that possibly be adequate testing for a vaccine for billions of people worldwide. While I'm thrilled that Pfizer is making good progress, this feels like a rush to judgment for greed or politics---or both. We need to do this right to save lives and to maintain faith in vaccines as public health tools."
2020-11-10 06:01:02,"Most people I went to school with could barely do the basics in high school math and science classes, let alone in college or graduate school. Everyone is skeptical of science until their life is on the line. Just about 100 years after widespread public health, sanitation and vaccinations, we have anti-vaxxers. About 50 years after desegregation, we have segregated spaces on universities ('safe spaces') and 'racial pride' movements (Black and White alike). What a pity that we don't ever seem to grow up."
2020-11-10 06:40:20,"I am a volunteer in this Pfizer Covid-19 clinical trial here in the US, and I investigated the vaccine thoroughly before agreeing to be a volunteer. This article is incorrect in stating that the vaccine is made with mRNA from the actual virus, but with a lab-created synthetic version of the mRNA from the virus spike protein. There is no living RNA or killed RNA from any part of the virus in Pfizer's or Moderna's vaccine. Whether I received the vaccine or the placebo, I feel proud and fortunate to have been given the opportunity to participate in this remarkable and historic medical experiment."
2020-11-10 05:16:19,Triumph of science and human ingenuity! The mRNA technique opens up a brand new pathway to combat viral illnesses. Nobel Prize winning stuff.
2020-11-10 09:01:18,"The article is a mess, jumping all over the place.  Were 30,000 or 44,000 total given the vaccine or placebo?  Where does the  90% number come from?  94 infections is 90% of what?  What was the degree of those 94 infections?

And since these infected people were weren't exposed to the actual virus, doesn't whether they became infected depend on who they had contact with and where?

I have managed to avoid the virus myself while doing regular exercising, going to the gym , shopping at a regular variety of stores and wearing ill fitting masks.  Does the fact that I have not contacted the virus mean anything?"
2020-11-10 09:57:04,"until now we have only heard Pfizer as the developer of the new vaccine in most of the US media.
I’m just wondering why most of the media continue to leave Biontech out of their reports.
Wouldn’t it be a good message to celebrate international cooperation on this vaccine?

Actually, it was a small company in Mainz, Biotech - across the river from me here in Germany, that developed the vaccine. This is the company Trump wanted to buy and in order to capture the exclusive rights. The company refused to sell. Biontech partnered with Pfizer, which has huge production capabilities, for the production and distribution of the vaccine.

A neat piece of info is that the founder of Biontech, Dr. Ugur Sahin, immigrated to Germany at the age of 4. He’s a physician who, with his wife started the research company with the goal of curing cancer."
2020-11-10 10:53:59,"Until vaccines are distributed, President-Elect Biden should get public service announcements made showing the importance of mask-wearing. The announcements should tug at the heartstrings. They should include grandmothers, health care workers, teachers, children, clergy, minorities, EMT's, store clerks, everyone BUT politicians.  We CAN work together. Use the media. Ask us to do this for our country."
2020-11-10 11:01:01,"As the article points out, this is insufficient information to judge the utility of the vaccine. To be ""effective"" the vaccine needs to prevent the relevant medical outcome of serious COVID disease. Were there ten times more hospitalizations and deaths in the placebo group? This is the type of simple question to ask. This is why the article starts with telling us the pandemic has killed over a million people. That's what matters."
2020-11-10 11:06:52,"The spiky exterior of the virus, stripped of its inner menace, is injected into people whose immune systems can then learn to recognize and react to it, so that the real virus is rejected when encountered. 
          This approach is different from the traditional method of injecting a complete but weakened form of virus. A bit like learning to recognize and shoot down unarmed missiles, rather than practicing on small but fully armed ones."
2020-11-10 11:29:17,"This is wonderful and promising ... but,  unless the placebo and test groups were matched to each other,  these results could easily be the product of  selection bias."
2020-11-10 14:43:52,"Until the length of time the vaccine is effective is discovered, the vaccine is useless."
2020-11-09 13:59:01,"The first analysis was based on 94 volunteers.

While the data is incredibly promising and definitely good news, the entire trial recruited 144,000 volunteers. There is much data to collect and analyze."
2020-11-09 19:58:33,Thank God we had President Trump to get us this vaccine.
2020-11-09 20:20:33,Thank you to President Trump.  Never has a vaccine been developed so rapidly.  Your 70 million supporters will be forever grateful.
2020-11-09 23:05:13,"As a vaccine nears, the government needs to pay attention to the problems that brings along withthetremendousbenefits. Reading the government report on the aborted swine flu vaccine program, published as The Epidemic that Never Was by Richard Neustadt and Harvey Fineberg, may help. 

Donald Trump, for all his faults, didn't dither. He got the vaccine development on a fast track, sidelining the liability issues that threatened to derail deployment. Everything is ready to go the minute a vaccine is approved. 

By contrast, Joe Biden is a definite ditherer. He has poor judgment, and has not a single case on his 50-year resume of getting anything done. Kamala Harris is even worse. Her presidential campaign was a poorly managed disaster. 

Joe Biden is echoing the same silly trope as Robert Redfield, that a mask is better than a vaccine. Not so, Joe. Not even close."
2020-11-09 23:10:26,"Let's assume there is no difference of any sort before or after between the vaccinated and the controls.

But, if you have 20,000 controls, how many infections do you expect? 5, 10, 30? If so, how many infections is 90% better? .5, 1, or 3?

Does not compute. (Might be a great vaccine, but we need to hear more.)"
2020-11-09 23:30:01,"Yeah, right. I am normally pro vaccine and anti conspiracy theories but this reeks. Just a week after the election and just before the Holiday season they announce a vaccine. I won't take it."
2020-11-10 00:01:29,"While the news is dramatic, scrutiny of the available details of the initial results on the Pfizer vaccine raises some concerns:
a) The overall incidence of COVID in the population that completed the study to date is only 0.00125, one tenth of the average reported in the U.S. and . This despite a >40% prevalence of minority subjects, who are more susceptible than the average.  Further, the total number of cases is only 94 and no data on disease severity, much less hospitalization and death rates is available, nor is vaccine risk data available as yet. One study with so many unusual features is arguably not convincing enough to merit emergency use much less initiate mass production.  Further, the need to keep the vaccine at temperatures under -90 degrees Farenheit will be an enormous challenge for this and, presumably, other RNA based viruses, in achieving wide distribution.  I am surprised and appalled that none of the experts who have spoken publicly, including Dr. Fauci, have raised any concerns."
2020-11-10 00:12:03,"CDC's data appear to document that those at risk are largely composed of a cohort of the elderly and people with other primary health issues, including diabetes, obesity, high pneumonia sensitivity, people being treated for Aids, or involved in other-at-Risk health behavior, and people of all ages with confirmed low immunity systems may want to consider this experimental vaccine. Certainly elderly people confined to assisted living facilities may want to risk the brand-new vaccines.

However, given that the mRNA is interfering with many unknowns in our individual biology, and that many people of all ages are capable of maintaining strong immune systems to the annual flue as well as the current mutation of the Covid virus it might be prudent to approach all these vaccines with a good deal of caution.

All the pharmaceutical companies have been provided with a completely free liability environment; and their profit potential will be astronomical if the protection is short-lived and the Covid virus continues to mutate. Under this approach many people will be looking at annual vaccines for the regular flue, plus annual vaccines for the new Covid Virus. 

Caution appear to be calling for a very conservative operative approach, in this case. For sure, each of these vaccinations should be voluntary."

What are you talking about?
Which ""race""?
...aaaah you might mean the race where China and Russia are already chilling after crossing successfully the finish line with their vaccine, ok, now I understand.

Your perception of reality is just different then others.

Don't get me wrong, any vaccine is good in our situation. Just this statement was boggling my humble mind."
2020-11-10 10:27:43,Wow. It came right after the election. Who would have thought. How corrupt. That don't even care that it cost American lives.
2020-11-10 06:22:21,"Good to see the notion in the Thomas/Gelles/Zimmer article that the vaccine is being developed in a cooperation between Pfizer (NYC) and BioNTech (Mainz, Germany).
CEOs: Albert Bourla and Uğur Şahin, respectively. The  former was born in Greece, the latter in Turkey. 
A global disease (pandemia) requires global efforts. 
Or is it ""America first""?"
2020-11-10 11:10:24,"Yah right, the timing of this announcement coming just after the election was sheer coincidence. And I’ve got some swampland to sell you in Florida. There should be a law preventing the international withholding of information critical to the nation for political purposes."
2020-11-10 11:19:36,There will be other vaccines. Although I think it is cool how fast they found an effective vaccine to save the world. And the world economy. These scientists are heroes. What is so ironic. Is that Covid-19 came just in time to show how little Trump cared about the lives of the American people. Trump lost to Biden. And than right after Trump is fired by the American people. We get a vaccine. Lucky Lady liberty or some democracy god that loves Americans is watching over us.
2020-11-10 14:46:24,"Looks like  (1) Trump was right on the timing of a vaccine, (2) Fauci was wrong on the timing of the vaccine, and (3) Pfizer stands to make a lot more money with Biden in the white house since rational drug pricing is not his thing."
2020-11-10 15:16:12,Interesting timing on the release of this information. Probably more hype for the stocks and the market.
2020-11-10 15:18:05,"Remember, all the information we currently have is based on a press release from Pfizer. It was a short study with a limited number of participants, And even if it does prove to be as effective  as Pfizer claims, there are still production, distribution (the vaccine has to be kept at -30º celsius), and prioritizing who receives it. Obviously, health care and front line workers need to receive it first, followed by those at greatest risk (e.g., elderly and those with underlying health issues). With he current formulation of this vaccine, two injections will be needed for each recipient. So don't get ready to drop your masks and social distancing any time soon. We probably have at least a year before we can see any signs of a semblance of pre-Covid normalcy."
2020-11-10 15:33:52,"“Pfizer, which developed the vaccine with the German drugmaker BioNTech, ...”

No, the vaccine was developed by BioNTech. BioNTech and Pfizer cooperate to accelerate the trials and to enable the mass production of the vaccine."
2020-11-10 15:55:16,"How can the FDA possibly have had the time to study short, mid or long term effects of this vaccine?  There will be plenty of skepticism to go around when it is released and not just from the anti-vaxers."
2020-11-10 16:37:54,"""The new results also don’t tell us whether older people will get strong protection from the vaccine.""  I read this statement in the companion piece to this article.  I was dreading I would find it as I was pretty certain that most of the volunteers in this trial were not elderly.  And I would imagine that there were also very few volunteers with comorbidities.  Yet as someone who is 65 with smokers' lungs, I am keenly aware that the vast majority of those who get seriously ill or die from this virus or either one of the both of the foregoing.

So I have to ask myself, what is the real news here?"
2020-11-10 17:31:25,"I have directed phase 3 studies.

If you read the press release they say immunity is now
been demonstrated for 14 days.  That is the duration of
current information.
These initial results are released through scientists working with company's attorneys.
Likely immunity will be longer, but at this time it is 14 days."
2020-11-10 01:05:51,You would have to be absolutely mad to take this vaccine anytime before the 3-5 year point. All drugs have an average of at least 3 years of clinical trial safety data. This number was 8-10 back in the 90s and before. I will let this vaccine be deemed safe beyond a shadow of a doubt after at least 5 years before I okay the injection of this particular inoculation. Specially this one.

Maybe I’m crazy but a vaccine developed by a German company, headed by a Turkish CEO isn’t the American triumph that you all are making it out to be. Why does everything have to be a compliment to trump rather than a compliment to the global scientific community?"

I believe in this NZ start up business; and as this article ended on there will be many vaccines required to end this pandemic, here's hoping there is success for the NZ vaccine start up business, as well.
This particular vaccine will need to manufactured around the world, in the countries it is going to be used in, so that's good for all the economies of the world.

During a time when immigrants are relentlessly maligned by the Trump administration and factions in Europe, it is important to recognize their contribution."
2020-11-10 17:41:33,"There are people suspecting this as a conspiracy theory because it came after the election...and if it came before the election others would say it was rushed and couldn’t trust it. Regardless of what political party you affiliate yourself with, the decisions you make with healthcare should be based on science, not politics.  There should be nothing political about a vaccine. 

It doesn’t matter if it comes before or after the election, the world doesn’t revolve around American politics - people are dying across the world, and if a vaccine can stop that, even for a little bit, that’s all that matters."
2020-11-10 18:07:29,Needs to be stored at -94 degrees fahrenheit. Big deal? No. Dry ice starts melting at -107 degrees. Dry ice use in the medical industry has been around for decades. Dry ice is made from pressurized co2. Lots of suppiers of co2 around. Even the cannabis industry uses co2 to make refined products. This is probably good news for atmospheric gases companies like Aire Liquide...
2020-11-10 18:22:11,"I'm frustrated with the vague terminology used in this article.  You say the vaccine was more than 90 percent effective in ""preventing the disease"" and later 94 volunteers who ""developed Covid-19.""  Does this mean they actually showed symptoms or simply tested positive for Covid-19?"
2020-11-10 19:07:46,"If we assume that this vaccine is indeed safe and surprisingly effective, does this mean that we can relax our vigilance, unmask, and mingle like it's 2019?

In fact, I believe that it means the opposite: we should maintain or even increase our vigilance, not decrease it.

Why?

Because in the absence of an effective vaccine, the purpose of masking, disinfecting, and isolating is to SLOW DOWN THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE—and it will have to be continued forever, because the virus will continue to infect people, maybe including you and me.

On the other hand, if it is only a matter of months until an effective vaccine will have been administered to most people, the purpose of masking, disinfecting, and isolating becomes NEVER GETTING THE DISEASE AT ALL. That is, if we can avoid infection until a vaccine-based herd immunity has been established, then we can essentially forget about CoViD19 forever (except perhaps getting periodic booster vaccines)."
2020-11-10 19:08:02,"Everyone mentioning the Chinese test - forget about that one, as I heard on New Zealand Magic Radio Station, news, that the reason that trials were halted was because of the suicidal  side-effects of the trial covid-19 vaccine. One of the participants, in China, committed suicide.
 And this is showing people the dangers of being a guinea pig in these trials. Drugs and vaccines have negative side effects that people need to be aware of."
2020-11-10 19:41:48,"I had two questions I'm hoping someone knowledgeable might be able to address:

•1  If the mRNA vaccines work by prompting cells to produce the coronavirus spike protein, which then elicits an immune response, would it be possible to simply produce and inject the spike protein, bypassing the mRNA process?

•2  Why wouldn't dry ice, which is cheap and readily available almost everywhere, and has a surface temp of around - 90ºc, be a feasible solution to the requirement for an ultra-cold storage and transport requirement?

Thank you!"
2020-11-10 19:52:59,Desperate or sensible? You decide the USA has said it will approve a vaccine with a 50% effectiveness rate - so if this is 90% then you can get the vaccine in early 2021.
2020-11-10 19:54:31,"I guess every drugstore, apothecary and house doctor has a cryogenic fridge able to keep the vaccine at -80 degrees C at all times.

The first analysis was based on 94 volunteers who developed Covid-19. Dr. Jansen said the outside board did not say how many of those cases came from participants who had been vaccinated. But with a rate of more than 90 percent effectiveness, most had to have been in the placebo group.""  How was the 90 percent effectiveness rate established?  The author seems to say that the 90 percent mark was established first, and because of that, the infected participants must have gotten the placebo.  Some clarity please."
2020-11-10 22:13:38,"There will surely be many months before this or any other vaccine is ready for full scale production, months more to actually produce the massive amounts needed, & still more time to administer it. This was NEVER going to be done by the election or even the end of the year."
2020-11-10 23:24:29,"Some issues about the vaccine: 

1. the widespread release  of the vaccine is a unique opportunity to maximally suppress the virus.  Any resistant virus selected by the infection of vaccinated people may be more resistant to all future vaccines. 

2. the role of immune over-reaction in the damage  and death caused by the virus means that increasing the immune response may increase the threat.  Thus, vaccinated people who get Covid may have more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated, despite the protection for most people from getting the disease at all"
2020-11-10 23:49:24,"""Even before the trial began, the Trump administration placed a bet that Pfizer and BioNTech would succeed, announcing its advance purchase deal on July 22.”

""Dr. Jansen said she learned of the results from the outside panel of experts shortly after 1 p.m. on Sunday, and that the timing was not influenced by the election.""

Some of Trump’s supporters were annoyed by his response to the Covid Pandemic.  If Pfiszer and BioNTech had made their announcement just a week or so ago, many of those former supporters would have decided to vote for him after all.  He may have won the election."

The data has not been peer reviewed, nor has it been made available, meaning that so far this unbelievable 90%  effective rate cannot be verified. Meanwhile, let's see whose portfolios benefit the most from this careless announcement.  The NYT gets an F for propagating unverified data. Come on, NYT, you can do better than this"

2020-11-10 22:23:28,What motivates Big Pharma? Is it to line pocketbooks or altruism or what. I got a whiff of these behemoths at a job once and when clinical trials went south drugs are pulled right and left. It’s kind of like overpaid athletes when you have free throw shooters like Shaq never mind there are people who make peanuts who are trying to find a cure for cancer. I’m just skeptical about what motivates these pharmaceutical companies.
2020-11-10 23:54:58,"I read in another news report that this trial only tested for COVID in symptomatic participants. And it seems that about 30% of those who get COVID are initially asymptomatic. If the other news report is correct regarding this major detail, and we take 30% as the asymptomatic proportion, the presumed effectiveness of the vaccine immediately falls to about 63% (90%*.7). Does anyone out there have more details, or care to double check my math?"

Of the 43,538 in the trial half was placebo 21769. 94 contracted COVID, 8 cases in the vaccine group from washingtonpost and 86 in the placebo group. 8/94 = 8.5% (90% efficacy and 86/94 = 91.5%. 

86/21769 implies a 0.4% infection rate for the placebo group,  which is incredible.

2020-11-06 15:06:12,"Children clearly have a strong innate immune response to this particular virus, so antibody response (which occurs subsequently to the innate response) is not needed at all or as much. This also suggests that anyone with a strong innate immune response should be relatively immune to this virus. And this is in turn supported by several studies showing the huge protective effect of optimal vitamin D levels in Covid-19: up to 15 times reduction in mortality according to one study. There is by now also evidence for zinc along these lines. The two put together likely have a massive protective effect far exceeding that of a vaccine (where the FDA is willing to approve a vaccine that has 50% efficacy), and due to their exceptional safety they could be used presumptively with vulnerable populations, or at least fast-tracked for clinical research; needless to say, neither is happening.

Both vitamin D and zinc are crucial for all facets of immunity, and so these findings are not at all surprising and in fact were predicted by multiple scientists already early on in the pandemic. That these finding are not translated into public-health policy is perhaps the most pernicious aspect of the (allegedly scientific) vaccine-centric narrative. There is already a safe and effective vaccine - in fact, a multi-pathogen vaccine that also protects against other flu-related viruses - but it is not the right one.

2020-11-06 16:33:48,"PELOSI’S BACKBONE

House Democrats can’t lose their nerve. McConnell is back to his old tricks. He says a stimulus is now “Job 1,” as if his old “skinny” stimulus is the new standard for economic salvation. He is banking on Pelosi having taken enough of a hit to her power from House losses that he is in a superior position to get what he wants. Leaving aside the probability that Trump in his petulance will sign nothing, the question is whether House Democrats will lose their spine just when they have leverage. 

McConnell plays the long game. House Democrats have to play the long game too. And it’s not even that long—just two months. Yes, that hurts when the rent is due. But take less now and three months later the rent will be due again, and there will be nothing Democrats can do about it. With the Senate in the balance with two runoff races in January, Democrats can pressure McConnell to do more now lest much more be done later if the Senate is lost. If he refuses, that will become a main issue in the two runoffs, putting his status as Majority Leader at risk. If he accepts, he can table the stimulus as a threat, and, he will think, reduce Democratic momentum in the runoffs. It’s a gamble either way, for both Democrats and McConnell, because winning both Senate races is an uphill—but also a doable—climb. But it’s also a moment of maximum Democratic leverage. If they keep their spine.

I am not suggesting they all get dexamethasone, but they could safely and inexpensively be given  Vit C as a preventive -- and animals that do get infected can be given zinc supplements, which is the only FDA approved for treatment of coronavirus symptoms in humans.

The Danish government is obviously paying little care to the fate of millions of animals. No effort made to treat, cure, or quarantine the animals for as long as these pose a threat to humans moreover no longer serve the single purpose to which these have been assigned from the start.

Let's guess that mink-farmers will call out for compensation for the loss in profit.
Just to be clear, this entire industry should be eradicated, period. For this reason, I have no concern for neither the plight of mink farmers nor for the fur-coats buyers in this equation.

The real problem is that once an animal reservoir of the virus is identified, what is the proper response? Culling farmed animals may be offensive to some, but if it's not done, the effect will be a further culling by the virus of human lives.

Dated August 18, 2020, it also references transmission of the virus in Denmark from mink to farm staff, possibly including the mutated strain. This NYT article notes research published in September, but transmission was found in Denmark and other EU countries as early as June when animals were also culled because of the virus. Within only a few short months the mink-human vector yielded a malicious mutation with potentially detrimental consequence.

Now it's November and the Dutch government has locked down the Northern Jutland which is roughly a 1/4 of the country and is destroying ALL mink in the country which account for 1% of the country's ENTIRE GDP. That is huge.

In the US, as reported in this Science article, there are 245 mink farms in 22 states. Mink infections were found on farms months ago. Tellingly and typical here, the article identifies general concern of experts, pivots to economic consequences for farmers and only at the end mentions concern about mutation and human health. 

We have mink farms in 22 states. We have a risk that what happened in Denmark will happen here, but our apparent strategy is wait and see. The wait and see approach with this easily spread deadly virus has given us more than 235,000 deaths since Spring. I hope experts and health officials are on top of this but I have doubt.

2020-11-03 22:43:48,"""Regardless of the election’s outcome this week, President Trump will be the one steering the country through what is likely to be the darkest and potentially deadliest period of the coronavirus pandemic, and he has largely excluded the nation’s leading health experts from his inner circle.""  He will be the one responsible for a large percentage of the past and continuing deaths due to not following his expert advisors, Brix and Fauchi and the science they and most of the rest of the world follow.  This history will follow Trump and be his major accomplishment written about for years to come."
2020-11-03 22:55:45,We Americans need to protect ourselves. Each one of us. We can't rely on a rational response from the federal government. I expect a Biden administration will have better health policies but we will all still need to protect ourselves.
2020-11-03 22:52:07,"I would suggest that, if Trump wins, it is precisely because the electoral majority view having him in place during a COVID winter is better then having Biden in the role."
2020-11-03 22:43:09,"If Trump loses the election (God Willing), there is the possibility of the 25th amendment.  I expect some Republicans would get on board with this?"
2020-11-03 23:06:34,"When you know you manager is leaving in ten weeks, you have much more license to ignore him. Since this is not a secret, I would not worry about Trump constraining those qualified and motivated to protect the public."
2020-11-03 23:13:21,"Trump won't do anything if he loses about the Corona Virus; and he won't do anything if he wins.  He will preside over the chaos either way as thousands die every week and while a million are infected every 10 days.  It's not interesting to him.  Given that he has basically abdicated his role as president, is avoiding the long arm of the law the only reason he wants to stay in office?  We can have only one president at a time, and if the elected president has abdicated, the country will just shuffle along clumsily while acknowledging the person holding the office that could coordinate and contribute to solving problems is just a dead body getting in the way.  I pray he loses because there are problems to address beyond inflating the stock market again."
2020-11-03 23:23:50,Trump has never directed any response to the pandemic unless one thinks that calling it a hoax and encouraging people not to wear  masks is a response.
2020-11-03 23:07:26,"Unfortunately, because Trump was president in 2020 the Covid virus will do more damage through 2020 and into the early months of 2021, even if Biden becomes president on Jan 20. It will take a while for the Federal government with real leadership to turn this pandemic around. We could have done better handling this by following the experts' recommendations. But we had Trump the clown in orange face paint trying to fight a pandemic by magical thinking. (America's very own Don Quixote) And let us not forget all those state governors and other Republican fools who followed Trump's lead causing widespread resurgence by denying the necessity of following the scientific guidelines about how to limit the spread of the virus. Like Trump these Republican leaders are responsible for thousands of preventable deaths."
2020-11-03 22:52:48,When Trump loses he should be forced out before he can do any more damage.
2020-11-03 22:51:42,"Maybe, like a miracle, Trump will just disappear after the election and let the country get back on the road to health."
2020-11-03 23:10:56,"Of course the worst is yet to come. He's been on a collision course with disaster. He's had no plan in place from the onset. He's buried his head in the sand like an ostrich. Hoping it'll all just go away. It's too little,too late. Unfortunately, many more lives will be lost. Due to his lack of direction. Trump MAGA one covid-19 death at a time."
2020-11-03 22:23:29,Winters not coming sanctions are!
2020-11-03 23:01:38,I have a daughter who miscarried recently. She was very sick and there is little doubt she had covid.  I hold Trump personally responsible for the death of my grandchild. There can be no forgiveness for Trump!
2020-11-03 23:12:40,"Only a benighted, soulless sociopath like Donald Trump could be directly responsible for so much suffering and death; pretend it isn’t happening; pat himself on the back for ‘a job well done’; and continue to sleep soundly every night."
2020-11-03 23:23:16,"Unfortuantely, we taxpayers are probably paying for Dr Atlas lies and nonsense. How on earth did he get a security clearance to work in the WH and not know that RT is a Russian foreign agent? He should lose his medical license and all reputable news organizations should refuse to publish anything he says."
2020-11-03 22:34:17,Impeachment is the only hope
2020-11-03 23:38:28,"Trump is not directing anything.  He's given up--on us and the nation.  He thinks that if he keeps saying it's getting better that means it actually is getting better.  But neither nature nor Covid listen to him.

Repetition does not establish validity."
2020-11-03 23:30:13,"Short of another shutdown what can a President actually do to prevent viruses from spreading?
The 50 Governors must do as they are now doing. Keep track of infection rates, ensure that hospitals are not overwhelmed, enforce indoor mask use, etc."
2020-11-03 23:31:09,"We can only hope that a safe and effective vaccine is approved soon after the election and distributed before trump leaves office.

If not, we are in for a very dark late autumn and winter with many millions of infections, sickness and death.

trump’s legacy 100 years from now will be the President that perpetuated the Republican killing fields, abandoned science and killed Americans as a consequence."
2020-11-03 23:42:29,"If Trump wins, we are doomed. If Biden wins, we are likely doomed. Easy choice."
2020-11-03 23:42:20,"When Biden wins trump has to step aside when it comes to the virus.  It is the only decent thing to do...

Which is why he will not even consider it, of course."
2020-11-04 00:03:16,"It’s certainly not looking good for anyone. I don’t think we will see a stimulus package passed. As a result there will be little, if any, holiday shopping; resulting in even more jobs lost and businesses closing. We’re going to have people homeless at the coldest weeks of the winter. We can’t wait three months for something to be passed - most people on unemployment now will no longer qualify in a few months. This is an urgent issue that remains on the back burner while McConnell’s precious Supreme Court crony was being shoved through and thrown onto the SCOTUS. 

Trump losing is just the start. We have over a quarter million COVID dead. Trump, Pence and McEnany knew - for months- the truth and lied to us for months. They’re going to have to do better than ‘they didn’t want us to panic’. These three need to be on trial, we need to find out what they knew, why they lied and what else they did.  And if they’re found guilty, we need to demand these three see substantial prison sentences. They better not be allowed to just walk away from this."
2020-11-04 00:04:49,"To solve hospital capacity problems here in Iowa, we could have a makeshift field hospital in our pizza restaurants, where patients can be laid out on the long tables.  Since half of us here don't believe in the virus, those folks can come in and enjoy the buffet.  It's a win-win!"
2020-11-04 00:07:09,"Trump didn't care about the virus  and how many Americans were felled by it and died from it.  And, that was when he was President first term.

If he were to win a second term, he will care even less about us and the deadly Covid19 virus if that is possible.

Trump has denied mask wearing and mocks those who wear them despite the experts world-wide saying ""wear a mask"".

But now, Trump has taken to wearing black gloves on his little hands  regardless of the weather. 
How ominous he looks.

""Why""though is the question. 
Has his germ phobia gotten the better of him? 
And this would be, despite his ""miraculous"" recovery from his own positive Covid19 event thanks to us, the taxpayers who footed his 100K VIP treatment unavailable to us should we need it.

Maybe, he really thinks he is a superhero wearing his miraculous gloves; after all, he bragged as much as he foolishly removed his mask and stood atop the White House balcony saluting no one immediately after being released from the hospital. 

NO mask but black gloves???"
2020-11-04 00:40:51,"We need a president who will sent out entirely different messages.

Too many have been persuaded there is no risk. There has been no education about how the virus will continue to spread as long as people persist in giving it hosts to carry on. It should be easy to unite folks with a goal of bring the virus to the earliest end possible.

Some of us can, independent of Trump and his crazy assistants,
keep implementing and modeling appropriate behavior to limit the spread. But it will take more than a modest percentage of the total population pitching in."
2020-11-04 00:45:18,"If trump loses, and I desperately hope he does, he will likely intentionally do everything in his power to worsen the pandemic in order to destroy things prior to his departure."
2020-11-04 00:43:18,"I hope Biden wins. The alternative will be an expensive mistake. However, I suspect the Covid ship has sailed. Anti-maskers and conspiracy theorists will keep spreading the 'word of Trump', and everyone else will be hiding away from the world. We will be lucky if there will be any normalcy in mid-2021."
2020-11-04 00:44:50,"When Biden takes over, there will only have been 1 month of winter.   Just one. He said he will end the virus with a national plan.  Plenty of time before spring to do that."
2020-11-04 00:53:24,"It feels like a race to see how many of us he can kill before January. Turns out, it isn’t a blue state problem, is it?"
2020-11-04 01:08:32,"This. Just this. Nothing else matters in comparison.

Check Europe. They are talking about a possible systems collapse. They know they won’t reach their peak for possibly up to three weeks.

There is rioting in the streets in Italy and Spain. In Germany the street protests are described as more energetic. Austria just had a multi-prong terrorism attack before their clampdown. France continues to struggle with the latest Charlie Hebdo/ freedom of expression fallout.

And Europe has much better socioeconomic support at baseline and now for the pandemic. Their healthcare system covers a considerably higher percent of their population (for considerably less expense) at baseline.

T h e y  are concerned about systems collapsing. What will our winter version of the pandemic look like? 

“Systems collapsing” is a euphemistic expression for insufficient food being at the grocery store, law enforcement being so overwhelmed ..... (remember Katrina?), hospitals so overwhelmed, they just close the doors, etc.

I do not think folks are clear about the possible outcomes here.

Finally, the Trump admin hasn’t even ramped up PPE production. Nothing could be more predictable than an increased need for PPE for this fall/ winter. This is dereliction of duty.

Dr Fauci and Dr Birx are sounding the alarm for a reason. No one is hearing it."
2020-11-04 01:28:18,"A special thanks to the unnamed poll worker featured in the photo.  

This is an act of bravery in defense of democracy."

1 farms will be sold to agra-businesses due to death of family farmers. More GMOs for all!!
2. small towns gone- time to give the land back to birds and other wild life.
3. The base is dead."
2020-11-03 23:41:35,"It seems no one on earth has figured out how to stop the virus.
Look at all the outbreaks worldwide.  No one has done it. 48 states require masks and yet the numbers go up. Yet they say Trump failed.  There is a lot of fault to go around."
2020-11-03 23:43:10,"Trump trotted out Drs.Fauci and Birx every night for a month to inform us to stay indoors (we now know outdoors is safer), don’t wear masks (never saw Fauci or Birx with a mask on until weeks later), wear gloves (nobody does now). 
These ‘experts’ were given too much authority."
2020-11-04 02:01:29,It’s quite possible I will never venture outside of New York City until there is an effective vaccine and 70 percent of people have been vaccinated. It is simply too dangerous elsewhere.
2020-11-04 02:20:11,"The Federal government's national response to the virus outbreak was well reported on 3/24/2020.  Trump, Pence, Birx and Fauci all backed the national plan which included a 14 day self isolation period for people leaving NYC which was the national epicenter of the outbreak at the time.  Four days later, Andrew Mark Cuomo declared the plan ""illegal"", challenged Trump's authority to implement the plan, stated that he would not enforce the national response to the outbreak and threatened to file a lawsuit over it.

A few days after that on 4/1/2020, the New York Times reported that Fauci's security was increased due to threats of violence.

I blame the Democrats for derailing the national coronavirus response and for refusing to take the advice of the scientific community.  Cuomo blocked the national response.  DNA testing shows that more than half of the cases in the US came from NYC.  They should have been put on quarantine like the scientific community recommended."
2020-11-04 03:36:03,"This is why I've been begging the editors and staff at the NYT to start doing serious investigative work about why opening schools is NOT safe. 

The Guardian did just that and came to the conclusion I have been hammering here all fall. That the numbers that were used to declare schools safe weren't accurate. That schools have NOT been honest about their positivity rates. That no real testing is happening at the schools...families are left to do it on an honor system and self report. That this entire boondoggle has been driven by the need to provide free childcare not with the best interests of children and teachers. That it is self-evidently preposterous to talk about lockdowns in Europe and the UK while keeping schools open. 

NYT. Please start doing real investigative work into this. Because the forces attempting to force in-person learning took everything into account accept keeping children and teachers safe. 

This wave IS being driven by the return to school. I have never been wrong about that and people are dying because so many have decided to take this narrative at face value without questioning sources and data. I checked my data from local schools against my state's official dashboard and there is NO resemblance. Schools or states are not telling the truth about the real rates of infection. This is urgent news that should be shaping policy.

2020-11-04 03:41:58,"Trump has done nothing but promote anti-science, anti-mask, and anti-social distancing measures. 
Other countries would never tolerate the infection numbers, long-term consequences, and deaths from Covid. 

The thing that really gets me is that so many people forget that those numbers represent real people. I have had family members die and now someone very close to me has serious cognitive declines because of Covid. 

Trump - This is ALL on your watch. Do you even care? Or should we just trust in that magical corner we are turning? Because what I see are infection numbers reaching close to 100,000 in  a 24 hour period with no end in sight. I fear for the future."
2020-11-04 04:00:38,"You can disagree with me, but I do think that if Trump had set a consistent and logical plan, and shut his mouth and twitter finger, if we had 400,00 deaths today, as painful as that would be, it would be compared to the original ""if we did nothing"" estimates of 2 million, and he might be able to claim some sort of recognition.

Now indeed, if he had actually done something beyond making ventilators to brag about, rather than making states and cities and hospitals fight it out on eBay for critical supplies, we would have had fewer and fewer deaths.
But he just likes to brag, and not take hay real responsibility for failures."
2020-11-04 04:24:40,"It's definitely time to shorten the two and a half month transition period between the election and the inauguration. In the early days of the country when people were traveling by horse and buggy this lag time made some sense, but not now.  Other countries have transitions measured in days.  It's time we adopt a 21st century transition time."
2020-11-04 04:15:57,"What can we citizens do to safeguard our loved ones? It's clear that the GOP governors have adopted the thoroughly discredited and criminally ignorant idea of herd immunity, though they're too cowardly to admit it. 

I think it's time citizens united and started bringing class action law suits. This is about criminal negligence and negligent homicide. Trump, who may well have another four years, and his minions have stated they have no intention of taking any action and they do so knowing the consequences. That makes them guilty. 

Any lawyers out there willing to do their patriotic duty and get serious about accountability? The only language they speak is money, so sue them into oblivion. That's where they've put more than 230,000 of our fellow Americans. 

Treat this virus seriously by demanding accountability."

Probably read by a nanny surely not by his parents they couldn’t be into bedtime stories because the don never sleeps"
2020-11-04 04:28:55,With the results as they are can we now talk about making it illegal to wear a mask nationwide? The people have spoken and do not want you to decide how they live in a free country. I propose anyone wearing a mask should be arrested. Freedom over any other principle.
2020-11-04 04:38:20,"I am fearful that if Trump wins so many more people will sicken and die since he will continue his massacre of medical facts. The way it stands this moment ,with such a close race, so many Americans see no danger or minimize the danger and support Trump. They want the economy full tilt but can’t connect the dots that there can’t be a robust economy when people are getting sick and dying at alarming and escalating rates."
2020-11-04 04:47:56,"Public health officials were too deferential to Trump from the start, which was January.  They thought that their experience, authority, facts and logic would persuade him to do the right thing.   They  thought they could humor him, give in on small matters, and lose an occasional battle in order to win the war.  They thought they should avoid the sort of direct, blunt and public disavowal of Trump's balderdash that would lead to their replacement by someone less qualified than they were who would cater to Trump's worst instincts, someone like Scott Atlas.  The doctors are wonderful people, but they didn't present a common front against Trump and win the  battle on how to combat the virus.  As a result, scores of thousands of persons died needlessly."
2020-11-04 04:49:26,If our profoundly immoral Trump wins then we will have to impeach him right from the start and charge him for crimies against humanity. I can’t wait to see that happen.  Someone needs to be held accountable for killing all of those victims.  I still don’t believe he had the virus and got cured.
2020-11-04 04:46:53,The winter of our discontent and death...
2020-11-03 22:37:44,"The west coast states are organizing their own vaccine review process, not being able to trust the CDC and FDA under Trump’s politicization. 

NY and New England should join them, and stand up a shadow CDC to collect data and make recommendations."
2020-11-04 00:12:25,"The one tool we have right now is the wearing of masks. There is no vaccine, there is no treatment. So to all of you who excuse Trump, just remember he has done everything in his power to discourage and forbid the use of masks. The one tool!
Trump is always screaming about virus restrictions killing the economy. Let me just say that it isn’t any government regulation (or lack of one) that’s keeping me out of restaurants and off airplanes."
2020-11-04 00:49:27,"600,000 reported new cases in the last week.  Today, the highest reported death total in one day since May.  And there are still plenty of places in the country where people can meet, eat, and exercise outside.  Wait until Thanksgiving and the holidays.  All of the cases that are piling up will overload hospitals, burn out medical people, and exhaust supplies.  Many deaths this winter.  It's terrible.  I'm 65.   I told my wife I'm going back to Phase 2 -- more deliveries of food and household items, less contact with outdoor groups, even at a distance.  And masks.  I wear 2 masks when I have to spend more than a minute or 2 in a store or doctor's office.  We need to take charge of own health."
2020-11-04 05:20:26,"Judging by the way that election results are coming in so far, COVID was hardly a factor against Mr. Trump.  So mask wars will continue and cases will continue to rise.  The numbers that we saw last spring / summer will pale compared to what we’ll see in December."
2020-11-04 00:19:57,You better hope your governor has it together this winter because hoping the Trump's government is going to save you is a waste of hope.
2020-11-04 05:27:05,"America is dead - you are all now living an a third world country with corruption and incompetence rife across your Government. By 2024, America will be an economic basket case with millions dead from the virus.

2020-11-04 05:49:46,"If DT wins, many more innocent lives will continue to perish. For a president who have shown callous disregard to public health recommendations, this is not unexpected. But to those who lose their lives, this is absolutely tragic. There is a mortal outcome to this result and if only it could be felt so much more real and familiar, the results wouldn't be as close as it is now."
2020-11-04 06:33:03,Fay I should never have tried to appease the man with the sprayon tan. Trump can’t fire him. Fauci should ignore the president find another platform and keep dispensing good medical advice at top volume.

2020-11-04 09:01:08,"Just looking at the election results, I no longer believe the US represents me or my values. Trump has showed us who he is in these 4 years and the coronavirus. The fact people disregarded the coronavirus in their voting is beyond me. It’s time to go if he wins, because I can’t see the pandemic response getting any better. Just look how he reacted to the pandemic in an election year! I live in Nj so I live in a democratic bubble. I truly believe if America was more diverse and educated in more of the population we would not be going through this. Basic understanding economics, business, etc, heck even having a better moral compass in the nation could have provided better results for this election."
2020-11-04 08:31:24,"If this man wins, now looking entirely possible and even likely, our death rates go through the roof.

I could weep for this country and its inability to do basic triage."
2020-11-04 07:28:31,"At best a vaccine won’t arrive until the end of the year. That will mean another 1M infections or more and likely 20;000 dead. The 10M people who will by then have had the virus could very likely lose health insurance when the ACA is overturned. Even when a vaccine is produced, many won’t get it and many will refuse to take it% I would not be surprised if we end up with 1M dead directly and 40M without health insurance due to preexisting conditions, yeah MAGA"
2020-11-04 07:08:14,If he wins again more people will leave this country. The wealthiest already have plans in place. The best and the brightest should go. But go where? Which country would be willing to take in a mass exodus from the USA?
2020-11-04 11:53:12,Yes and what will happen? More lies? Take away ACA? Turning the corner? Shame on you America-you continue to allow him to have control. I am sickened and not just from the virus.
2020-11-04 12:43:40,Millions more ballots have to be counted and Trump falsely claims he has won.  He has ignored this virus and more people died than was necessary.  He could have taken charge but he preferred tweeting insults about Joe Biden and the Democrats.  He is an overgrown child with no sense of what is happening around him. People listen to him. And that makes him dangerous. I only hope he loses this election. But he will call for unrest if he loses. It will be a scary time for all.
2020-11-04 12:30:58,The United States has shown itself just too incompetent to be credible any more.

2020-11-04 12:39:25,"So many countries have done well curbing the Covid pandemic in 2020. Only America, under our grossly unfit president, has caused the US to have the highest infection rates and we’re looking at winter of 2021 with fear and anxiety. Who won our presidential election yesterday? We’re all waiting for the news as our country’s votes are being tallied, and President Trump is already screaming “Fraud”!"
2020-11-04 14:28:52,Which virus expert can justifiable be assigned credit for the shameful state of the Coronavirus 2 pandemic? All the governors and politicians mandating a mask are a joke. From the very beginning masks should have been required in all indoor public places and outdoors where similar safe distancing is not possible. More importantly the orders should be to wear proper masks properly and not sagging masks under the nose. That would have saved lives not just wearing a mask just because it is required.
2020-11-04 14:46:53,Departments of Public Health throughout the country have competent public health professionals on their staffs.

2020-11-04 13:12:48,Dr Scott Atlas is a quack. He’s not an epidemiologist. He’s not an expert in infectious disease. He’s just telling the President what he wants to hear. God help us all.
2020-11-04 14:25:41,They need to park the refrigerated morgue trucks all around the perimeter of the White House for this administration as to what is really around every corner if we don't follow science and medicine and put strategic public health policies in place.
2020-11-04 14:02:43,"The question that has to be asked here is which do they fear the most, the virus or Trump?"
2020-11-04 14:19:04,"Now that the race is over, one way or another, Trump can  just totally ignore the virus.

Which might ne better than what he was actually doing."
2020-11-04 13:18:23,"It's terrifying that so many people are voting for Trump, who has completely bungled the response to COVID and then claimed that the unchecked spread of the virus was no big deal because there is a vaccine 'coming in a few weeks.'

Nobody is coming to save us but ourselves.  I keep listening to Dr. Fauci, although he may soon be fired like a dog by Donald Trump.

COVID alone was an enormous reason to defeat Donald Trump.

We have a president who considers a pandemic and public health emergency a joke.

I can't get my head around this."
2020-11-04 14:18:39,"Americans have spoken with so many votes for Trump and the GOP, endorsing death as a good idea. A sad day. A telling day. The rest of the world looks on in horror. I am Canadian and shouldn't really care this much. But I do."
2020-11-04 14:54:08,"Can not Americans be smart enough to know to wear a mask without the President telling them to do so? People who do not wear them are most likely to eat too much, not exercise or take care of their bodies. When does common sense come in."
2020-11-04 15:27:58,"Regardless of election results, his attention will be focused on HIS priorities:

2020-11-04 15:50:09,In the winter time there is our body heat loss into the environment faster than the other season. Saving our body energy will be the benefit to overcome the disease. Taking a meditation attitude to create a serenity in mind will give a chance to have healthiness.
2020-11-04 15:53:09,"Wearing a mask is annoying.  During the summer it was uncomfortable.  Keeping a physical distance of 6 feet between oneself and others who are not family is annoying too.  But it sure beats being intubated and on a ventilator or dead.  

Donald Trump is not a scientist.  He is not a doctor.  He is president and as president he is supposed to be working on behalf of all the citizens in the United States instead of lying about doctors, pushing useless remedies, and telling us that relief is just around the corner.  However, in the end, we make the decisions whether or not to wear a mask or keep our distance or avoid crowds.  

Wear a mask, keep your distance, avoid crowds, wash your hands, and remember that being intubated or dead is not a pretty alternative."
2020-11-04 15:48:59,"Trump and Atlas's medical policy is the ""YOLO Plan"".

YOLO = ""You're On Your Own"".
And, now, with his New and Improved Supreme Court, you get to lose all of the Affordable Care Act, too.

... but you knew that......"
2020-11-04 15:51:05,Well all those folks who believe in Trump and live in states who went for Trump in 2020 can now reap their reward this winter
2020-11-04 16:00:34,"Covid's biggest ally is yours truly, Donald J. Trump, embarked in a criminal enterprise so lethal that not even the economy can escape it. As to why Trump's demagoguery and outstanding lies were able to convince his clueless followers that Biden is the problem goes beyond belief...and all sanity. Don't we realize that, by re-electing such a cruel despot, it shall impinge on the very freedom we take for granted? As Winter is upon us soon enough, the coronavirus pandemia has no way to go but accelerate the thousands of deaths already under Trump's belt. Is this what we want or need? Absolutely not...unless we become suicidal!"
2020-11-04 16:04:13,"A celebration of ignorance and stupidity.  This is the real life, ""The Emperor Has New Clothes"".  The country is doomed by science and public health deniers with no education or training.    We have more than white grievance to deal with, but ignorance grieveance too."
2020-11-04 16:06:47,"Sure, we have a culture of personal responsibility and choice under a fragmented public health system that disadvantages us when speed is of essence. Nobody’s been allowed an easy time with SARS coronavirus 2. Nobody can claim that lapses follow party lines; rather, they’ve come down to local circumstances not foreseen by experts in an experience I hope they learn from. The latter had, after all, neglected the role of international border quarantine and mask use early on, and we note how Socialist Emmanuel Macron currently presides over a spike in France worse than America’s.

But Donald Trump has done little but make our job harder than it has to be. The nonstop torrent of denial and misinformation. His unction to act against disease control advice for schools and meatpacking plants or the supposed liberation of Michigan. Bullies harass the doctors at our CDC while we gasp at the slap-happy super-spreader events he insists on holding, often against local law and one of them in the Rose Garden no less. This has done us incalculable harm. Any other president would have given us an encouraging but sober message at least. With Trump, it’s chaos, backbiting and ugly Tweets all the way.

Whatever China’s fault in letting it out of the bottle, we must stop it on our own shores. Trump has no plans to do so."
2020-11-04 16:25:47,Where is the board of medical examiners whose job is to monitor physicians licensed in their state? I would think that operating outside one's area of expertise or making recommendations that other experts consider a danger to public health would trigger an investigation.
2020-11-04 16:22:04,It is getting harder every day to care about them if Trump supporters reject science and risk their lives by gathering in groups and not wearing masks.  Darwinism in action.
2020-11-04 16:23:18,"If Trump, wins his inauguration will be the superspreader event to end all superspreader events."
2020-11-04 16:40:36,"Isn't an increase in cases and a wider spread of coronavirus exactly what almost half of this nation voted for yesterday?  We are clearly a pro-pandemic country.  We love the sickness and death it brings.  Maybe instead of running human beings for office, the Democrats should just run viruses.  They would finally get all those votes they so desperately crave in the red states."
2020-11-04 16:48:00,"As a Canadian who has worked and gone to University In the United States I want to express my deep condolences for a former wonderful country who use to be a wonderful alliance to fellow democratic free countries. My faith in humanity has been shaken again, how does such a con man and party successfully stop people from voting with a slogan of voter fraud, or a slogan like “make America great” after 4 years in power and gop been in power for 6 years, I guess being honest, caring for your fellow man and believing in conspiracies is the new America. I fear that NATO will be over and fascism will thrive for years to come. My condolences for those who voted for Biden and those who voted for trump you get what you deserve.Looks like the world will view the USA the same way we all look at Russia."
2020-11-04 17:02:08,"it is entirely possible that should Trump lose, through vindictiveness, he could fire all the infectious disease experts and watch the country burn of COVID19"
2020-11-04 17:06:32,Is Trump just a Russian Puppet and Atlas a publicity seeking opportunist?- it’s about time we place the two of them in a body of water and drain the swamp( flush it)
2020-11-04 18:06:26,"Leadership counts a lot, particularly when addressing a call to sacrifice and change from normalcy. Some governors made the call to require quarantines, shutdowns and mask requirements, although they all had to determine those with no guidance from Washington. At the same time Trump made serious attention to the pandemic a partisan issue, so GOP governors followed his lead to do little, if anything, putting revenue over lives.

Trump pretended (when he knew better) that Covid is a nothing burger, and his idiot followers went along, despite the death and illness, which Trump also described as made-up and falsified. After spending his term accusing experts and health professionals of being liars and frauds, over 40% of the country parrot the same bilge.

Trump and his GOP enablers are guilty of manslaughter by indifference and malpractice, but they'll never serve a day in prison."
2020-11-04 17:03:41,"Now that it appears Biden is going to win this election, I just can't wait to see Trump's scorched earth policy in regards to the virus!"
2020-11-04 17:25:01,"The writer is correct, Dr's Birx, Redfield, Fauchi all were intimidated by McDonald Trump and did not put the welfare of the people over McDonald's re-election campaign.
The time to show courage has passed - Trump has managed to kill off tens of thousands of our fellow citizens as his sacrifice to Wall Street and his re-election bid."
2020-11-04 18:20:50,"I just read several British newspapers. England is about to enter into a severe one month lockdown so their hospitals don't become overwhelmed. Lots of people commented in the papers how furious they are with Boris Johnson for locking them down until December 3 because they want to go Christmas shopping.

I envy the British they have a leader who is trying to control the spread of COVID.

Johnson said if he didn't do the lockdown, soon England would have a thousand deaths a day.  

We've had over a thousand deaths a day for how many months now?"
2020-11-04 18:49:51,"Out of a misguided sense of fairness, journalists did not write about Trump's mental health during the 2016 campaign.  There was a lot publicly known about Trump that indicated he was narcissistic, irresponsible and unstable.  I remember Trump waged a tabloid war against first wife Ivana when he divorced her in 1992.  He smeared her in the most vulgar way imaginable in the NYC newspapers for weeks.  Crazy headlines.  Trump didn't care his 3 young children, preteens who lived with her, were subjected to those stories whenever they left the house.  Who acts like that?

After the 2016 election, I met a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, a very brilliant man, at a Washington event. He asked what I thought of Trump.  I said ""Trump's insane.""  He looked shocked and said ""You think so? Really?""  I said ""Just wait.""

The media went easy on Trump in 2016 compared to their constant criticism of Hillary Clinton.  Hillary said, in the most polite way imaginable, ""Donald Trump is not temperamentally fit to be President of the United States.""
I wonder what people think she meant by that. That he isn't punctual or has bad table manners?  It's like this country did not have the conversation it needed to about what kind of person Donald Trump is.

His niece, a therapist, published a book in which she paints a portrait of a very disturbed man.

Yet we still have not caught up to why Trump carries on like COVID isn't killing people, even after contracting it himself.

Now why would that be?"
2020-11-04 18:55:01,"The NY Times, an international newspaper, needs to set
such claims in context

If it were the “quality” of the government that decided the
success in the Corona fight, Xi’s China would come in first

Restricting it to Western Democracies,  France , with a highly competent government under Macron, a highly competent bureaucracy and outstanding health care system would be much better off than the US

That is;

-IF the quality of the National government mattered

But it does NOT.  Yesterday, France with less than 1/4 of the US population, reported  845     daily deaths,  the US  1134 . That it, with a quarter of the US population it reported as nearly as many death.  That is, following the NY Times logic, Macron's Government is four times worse
than Trump's

This is absurd.  

These numbers, as well as a comparison of France (National Plan) with Germany (No National plan, the States are solely in charge but does much better than either the US or France) show that other factors  are decisive."
2020-11-04 18:43:50,"I'm quitting my job as a clinical doctor and taking a job in venture capital.

Why would I risk myself to help these people who don't care if they get sick and die? I hear the message loud and clear, and I'm out. It's very liberating that I now only have yo take care of myself."
2020-11-04 18:31:21,This is a nightmare. And what we don’t hear much about is how the SARS Co-V-2 virus is also running its course AND muting into antibiotic strains in other animals. Denmark is currently in the process of destroying their minks in an effort to contain just such a mutation... We are in more trouble than people realize.
2020-11-04 18:36:48,"I live in a blue state that has a republican governor. Early on, mistakes were made, notably and tragically at a home for veterans and at nursing homes. As more became known about COVID, our governor took action to slow the spread, easing restrictions as cases decreased. We are seeing an increase at this time and he’s taking what, in my view, is appropriate action. Some people are angry and some are calling for his impeachment. It’s a shame that some people value their freedom more than their or others’  health. Just wear a mask and quit complaining about it."
2020-11-04 19:59:28,"So Trump is refusing to acknowledge the pandemic, he's hostile toward country's top virus experts, and he's sending the leader of his virus task force to discuss America's problems with Russian state TV, and I'm supposed to believe Trump isn't a Putin stooge?  What more could Trump do to announce he's serving Russia's interests, and is actively, purposefully allowing Americans to die?"
2020-11-04 13:45:03,"The endless string of hand-wringing goes on. The chorus of ""do something for me"" rings out when the answer is personal responsibility.  You, not me, not somebody else, is responsible for their own health outcomes.  If you don't want to risk infection, sharply curtail your public interactions,  If you have a high-risk person in your home, take precautions.  My favorite, ""restaurants should close because servers can be infected by guests, bringing virus home to at-risk family"". Some states want to limit people's ability to dine out, keep the economy going, and live normally.  How about - the server who has an issue remove themselves from harm's way?  Will the restaurant world have  smaller clientele of younger, healthier, lower risk people?  Yes - so what?  There was outrage went Trump went back to to the White House after leaving Walter Reed Hospital - ""oh the risk to the White House food service staff, janitors, and their at-risk family members?"" - how about taking a leave or vacation if you are concerned?  There is screaming about the levels of cases in Florida - so what?  It's gone on for months- state hasn't fallen into a Mad Max-like apocalypse. ATMs are giving out money, police officers respond to calls, Disney has even figured out how to adapt and open.  A recent statistic shows best estimate being COVID19 is 10x more fatal than seasonal flu.  Adapt.  I have done nothing in the past related to flu.  This year, I will do 10x more and get a shot.  Minimum - wear a mask!"
2020-11-05 16:54:57,"It was a lab test.  Doesn't look like any real concert that I ever saw.  Again: half measures don't work, NEVER have.  Either drop precautions and lockdowns all together  for once totally lockdown for a decent period.  Maybe there should just be a national referendum since nobody's listening to either scientists or politicians."
2020-11-05 18:58:27,"Hello ! One of the big reasons people go to concerts, in addition to the obvious delight of enjoying live music, is to socialize. In the lobby before and after the concert but especially during intermission, in ticket and entrance lines, even in the bathrooms. After so many months of being isolated, the urge to socialize in a concert venue would be almost irresistible. And if everyone did successfully resist it, then the experience would be more like attending a funeral service than a concert."
2020-11-05 19:15:31,"What about outdoor venues like the Hollywood Bowl? Extra social distance between groups of concert goers could be created by only selling half or 2/3 of the tickets. The season could also be extended because the weather in LA is rarely rainy. The process of loading people in and the bathroom line for women would be the most challenging to safely orchestrate, but it could be done."
2020-11-05 20:35:14,"Why aren’t more concert venues streaming events in 4K and in Dolby Atmos?

These venues could market that a purchase of “x” amount of events would provide a discount for future in person concerts or a discount on other streaming events.

For an industry that is supposed to be creative, they have not managed their intuitive ability to meet the challenges of the pandemic.

Early on in March I subscribed to Tidal, but the service wasn’t worth the money 💰 for high quality audio or talent.

Perhaps things may change in the future, but for survival, necessity used to be the mother of invention..

What happened?

Studying air flow tests in arenas has value, but these types of tests hold more importance for office buildings and other types of buildings where people need to interact out of necessity rather than for entertainment..."

2020-11-05 23:19:01,"These insights are maybe not a game-changer for concerts, but may help schools, production halls, everywhere, where large group have to be close to each other. 
Butcheries already have to use air filter systems. Trains and public transportations will also have better ventilation. We have to acknowledge, that our society is vulnerable to airborne viruses. Some of them are just a nuisance, like the flu. But we still may want to mitigate them. 
This pandemic caught us with our pants down, we must know how we can be better prepared. Even for the time until we get a vaccine we need science to make our life less affected. It would be stupid just to act, like a virus would magically go away or could be ignored."

2020-11-03 11:39:15,"Perhaps there should be an article for the rationale of a 25% indoor dining capacity in Little Neck, and a 50% indoor dining capacity in Great Neck. 

Factors beyond government edicts are killing the restaurants in Grand Central Station. But the irrational polices of the governor are killing restaurants for no other reason than for killing the restaurants.

Looks like we will have one more week of nice weather for outdoor dining. After that, it's lights out until the end of April. And permanent lights out for thousands of NYC restaurants."
2020-11-03 11:51:09,This important foundation to both city and state economic foundations are being destroyed by mayors and governors who have locked down their cities and states without careful thought to the collateral damages from their decisions. The lockdowns have proven to be not effective either here or in Europe. Second lockdowns will fail just as did the first and third lockdowns will fail as well. Coronavirus is not Ebola. The death rate minuscule in comparison. Ebola hits all people more or less evenly while the virus is a serious threat primarily to the elderly and otherwise ill. We have destroyed our economy without an evaluation to the collateral damage it has caused. The future will indict our political class for how this tragedy was dwelt with.
2020-11-03 11:53:38,"Many restaurants will “go,” to be replaced by at least as many, post-vaccine. Restaurants are as fundamental to the human experience as bars, pubs, performance, sport. None of that is going away for good."
2020-11-03 11:54:29,"I am so desperately sorry for the restaurant business—owners, chefs, waiters, everyone. I’m one of the people who will not sit indoors at a restaurant under pretty much any circumstances, although I’ve done as much takeout as possible despite a much reduced income. But oh I can’t wait to eat out again! We thoroughly enjoy it, and even on long road trips seek out individual and interesting downtown restaurants rather than soulless fast food chains.

If the pandemic does result in more people working from home long term, then I guess the location and hours of restaurants could change. But I don’t think people will ever lose the love of eating out. We’ll be back, and so will you."
2020-11-03 12:03:58,People may have to learn how to cook. Dust off the instant pot and use the stove. Life skills are important.
2020-11-03 12:08:59,"The restaurants are not the primary reason that draws people to urban centers - the well-paying professional jobs do, and the restaurants and bars pop up to meet that demand, not visa versa. They need to be able to pay that tab first! With the changing landscape of work with increases remote working, the pandemic pushing families out to the suburbs, etc - things will look different and restauranteurs will need to adjust. 

The good news is people may shift their geographic location and work habits, but people love good food and so wherever these people end up, the demand for great food will exist. The most resourceful of enterpreneurs will recognize that seize those opportunities."
2020-11-03 12:15:15,"Your column requires new and interesting questions. I ask myself when did I first eat in a restaurant? What did I have? In the early 40s we did not have a pandemic; we had a war. Since I was just a child I did not know of restaurants. My grandparents raised me, and they were barely able to keep a roof over our heads. I really do not remember but I think it was a hamburger in a ridiculously cheap restaurant. I have since eaten in some very fancy and expensive restaurants, the hamburger stands out and was every bit as good as the expensive restaurants."

2020-11-03 12:18:38,"It's no exaggeration to say that many CEO's keep their HQ's in New York out of pure vanity. Even with many back-office jobs moved to smaller cities and suburbs, the urge to see and be seen by others in their enchanted realm is irresistable. It's not like most of these people were flocking to museums, theaters, or galleries, but one thing they were doing is stuffing their faces with ever more extravagant concoctions, which is the only form of ""culture"" most of these vapid wealthy know. The breathless reviews in this paper verified that every week, to the point that mixologists merited the same degree of awe as a Michelangelo. With restaurants gone, expect many companies to suddenly rediscover the bottom line and conclude that keeping their HQ's in New York is no longer viable."
2020-11-03 12:28:11,"This may be a good thing: redistribution of urban population may bring talent and young people to the dying towns and counties in many parts of the country.  Revitalizing communities, moving assets around, reducing the stress of large urban centers to the environment, to people’s health. I am feeling positive about the reverse of the trend, move to a small town a far away county and build a community. Big cities will adjust, Will survive, maybe just not as big."
2020-11-03 12:31:11,"You’re describing pretty much every urban area on the planet, rich or poor.  In fact, if you adjust for high rises, US cities are less densely populated than most of the world’s major cities, and commercial districts are all the same:  tightly packed, diverse, with lots of restaurants.  In the US, cheap energy costs, transportation policy and historic racism (especially desegregation orders) have promoted sprawl in ways that are uniquely American.  Add remote work and increasing urban unrest, and right now, it doesn’t look good for US cities.  But cities are dynamic, living things that have survived pretty much every plague, war, natural and man-made disaster thrown at them for hundreds, even thousands of years.  We gravitate toward each other and cities serve that natural inclination best. Even with all that we do in this country to harm our cities - at a national level, seemingly deliberate - they keep coming back.  And they will again."
2020-11-03 12:40:39,"It is horribly sad to see favorite and iconic restaurants not make it.

2020-11-03 12:41:14,"Has anyone looked at cause and effect here?  Food was not as widely elevated in the culture in the 90s (where did George and Jerry eat in Seinfeld? Okay, maybe George wasn't a 'young creative'), and I don't know any young people who moved to NYC for the food in that era.  Maybe food has an influence on that third wave of a city's 'resurgence' (and gentrification), but seems like those people are working at Google/Facebook/AirBnB, not starting them."
2020-11-03 12:42:43,"What will happen?

Those businesses will go bust. 

Other businesses will be created. 

You like capitalism? 

Well, this is how it's supposed to work."
2020-11-03 12:48:35,"Sorry but the recent boom of the suburbs is not because urban restaurants are closed, it’s because people can work remotely now and have way more space for less money. Restaurants are an icing on the urban cake but let’s not overestimate their significance. People mostly cooked at home for much of the 19th and 20th centuries and cities were vibrant then too."
2020-11-03 12:50:39,"The problem is very serious.

Cities could become more affordable and more attractive places to live for everyone - not just the wealthy. Also, restaurants will come back. It will take time, and they may look different, but they'll be back."
2020-11-03 13:02:18,"As the article and many comments indicate, there are many negative ramifications related to the closing of thousands of restaurants.
However, none of the discussion about the benefits that restaurants provide mentions the quality of the actual jobs in a restaurant, including servers and kitchen staff. In general, these are not well paying jobs, and, often, the employee is reliant on tips, just to earn enough money to get by. As the restaurant industry comes to grips with their new reality, efforts should be made to improve the pay of the people who work there, and not just recreate what existed before the pandemic. This might mean higher prices and/or fewer restaurants in total but the individuals who actually are employed will be better off than before."
2020-11-03 13:07:07,"I do hope that some independent local restaurants survive and not just the nasty corporate chains. The ones that do survive will need to be able to get by on a reasonably-priced take out business over the winter months, and then have an outdoor seating area open in the warmer months with full service bar service. Rents will need to be re-negotiated and states may have to change the cost of liquor and beer/wine licensing and insurance rates to enable these businesses to lower their overhead expenditures when just doing take-out over the winter. People will not spend $30 for take-out, and they will not be able to employ a big staff through the lean months. Smaller will be better in future. Maybe time to return to the family or mom and pop type establishments of a bygone era."
2020-11-03 13:07:52,Live in a histrionic building in what was considered the theater district of the city. The local restaurants have been our lifeline before the pandemic and even now as they have limited seating. We are truly supporting each other.

By the way, it’s a great dining city. Don’t miss Botanical Heights, as an example, with Union Loafers, Olio, Elaia, and more."
2020-11-03 13:32:32,"With all due respect, I think you have cause and effect backwards. Young high-income workers don’t come to cities for the restaurants; they come for the jobs and the restaurants follow them. If those jobs become remote, then some of those high income workers will move to less densely populated areas. Some of the restaurants will follow them, and, just maybe, housing will become more affordable in urban centers.

Sorry, but some well-educated liberals with good jobs have a massive blind spot for the stunning income inequality in urban centers. The workers in those restaurants are barely getting by and likely can’t afford to live anywhere close to the nice restaurants frequented by these young professionals."

I look forward to more on that because, frankly, with our education system gone, we need all of the ""idea spots"" we can get."

2020-11-03 13:35:08,"I guess people move to Wisconsin and open new restaurants where there aren’t annoying liberals who sue people, close businesses, and give kids to the state to raise. Grab a pickup and hit the road! Gaga is going to be sorry she made fun of Republicans who drink beer! I’m buying a new pickup today. And quite honestly, beer is better than wine. Seriously. Less sweet and you can have it every day after work. Democrats don’t really work. 

Remember democrats, if you haven’t figured out in 49 years that feminism is child neglect, you’re probably not the rocket scientists you pretend to be. 

Restaurant go bankrupt if annoying liberals force them to close.

What is your point? To turn everything into the Soviet Union? How do you not learn? 

Kids need mothers, not feminists. Remember, dogs are sad if owners are away for ten hours a day. Kids are the same. Feminism is child neglect."
2020-11-03 13:43:39,"The answer is that cities are being recognized for what they are, places where people go to for their careers or job/jobs. For many of us who live in these concrete and horribly managed jungles, the ability to move to clean air, live around polite people, avoid angry and often violent protests, have good schools all with lower costs is the blessing of the pandemic. The great restaurants will follow for the same reasons. Then our former cities are going to hv to figure out how to create safe, clean urban environments to get us to even visit."
2020-11-03 13:48:28,"I live in Boston, and yes, like most cities, restaurants, bars and coffee shops are an important part of the fabric, but I do not believe they are the anchor of this city, anyway.  What drives Boston is a knowledge based economy driven by the 185 colleges and universities in and around the city.

So, unless we are going to permanently close Harvard, Tufts, MIT, BU, BC, Northeastern, Emerson, etc., etc., or dig them out of the ground and move them to the exurbs, or abandon the knowledge based economy, I don't think Boston is going anywhere even if half of the hospitality establishments close.  Boston's restaurant industry is driven by its other core industries not the other way around, and I suspect this is true in most other cities.

That said, the loss of public gathering and now private gathering will be highly deleterious to our economy as well as our individual quality of life."
2020-11-03 13:49:07,"Restaurants are a PART of the urban scene that all people enjoy, but a very small part.  Young, well educated people do not have the immediate resource to frequent restaurants regularly, to be part of 'cafe society' (so to speak).  As a former Manhattanite, if I had to choose between opera at the Met, a concert/play, or a meal out, I'd take the obvious: entertainment.
In a time when NYT and other broadsheets talk about young, well educated persons living three, four, or more to an apartment just to be able to live in NYC I doubt that these young professionals-to-be are going to eat out nightly...or even weekly."

Restaurants can attract people to the neighborhod, but they are never ever the draw.  Do you know anyone who moved to an area solely becuse it had restaurants they liked?  It is usually bars, art galleries and then restaurants that will interest people in that area.  But people usually are first because the rent is cheap.  Sadly this is how capitalism works.  You take a risk in opening a business, everyone who has ever opened a business understands this risk.  This is what some economists will call an ""adjustment"".  Many businesses have been adjusted right out of business.  The restraurant industry is not different.  What IS different about the food service industry is that the profit margins are really low, the expenses are really high, they depend upon a massive flow of cash daily, they employee some highly skilled people to people who will make minimum wage if that.  It is a very tough business, hard work and long hours.  But covid is re-setting many different types of business right now in addition to the food service industry."
2020-11-03 14:09:30,"This week in downtown NYC the weather turned cold and raw.  Immediately, the small spark of life that resulted from outdoor dining died.  Restaurants were empty and the streets were deserted. It struck me that the city is dead until the Spring. Not sure what restaurant survives these next 6 months. 

But it also struck me that when and if we are able to get this under control with a vaccine, the demand for social spaces and the pent up craving for all we have missed will be a boom to the industry."

Apparently, that flawed mindset, or the desire to appeal to it, lives on. The Lawrenceville neighborhood, where I have spent a lot of time, is thriving compared to the old days. Is it the robotics centers, or the brew pub, or the night club with the suspicious fire a few years ago? Who can tell? Well, the robotics centers bring a lot of wealthy young people who spend money at places like restaurants. There are lots of other concentrations of restaurants in and around Pittsburgh, but there just are not that many robotics centers. Restaurants also have low start up costs and fail regularly, while robotics centers are long-term investments in a growing industry that will continue to grow.

The dine in restaurant industry is way over capacity. While people do go to these places for dates or other social gatherings, they can go somewhere else and have almost as much fun. The marginal value of the experience is pretty marginal. The environmental impact,mostly in wasted food, is out of proportion to customers' enjoyment. The ownership of many of these places has a world view aligned with the restauranteur-in-chief. 

Restaurants are due for a massive right-sizing, and we will manage to socialize just fine afterwards. Pretending restaurants are essential would lead to terrible policy."

2020-11-03 15:05:55,"It is nothing short of terrible that restaurants, bars, and coffee shops are taking big hits during COVID. It takes an incredible amount of money, experience, and talent to run and staff a restaurant, and it is an industry that requires workers and customers be there in person. This is why it is unique, and deserves financial help during the pandemic.

That said, every urban market is different, and I don’t agree with the opinion that restaurants are what draw people to cities. Jobs, culture, art, entertainment, intellectual capital, public transportation and human diversity are typically equal in their draw for people to chose to move to cities. It is what made me move to NYC 20 years ago. And, in NYC, the change in culture in the last 8 years has slowly but surely choked retail and hospitality viability before COVID hit. Over-inflated commercial rents, the focus on the tourist trade, and targeting luxury-culture means drinks cost $14 and meals $30-50 per person, and higher. COVID is only exacerbating what was slowly rotting the fabric of NYC. I only hope a correction will occur that allows actual talented & creative people to run businesses and everyone to live more affordable lives here again."
2020-11-03 15:05:12,"The immediate hardships restaurants and other businesses are facing are saddening. The chefs and their staff may not be the cultural glue of cities as the writer suggests, but they certainly are a part of that glue like the sanitation workers, transportation workers, teachers, white collar folk, etc. We don’t have to treat this as an either/or. After all, it’s not just the affluent fleeing cities because they can afford to. There are the formerly affluent people who have taken pay cuts or have simply lost jobs, which has a trickle down effect on other incomes down the socioeconomic totem poll. 

Someone or some people across the country are going to figure out something that breathes new life into pandemic (post-pandemic restaurant) culture because necessity is the mother of invention. Following the affluent flight to the suburbs is probably not the answer if the rules/attitudes toward dining in urban restaurants are applied to suburban ones as well. 

Also, maybe the diffusion of urban liberals to suburban and rural areas will throw a wrench into the plans of future presidential campaigns that seek to game the Electoral College for a victory instead of actually appealing to a broad range of Americans as was originally intended. Sorry. It’s Election Day. I had to go there. 

P.S. I still support my favorite restaurants here because I can afford to and doing dishes several times a day sucks."
2020-11-03 15:13:08,"I do not mean to gloss over the pain and suffering to all these restaurant owners and staff, but this is a temporary issue. The restaurant space and equipment is not going away. The culinary and service expertise is not going away. The customers, for the moment are gone. However, we will be back as soon as it is safe. The government should be doing more for the restaurant staff in the meantime, and it is shameful that it has not. 

The reason businesses have the legal protection of bankruptcy is so that owners in situations like this can wipe the business debts and return with a clean slate when the economy rebounds. When it does, all the makings of a good restaurant will still be around, this time with customers."

2020-11-03 15:17:24,"One thing that was merely glanced over was the effect on labour.  With much of the food service labour force skewing towards the 18-30 cohort, all the restaurants closing will create a massive surge in unemployment in this age group.

With that comes a whole host of other societal problems, increasing debt, lack of access to higher education, unable to afford healthcare, etc.  

Although much of this cohort tends to vote more liberal, the pain that this economic hardship may influence a whole generation of voters to strengthen their resolve and never even think about voting a right-wing politician ever again."

2020-11-03 15:29:42,"Maybe the restaurant culture has been overrated and overpopulated. I grew up in a time when eating out was a special occasion, not going somewhere for a breakfast sandwich, or eating in a diner instead of taking that brown bag lunch. There is something amiss in a culture that consumes over half its nourishment in restaurant or takeout settings. Just returned from shopping after 17 days - we've had 2 takeout pizzas since March and are eating well."
2020-11-03 15:30:38,"If we value these spaces as important, perhaps profits for the banks holding these buildings and loans to restaurants should not be our priority.

Profit and capitalism over the needs of the community are the problem."
2020-11-03 15:32:12,"This is a dystopian view and it makes no sense to me. Restaurants and bars will return wherever there are people. Big cities will, by their very nature, demand them. If anything, I see a pent up demand that will be a major catalyst for new restaurants to fill the void treated by the pandemic. The economic wildfire caused by COVID has created a void, and the Economy's nature abhors a void."
2020-11-03 15:36:08,"The entire restaurant industry is built on starvation wages. Many of the workers make less than minimum wage, and rare is the worker who gets healthcare and sick leave as part of their compensation. These workers are subsidized by the rest of us via public assistance. This industry needs to stop externalizing its costs on to the rest of us. 

I appreciate good food, and we occasionally enjoy take out Korean, Chinese, Thai etc. Even before the pandemic, eating out was a rare treat. I'm not unmindful of the economic loses suffered by this particular community. If the restaurant industry comes back, it needs to return with an economic structure that does not rely on tax subsidies to survive."

I would imagine the same is true for a lot of people out there. As soon as it's safe to dine again, there will be a LOT of pent up demand needing LOTS of bars and restaurants!"

2020-11-03 16:06:31,In Denver a number of well loved restaurants are permanently closing. Their small spaces with tables squeezed together aren’t practical to reopen now. But interestingly there are a number of new restaurants openings as they were able to design around COVID restrictions.
2020-11-03 16:07:53,"We love eating out. But we can’t afford it anymore, either. Restaurants are not the only businesses struggling. My business is suffering because most of my clients have been shut down again, and my son’s college work-study job has been eliminated completely, so two white, college-educated adults are now supporting three people in two different states solely upon the income from what amounts to two part-time jobs. And one of those jobs is in a restaurant that is also struggling. The Republican Senate refused to renew the pandemic unemployment assistance while implying that we are all of us too “lazy” to want to work, and you can bet that hearing that from Mitch McConnell, one of the world’s worst grifters, is partly why we all voted against every Republican running for office. They have been busy giving tax cuts to people who don’t need them, packing the courts with anti-choice judges, and depriving the rest of us of hope. At least the Dems passed the HEROES bill in May, and if they get into power, we are expecting a much better, far more robust assistance package for the country. Maybe that will help save the restaurants and all of the other small businesses that are currently doing their best to survive under the current terrible circumstances — which could have been mitigated if we had had more competent and caring leadership in this country. It’s obvious that callousness and disdain for those who are suffering brings us nothing as a country."
2020-11-03 16:22:18,Absence of restaurants strikes me as a weird thing to worry about.  If there is demand there will be supply.  There's no barrier with intellectual property - recipes get reverse-engineered all day.  Increments of capacity can be as small as food carts.  Landlords will lower expectations for rent and new restaurants will go into place.
2020-11-03 16:31:57,"I’m old enough to remember when people worked in factories and had good paying union jobs. The downtown areas were thriving occupied by local banks and big department stores and first-run movie houses. People didn’t eat out much and only on special occasions. The neighborhoods were mainly where people lived and went to school and church. Then the economic collapse of the Seventies happened. Factories closed, and neighborhoods emptied out and churches closed as people fled to the burbs. Shopping malls replaced department stores, and cineplexes replaced the old movie houses. The Nineties ushered in a new era of prosperity, but it wasn’t the same. The good factory jobs never came back but were replaced by low-paying service jobs with little job security. It was a gig economy. It was depressing to see small restaurants and artsy-crafts shops selling dried flowers and bath products suddenly becoming the center of the economy. The big factories were replaced by condos and fancy lofts and there was no longer any stability or community, so when the pandemic hit, everything was swept away. What next? Everyone working at home, ordering in for food, and shopping at Amazon? The big tech companies will take over now. Technology will destroy us. What a bleak time for our children to grow up in even if we do emerge from this present horror."

2020-11-03 15:10:49,"Indoor restaurants are struggling even in areas without capacity rules. People don’t want to be in a room of strangers during a pandemic. It’s not the government’s rules giving people the heebee geebees, the virus is doing that. Plenty of young people who are otherwise healthy still have health conditions like asthma, and plenty don’t have health insurance. It’s just plain stupid to go sit in a restaurant or bar if you don’t have insurance and especially with health conditions. It’s just ridiculous to assume government capacity rules are really the reason, it’s the pandemic, stupid. 

Having said that, in our local area, restaurants that offer takeout and are exceptional are thriving. For example, we have a particularly good Italian restaurant, a dive place with few tables and mostly takeout. Before the pandemic, I could pick up a pizza in a half hour after calling in. Now I have to wait an hour or more to pick up."

Rife with sexual harassment/assault, racism, classism, and every exploitative behavior under the sun - these places are getting their comeuppance. Now I’m not saying that the workers or the few honest owners deserve this, and in fact we should be doing our best to support those people at this time. But a lot of this industry is toxic and I think it needed a major shake up like this to force change. 

How is it fair that as a server I was making $80,000 a year but the dishwasher was making $25,000? But on that note, how is it fair that the owner rolls up in his Tesla and treats the place like his personal playground as we are instructed to act like servile peasants?

There’s this culture in restaurants that struggling and working yourself into the ground is noble. Cooks work 13 hour days but aren’t allowed to clock in for 5 of those hours. They are told “that’s just how the industry is”. They live in poverty because they know that this place will look good on their resume and hopefully will lead to more opportunities. And god forbid anyone call in sick. 

I’ve heard horrible things come out of chefs mouths, I’ve seen plates thrown across the kitchen, I’ve been fired because I knew too much about a sexual harassment lawsuit a chef took out against an owner. 

Good people will suffer from this. But to the rest, good riddance and let’s hope the new set treat their employees like humans"

Get rid of the restaurants. People can cook for themselves. It's a luxury item for an increasingly impoverished nation, eating out. The savings will eventually reach everyone, and there will be more money for the stuff people really need, to survive."
2020-11-03 16:54:35,"I actually believe restaurants are likely to come back in a slightly different form. Rents will be lower as landlords need to rent the space. New entrepreneurs will want to try their hand at it with smaller more specialized menus and more take out friendly recipes.  Reduced waste and smaller staffs.  More fun, less high end. Maybe a cockeyed optimist but a little hopeful about that particular industry."
2020-11-03 16:58:21,"The restaurant industry is not being decimated by the pandemic. It is being decimated by the government's reaction to the pandemic.

If the government had not decided to forcibly prevent people from patronizing restaurants for the last nine months, many of these restaurants would be doing just fine (as the young and healthy population would continue to dine in).

It has been stunning to me to watch this year how little the politicians and people supporting them care about these small business owners and their mostly low-wage employees."

2020-11-03 17:51:35,"I don't think restaurants are the beating heart of vibrant city living. They are more like butterflies. Restaurants are a sign of healthy urban ecosystems. These economists have their causality confused. Restaurants are a component of a desirable place, not the thing itself. 

What makes an urban space desirable then? A desirable urban space is a space where all your economic activity centers are located within convenient and interesting relation to each other.

What does that mean?

In NYC, there were two grocery stores, a pharmacy, a park, a bar, a liquor store, a drycleaner, a movie theater, a pizza place, an Indian place, a bagel place, a deli, a cafe, a coffee shop, a school, a church, a synagogue, a museum, and two subway stops all within easy walking distance of my apartment. The bar was actually attached to my building. The only place I ever needed to travel was work and the commute was fairly painless. Express train, no transfers.

Now you might say, downtown has all these things plus more and better restaurants. Don't you want to go there?

No!! Because downtown doesn't have the one thing I value most: My home. You'll find this area blindness among economic development gurus all the time. Look at this beautiful vibrant space with all these restaurants and stores! Who cares if no one can afford to live there? Just like a shopping mall, everything goes dark and empty when the people go home.

New York is interesting because people live everywhere and they never sleep."
2020-11-03 18:16:46,"If restaurants die, much of the préciosité, elitism and prétense of living in a gentrified neighbourhood will also die.  But people will always want to relegate cooking and cleaning up to others, so I don’t see this happening in Pittsburg where I once lived and Chicago where I currently live.  My cooking, honed at cordon bleu and through many generations of French gourmands, needs no Michelin star.  My guests are delighted to be invited here for any occasion at less than $500 a person."
2020-11-03 15:26:49,"Maybe we're finally figuring out that we don't need to be packed like sardines in a tin.  We can only hope that the open-office concept dies a well-deserved death along with it.  I don't have to go into any downtown because now I can and do work from home.

I have lived in the Los Angeles suburbs for 50 years.  I can't remember the year I last went into Los Angeles.  There is no need, and there is nothing there I want to see or do that I can't find here.  

It's too densely populated even here in the 'burbs.  Restaurants that can adapt have done so and are surviving.  More of them will survive in the suburbs because there is space for the outdoor dining.  So Cal is somewhat better positioned for it due to the weather, also.

For those of you who find the core exciting, more power to you.  I can't think of a single thing that could draw me there.

And there are legions like me."
2020-11-03 17:44:34,"Some comments here treat the topic of restaurants as if it's an issue of eating (why not cook at home!) or disposable income (they're only for the moneyed guys!) or services that follow the jobs (they will now move to the suburbs!).  They miss what I suspect makes restaurants so resilient and invaluable in the long term: they're a key part of an urban lifestyle. They are places for meeting, dating, watching people, and even working.  They are part service, part entertainment, part office.  As long as cities are there, restaurants will be a critical part of the urban mix.  And I don't think the dense cities are going anywhere.  And by the way, if there is anyone out there renouncing to the doomed New York City, London, Paris or Tokyo, please contact me.  I'll take your apartment unit and suffer through the coming urban apocalypse, no problem."
2020-11-03 14:54:28,"Hmmmm. Long after the fall of the Roman Empire, Rome still exists as a city and lo, and behold, there are RESTAURANTS.
Restaurants as a business category are not going anywhere. Yes, there will be some restructuring as some/many individual businesses succumb to this dire economic situation. But others will come to take their place as the pandemic wanes and the economy picks up."
2020-11-03 12:13:24,"I love eating out in great restaurants, and I can't wait to go out again with friends.  Takeout just isn't the same.  But while the pandemic will destroy individual restaurants, I think it's an exaggeration to say that it will destroy city life.  Some businesses will close, but there are always new ones waiting to take their place.  I hope things get better soon for owners and workers alike, so we don't have to test the theory."
2020-11-03 15:56:40,"I remember back in the 60's and early 70's when magazines such as Popular Science had articles about ""How we will live in 2000"".  Now 20 years after 2000, our world looks nothing like the fantasies outlined in those articles.  While we have experienced enormous change, it is nothing like the change that was predicted.

Similarly the ""What will the world look like after the pandemic"" articles.  I am a city lover and I am in isolation.  I really miss going to restaurants, browsing in bookstores and many other aspects of my ""before"" life.  Once it is safe again I will be still living in the city and I will definitely be celebrating the return of my freedom by going to restaurants.

The movement out of town for all the stated reasons - the ease of working from home, access to green space and the loss of restaurant dining - is only at the margins.  To the extent that demand for city dwellings softens it simply means that cities will be more affordable for more people that want to live in them.  The influx will quickly restore the status quo.

Cities are not for everyone - but for those of us who love living in the City - there is no alternative."
2020-11-03 16:15:14,"I enjoyed a great birthday dinner at a beautiful restaurant on Sunday night, and we had an early morning breakfast before voting at our local diner this morning.

At both places, our names and phone numbers were requested for tracing in the event of a new case. 

 So far, our rural town has been very careful, and in spite of over 100,000 tourists to our area, we had 2 total cases since March. 

Only 1 local restaurant has closed, a tiny place with 4 tables. 

As a former college student working tables in restaurants, I loved the rush of the dinner hour and seeing familiar faces.

I'm looking forward to the new."
2020-11-03 18:59:00,"The entire spectrum of resorts to live in a relatively few cities has been affected by the experience of working from home. I have long said that the masses who head for a small number of urban areas is inexplicable in the face of the fact that at II time in human history has it been less necessary to be in or near a particular place to practice in a particular field. That the information sector is among the most lemming like in where it locates defies logic since they are the reason it is no longer necessary to live near Wall St to work in finance, the Silicon Valley or its offshoots to work in tech, Hartford to work in insurance, etc."

Oh pul-leeze!"
2020-11-03 23:15:58,Good riddance. Nobody is going to miss the overpriced city restaurants except the owners and overcompensated waiters. It will be great to see new places spring up to replace them.

It makes perfect economic sense that the restaurants close when they are not needed. As soon as this pandemics is over they will open again. Better than ever. Those may not be the same restaurants employing the same people, but the demand will not remain unserved, don’t you worry about that. I feel bad for the people in that business, but I am not concerned about having restaurant-less cities in the future. People will still eat and communicate.

2020-11-04 03:14:48,"And much of the havoc is the same as what happened during the yearslong super recession between 2008 and several years after that. And then people started moving back in.

The pandemic's impact will lessen as we eventually have vaccines and antivirals. The damage to office spaces will be large, but that will not end office buildings. The damage to places where office workers ran out for lunch will be there, but places will also open again, under same or new management.

Look at what's happening this way - the high failure rate of restaurants, as you finally acknowledged late in this article, has been accelerated (as it was in the Great Recession).

But the equipment isn't being crushed, the know-how isn't being wiped from brains, the hunger for getting together with other people is, if anything, building up.

So you will have temporarily depressed rents on properties. You will have many experienced hospitality owners, managers, etc. all ready to start again.

I live in downtown Chicago and just as shutdowns accelerated ten, twelve years ago, they came back when conditions got better. I expect (and am eager for) the same to happen again when we finally get a grip on this pandemic."

I recently discovered that new diseases emerged several hundred years ago in China when farmers began to keep pigs and ducks in close proximity.

2020-11-02 12:50:57,"Dr. Gao thought cane rats could be the animal source. While the first cases weren’t related to that market, were they related to rats elsewhere? Did China do extensive testing of it’s rat populations, in other cities? Given that some virus was found in European septic systems earlier, did Europe do any rat testing? 

And it may be time for a new WHO head. Soft politics? As tens of thousands die? Pandering to any one nation, whether it be China, the U.S., the EU- doesn’t inspire much confidence. If an alternative funding strategy can’t be found, maybe it is time to reconsider membership.

Except, most “cases” aren’t cases. 99% of these people aren’t sick, and never have been. They just are carrying the virus. 

We all carry pathogens all the time. It’s the basis of disease resistance. The first colonists to the New World brought smallpox with them. But none of them had smallpox; no one with smallpox made that hard ocean crossing. They just carried the virus. Thus, when the resident Native Americans were swept by smallpox epidemics, and died, the newcomers stayed well.

It’s how the human race has survived these diseases. The WHO has lied about this from the very beginning of the pandemic in China.

Deaths matter. We are in the seventh consecutive week averaging less than 1,000 covid deaths a day; it’s currently 800.

2020-11-02 13:02:11,"This article does its readers a severe disservice in not mentioning a word about what we now know about its origins - and is stuck rehashing what was known at the beginning of January.

We know now the pandemic did not originate at the Wuhan Seafood Market. The market was a crowded shopping area in the dense center of the city and was simply the locus where the outbreak was first recognized.

Every one of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes that has ever been sequenced, approaching 100,000 now, forms part of a tree that is rooted around November 15. 

The first case of COVID-19 of an illness, later identified for what it was, was seen on December 1. And around December 15 it had taken a flight to France where it started a chain of infection that landed a French citizen in a Paris hospital before the Wuhan Seafood Market outbreak was noticed.

But it would have diluted the claims of the authors to give the reader a hint that all their reporting was about a red herring, a false lead on the origin."

By focusing on scapegoating China, we have on both conscious and unconscious levels reinforced the perception of China as ""other"". I believe that this has been part of the reason that our response has been so delayed and inadequate. Remember the ""relief"" when this hit Italy because then we would get some ""real"" information and see how a modern Western nation could successfully deal with Covid without resorting to the ""draconian"", ""totalitarian"" and ""Maoist"" strategies employed by China. Then to our astonishment and horror, we saw this thing literally steamroll Italy. Oops. It really doesn't matter what China publicly said, they gave us a step by step playbook of how to handle this. What they did to contain and mitigate was literally visible by satellite and based on sound reasoning and science. If we did not see them as ""other"" we would have appreciated the severity of the threat sooner and would have followed their, now proven, strategies. We are blaming them for our own failures and continuing to do so will jeopardize the global cooperation that is required to deal with this and future pandemics."

People should remember that China muzzled some of its leading scientists, researchers and physicians when they tried to alert the outside world to this contagion. 
People should remember, as reporting from NYTimes, WSJ and others has confirmed, China did NOTHING to stop tens of thousands of infected Chinese nationals from international travel during the month of January -- AFTER China knew it had a deadly serious problem on its hands. 
People should remember that Chinese authorities launched a vicious story blaming the US military for introducing the virus into Wuhan. It has since been retracted, yet Chinese propaganda continues. 
Let's remove our Chinese manufactured rose colored glasses. In good time, we need to seriously reassess our relationship with the brutal totalitarians who run Beijing."

Nature did not randomly select Wuhan.  You don’t have to be an expert in probability to calculate the odds.  So why Wuhan?  Why is this singularly transmissible virus is so hard to fight compared to other viruses?  The answer to all questions lead me back to the virus labs in Wuhan.  They had been designing chimera coronaviruses for many years.  Whether it was an accidental or malicious release is the only remaining question.  The CCP and PLA has been playing around will bio-weapons and the Wuhan labs had been pursuing making viruses more infectious and deadly for years. We won’t find direct proof because the CCP has destroyed evidence and has barred investigators from going into these Wuhan labs. The WHO is feckless and has been corrupted by the CCP.  Ignore it."

Trump's and the top military brass's effort to deny serious disease on the aircraft carrier offer a clue as to how our government would have responded if a Covid case had first been discovered on American soil. True, China could have  given more access to outside scientists but their response is not unique to world politics nor surprising."
2020-11-02 13:54:11,"WHO knows that it is best for the greater good and let China lead the search and investigate along with other WHO members.

In addition, China will contribute to the WHO vaccine program, which will help many poor countries in need of any vaccine to stop the Covid-19.  

WHO also needs Chinese vaccines to distribute to poor countries once vaccine is passed the Stage III trial.  This is specially critical because the vaccines in Stage III by other  developed countries have already been bought up by rich countries. None is available for poor countries.  

WHO may attract criticism from US. But again, we have no extra vaccine capacity to help other countries except our self."

2020-11-02 14:47:05,"We cannot be that naive to not acknowledge that the Chinese government has a substantial responsibility to the global spread of this virus. 

Yes - the American response to this virus was and still is abysmal, but many countries in a more social unified Europe are also experiencing second and third waves and second shutdowns, which are all clear signs that this virus is mutating. 

This is not the first, second, or third time that an infectious disease has originated from mainland China. Nor is thier lack of transparency surprising. However, what I find quite rich is that many European countries quickly criticize American companies and the lack of privacy from American companies, like Google, yet are more than willing to hold hands with China, a country with a government that is notoriously known of hindering free speech and dissolving itself from any semblance of accountability. 

The Chinese government has a clear blame to the global spread of this virus, and we are too afraid to admit it because we think we're going to be labeled as racists. The Chinese government and the Chinese people are two completely different entities. The global community need to place more accountability on China, or China will use this as a precedent to wield their global affairs anyway they like. The American government has done this too, but the only difference is that we can criticize our government and elect our leaders, we can try them in court, but the same cannot be said for China."
2020-11-02 13:34:14,US and UK along with European countries should have dragged China to UN or some place and insisted on finding out what actually happened.That would have helped in finding vaccine faster.Instead each country decided to go their own way resulting in chaos.

Under ANY normal president, the US would have been working with China, allies, and international agencies last November and December, to prevent this pandemic from leaving China to begin with.

Instead, Trump fired all the planners, denied the science, and refused all collaboration.

Future historians will regard this as the Trump Plague and the Trump Global Recession.  The millions of deaths and the trillions of dollars lost worldwide will be due largely to Trump’s narcissism and obsessive hatred toward Obama.

There can be no progress in health or economics until Trump leaves office in Jan. 2021.  

President Biden can start the healing, both medically and politically.  In addition to working with other countries to defeat COVID worldwide, he should also create an international program to prevent the next pandemic from spreading.

2020-11-02 15:18:35,"The NYT article: ""Four of the first five coronavirus patients had no clear links to the market."" 

Terming them ""the first five"" is misleading. By the time those five were identified, there were probably hundreds of Wuhan residents who had been infected. There would need to be tracing of the five's contacts in the prior weeks to identify a probable source. 

My question to the experts: Do scientific studies of prior viruses reveal whether the cross-over from animals to humans  of a new strain occurs to a single person who then infects others, or from animals to many people in the initial period before infectious transmission between humans becomes widespread? That information would help to identify the early transmission pattern in the Wuhan outbreak."
2020-11-02 14:33:11,"China is NEVER to be trusted on this. Ever. Any strategy that relies on honest communication from the Chinese should be scrapped. They do not, ever, have the best interests of anyone (besides themselves) at hand and should never be trusted in this (or much of anything else either)."
2020-11-02 13:43:37,"Tracing the origins and reservoirs of viruses that spill over from nature to humans is difficult and requires meticulous and often dangerous work. Politics need to put aside to allow full, co-operative work. Look at the localization of the original SARS CoV that first appeared in 2003.

Many sources were postulated, e.g. Civet Cat, monkeys, etc. Often these were traced to the animal markets. The complex and  meticulous studies led back to a few species of bats and the virus transferred to other animals and these were ultimately transferred to humans, who carelessly or unknowingly spread it among themselves. 

The point is the current pandemic is likely due to such a spillover. Along with other identification and preventive measures, the source and reservoir where it resides between pandemics need to be identified. There is no simple, non-scientific or political answer.

The final death toll from SARS was very much lower than from SARS-CoV-2"
2020-11-02 14:27:44,The un-scientific approach by WHO is what happens when an organization needs to interact with a dictatorship controlled by a leader for life. How could they have done the right thing for the good of world health? This is case study material.
2020-11-02 14:16:20,"Isn’t it odd that the virus was contained in China just in the Wuhan providence, but it spread to the rest of the world? Europe has higher deaths per capita than the US, but everyone is focused on blaming Trump. Europe and other countries economies are decimated, but ours in the US is not. Isn’t it odd that globalists are peddling the Great Reset worldwide because of the pandemic?  How handy. It’s almost like the virus was purposely released for an agenda. Hmmm. Doesn’t sound like a peaceful & tolerant movement to me."
2020-11-02 13:57:19,"A very thorough article.  The faults of the WHO and China are clear; the institutional problems are elucidated; the fast-draw rationalizations of our President to blame other and excuse himself, are obvious; but overall, there is little reassuring here, except that scientists will, with time, discover the cause of the Pandemic that is killing so many people worldwide, if left alone to do their work. Good luck, huh? This article seems to indicate that Vice President Biden puts trust in science, perhaps not to the same degree that President Trump asserts in his own self-confidence above all advice, so I can only hope that the NYTimes will muster some more information that would be useful to the voters and pivotal to making the best choice in the upcoming election."
2020-11-02 13:32:22,"It doesn't matter whether or not a formal scientific investigation is ongoing. The conclusions of the report are already being drafted in some obscure politburo, and we all know what will be in it. 

Some random country will be blamed for ""starting"" the epidemics, China will be portrayed as doing such a good job at trying to save the world with the fabulous guidance of the WHO, and a few countries will be labeled racists for trying (and failing) to control travel.

Why does anyone even care, now that it's too late to learn anything valuable?
Let the propaganda machine work as usual, but if for a change we could not amplify its message, it would be great."
2020-11-02 15:02:07,"The nature of the WHO seems to lead to this kind of situation. The Chinese are sensitive to criticism and did not want outsiders looking at what might be their dirty laundry. Understandably, they were also suspicious of Westerners - particularly Americans -on a WHO team. Given that some of the IAEA's American nuclear inspectors in Iran were American double-agents, and given the Trump adminstration's continuing attacks on China, this wariness is understandable. Nonetheless, in reading this, I could not help but wonder if the US would have behaved much differently? Certainly, the US record of abusing multilateral organizations and expecting them to do the bidding of the US - and then throwing tantrums and making threats if they do not - is a long established mode of American conduct. Indeed, many of the US complaints about China amount to condemning China for doing things that the US does or has done as a regular practice."
2020-11-02 15:19:07,"The Chinese doctor who first warned of a novel virus outbreak disappeared soon after. 
 Wuhan was  sealed off from the rest of China early on but international flights in and out continued.

  Conspiracy or coincidence, this ended up being very effective in causing harm to Chinas economic competitors..."
2020-11-02 14:32:45,"Amazing that the coverup and freeze on any independent examination of potential evidence is well document here.  It is a conspiracy with China directing WHO moves and pronouncements.  You make the case for Trump's less documented assertions.

CDC and Fauci depend on WHO to be open, and in front of things.  When we thus follow the ""science"" and find it so corrupted who are we to believe?"
2020-11-02 15:36:54,"This report demonstrates the working of 3 issues: science, politics and leadership. 
Mistakes are made by China and many Western countries.  China made the first mistakes and soon corrected them by locking down province and cities.  It played politics with the outsider world, but not with its own people. 
Western countries make the mistake by not taking the virus seriously, handle the situation clumsily and blamed it on China.  US especially considers this issue of health (by extension life and death) as political.  
Xi builds a new great wall of China, WHO director is a seasoned diplomat and Trump is forever a realty TV star!"
2020-11-02 15:37:53,"In an effort to “save face”™️, the Chinese government restricted access to data and possible means of investigation. They didn’t want to look bad. That’s par for the course with the CCP. But how does that dispel any of the concerns other nations may have? How does that answer any questions that outside scientists may have?
“Nothing to see here” or “stuff happens” isn’t a sufficient response to a pandemic that’s turned the world upside down. 
Furthermore, how can anyone determine what is and isn’t a conspiracy theory when there is such a dearth of knowledge about the cause of outbreak?"
2020-11-02 15:41:27,"A botched evidence trail at the Huanan Seafood Market and a propensity for hiding information suggests that Chinese authorities continue to have considerable credibility issues.  A publication called The Epoch Times also reveals that there were several deaths in Wuhan hospitals due to COVID-19-like symptoms as far back as September, 2019.  CT scans of several of those patients showed a respiratory pattern that matched lesions found in documented COVID-19 patients.  This data at least questions the regime's official timeline and therefore possibly how the virus originated. 

Due to the worldwide damage done to human lives and economies of scale China is going to have to be forthright in providing reliable, verifiable data to back up its assertions or risk political, diplomatic and economic ostracism.  There's a compelling argument that China should be held liable by countries or groups of individuals victimized by the pandemic."
2020-11-02 15:47:57,"Since the virus originated in China , China is the logical nation to investigate its origins. The idea of a group of people unfamiliar with the Wuhan area/environment descending and doing better than a local team is absurd. Extending this idea, possibly the US is not qualified to sort out its election mess, maybe a Chinese or Nigerian team could do better."

2020-11-02 15:52:52,"And if virus had been found in the market, how would we know if the meat for sale brought it or infected humans? I agree the most likely source is China's wild meat trade, but that is speculative. We still have the genome of the virus. Ultimately, despite how many testimonies and samples you take, the answer is buried somewhere in that genetic code."

2020-11-02 15:29:47,"Excellent article albeit 7 or 8 months late.    A root cause analysis will show many deficiencies including the press, politic, foundations (BMGF), and scientists all obfuscated the truth for their own publicity and ego."

2020-11-02 13:49:13,"Wow, so Trump was right and Fauci was wrong. China did not cooperate with the WHO and should be punished by the global community.  Funny how these stories are showing up right before Trump wins again."
2020-11-02 14:36:26,"Until there is regime change in China, the truth will never be known.

A big if. And perhaps not even then. After all, secrecy and disinformation will always remain the go-to strategies of those individuals who govern the world.

The good news is that those individuals -- powered by their ideological and material lusts, are not only often rivals in their corruption, but in their agendas as well.

So who knows what might be inadvertently revealed?"
2020-11-02 14:26:22,"It is tragic that the Trump administration cut funding to the World Health Organization, which was forced to withdraw Dr. Linda Quick and other epidemiologists monitoring China (including Wuhan) just before SRS-CoV-2 appeared.  Had our experts still be in China in November, the Covid-19 contagion could have been contained to a one city or region in China.

It is disgraceful that American media rarely mentions that it was the American government that deliberately chose to crippled WHO, politicize the epidemic and antagonize China.

America brought the Trump Pandemic upon itself and America is solely responsible for most of the death of hundreds of thousands of dead and dying Americans."

2020-11-02 14:56:36,"Stop your Trump fixations for a minute; not everything in the world is about Trump.

The fact is, China has no interest in discovering the origins of the virus, and is preventing any investigation. Why? Pride? Embarrassment? Because totalitarian governments are sensitive to criticism?

Remember, the CPP killed millions of its own citizens during the Cultural Revolution. It doesn't care about health impacts, it cares about preserving its self-image."
2020-11-02 13:55:05,Isn’t this what Trump was claiming from the very beginning when most of the media mocked him ?

2020-11-02 16:16:23,"One of three larger picture implications of this mess, and we're seeing it domestically more and more, the old idea that science/health and politics/policy/communications are separate, and should be kept that way, is an out-of-date myth.
These fields keep smacking into each other. For better or worse, that's just the way it is. It even happened, albeit to a much lessor degree, before the Trump era.
We should recognize and come to grips with the interconnections, and try to work out guidance for do's and don'ts.
I hope schools of public health and medicine are cognizant of this, professors are working out the new rules of the game, and teaching their students. And then tell the public how things are changing, including the latter's new role as recipient/processor/re-communicator of messages.
Public health professionals should not have to be caught in double binds, and suffer undeserved threats to their reputations, and never to their families.
Another large scale implication is WHO must do things differently, as well as concede major mistakes. But how much of that is due to their own double bind, which must also be recognized and overcome.
There will be more pandemics and we must get much better at this.
Relatedly, we need to go back even earlier in the origin story. What were the ecological roots, the environmental destruction that led to the human contact to begin with? This rarely comes up, and only a few Times journalists seem to know about it."
2020-11-02 16:39:04,"No matter how much the govt (China) twists and turns the answer rests the same. At the outset a quick, effective isolation of the virus pockets was possible. Even if C19 is more airborne than SARS or H1N1 or Ebola... a rapid response by China and WHO might have kept C19 in one place. This opportunity was missed by bureaucracy. We know that bureaucracy kills and C19 is the perfect example of bureaucracy's indifference to human lives. Add to bureaucracy political rapacity, this too kills. The US now understands how rapacious, uncaring politicians (eg., baby-cager Trump) impede virus protection and even further a pandemic's destruction. This will be a very difficult lesson for US citizens. They will look back and regret the election of a populist like Republican Trump."

China does not want the truth to be known"
2020-11-02 16:39:52,"Not much in here is surprising. We all know the WHO is a China puppet, but most people are too afraid of having a common opinion with Trump."
2020-11-02 16:17:09,"For the W.H.O. to ""let China take charge"" in its hunt for the virus source is akin to allowing the foxes to inspect the hen houses for weaknesses in its structure and pens.

China had a golden opportunity to sound the alarm bells early on in February when Dr. Li Wenliang tried to issue the first warning about the deadly coronavirus outbreak.  

However, he and his brave and heroic efforts were silenced by the Chinese government.  It wasn't until he died on February 7th after contracting the virus while working at Wuhan Central Hospital that this new and deadly virus could not longer be ignored nor silenced.

It's a little difficult to assume or expect full transparency and honesty from this country NOW when they have been anything but for most of this year.

If only they had been honest, open and upfront about this virus, I keep thinking about the enormous of lives that could have been spared.

Something, China has proven to be anything but trustworthy and credible."
2020-11-02 12:27:31,"In an age where information is power, the most important thing a government can do, is to maintain access to information. There are many ways information is obtained, but one way to ensure you do not have access to it, is to be reactionary and self select out of the one organization that can give you access. A more skilled and cunning leader, say someone like Mr. Xi, knows that you leverage organizations like WHO from the inside, not by accusing them of the gross incompetence at its institutional core. As China asserts itself as a great power, we can expect more co-opting of weak international institutions. The way to combat this is through engagement, so we can shape those institutions to our advantage."
2020-11-02 14:43:23,"The appearance of the Covid19 epidemic in Wuhan in the same decade as the SARS coronavirus epidemic definitely placed the onus on the Chinese government to find the origin of the Covid19 corona virus. Yes, China was guilty of harboring the agent. But this is not a question of ""guilt"". This was a question of trying to learn about how this ""novel"" corona virus was introduced into the human population. Yes, China initially covered up and by so doing politicized it. BUT, Trump then over-reacted and politicized it to a much greater extent making it impossible for scientists to ever get past the great wall of politics to discover the Truth. Once again Trump made a mess of what might have been simply a scientific conundrum that was possibly soluble. Trump messes up everything with which he comes into contact. His leadership on this national emergency has been disastrous."
2020-11-02 14:13:55,"If the US had accepted the German test being distributed by WHO, we would have had a big head start. Quitting WHO and calling it the ""China virus"" did not encourage China to cooperate. America's Trumpist isolationism was and is the biggest problem in fighting the virus."

The botched testing was among the most significant errors in the early response by the US. This was a CDC led effort. The sooner the media can come to grips with the fact that scientists are fallible, we will have a more sensible discussion in many areas. This was not the fault of the 'Trump administration'. It was a massive institutional failure among scientists, career civil servants and the administration."
2020-11-02 17:52:10,"Let's not forget the political pettiness of the Trump administration when it closed the CDC office left by the Obama administration this was not only critical but essential for a quick reaction which was the sole purpose of having an office in the White House to deal with such emergencies.

Trump has treated covid as a political tool to divide the nation and has bartered away critical time and knowledge away by further removing the United States from the WHO instead choosing to bury his head in the sand, his actions during the pandemic have been bizarre and out of step with how the rest of the world has dealt with it with responsibility and joint efforts between different scientific organizations willing to help, this is just par for the course for a man who spent his life jumping from one failure to the next and surviving by the wit of his con and wrangling with his lenders and the courts instead of running a successful business but that's how he thinks business should be run and so he ran the country as such."
2020-11-02 18:04:20,"This was a fairly informative if perhaps incomplete article that highlights things that the reputable American press, which has largely focused its energies on highlighting Trump's many failures (and is the worse for it), has downplayed for months now."
2020-11-02 18:29:07,"Even though China concealed information at the beginning, by the end of Jan, the world already knew how deadly the virus is when China locked down a city of 10 million people. How did the rest of the world do curbing their local spread after knowing all these? Which country managed to not to spread virus to other countries? It's easy to say that if China had been more transparent, the rest of the world wouldn't have had been suffering from thousands of deaths today. But I genuinely believe even the China CDC didn't know enough about the virus at beginning to impose stricter restrictions. Unless China had all the knowledge we have today about asymptomatic patients, imposed a total travel ban immediately after the first case was detected, and tested everyone in Wuhan, there was no way this virus wouldn't have been spread elsewhere in the age of globalization.  What WHO praised China for was their actions to bring it under control once it's clear How deadly and infectious this virus is and I don't see why they shouldn't. The local transmission in China is almost zero. Isn't there anything that we can learn from? I don't understand how this article is helping American people and informing what they should do."
2020-11-02 17:03:08,"Sadly the investigation was politicized from the start because of the different political system in China.  Remember the ""Sick man of the Asia"" article that caused so much furies at the start of the pandemic?  

Anytime the media attached the virus to a political system, a country or an ethnic group, they squander the opportunities for the truth.  I too wish the only the Chinese bats carry the coronavirus and infect only people live in an authoritarian state."
2020-11-02 17:02:22,"This virus was not made in a lab.
After ""The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2"" by Andersen et al. in Nature Medicine, no scientist of standing would think so.
It is clear that, quote, ""RaTG13, sampled from a Rhinolophus affinis bat, is ~96% identical overall to SARS-CoV-2, its spike diverges in the RBD, which suggests that it may not bind efficiently to human ACE2"" (...) Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2. Although the RaTG13 bat virus remains the closest to SARS-CoV-2 across the genome, some pangolin coronaviruses exhibit strong similarity to SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD, including all six key RBD residues. This clearly shows that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein optimized for binding to human-like ACE2 is the result of natural selection.""

However, I'm one of those people who tried to find out who the alternate host was - maybe a pangolin - who made SARS-Cov-2 able to infect humans (which the RaTG13 virus was not able to)...

And I can say one thing with certainty: if all wildlife markets and all wildlife trade were banned, first in China and Asia, and then around the globe, and humans would leave biodiverse places alone, not burning or logging them, not farming or living in their vicinity, with wealthy countries helping poorer ones achieve that, we could stop 99% of new pathogens before they become pandemics..."

2020-11-02 16:43:39,"Please do some more reading from scientific journals. The lab conspiracy theory has been debunked using sequencing comparisons.  When viruses jump hosts it often starts out very slowly and deaths may go undetected. It takes time for natural selection to select for viruses that can infect the new host more efficiently. HIV has been traced back to cases years before any documented outbreak. Same with other viruses. The origin may have been anywhere in the region. A recent Nature article pin pointed RNA sequences more closely aligned with bats in neighboring Thailand, suggesting a slow earlier jump. 

This is what happens when you politicize science. No nation is to blame for the viruses origins. Nations can be blamed for not protecting their people or interfering with the research. But let’s stop the conspiracy theories and focus on containing the virus."
2020-11-02 17:08:51,Thank you for finally saying what we've known to be true for months.

I was sick for two months with bronchitis  and other respiratory complaints, and saw a pulmonologist several times.  This was not like me; I am older, but healthy and fit, a f/t worker.

You could tell he was lying to protect a trade deal - he was moving his lips! And was China ever expected to be forthcoming about anything regarding the virus? Please! Trump spent 3 years making the U.S. irrelevant to being a leader in any sense except in number of infections and deaths. We are an object of pity and a lion who couldn’t roar on the international stage. Both China and Trump have treated this pandemic as a political opportunity in their own usual way - China using secrecy, propaganda, repression, internal spying, and removal of those with messages that don’t tow the government line; Trump with lies, narcissism, politicisation, ignorance, cruelty, intimidation, and greed. Trump has been aided at every step by his lackeys in the Republican Party who knew exactly what was going on, knew what to do to save thousands of lives and jobs, and chose to sacrifice lives to avoid a mean tweet. Now Trump has called for and encouraged actual violence against those he does not like. Republicans are now stuck whether Trump remains in the White House for another 4 years or not - they will have to think about what they say because anything against Trump could be a matter of life or death for a very long time. Trump’s “army” will literally hunt them down. Welcome to the world of Black and Brown people."

2020-11-02 18:01:31,"From Sars to Covid to Hong Kong flu to H7n9 to H5N1 to Asian flu China is the originator of many of the most deadly viral outbreaks. Their duplicity and concealing of data remains a major concern as countries around the world continue to suffer, whether these viruses are wild market incubators or lab experiments that have gone wrong. China has held the WHO in it's power for years and this needs to stop. An obvious example of this is the bizarre complaint of China that the virus is called the ""Wuhan Virus."" Virtually all viruses/infections are named after where they originate, from the Hong Kong flu to 'Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever', to Lyme Disease (Lyme Connecticut) to Ebola (Ebola River in Africa) to Zika (Zika Forest, Uganda), to Marburg virus (Marburg, Ger). China, if it wishes to remain a part of the trading/business community, it must become more transparent, and open up its data fields regarding this virus."

That said there was a relatively short period of time before the bat was out of the cave as it were. Regardless of how the market was involved the virus escaped into the animal kingdom from bats, the subject of the Chinese Bat Lady for decades. This one came from caves west of Wuhan. How exactly is the question but it's only a question of zoonotic biology not politics."
2020-11-02 19:14:11,In 2020 the budget for the CDC was almost 1/2 of what it was in 2017. To accommodate the cuts the CDC pulled scientists who monitor these outbreaks from China (and other parts of the world). Had they been present would they have been able bolster a WHO presence in the investigation? Is this part of the America first agenda and if so does anyone see the irony in the results of this policy?
2020-11-02 19:35:28,"The most important question is if the SARS-COV-2 virus may have arisen out of laboratory adaptation of a precursor bat virus through tissue culture propagation of the virus in a laboratory, followed by accidental infection of a laboratory worker.

Most viruses show species restriction because when a virus adapts by growth and selection to replicate well  in one species, it becomes less well adapted to growth in a different species.  So the question is:  how did SARS-CoV-2 adapt from being a bat-optimized virus into becoming a human optimized virus?  Typically we think this often involves an intermediate species that allows for some of the changes needed to happen.  But it could have occurred in a laboratory, without any fancy molecular biology steps, just by propagation in human cells in tissue culture.  There is no evidence for this, just as there is no evidence against this having happened.  China denies this possibility.  But if that occurred, laboratory infections are not rare and that could have been the source for introduction of the virus into the community where it could have further mutated and adapted.   It is an important question because it goes to the risk of laboratory adaptation of viruses in the future and what standards of containment should be used in such work."
2020-11-02 19:55:10,"""When the Trump administration decided to develop its own test kits, rather than rely on the W.H.O. blueprint, the botched result led to delays.""

This differs from what I recall being reported earlier this year. The information then was that the Germans offered us a functional test very early one and that the CDC bureaucracy rejected it due to not-invented-here bias. The CDC chose to create a more comprehensive test. That test was unsuccessful once it as made available to the medical professionals.

I believe that working the term ""Trump administration"" into the narrative of the CDC's error is a mistake."

2020-11-02 19:07:29,"So it is just a coincidence that the CCP biological weapons lab is in Wuhan? The CCP is putting their country on a war footing. Bio weapons are just another weapon to them. 
Maybe the virus just got away from them but one has to wonder, the virus has hit the free world very hard."
2020-11-02 17:22:15,"Not a bad article, but I wish the author would have kept the US politics out of it and concentrated on the subject. It's entirely likely that this outbreak was lab related whether intentional or unintentional. As some others have said, the US has had issues in the past. Operation Sea-Spray in 1950 resulted in an outbreak of Serratia marcescens pneumonia in San Francisco. In the 70s security guards at Naval Biosciences lab in Oakland CA were infected with Yersinia pestis. When you have a local source of a virus not normally found locally, that source needs to be evaluated."
2020-11-02 19:56:45,Trump is the right person to deal with China and hold it accountable with tighter attacks on it very soon once he wins the election!
2020-11-02 18:13:37,"As a published scientist myself, let me explain something to everyone here. When they say that ""there is no evidence that it came from a lab"", that is a completely misleading assertion. The virus could easily have leaked from a lab and there wouldn't necessarily be any evidence of that in the viral genome. 

Here are some documented facts and I will let you all draw your own conclusions:

1. The 96% genetically similiar virus (RaTG13), mentioned in this article, was held at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) but never published or acknowledged until after the pandemic was underway. 

2. The RaTG13 virus was originally sampled from a cave in China in 2012 where workers became sick with an unexplained pneumonia with symptoms mimicking COVID-19.

3. WIV has not allowed anyone to view their files, data, or confirmed what type of virus research they were conducting (Animal passage experiments? Gain of function experiments?)

4. In 2018, workers for the US state department sent cables from China reporting that the WIV high-risk virus research lab was unsafe and a possible source of outbreak. (Reported by Washington Post)."
2020-11-02 17:19:35,"This article makes numerous efforts to   apply blame for this catastrophe on Trump, but despite these efforts the truth emerges.  Wherever this virus orginated, there was a massive Chinese coverup, enabled by the WHO.  Indeed it may have leaked accidentally or malevolently from the virus lab in Wuhan.  There were weeks of delays,  and the WHO continued to recommend travel!  And when Trump finally curtailed travel from China, he was labeled a xenophobe by those who claim that they could have handled it better!
Even now as the article makes clear, any investigation is tainted by delay and obstruction by the Chinese.
It's worth remembering that this type of delay and obstruction similarly hindered any real investigation of Iran's nuclear program by the UN nuclear investigators, i.e. allowing Iran to collect its own soil samples to be sent for evaluation.
Try as you may, this cannot be laid at Trump's feet."
2020-11-02 19:09:36,"When countries do not want an organization to work, the rules will fail. China should have been publicly embarrassed. This applies to the United States also. Our organizations in government aren't failing. The republicans don't want government to work."
2020-11-02 19:18:41,"China dealt with the epidemic properly and openly from the beginning.  The WHO also dealt with the epidemic properly and openly from the very beginning of January on learning of the pneumonia cases from China.  The United States was also informed by China of the pneumonia cases at the very beginning of January.

China sequenced the genetic code of the coronavirus by January 7 and gave the newly developed primers for detecting the virus to the WHO on January 10.  China
delivered the genetic code to the WHO and international researchers on January 11.

China has dealt with the viral epidemic properly and openly.  So too the WHO.  I am only grateful."
2020-11-02 18:56:08,"Is there any doubt that China is hiding things in all areas medicine trade, political? I wish our media paid more attention to this instead of the petty political fights and personal smears that dominate the every day news."
2020-11-02 19:13:36,"Contrary to Trump’s decision for the US to withdraw from W.H.O., we need to drastically increase funding for W.H.O., to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic in poor countries that are ill-equipped to deal with it.

We also need to get rid of Trump, whose perverse anti-competence has led to disaster.

President Biden can start the healing, both medically and politically.  In addition to working with other countries to defeat COVID worldwide, he should also create an international program to prevent the next pandemic from spreading.

VOTE BIDEN/HARRIS for the survival of America!"
2020-11-02 18:50:16,"Well, that is what you should expect when you politicize the health policies. Why would China or any other country for this matter allow the investigation if it is suspected that such investigation will be used to assign the blame?"
2020-11-02 17:02:40,"There's a very important reason why no one, even CIA can say virus is man made. 

Because that means anyone with knowledge and training could make the COVID. That is a terrorist's dream. The tools for generating the virus are commercially available. If anyone can make virus without proper facilities, it will be much worse than COVID-19. There will be 3-10 different COVID-20, 21s every year. humanity would grind to halt with unacceptable loss of life. 

Virus did come from lab, Wuhan isn't coincidence, of all places, why so many in Wuhan? I don't think it's intentional though"
2020-11-02 17:08:52,"Most of these zoonotic diseases come from China, so we need them to make the WHO relevant and efficient in doing their work. Unfortunately , China is a power hungry, childish, third world country being treated like a peace loving partner when in actuality, they love nothing more than to heap disease upon their allies and admit nothing. As long a China is tolerated, even lionized by WHO to bribe them for their partnership...the WHO will be a joke. But not as big a joke as our governments response to Covid."
2020-11-02 16:58:51,"Let US take charge and we will know (sorry, in that case, we have already known)."
2020-11-02 20:14:08,This seems to be a heated political piece not a cool analysis.
2020-11-02 18:40:35,"The most likely source of the virus is the leaky BSL-4 laboratory located in ... Wuhan, the epicenter.  The bat cave is over 1000km away.   Sure, the virus could have spread from the bat cave to Wuhan, but the Chinese cover up casts a lot of doubt on the 'natural spread' hypothesis.  Combined with the known weaknesses identified in State Department cables for biohazard security in the Wuhan BSL-4 lab, the more likely scenario is a viral escape.  Considering how many escapes of other viruses occur in the US biohazard labs (and are illegally covered up here), well, it is hardly surprising that the Chinese cover up a far more deadly escape and purge all data to prevent an investigation, should one actually occur.

Even worse, it appears that the US government may have, against standing rules, partly financed GOF work at the Wuhan BSL-4 lab.  Probably not a direct line to the escape, but the more virus work that is done, the more likely viral particles will escape-- worse If they are GOF, which presently isn't clear. 

The Chinese do have plausible deniability, supported by weak western ""scientists"" opining on carting infected animals 1000km and causing viral spread.  Collecting more circumstantial data by an impartial party might give us an idea of the true story, but good luck with that in China.   I hear Chinese scientists are THE  best and THE MOST perfect and would never bow to Xi's rubber hose threat vs. publishing the truth..."
2020-11-02 19:50:56,"Of course, the Chinese government could have simply shut down all international flights in and out of China."
2020-11-02 19:41:17,"By December 31, 2019, the cases of pneumonia detected in Wuhan had been reported to regional and national health authorities and news of the pneumonia cases was written about in an international Reuters article:

Chinese officials investigate cause of pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan
By Reuters

The WHO was informed by China, the US was informed by China.  The WHO in turn informed all countries about the pneumonia outbreak from early January.  China updated and made public information on the outbreak every single day from the beginning of January.

By January 7, China had sequenced the genetic code of the novel coronavirus responsible for the pneumonia outbreak.  What was done by China was open and international sharing of information was assured.

I am only grateful to China and in turn the WHO."
2020-11-02 19:11:17,The virus is free. H.K isn't.
2020-11-02 18:43:03,"Much as I hate to agree on anything with the deluded president, I am dumbfounded that anyone half ways aware of the tyranny-propaganda machine that has prevailed in Beijing for 70 years, would believe China about their culpability for the pandemic. WHO were utterly gutless and relieved to be manipulated."
2020-11-02 18:58:24,"As time goes on, I am ever more convinced that the US has smoking gun intelligence describing in great detail how this virus was modified in a Chinese laboratory (as part of legitimate ""gain of function "" research -- see the NIH website link below) and accidentally / intentionally let loose into the environment.  

If past practice holds -- and I am certain that it does -- only a very small group of administration officials have been briefed on this reporting.  Which is why it has not leaked.

The US must wait for a decent interval to pass before it can release this sensitive information.  I suspect that the time will come once a vaccine has been developed and global deaths from COVID are on a discernible decline.

Why wait, you ask?

The US has powerful reasons to preserve global political and economic stability at the moment.  Revealing what I believe to be the truth could lead to a diplomatic backlash against China and all that would entail from such a reaction.

2020-11-02 18:48:59,"We have no influence in WHO since our brilliant self proclaimed genus President with drew us from WHO. China has taken over, thanks to Trump."
2020-11-02 17:25:15,Breaking news: liars and butchers aren't being forthcoming about the reality on the ground. Why put out a wolf to guard the hen house?
2020-11-02 16:44:35,"The most obvious question that emerges from this article is this: What is the government of China hiding?

If the origins of the virus are not known by Chinese scientists, and the government of China is creating obstacles to international organizations such as the WHO to investigate the virus simply to save face, that is as damning an indictment of the Chinese government as it would be if the government knows the answer but is concealing it for some unknown reasons."
2020-11-02 20:46:10,This is an incredibly good piece of reporting and integrated into a very well-written piece. I congratulate the authors.
2020-11-02 20:20:41,"It is so obvious, as it has been since January, that the W.H.O., China, Trump, and virtually every world leader have been lying. According to the Bernstein tapes, Trump was fully cognizant of the dangers of the virus in January although he did not share the information with the American public - nor did his advisors. Nor did any other person in power. They should all be ousted from any form of power. All that notwithstanding, the search for an animal origin is irrelevant, if not futile. The real, unequivocal truth is the human animal is now the single biggest vector of the disease. Whether a bat, or a toad, was the initial source of the virus, those creatures lack the ability to reason out and control the spread of the virus. They lack the science and tools to overcome the spread. It's becoming increasingly obvious that mankind is no better. We are facing an extinction event here. One even worse and inevitable than climate change. Wake up humanity; before you too are irrelevant."
2020-11-02 20:19:33,Every step Trump has taken on the virus has been political and effort to fix blame instead of fixing the problem. The politicizing of the masks is probably the biggest mistake of a disastrous administration.
2020-11-02 21:46:04,Trump was correct all along that China CCP have not been transparent and cooperative and that they should be made accountable to the whole world.
2020-11-02 22:20:29,"If outcome suggests causality the Chinese were quite intentional in disseminating the virus to the West while protecting their own population and economy.
They allowed their infected citizens overseas as tourists and business men with Mooney in their pockets while shutting down internal travel in their own country.
Their infected citizens are analogous to the small pox infected blankets provided to native Americans by the advancing US government.
The Chinese economy is growing while every Western economy has tanked.
Now they are selling their vaccine to the highest bidder."
2020-11-02 22:30:31,"“It is difficult to do this work in a politically intoxicated environment,” Dr. Ryan, the organization’s emergency director, said.

It sounds to me as if the word ""intoxicated"" should be shortened to ""toxic.""

An illuminating piece.  Thank you."
2020-11-02 21:25:13,"Dr Ryan “It is difficult to do this work in a politically intoxicated environment”
This seems a bald statement of ""facts"" here.
There are always going to be problems investigating situations like these, because of blame being thrown around.
Any work on exotic, possible infections may be open to an accidental slip-up no matter how much bio care is taken. 
I'm not sure many countries would actually be more open initially, especially given today's blame culture.

The ""Q annon type"" conspiracies seem unlikely - as all countries, including China depends on world trade going as smoothly as possible. 
Only some Theocratic Death cult would actively take risks deliberately.
  
All working together, however imperfectly seems the best way forward - including reforms of more than the WHO."
2020-11-02 22:21:42,China has really fueled conspiracies by making it difficult for an international team in the field to figure out what happened. But can we blame them?  We can't even do contact-tracing in our own White House. Everyone in power has an agenda and none of it is pointed towards the truth.
2020-11-02 22:21:08,"Why people still take China's word for the virus? After more than 10 months, they had already changed all the narratives, destroyed all evidences that might against them, silenced all noise."
2020-11-02 21:46:49,Can't do it myself but it must be a nice feeling for many people to have a country that can be blamed for everything bad in the world.
2020-11-02 23:02:17,"When it comes to China, don’t trust, and verify. Then verify again, and be skeptical."
2020-11-02 22:23:03,"Politics aside how is it possible, in 2020 (not 1420) that with bodies piling up in the streets of Wuhan the Chinese government allowed flights to go from Wuhan to Western Europe and the USA but banned flights within China and quarantined a major city with its military but didn't tell the WHO or the world? How? How is that not a crime against humanity? How is it possible in 2020 that when people who were contracting covid in Chinese cities but had never traveled to Wuhan or eaten bats anywhere that human to human transmission was not publicized to the world? Human to human transmission was a game changer. Any first year medical student would know that."
2020-11-02 21:28:33,Yet again we have an international organization which is incompetent and anti-American. This is outrageous and as much as I hate to admit it I agree with Trump's decision to pull out.I just hope we don't rejoin at a later date because that only reinforces the bad behavior.
2020-11-02 23:06:32,"We needed the human intelligence of having our own people there reporting to the National Security Council. Trump killed it and pulled them back. 

We need then to react to that intel. Trump ignored it and lied to the American people about it.

Enough said."
2020-11-02 23:22:25,"""Scientists and intelligence officials say there is no evidence for such a theory, but some of Mr. Trump’s closest allies gave it credence."" Do you find this convincing? Would you kindly show who these ""scientist"" and ""intelligence officials"" are, what their credentials are, and how they arrived at this conclusion? So far the only information I have seen is that they found the sequences ~85% similar which is virtually meaningless. I'm the most progressive person I know and I certainly am not convinced by any of these statements and I have seen no supporting evidence at all. I've done some genetic engineering and it only requires a few strategic base changes. It would be very helpful to see the evidence that led to the conclusion that the virus is not genetically altered/engineered. No one in the field uses the term ""man made"". The funding sources of the scientists (e.g. Lipkin) you quote should be revealed as well."
2020-11-02 22:05:08,When you look at the different graphs it show how our food industry along with the cigarette industry have made our citizens so weak that we are at the mercy of this virus and the next.
2020-11-02 23:26:53,"""We are sorry.""

China never said it.
Who never said it.
US officials never said it.

It doesn't matter what the rabbit hole investigation finds, and it doesn't matter how WHO changes, and a change in  leadership here in the states means nothing--- unless someone finally takes responsibility for their role in this mess.


Good article by the way, wish it had come , like 3 months earlier, but keep them coming."
2020-11-02 22:04:57,"This politicalization, i.e. distortion, of crucial facts is exactly what always happens when dictators, like China's Xi, and dictator wannabes, like Donald Trump, deal with any issue that will reflect on them personally.  Their attempts to protect themselves politically cost hundreds of thousands of citizens' lives.  In China, with its Communist party dictatorship, one is not surprised at this behavior.  But here?  It is simply amazing that the Americans who vote for Trump do not think character matters:  If a politician establishes himself as a self-centered liar, then he or she has zero credibility and is unable to communicate or organize or lead when it really counts.  And we end up with avoidable disasters like this COVID death march."
2020-11-02 21:51:39,"No one knows the origins of the virus. It was already in Brazil in November 2019. The waste water confirms that. I suspect that it originated through a natural mutation in Southern China or Southeast Asia. These are the endemic areas of the horseshoe bat. The archeological scientific evidence of that is the number of fatalities in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Southern China and Vietnam are almost nil. In fact, Laos and Cambodia has no fatalities from Covid-19. This suggest that many people have been infected with a similar virus and it mutated. This is the most likely explanation. The WHO or whoever will have their final report in 5 yrs or so. This is an acquired infection. Hence the immunity is not confer on the Asians that grew in other areas"
2020-11-02 23:25:05,"At this point it doesn’t matter what happened with China. Trump our President failed to protect the people. We were not prepared as country with masks and medical equipment. If Masks had been implemented the moment this was becoming an issue in China we wouldn’t have been in this quandary. It could have come from Russia, it doesn’t matter we were not prepared as a country and now it’s spread all over. The utter lies about this turning the corner for political gain are just so wrong. 

Stop the madness and vote Biden in."
2020-11-02 22:07:09,"Only 20 cases daily in China, what do they know that we don't, and why don't they share what they know"
2020-11-02 22:32:55,"Politics aside how in 2020 (not 1420) when bodies were piling up in the streets of Wuhan (literally!) did this not get reported to the WHO instantly and the world? How, in 2020 did, at that very moment, did Chinese officials allow 747s to fly from Wuhan to Europe and the USA and thence the world but ban all flights within China but not tell the world? How in 2020 did Chinese not report to the world that people were dying in cities outside the city they surrounded who had never traveled to Wuhan or eaten a bat? Any first year medical student would know that establishes human to human transmission and is a game changer. But this is no game."
2020-11-02 23:10:31,But Trump tweeted just last week that COVID-19 was over and going away.

2020-11-03 02:13:50,"While Americans are dropping like flies dying from covid-19, counting 231,493 so far according to Johns Hopkins, it boggles the mind that Western Media is still hung up on a political witch hunt, not so much for the source of the disease that broke out in Wuhan, but how to blame China.

There is a very famous teaching of the Buddha called the ""Parable of the Poisoned Arrow"". It goes like this:

""...It's just as if a man were wounded with an arrow thickly smeared with poison. His friends & companions, kinsmen & relatives would provide him with a surgeon, and the man would say, 'I won't have this arrow removed until I know whether the man who wounded me was a noble warrior, a priest, a merchant, or a worker ... whether he was tall, medium, or short... whether the bow was a long bow or a crossbow... whether the shaft was wild or cultivated... whether the feathers of the shaft were those of a vulture, a stork, a hawk, a peacock, or another bird... (it went on & on)... ' The man would die and those things would still remain unknown to him. 

Over 2,500 years later, the teaching is still ignored."
2020-11-03 03:17:16,"The saga of WHO and COVID is the repetition of Communist promise to the world - propaganda and falsehood. China is not interested to find the truth but to hide the truth. Even if WHO is allowed to go to China and try to find the origin of the virus, it is too late and the falsification of records by CPP. I doubt we will ever know the truth and WHO and China have lost the credibility to the world."
2020-11-03 03:18:01,"If you ever read outside the media propaganda,which is even worse than the Chinese reports,if that is possible ,you will discover smatterings of the truth.The fact is research has proven the markets were not the source although strains exist there the complications of the exact structure of the covid 19 originated in the lab and were released by accident.In there is the reason for secrecy and coverups because fault and blame are imminent to be held.Then the deeper texts of US involvement in the financing and the folks from the last administration who were and still are involved in the Wuhan lab ect ect."
2020-11-03 03:29:36,"I find it funny that commenters here seem to think that it doesnt matter what caused Covid and then go on to praise a dictatorship for doing what dictatorships are good at, i.e. control their people and restrict civil rights. I dont care if dictatorships, especially one that tries to turn every one of their people Han, kills doctors, teaches that being gay is a mental disease, and executes the most people of any nation, are good at containing the virus. I still dont want to live under one. The origins of this virus have been obfuscated by China and the WHO. The WHO has lost all legitamacy. The United States may have messed up big, but the buck stops with the nation that allowed international flights out of their country when they knew how dangerous the virus that their policies created was and had already locked Wuhan down. Intead, they made a concious decision to infect the world. Chinas policies directly led to the world we live in today."

It is unacceptable that the world health organization is being partially transparent when it comes to a global pandemic that has impacted so many families around the world. 8 months later and countries are still in states of emergency, economic disparity is rampant. We need to continue urging WHO to investigate the origins of the virus because information is power and we need to avoid repeating this situation. And we need to put global pressure on China to let WHO investigate accordingly and for WHO to disclose their negotiated terms with China."

It did the same thing with SARS but eventually allowed investigators in. I wonder why the Times waited until election day for this story, because it backs up Trump more than it slams him though the Times is getting in its digs.  Everyone in the world has a right to be mistrustful of China given its failures to be forthcoming and WHO for going along with it. That flies in the face of what WHO is supposed to be about."
2020-11-03 16:13:13,Why would the White House be interested in the scientific method when it often relies exclusively on the president’s gut?
2020-11-03 16:27:56,"When the White House was approached about doing genomic testing of the president's Covid infection and others around him, the White House declined saying the president's illness was a national security matter and not for prying eyes. (Wa Post).

This national security cover was applied at the beginning of the Covid outbreak way back in January, according to Reuters.

A national epidemiological emergency should not be covered up in fake national security claims unless the President and his people are trying to hide something.

Ultimately, the only way we the people and the good scientists trying to understand the SARS Cov2 outbreak will learn of the origins will come from genomic testing of the virus by way of mutational changes; it should be possible to track back to the source, which might end up being a blank wall. Sadly, even forensic genomic tracking remains shrouded in a cover up. 
Why?

The Chinese are opaque on questions of the origins; and the president and his people prevented scientists from knowing the course of the virus by failing to track the disease when it first landed on the continent. And the Chinese and Americans have collaborated on doing corona virus research; track the patents; there is a huge back story.

 End the secrecy; end the national security charade; let's get to the bottom of this novel virus."
2020-11-03 14:53:08,"Article shows that it's difficult to identify how it spread to these two NY Times reporters.  
But one of the most disturbing sentences in the article with no further explanation is the following:""Both journalists wore masks.""   Granted they were at different events.  Obviously the masks did not prevent infection.  In both cases there are still too many questions on ""how"" the transmission happened if indeed it came from 'the broader White House outbreak ( which the writers admit).  
While wearing masks might be the best method of trying to limit the spread now, it doesn't always work.  For example, if the transmission is largely through the spread of airborne particles and you are wearing a mask, can your eyes (unprotected ) be the point of contact?  Or when you take off your mask if the ends of the mask are infected you need to throw away the mask and scrub your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water and hope for the best. At least  until an effective vaccine is ready next year."

And by testing the two journalists we have learned only that they were infected by a relatively rare COVID strain? This sure seems like a lot of time and money spent for very little gain. Maybe I’m missing What is the point of this article except to bash the Trump administration for not doing their own genomic testing of the outbreak? And such testing would tell us what, exactly? And by testing the two journalists we have learned only that they were infected by a relatively rare COVID strain? This sure seems like a lot of time and money expended for very little gain. Am I missing something here?"
2020-11-03 17:35:02,"Sunday's NY Times (Nov. 1, 2020) has a front page article titled: ""How Are Americans Catching the Virus? Increasingly, 'They Have No Idea;'"" by Sarah Mervosh and Lucy Tomkins that is pertinent to this discussion. It cites Crystal Watson, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who states that coronavirus  tracking becomes difficult when the virus spreads to more than 10 cases per 100,000 people a day.  

For the US, with a population of about 328 million people, this would amount to a spread of about 32,800 cases per day; estimated as follows:
[(10/100,000     x     328,000,000) = 32,800 cases per day].

On Friday, Oct. 30, 2020 the Times cites a national spread of 99,155 new cases in this article.

2020-11-03 17:12:58,"If Trump is booted out, the entire White House complex will need to be leveled and rebuilt, for public health reasons. Seriously. Can’t imagine being the Biden family having to move in after the Trumps trashed everything so badly, just by their very presence."
2020-11-03 17:15:41,"Oh good grief what's next ? This is the only political virus I have  ever heard o, and it can morph into whatever it needs to scare the living daylights out of trusting people that still have a shred of trust in what we are spoon fed. First the virus thrived in cool damp places. Then in mid-July and into August it was rampaging through Florida of all places. i defy you to show me a dank damp cool place in Florida during these months. The mask touting Doctor is at a baseball game yelling over the noise 6 inches from his pals face with no mask on his face , no one saw that I expect. Now the magical virus can affect the genetics of who now !! I would be in tears laughing if it were a joke , but instead I am saddened that they think we are so stupid we believe it and worse some actually do ! If it we mentioned even once in the hundreds of millions of trillions of people that had it then well , maybe. Instead nope only the do all, cause all , fall guy with all the fingers pointing Trump !! Oh give me a break for God's sake. A virus can not be steered to where it is needed to plant seeds of doubt in peoples heads. I wish the powers that be would stop insulting the intelligence of others.  As a sidebar who exactly are ""The Administration"" and the studies that reveal ! Also these studies who performed them? Why were these ""studies"" never brought up before. Wait I know it wasn't Trump to caused every bad thing in my life guy."
2020-11-03 16:53:46,"Confused- the two journalists wore masks and got infected? 

So does that mean that wearing masks doesn’t work?"
2020-11-03 17:00:51,"The White House likely fears  revelation Trump tested positive before the first debate and knew he was positive when he traveled to a later fundraiser. 

That’s the national security consideration at work. 

He just couldn’t resist his impulses."
2020-11-03 18:29:01,I love it when articles show the powerful application of science to real world issues.
2020-11-03 20:24:04,you can run but you cannot hide says the scientist.good work.
2020-11-03 22:35:06,This is the first venue that lets me say that I have yet to see any proof that T himself had the virus.
2020-11-03 23:22:53,"Isn’t it strange how boundless Trump’s energy was/ is post his purportedly Covid infection?  The UK’s a Prince William, in his 30s,  confessed to have been infected and how much difficulty he had breathing.   But not the septuagenarian Trump.   The amount of energy he used during his recent his multi-state, same-day campaign rallies aren’t normal activities for someone felled by the virus.   Most survivor testimonials are that it drains the body of all energy.  Even U.K. PM Boris Johnson took a couple of weeks to recover, and he’s much younger than Trump.  The 50 yr. old, gazelle, Melania, in her sky high spike heels, is another mystery wrapped in designer clothes."
2020-11-03 16:04:49,They just don't care. Period. An irresponsible sociopathic administration that needs to be tossed to the curb today.
