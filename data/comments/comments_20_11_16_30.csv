2020-11-30 17:32,"15 years ago I ceased construction work, and decreased my vitamin C intake from 3grams daily, to 1000mg. I immediately exhibited signs of cardiovascular disease, and also noted that sometimes (maybe once a week) when i rinsed my mouth at a sink, that the rinsewater was tinged pink.

8 years ago i learned that both symptoms were indicative of 
scurvy (vitamin C deficiency).

In primary school i was instructed that vitamin B is good for 'teeth and gums'.  Eight years ago i observed that a slightly loose tooth firmed up immediately upon taking some B vitamins.

When i got covid last winter/spring, my gums bled on a couple occasions.

Sooo:
Vitamin C very good for gums/bleeding gums, soft tissue.
Vitamin B great for loose teeth.

Vitamin B also seems to change the red skin tan back to brown/tan among imbibers."
2020-11-30 17:47,"It blows my mind that dental and vision care are not treated as medical care and are not covered my Medicare or the ACA. Like eating and seeing are optional.

Remember to wear your mask, kiddos. It's been a rough ride."
2020-11-30 19:39,"What,￼ the teeth in my mouth￼? I still got a set of good chompers in the front of my mouth but the molars are another story; two of the main ones have broken off, long long ago￼, The others are pretty ugly,with cavity fillings and in fact I’ve had the front eyeteeth removed when I was young and the gap still hasn’t filled quite yet but I have to find out how to chew Meats and things without biting the inside of my cheek with the sharp points that exist now so eating is kind of painful maybe I should get my teeth fixed (yeah $50,000 per tooth￼￼), Or quit eating which would solve my high blood sugar problem."
2020-11-30 21:16,consider the experience of patients post-interferon treatment. super high levels of inflammation seem to destroy teeth (along with whichever virus the body is trying to combat)
2020-11-30 21:28,"While I respect Dr. Li's call for openness to new presentations of disease after COVID, it has been my prior experience that it takes years, if not decades of periodontal disease and altered angiogenesis in a patient's gums to outright lose a tooth. It seems to me to be highly unlikely that COVID is to be implicated as the primary reason this article's subject has lost her tooth especially given her prior history of smoking. It is a common consequence of chronic smoking that a patient develops gum disease which, in it's advanced stages, presents with spontaneous tooth exfoliation. 

Of course this is my professional observation/opinion which is the lowest form of evidence and I would happily change my mind in the face of peer reviewed science."
2020-11-30 17:40,"Perhaps it's because so few went to the dentist after being frightened by hysterical reporting where even today ""cases"" are  reported as if they have any significant relevance to hospitalizations/deaths.  The lack of being healthy is an American trademark and a significant reason for so much ill effect among a mentally and physically diseased people."
2020-11-30 18:50,Yikes. This should make folks want to to wear masks!
2020-11-30 21:15,Are the long haulers still sick with Covid? Can they still pass it on to others? If not is it simply the body’s defense mechanism reacting to something no longer present? I’m not sure that I’ve seen the answer to this anywhere.
2020-11-30 20:07,"As a dentist I am very concerned about the misleading claims in this article.  While there is a chance that Covid 19 could contribute to dental problems it is false to say that it can cause tooth loss.  For a tooth to ""fall out"" it would require complete loss of the alveolar bone around the root of the tooth.  It would take many years of severe periodontal disease for this amount of bone loss to occur.  The ""evidence"" presented here is all anecdotal and in Ms. Khemili's case it was even noted that her dentist ""found that her gums were not infected but she had significant bone loss from when she used to smoke.""  

I fear this is another alarmist article that is light on scientific evidence."
2020-12-01 0:25,"Covid.  The gift that keeps on giving.  What else will we see in recovered patients 1, 5 ,10 years out?"
2020-12-01 2:47,"It might relate to the vitamin D processing in our body. The massive quarantine in this pandemic may have ruined our vitamin D consumption and lack of the sun light exposure.
Vitamin D is good for bones and it needs sunlight to process it."
2020-12-01 2:19,"As if I needed another reason to isolate until there's a vaccine available. Thank you, NYTimes."
2020-12-01 4:28,"I find it so interesting that some can admit that we are facing a new virus the world is continually collecting data on, yet will disregard possibly unusual conditions like teeth falling out. Yes, Ms. Khemili had years of smoking to account for, but what about the 12 yr old boy? Worth keeping an eye on before calling this fake scientific news. 

We are not even 1 yr in, and we should be tracking long haulers and those who contracted covid early on. But the system is so overwhelmed that we can barely spare a doctor to keep reg tabs on *recovered* patients. There could be more cases, but as someone here said, dental costs are high, peoples' incomes / savings are low. We could have more cases and we just don't know it. Let's share the early data and findings with the public so that more can see/read about it, and maybe come out."
2020-11-30 15:19,"I had the virus in mid March. I had the antibody test a month after being sick ( April 13) as that was the earliest availability of the test here in Florida. I tested positive for one antibody (IgR) which proved I had had the virus and tested positive for the second antibody (IgM)  which meant that a MONTH after I was sick I was still shedding virus so still considered contagious. My doctor told me to quarantine for two more weeks. After that I was tested with a PCR test and was virus free - so no longer considered contagious. I wouldn’t rush to conclude people aren’t contagious after a short period of time. Since no conclusive follow up is being done, assuming someone to be contagion free or more contagious prior can’t be safely verified. It took the State of Florida until May 20 to follow up with me on my case which by law was reported in March. Slow and poor reporting affects everything."
2020-11-30 15:38,"Something that doesn’t seem to be mentioned enough, but has been done in Europe for decades is — opening windows occasionally and just exchanging air. This is done in bedrooms in Germany most mornings when the down comforters are aired out there as well.

Cheap and inexpensive way to reduce room/bldg viral load, just open the windows a few times a day."
2020-11-30 15:47,"Throughout this pandemic, we've heard complaints about people without expertise in infectious diseases pontificating about it.  Now the shoe is on the other foot: in this article, we have at least two infectious/virology experts voicing uninformed opinions about human psychology and behavior - whether people would be more likely to comply with a shorter period. Such opinions are entirely outside their area of expertise. No actual evidence was offered in support of those opinions."
2020-11-30 15:48,"A couple of questions are raised by this article and those are 1.  Just how virulent is the viral load that either a non-symptomatic or symptomatic person sheds?  I realize that is difficult to measure and must depend on an individual's specific markers for this. Not to mention one's own propensity to be vulnerable to infection. 

 For example, I have read that a small number of people are the ""cause"" of most of the spreading of the virus (i.e. the ""superspreaders"") (the proportion might be the familiar 80/20 but I'm not sure.)  

Also, this statement raises question 2: Yet patients may carry genetic fragments from the virus in their noses and throats for an average of 17 days, and, in some cases, for up to three months.  

But these genetic fragments aren't indicative of the level of transmissibility, are they?  An analogy I read was that of finding a murderer's fingerprints at the scene of the crime.  The murderer had been there but was now gone and not ""still"" committing murder.   

@MaryAnn seemed to have been caught up in the early days of her medical advisors' limited knowledge  of the coronavirus and much has been learned since March/April/May.  

I'd be interested to read if anyone out there can add to this article and answer my questions, however speculatively."
2020-11-30 16:19,"I would take this advice with big grains of salt. My mom started having symptoms on November 15 and my dad a few days later. Both were tested 10 days later, on November 25, and both were positive. They are not hospitalized but aren't really on an upswing."
2020-11-30 17:06,"If your livelihood depends on being physically present at your workplace, then the difference of a few days in voluntary adherence to a guideline will not make much difference. It's hard to envision someone saying ""I can stay home for 5 days but not 10 or 14."" If they are too sick to work, they'll stay home. If they are not too sick to work, they'll go to work. As long as those guidelines are voluntary, it hardly matters what the length of time may be. The good news seems to be that, by the time you feel well enough to go back to work, your shedding of virus has greatly diminished. To achieve perfect control, you'd have to make isolation mandatory, with enforcement."
2020-11-30 17:22,"This Wuhan pandemonium has generated a pandemic of information that is often contradictory and offered in such fashion as to draw differing conclusions.

This one is no exception.

I think folks who think they have caught Wuhan - on their own should isolate themselves as much and as long as possible.

And if you cannot isolate yourself for whatever the reason - should take precautions such as masks, warning others of your infection - as much as possible.

We are humans who were bred to live in a society and not animals of wild kingdom who are genetically inclined to live by themselves or at least show a territorial ambitions so others not invade.

Isolation for many is a luxury."
2020-11-30 20:04,"I know of a handful of studies that show virus culture positivity (this is correlated with infectivity) beyond 9 days after symptom onset - out to 12 or 15.  The Cevik review, while very nice, is a little old and does not take into account these new studies. If people are still shedding virus that can grow in culture out to 9 or 12 days, why on earth would we send those people out into society after 5 days?  Follow the science."
2020-11-30 21:07,"Just to clarify that Germany never planned to reduce quarantine to 5 days. The idea for this was an additional quarantine for all people that were part of a potential super spreader event. Say Patient 1 tests positive and then says that they were at choir practice 5 days earlier. As this is a typical setting for a super spreader event and it is likely that Patient 1 was infected there, all participants of the choir practice would be sent immediately into a 5-day quarantine/quasi-isolation as the probability that they got infected is high. After the 5 days, they would be tested and released if all tests are negative.

This was never implemented until last week when this rule started being applied to school classes. I.e., if there is one positive pupil, the whole class would be sent to a 5-day quarantine and will be tested at the end using a rapid antigen test. Everybody that is negative has to return to school; everybody testing positive extends quarantine to 14 days."
2020-11-30 22:07,If I understood this correctly Isolation occurs too late in most countries.  That explains some of the chaos seen in the US.  Only immediate test and trace would have slowed the transmission explosion.  That might explain why the countries that had setup test and trace during SARS and MERS were able to contain the viral cascade
2020-11-30 22:17,"Our president had COVID, quarantined a while under the advice of our top doctors, and then spread the virus to countless others once he was given the clear.

Enough with the articles of risk assessment, how to fly safely, which resorts to fly off to for skiing, etc.  Stay home, quit getting together with folks you don't live with, and maybe just maybe we can quit leading the world in most cases/deaths.  

But, no one is going to listen and there will be even more travel for Christmas and come Easter it will take a miracle if our hospitals have not collapsed.  

Before the virus ever hit our shores, in a rush to be first in all things media, our journalists had taught us all that this virus hit old obese diabetics who smoke and eat too much salt.  That is why our Ivy League students went on Spring Break like nothing was going on.  And now?  You can't put the genie back in the bottle.  Everyone has read every article about odds, numbers, risk assessment, etc.  And everyone considers themselves an expert about a virus that didn't exist about a year ago.  Its novel, as in new, not on Oprah's Book list.  No one is an expert on this one.  Stay home.  Had we done that, we would be like China which looks pretty normal compared to us.  Or New Zealand."
2020-11-30 20:06,"What strikes me about the article is one word in the headline itself - “most”.  Aside from the fact that in the article itself there are numerous opinions about what numerous studies show, most of the people who end up getting Covid-19 after being exposed to those who are still shedding only a bit (!) won’t care about the line between most and, say, virtually none."
2020-12-01 2:09,"It’s all a guess. Experts are just making their best guess that they can. I tested positive in April. I had a headache as a first symptom but didn’t recognize it as the virus until I developed a fever 3 days later. I became very sick and developed pneumonia but never entered the hospital. My wife shared a bed and bathroom with me for those three days of a headache and I ate at kitchen table with my 3 children. No one at home was infected. No one else had any symptoms and all at home tested negative and tested negative for antibodies. At work my secretary was in close contacted including using my phone and computer.....never any symptoms, had a negative test and negative for antibodies. Not sure to make of it all."
2020-12-01 1:52,"I think this news report may be inaccurate. My understanding from other news sources is that CDC is considering shortening the quarantine period following exposure, not the isolation period following illness onset. This is due to most people becoming ill within 5 days following exposure to COVID. So you could end quarantine early if you took and received a negative test result around 1 week following exposure, because chances of you becoming newly sick after that point are low. The isolation period wouldn’t be shortened because infectious viral shedding occurs for roughly 10 days after infection onset. It’s only beyond 10 days that the detectable virus is non-culturable."
2020-12-02 15:20,"An important piece. I had not thought about the damage labeling front line workers as ""hero's"" could do with respect to their ability to be vulnerable, and hope any reading this will feel more comfortable knowing they are not alone. 

I've been thinking lately that people ought to have to explain their holiday travel plans to a nurse or doctor. It might not change any itineraries, but at least it would force a moment of reflection on the reality of this virus."
2020-12-02 15:33,My hospital has an extreme shortage of critical care nurses and RTs who are now being offered travel contracts (10k/ week). Some are leaving and taking the money to work in NY and ND. It’s a real problem— why on earth weren’t we scaling up critical care staff and training 6 months ago?
2020-12-02 15:43,"Why aren’t we howling anymore to honor front line workers?  If anything, things are worse now and the doctors and nurses have been at it now for almost 9 months.  They deserve this small token of appreciation."
2020-12-02 16:25,"God bless them. They are heroes. To a person. How many of us could cope with what they see every day? When this is finally over, I expect most of them to quit. However motivated they may be, it's just too much to expect them to cope after what they have experienced.  And we will be, my friends, without our much needed first-line hospital workers. Mark my words."
2020-12-02 16:32,"Hats off to the health care workers. 

We initially ‘shut down’ to prevent exactly this - overwhelming the health care workers and system. Unfortunately, while some places played by the rules, many others made it a political game.  Now we are all going to pay a big price."
2020-12-02 16:37,"This section struck me: ""Many state medical boards still ask intrusive questions about physicians’ history of mental health diagnoses or treatments in applications to renew a license — a disincentive to many doctors who might otherwise seek professional help."" This structural impediment to health care professionals seeking mental health care needs to be changed immediately. Seeking mental health care should be a sign of strength, not weakness."
2020-12-02 16:39,Thank you for this story. We are asking too much of our healthcare workers—at all levels— and need concentrate efforts on how to support them.
2020-12-02 16:43,"Thank you for this moving piece.  As a front line worker, I can attest to the overwhelming fatigue.  The sad part, is that the disinformation occurring in midwestern and western states needs to STOP! I want to scream every time I see someone disrespecting me without a mask on. Friends, coworkers, neighbors have either died or are battling long-haul symptoms.  The nurses are fed up! And working alongside a travel nurse making triple my salary is demoralizing. Keep these stories front page, NYT."
2020-12-02 17:02,A stark reminder of the cost being paid to combat this virus. Doctors and nurses have gone so far beyond what any reasonable person could expect of them. That doesn't mean they can save everyone - as much as they might wish it did. I'm ashamed that so much of our country has decided to be done fighting the virus. History will remember this year both for the incredible sacrifices made by some and for the many others who refused to be inconvenienced no matter the cost to their friends and neighbors.
2020-12-02 16:40,"Get the House and Senate into volunteer then watch them squirm.
As a RN I am so disappointed and sad it’s sometimes overwhelming."
2020-12-02 15:30,"I’m an ED doc. We have a shortage of critical care nurses, physicians, and RYS. Yesterday I saw some
NYT commenters suggesting older people should get covid vaccines before healthcare workers (I’m 45). I resolved, if this happens, to leave the ED for a less risky, easier, clinical job."
2020-12-02 15:20,"Behold our nation. Lazy, soft people who cannot rise to face a national crisis. People who give up and ignore mass casualties. People who won't even vaccinate in-custody immigrant children against influenza; causing needless death. People who ignore, and kill, for convenience and their own selfish freedom. 

And all led by one man, who sues to ignore all the Black votes in Detroit. 

Over 70 million of us don't give a damn about anyone but ourselves. The people with money who vote for this are the worst. Colossally selfish. Beyond some of the worst abominations in history."
2020-12-02 17:18,My wife was a VA Physician before Alzheimer's struck.  Now she is in  a facility.  I married her when she was a medical student.   You are all heroes.
2020-12-02 15:49,"My heart goes out to all healthcare workers. It pains me that so many people refused to take the virus seriously and take the simple precaution and minor inconveniences that would have helped limit the impact and spread on this virus. They don't see how the devastation their selfish decisions has on others. Particularly healthcare workers. I can't even begin to image the horrors you've experienced. I wish there were a magic wand I could wave to make this all go away. All I can do is thank you for your continued care and service. You may not be comfortable with the title of ""hero"" but you are that to many. Even in the cases of death, you are there trying,  comforting & just being present when family members cannot. You are making a difference & we are grateful beyond words. 

I sincerely hope that once the pandemic starts to show in our rear mirror that Biden sets up a day when we acknowledge healthcare and other workers for their efforts on our behalf, the sacrifices they have made, and the unimaginable horrors they have seen but not let deter them from their vocations. In the meantime, perhaps we can do a small gesture by literally ringing in the New Year by having people across America/the World ring a bell(s) at midnight on Jan 31st (in your time zone) to say Thank You and We Care. What do others think? An acknowledgement, thank you & expression of Hope.

God bless you all. May he protect you and your families & give you the health and strength to carry on."
2020-12-02 18:44,This should be required reading for all the conspiracy theorists. It might not change any minds but it should at least inform them that some people are expending huge amounts of energy on something that doesn’t exist / is no worse than flu / is a plot by Bill Gates and/or George Soros etc.
2020-12-02 19:16,"Nearly forty years ago, I was hired to do a statistical analysis of data from a questionnaire sent to nurses with their state license renewal applications. The goal of the questionnaire was to determine why there was a shortage of trained nurses. A factor analysis revealed that the major factors were low pay, lack of respect from medical and hospital management superiors, and lack of control over their schedules, factors which caused many to eventually leave the field.
How were these findings used?
The ""experts"" recommended that nurses be offered better parking places at night and that a bulletin board be set up to advertise apartments for rent nearby the hospitals, two factors that were of marginal significance, at best.
The state was the only deadbeat client I ever had, by the way. It took well over six months for me to get paid.
So, forty years later, have things improved for nurses?
Obviously not, but the stock market does not seem to mind.
Government is on the case, though..."
2020-12-02 20:26,"Thank you Katherine for bringing this thoughtful essay to light. The medical profession has done such an excellent job protecting and caring for others, all the while trying to care for family. The burden is tremendous. I thank them from the knees of my heart. So much time has lapsed, countless deaths and still no mask mandate on federal level, it is criminal to subject and abuse our healthcare providers in this manner."
2020-12-02 20:36,"It’s been a hard year for my millennial age children - military doctor, civilian nurses, and a police officer in a big city. All front line, and parents of young children.  The absolutely only reason for us old people to go en masse to the head of the vaccine queue is if this eases pressure on the health care system. This reminds me of the ethics debates we had in university - what is the greater good. The debate isn’t hypothetical now."
2020-12-02 18:13,So why haven't plans been made to increase the number of health care workers? There are certainly plenty of unemployed looking for work and training.  The U.S. military can train paramedics in a few months - why isn't their expertise called on? What about those doctors who consider themselves as specialists too good to treat ordinary patients? Maybe what is needed is not clapping but a thorough revaluation of the system.
2020-12-02 21:20,"This is the sad but necessary answer to those who deny, those who mock, those who flout, those who deny, those who lament their loss of liberty.  
This is real for the individuals in this article, these doctors, PAs, nurses, EMTs, hospital workers (including unit clerks, housekeepers, and food service staff).  
When you, the flouters/deniers/liberty lamenters, declare that your freedom from the tyranny of masks is at risk when because public health officials are on power kicks (when in reality, they are doing their jobs), you put these individuals at risk.  
How selfish of you.  
How myopic of you.  
How narcissistic of you.
(You are better than that. aren't you?)
Share this article, not because these individuals are heros, but because they are moms and dads and siblings.  And they deserve acknowledgment that this is real and this is hard."

2020-12-02 19:33,"Some time ago, some deluded (and armed!) person drove for hours to investigate a supposed paedophile ring operating out of a pizza restaurant. Meanwhile covid deniers could probably drive a short distance to the local hospital to test their views that this is all a hoax. 
But given that I have read that some die of covid while denying it,..shaking my head."
2020-12-02 23:21,"I have talked about this ad nauseum to my sister. I am a retired nurse, albeit through getting hit by a car 25 yrs ago. I am on SSD.  after the accident (i was crossing the street at 12 noon)i had a private disability that only paid 750 dollars a month.  in ten yrs i had 34 surgeries and those were just related to fixing my leg which was fractured; which then affected my gait. finally when i came back i went to only four days a week. finally after ten yrs i had to apply for SSD. that was in 2002 when i finally filled out my departure papers.  
when i left then the average age of a nurse was 42.  it is now closer to 48. many nurses are or have left the profession for traveling nurses or agency nurses which are paid way more than regular ICU nurses or floor nurses. many long term care nurses are in fact LPNs and aides.  they usually have only one RN.  and the night shift forget it.
I worked in the OR a little over 19 yrs. many hospitals are laying off nurses who work in outpatient clinics such as GI, surgicenters and plastic surgery centers.  I unfortunately have developed too many health problems as a result of the accident.  this country has never addressed this problem of the shortage of nurses especially those who are trained in specialties. I feel for these nurses and cry every night for them."
2020-12-03 0:35,"Sometimes I wonder if the people caught attending mass events should be entered into database that alerts facilities not to accept them if they turn out to be COVID-19+. I know that sounds heartless and would likely not be feasible but it seems like people who continue to flout laws should be punished accordingly. 

Also for people who say that others who  wear masks because they're afraid of COVID-19: they should consider that the person wearing the mask might be COVID-19+ already and they're PROTECTING you.  I'm a healthcare worker who wears a mask regularly and I've had a few maskless people approach me outside work, mostly accidentally. Occasionally, I'll them to back off because *I* -- not them -- might be infected."
2020-12-03 0:38,"Two days ago, I went to pick up food curbside, at a small local grocery store, where my son works.
Our State now has a mandate , for masks to be worn in all business. I watched a careless, amoral your man, jump out of his truck (left running) to go into the store, not wearing a mask. Later he came out again, still no mask on.

I was going to tell him, that masks ARE required inside, with a sign on the store's door, and his careless, indifferent behavior is endangering the life of my son. 
But I would probably been punched in the face. 

So sad, that these Health Care workers, end up shouldering the burden, of caring for these indifferent citizens, who don't believe in wearing masks, social distancing, or science."

2020-12-03 0:43,When I read stories like this I am struck again by the profound evil your president has perpetrated on his country and the shocking dereliction of duty by the Republicans who have empowered him.
2020-12-03 0:35,"It is heartbreaking to hear these stories of dedicated physicians, nurses, and others.  But, to be brutally honest, selflessness and sympathy is not a political or survival strategy in 2020 pandemic America.

After 9 months you should recognize that you are being exploited.  By the hospital and other corporations you work for.  By politicians and your fellow Americans, who have demonstrated over and over they simply do not care about you and your families, other than to be there to service them when they get sick after going to the bar, a motorcycle rally, or other superspreading event.

It is past time for emergency personnel to get over their ""selfless"" and dedicated"" self-image -- that is not going to save you and your family.  We are heading into the worst of it, and you have a unique skill set in a pandemic that can be leveraged to curtail this spiral of destruction.  By giving an ultimatum, threatening job action in those states, cities, counties, etc. that are not taking sufficient action to protect you."
2020-12-03 1:54,"I am a physician. I do not work in the ICU or ED, but am exposed to many patients daily. We are expected to now maximize our productivity to recoup some of our organization’s financial losses from spring when not much was going on and we had few cases. Now our hospital is being overrun with Covid-19 patients, and infection rates are surging in this small rural state. 

Our clinic rules are clear: one must wear a mask at all times to protect patients and staff. Yet every day, all day long, I must politely ask people to put their masks on and keep them on, and they respond with anger and sometimes hostility. The disrespect shown to us, who come to work every day to help patients (including these), is astonishing and inexplicable. How hard can it be to wear a mask for an hour or so? We wear them for many hours straight every single day. Moreover, if healthworkers go down, who do these people think will be there to take care of them if they get Covid-19 or some other condition?"
2020-12-03 2:36,"I found the most horrifying sentence in the article to be: ""Some, like Dr. Gilman, in Arizona, have had their salaries slashed as hospitals weigh how to cover costs.""

These health care workers are risking their lives like no one else. Relief is not in sight. Health care workers are understandably quitting. They are also dying. 

What ignorant hospital administrator would cut salaries at a time like this without appealing to every possible source, from the state to the press to the public?

Why isn't Congress all over this?"
2020-12-03 3:05,"I am tired and mad. My health center has been fighting for months now. Our country had time before things got worse in March, when we knew we had to get more ppe. We had time over the summer to regroup in different regions but there was no leadership. Our experts were silenced. Public health was ridiculed. 

Now we are out of time. There is no more Calvary. There are no more nurses coming. There are no more support staff.  There are no more staff. What we have is what we have. We, as a nation, blew it. We wasted time and energy when we didn’t have that luxury. 

People are going to die who don’t need to without their loved ones."
2020-12-02 15:08,"I vote that prisoners be the one of the last to receive the vaccine, after it has been offered to every member of society who has not broken society's rules."
2020-12-02 15:19,"Corrections staff and inmates should receive vaccination priority, at least over healthy adults, and possibly higher up on the chain.  Inmates live in close proximity and share facilities as well as space, and many have underlying medical conditions and psychological issues.  They cannot shelter in place or socially distance like those at liberty.  And the very same risks that the inmates face are also borne by corrections staff, who work in these overcrowded facilities and must manage these individuals.  In turn, the families of correction staff are at risk.  Let's look past the reasons that brought prisoners to prison.  They are human beings, as are the staff that watches them, transports them, care for their medical needs, and counsels and teaches them."
2020-12-02 16:00,"We need to stop the virus where it is spreading the fastest. Of course the very vulnerable must be protected, but the priority is to stop this creature where it is thriving.

2020-12-02 17:15,"Incarcerated Americans should absolutely be prioritized. Besides the fact that many have preexisting conditions that make them vulnerable, the conditions of incarceration make it impossible for most inmates to observe best practices to avoid infection. Their sentences are for imprisonment and do not include being subjected to hazardous conditions. This is true when it comes to prison violence. This is certainly true when it comes to COVID. We, as a society, have a duty to protect those in our charge. We need to take this seriously."
2020-12-02 17:15,"People in confined conditions should receive vaccines before healthy young adults not confined. But there are many more vulnerable populations that should go before them. The harm that results from delaying the vaccinations for particular groups is clear. Health care workers who become infectious cannot work. Weak bodies are likely to lose their battles with the virus, so are the more likely to die."

2020-12-02 16:03,"I suggest we decide what nation we are and live to our decision. Are we world leaders who champion human rights and believe in opportunity for all?

If so, we imprison people adjudged to have broken the law in a humane way and we vaccinate prisoners. 

If we are a totalitarian government that rules by fear, using lies and brute force to control our population, we continue to let our prisoners die of coronavirus and don’t even bother to consider it newsworthy. 

But if that is who we are, how about we stop touting buzzwords about how we’re the land of the free and home of the brave? There’s nothing that brave about packing people together in a cell and leaving them to get sick and die. 

At least one in eight of us knows someone locked up either now or in the past. We just don’t talk about it because we’re afraid of making it worse for our loved one.

And when you think about that silencing of voices, in the United States of America, it ought to frighten you, too."
2020-12-02 17:29,Prisoners are often called upon to help us when we are in crisis. They risk their lives fighting wild fires and make hand sanitizers when we needed them. It is only fair that we recognize their contributions and give back by vaccinating them sooner rather than later.
2020-12-02 17:56,"The ethical obligation cannot be said loudly enough.  I'm glad this article mentions it twice!  Thinking back to the start of the pandemic, we know that the virus was brought in from the outside -- either by new inmates, transferred inmates or prison personnel.  Clearly there was a moment where officials could have taken action but apparently REAL steps to control the virus were never taken.   And now the virus has a stronghold.  Judges could grant compassionate relief but are they?  Not to my knowledge.  This is a mess and only underscores the weakness of our entire system -- whether it's prisons, schools, hospitals, housing,  we are failing!"
2020-12-02 18:10,"Prisons will never get COVID aid for the same reason that Phone Calls from prisons still cost $5 per minute and there is NEVER legislation passed to stop predatory behavior towards inmates, in any way. We could give so many examples. The fact is that inmates have no political voice. 

I very much appreciate the efforts in Florida to give former inmates the right to vote. This has been fought bitterly by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and other Trump allies, specifically out of fear of their political power, despite having been forwarded by the Florida citizens, by vote, on numerous occasions.

Once former inmates can vote, we can only hope that the prison populations will be taken seriously as people and as citizens."
2020-12-02 18:23,"It’s reasonable to first vaccinate healthcare worker. But next, it’s not moral to prioritize all those at high risk due to crowded conditions, e.g., nursing homes, with the exception of incarcerated people. Putting them at low priority is like subjecting them to a rerun of the Tuskegee Experiments."

Or more socializing risk and privatizing profit?"
2020-12-02 17:12,"Federal officials have it right: prison staff should be pretty high up on the list, but prisoners should not.

Right."
2020-12-02 17:21,"Any person held against their will, be it in prisons or on the border, or at Gitmo, must get the virus vaccine at the same time as doctors, nurses, support personal... in other words, the ""First Tier"".

With incarceration, comes responsibility.
In this case, the responsibility is to protect those who cannot protect themselves or even move out of the pathway of the disease.

This includes those ""private prisons"" where private citizens make a profit off locking up juveniles or the poor.

And, if you don't like this duty, then shut down all private prisons; Gitmo --- where people are not even charged with crimes but are simply held in a legal limbo; the facilities where Baptists and Catholic ""non-profits"" are making millions on separated children or force sterilizing women who are not citizens.

We've had 4 years of the authorities of this nation gloating over the misery they can inflict.
If we cannot protect the most vulnerable, then perhaps the United Nations needs to step in."
2020-12-02 16:50,"The costs to public health are immense when people in congregate living facilities get Covid. That alone warrants keeping inmates at the top of the list. To those who say being a prisoner means you don’t deserve to be spared the virus, I urge you to consider the fact that we all make mistakes and serving time does not mean you deserve illness and possible death from Covid."
2020-12-02 21:05,"The way we treat prisoners in the U.S. is a disgrace. I dearly hope that our poor treatment does not extend to preventable deaths. There seems to always be an argument about how much inmates deserve, but surely they deserve to survive."
2020-12-02 20:20,"We have a moral duty to protect the health of prisoners, not just prison staff. 

While this nation already has too many people incarcerated for minor offenses, if we locked them up we have to prioritize their health just like any other vulnerable group.

This should not even be open for debate. Shame on our as a nation if we can't do this one, simple thing."

No going outside, no mixing with people other than your cell mates. In two weeks you’re free. An entire cell block could be processed like this at once, sharing the frustration but also the collective promise of being entirely Covid-free at the end. After all, nobody goes in, nobody comes out, the virus extinguishes inside the limited population. Not so bad. 

It also seems to me that the NYT would rather give scarce vaccine doses to shooters and murderers. Drug dealers, rapists, thieves and muggers. You know, instead of to law abiding citizens. 

That’s standard operating procedures for these news pages nowadays ..."

2020-12-03 1:17,"This isn’t about who deserves it. It’s not about people's societal standing as a good or bad person. 

This has to be approached creatively and that may seem counterintuitive and perceived as unfair. If it’s to be done right, there’s no room for emotion, only logic. The larger picture of proceeding in this the most efficient and productive way possible is what we have to focus on. Getting vaccines to inmates is a priority. Any group living in confined quarters regardless of reason should be a priority. And this has to be rolled out in an organized way, so that the people who should remain in lockdown for the time being because of health and age, are accounted for and vaccinated accordingly. This could be the most important project that any governor will ever face, and let’s hope for our larger American family they look to science and logic."

2020-11-17 16:17,"Schools are essential, that is music to my retired teacher ears. The other businesses deserve federal monetary assistance as much as possible to bear the brunt of this pandemic. Teachers and other adult staff deserve hazard pay. I can breathe easier to hear that concern for indigenous and racial equity in vaccine distribution. I would gladly give up a vaccine and stay home to give my vaccine to a working teacher if that's what it comes down to to get these kids back in school."
2020-11-17 16:32,"One trouble I haven't seen mentioned that I have observed in acquaintances on Zooms--people are dishonest about having contracted COVID-19 if they have non-hospitalization symptoms. They don't want to admit that they weren't careful or that they may have gone around infecting others knowingly  while having symptoms they denied or unknowingly. Some don't even get tested or retested when they have a negative test then develop obvious symptoms.

I do not know how public health officials can reduce the stigmas and make people be honest  or get  past their denial to isolate and/or tell others of their exposure and infections. 

However, the dishonest people can make us realize for policy making that COVID-19 infection rates are most likely higher than officially reported."
2020-11-17 16:34,"Innovation and creative problem solving are always good things, but the fact is that between Germany, Sweden and Taiwan we already have all the data we need to know what models will work.

Then we can return to being the amazing and exclusively innovative country we like to convince ourselves we are after COVID is distinguished."

The last five days have averaged over 160,000 new cases per day. How can masks possibly be effective if the infection rate triples with increased use?
 Something does not compute."
2020-11-17 17:17,"Mr. Biden said yesterday that people will die because his newly assembled 13 member advisory board hasn't yet met with the Trump administrations' people.

He should go back and watch the 60 Minutes program of a couple of weeks ago that reported in extreme detail the plans for shipping out the vaccines as soon as possible.  The military has gone to extreme lengths to prepare for this.  They have anticipated the availability of the vaccine along the timelines that have since been proven correct with the announcements of Pfizer and Moderna.

The operation ""Warp Speed"" has paid for the production of millions of doses of different vaccines, while testing of the vaccines has been ongoing - an arrangement unheard of in medicine before this epidemic.

The Trump Administrations handling of the development of vaccines for the COVID-19 virus, and its planning for distribution of same has been stellar.  Really. The smartest thing that Mr. Biden could do regarding vaccine testing, production, and distribution, would be to get out of the way."
2020-11-17 17:23,"Wow!  Thanks for running this article.  I almost forgot what it is like to have a competent, committed professional give straight-forward, honest answers to intelligent questions.  Here's to all those, like Dr. Gounder, who will soon be stepping forward as part of the new administration's team to get us back on the rails."
2020-11-17 18:10,"Dr. Gounder is going to be introduced into a major clash of cultures in a short while.  There is as vast difference between the reasoned, scientific culture that she has been in during her professional career and her short stint with the Biden team so far. 

The world that she is in now sees problems as obstacles that need solutions.  The brick wall she will soon encounter is a faith based, angry, uneducated, delusional mob who cannot understand the concept of cause and effect or social responsibility.  

The DPA with adequate production of PPE supplies as well as supplying public health departments with educational materials and check lists to use in their work with the public and bringing the CDC back to their former position of  respect are winners and quite readily achievable.

Wide spread open testing before relatively rapid PCR or similar accurate testing, is available is not going to be real helpful.  The public does not understand false positive and negative tests and there is no way to train them without having a well educated intermediary in the line somewhere that has to be listened too.  The public sees negative tests as a get-out-of-jail-free card and will use it as such.  Our public is not as well educated as those in other countries that can make this work.

The response to the Republicans needs to be to withhold public funds to any person or area that does not follow CDC guidelines.  These free-loaders will not understand anything else."
2020-11-17 18:59,"How refreshing to read the words of an actual expert, who has plans that seem reasonable, based on actual science and non-confrontational.

I so look forward to that day!"
2020-11-17 19:31,"When you pickup a project that has essentially been ignored for 10 to 12 months, you are behind the power curve at the start.  Couple this with the fact that Red State governors will not listen to you will only complicate matters.  Getting the virus under control will be a Herculean task.  This article suggests the Biden–Harris Administration will be mired in people with theory with little or minor practical experience --- pushing for factories to make PPE will take months and the high priced products they produce will probably coincide with the end of the virus pandemic.    
 
An advisory panel is not needed.  A “battle staff” is needed... not a bunch of people who are primarily leftover think tank Washington connected bureaucrats, east coast specialist and Democratic “wonder kids” sitting around a table discussing issues.  Easy solution will be difficult to implement --- new blood from the real world field and front lines is  needed --- Governors anyone? 

The first step is to develop an action plan... it looks to me like the “plan” will have to wait until they get the transition team of Democratic insiders and Obama staffers is installed to start... about the middle of December.  By the time the plan gets developed or published, Trump will see to it vaccine delivery has started and number's will start to go down and Republican's get the credit."

After watching Trump's administration flounder because all decisions were prioritized politically instead of scientifically was the nightmare. All that has happened during the past 9 months was watching Trump trying to talk away the ""China virus"" and by so doing we now have The ""Trump epidemic"". During all this time Trump could have mitigated the effect of this epidemic by doing what his scientific team told him was needed. Not Donald Trump who believed he knew more about what to do than the experts. How ridiculous a fool we have had in charge of the United States' response to this ""unprecedented"" pandemic! Even now we have to wait while Trump blusters his way to the end of his failed presidency. But American democracy has failed itself by choosing such an ignorant fool to be in charge of our lives and well-being."

2020-11-17 17:38,"At least they are starting to talk basic common sense.   A blast of support and intelligent communication from the federal government will make a big difference.  However, to my mind, there is a critical two-lawyered question -  How will the governors and legislatures in Red/Covid-denial states respond once their ship is really sinking, and is it possible to bring around a meaningful proportion of the resistant segment of the population at this late date?  ND (finally) decides to mandate masks; SD refuses and has people whose dying words are ""Covid is a hoax"".  AR is spending $1.6 million on advertising to get people to wear masks . . . at this point in the game . . 

They made a pact with the devil, and the devil has come for his due . .  Whether you can muster the sympathy for those who have driven our country deep into this disaster or not, unfortunately we are all sharing the same geography.  Unless WI and SD can realize that a positivity of 2.7% (NY) is better than 40% (SD) the federal efforts will have little relatively impact.  

Getting from here to April and vaccination is going to be a horrific almost unimaginable journey of self-inflicted pain.  A collective auto da fe perhaps.   Not Jonestown in Guyana, because many of us will have to go with them, but an extermination of many of the fantasies America has chosen to indulge in over the last 30 yrs."
2020-11-17 17:39,"What Biden is proposing has been done over the past 8 months, yet what will “free” testing do when most labs are near testing capacity?

Free testing will result in a mad rush and overwhelm the system and create issues and backlogs. Worse yet this could delay infected people from getting immediate medical treatment if their test results are delayed several days.

Biden is all hype and his only saving grace are the vaccines the Trump Administration fast reacted with Operation Warp Speed.

And thus that voting really matters and who is elected DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE.Dr. Gounder's comments reveal  the importance of how a President will implement policies on the ground, not just the overall statements. She notes that the Biden Administration will, in addition to take its cues from experts, will try to address the racial and economic injustices that resulted in disproportionate deaths among people of color and other poor people. Additionally, the article underscores the value of having people with experience and knowledge in elected and other government positions."
2020-11-18 22:36,"Medical science will have a voice and the president's ear come 2021.  That Dr. Gounder will be one of those voices can only be applauded.  Dr. Gounder shared specific goals to increase the disparity of treatment and testing for Black and Native American  communities.  She mentions having spent time on the reservation.  Good. So have I.  I cannot help notice the shorter shrift rural communities received in this piece.  Regarding these communities, Dr. Gounder said:  ""I don't have a good answer... right now as to what we can do right away. But it's definitely on the radar.""  Some of these communities have the highest rate of increased infection  in the country.  These, as many of us progressives sadly know, voted overwhelming Trump in 2016 and 2020.  I hope against hope that Dr. Gounder is not a barometer of an administration that will inject politics into their treatment of the pandemic.  We've had four years of witnessing politics getting placed over the health of the American people.  No matter how rural folks voted, they have a right to the same medical priorities s other communities.  To do less is to practice the same contemptible behavior we have been criticizing since January, 2016.   ""... definitely on the radar"" clearly strikes me as more of a deflection than a priority. Let us hope that politics does not take us ever near the path trod by Donald Trump."
2020-11-16 19:42,"These tragedies are heartbreaking and certainly replicated one would presume in every country where wealth and social networking are the props used for access to healthcare.

   In Canada for example a consortium of doctors last spring identified at least 25 deaths over a 6 week period in the Toronto region to the mass cancellation of non invasive heart procedures. 
  And despite the pandemic cases easing in the summer months in Canada last month an alumnus of my alma mater in Ontario was still schlepping her Grandmother to extensive onerous radiation treatments in lieu of the recommended hospital procedure for her lung cancer that had been repeated cancelled over a 6 month period.
  Needless to say the anxiety and stress this has produced has likely negatively impacted the successful outcome once predicted upon discovering her cancer at a 'manageable stage'.

   This article begs the question if oncologists are seeing such a dramatically reduced case load, why are they not sounding the alarm? 
  Or are these doctors, technicians and hospital administrators in the business of providing cancer treatments all toiling away caring for Covid patients?
 I thought not."

2020-11-16 22:41,"Of course this has happened here in the United States due to Covid also.    But the one saving grace of the ridiculously expensive and inefficient health care system in the States is built-in excess capacity.  It is one of many reasons Americans pay much more for health care than do Europeans, but it pays off in a crisis or with serious illnesses.   When I was living in London a few years ago there were articles in various newspapers about the GOAL of the NHS to have people begin their cancer treatment within four months of diagnosis.   And that can be after waiting months for the initial biopsy.  No matter how much it costs, I can't imagine many Americans finding it reasonable to wait that long for their cancer treatment."

Fact is that Spain's health care system is neither modern nor functioning.
It is part of a corrupt system inside a corrupt government - of both sides of the aisle - and it will not improve soon.

Being Spanish and living in Germany I know what I am talking about."

2020-11-16 19:52,"This is what happens when measured responses go out the window, and hysteria and political-correctness leads to all-or-nothing thinking and approaches, complete with shaming of anyone who disagrees with said all-or-nothing approaches.

Yes, we should be cautious.  Yes, we can easily maintain physical distance,  wear masks, wash hands, etc.  But life must go on.  Mental and emotional health is just as important.  And those who die of cancer should be equally mourned, and their lives considered just as valuable, as those who may die of COVID. 

Those who refuse to make any adjustments at all in their lifestyles, even during this pandemic, are being stubborn, juvenile and selfish.  But so too are those who are dictating to others, simply out of hysteria and political correctness, without taking a step back and considering the bigger picture.

As with all things in life, something in the middle is usually best."

He never had melanoma before. He kept getting sicker. When he finally decided to go to the ER, it was too late; the cancer had already spread to his spine, lungs and liver."
2020-11-16 20:33,Spain relies excessively in its public healthcare system. Traditional private doctor appointments have been disappearing as the government holds something close to a monopoly in health.
2020-11-17 12:06,"This is a side effect of a global pandemic. Some of these cancers display no warning signs, so it's not shocking that these patients died so quickly. They probably would have died anyway in the same time frame, even with treatment, because the cancers were so far advanced."
2020-11-17 19:58,"Not sure what the answer is. Basically, Spanish doctors are being sued, because they don't have time to do their jobs properly. And these lawsuits will only rob them of more time to do their jobs properly.

No good answers."
2020-12-02 18:42,"My concern about the efficacy of the various vaccines is the shortened timeline necessitated by the relentless onslaught of the pandemic. Usually vaccine trials run for a period of years, not months. Those who have been administered the vaccine must remain in the study to confirm continued immunity. Furthermore, the shortened time of the trial raises an issue as to whether the participants were adequately exposed to the virus. Do we know that mask wearing and social distancing limited exposure and enhanced or masked the true efficacy of the vaccine? Was the behavior of participants monitored? Coronavirus is a unique malady in that we have asked and locally mandated changes to ordinary behavior. Have these precautions been controlled for? 
These factors must be part of the publicly disclosed evaluation."

2020-11-30 11:33,"Both of my elementary-aged children are learning online this academic year. I witness just how hard their teachers are working and how extremely difficult it is to get 6 and 8 year olds engaged in learning from home. 
My district’s decision to treat this year just like any other- the same curriculum, standards, and extracurricular requirements (yes, my children must complete gym class remotely) is unrealistic.
Something has to give- we either her figure out a way to get these kids in school full time, or we all need to collectively lower our standards for this academic year. Teachers and parents of online students are very close to the breaking point."
2020-11-30 11:43,"Thank you to Ms. Singer for highlighting the effects that the pandemic is having on teachers. No- teachers are not obstructionists as some pieces would indicate nor are their unions. The stress associated with the various modes of teaching and the impact it is having will be generational. Teachers have always been asked to do more than teach- act as social worker, nurse and mediator, to name a few. This pandemic is stretching their well-being to the limit and that includes their own trepidation of contracting the disease. So, the next time a politician decides to open schools one week and close them the next, wherever it is, he or she needs to read this article and understand that damage is being done, much of it long lasting."
2020-11-30 11:45,"We should be reimagining the second semester of school now, given what we’ve learned.  I teach at a hybrid high school and it sort of works. Not great but not terrible.  Isn’t that enough this year? Right now bouncing in and out of remote coupled with the anxiety of rising cases depletes whatever normalcy we had and further erodes any learning. Why not schedule premptive remote learning periods after breaks and let teachers map ut the semester to match that plan."
2020-11-30 11:52,"Lifelong high school teacher here. Thank you for publicly posting what all of my colleagues and I are voicing. What wasn’t mentioned and should be is that we teachers have already made financial sacrifices to work in education. Now we’re expected to risk health and life, as well as volunteer beyond the hours we already volunteer in a regular school year, to make hybrid and remote teachering work. Our society needs to reevaluate the value placed on solid, caring, effective teachers lest as a body politic the best of us calls it quit. Why not start by pegging our salaries, in some reasonable calculation, to local real estate median house prices in the school area so that we can finally afford to buy a home? How many of my teacher friends need roommates to afford rent! We sacrifice time and health and decades long educational loans ... at least give us access to homes."
2020-11-30 11:53,"We are experiencing something entirely different—in our Atlanta elementary school, it’s been 100% remote, only 4 days a week, and only 9-12:30 (including several 15 minute breaks and a 45 minute “special”). One afternoon per week, my child participates in a 30 minute small group.  There are no classes on Wednesday, just the availability of lots of computer games.   I don’t see how teachers could possibly be getting burned out when they are teaching 100% remote, about 3 hours per day, for only 4 days a week.  I’d really like to understand how these teachers perceive the load and whether they think they are doing enough. I don’t think it’s enough, so educating my child is simply the part time job I do on top of my full time job.  This is unsustainable."
2020-11-30 11:53,"After reading many an article and Op-Ed in this very paper suggesting that schools must reopen for in-person instruction because the cost to the nation’s children and families is too high, I felt a sense of relief that here at last, there was a writer who bothered to check on those who carry out that work: the teachers. 

In-person learning means hybrid learning right now, and we are at the end of our rope. I’m fortunate enough that my district has opted for remote instruction until January (we all know and agree this is not ideal, but right now, it’s the best we can do); we tried hybrid instruction and had to close almost immediately after we reopened. My daughter, a first-year elementary special education teacher, still goes in every day for hybrid teaching. She’s burning out; trying to teach a class of students with behavioral problems while addressing the many needs of those at home is a losing proposition. I worry about her. 

Stop believing teachers have super powers. We don’t."
2020-11-30 11:59,"My school has been hybrid (4 days in, one day remote) since August. We are doing just fine. In talking to teachers (I have kids in all three levels- elem, middle, high), I have gathered so far that, albeit not without its snags, the system has worked quite well. We are a poor urban school district near Pittsburgh; if we can do it, everyone else can too, I am convinced."
2020-11-30 11:59,"The job was barely sustainable before the pandemic.  If there were a little more “give” in the system, if teachers had a caseload of, say, 50-60 students rather than a completely unmanageable caseload of upwards of 150 students, the pandemic would not be such a challenge.  But where everything is already stretched to the utmost, one more tug, let alone a pandemic, tears apart the fabric."
2020-11-30 11:42,"Teachers are absolutely exhausted, and understandably terrified of contracting COVID. Many school districts struggled to recruit any teachers (much less good ones) before the pandemic. The continuing mismanagement of education, healthcare, and the rest, and the contempt heaped on teaching, and other formerly respected professions that further the common good, is a disaster that has only accelerated this year."
2020-11-30 11:47,"This 64 yo teacher of 13 years (a career changer) elected to retire early. I was the only theatre teacher in our HS, and I knew remote learning would not be an option.  
Teaching is brutal under the best of circumstances. As much as we truly do love our students, the changes I've seen in the last 13 years have all been changes that have negatively impacted teachers and students.
I knew that ""pandemic teaching"" would be the straw that broke this camel's back.  I miss my students terribly and hope to get back into a school, in some form, when this is over, but I am so glad I made the decision to retire when I did.  My teacher friends are truly suffering."
2020-11-30 11:45,"My wife is a reading specialist in an elementary school here in upstate NY.  This article is spot on.  My wife since the end of school last year, is constantly working on plans and ideas to make zoom learning better.  She has worked 13 hour days since the pandemic hit.  Her problem is that her students are low income special needs children.  My heart goes out to all the teachers trying to teach under these barbaric conditions.  Last week my wife was crying because 4 of her kids lost internet because their parents are broke and unemployed.  I called our local Senator and asked for help to no avail.  I called the superintendent of the district and was told their was nothing they could do.  I called Spectrum and Verizon for help to no avail. Desperate, I called a local millionaire and told her what was going on.  She picked up the phone and ordered internet for the family and paid for 5 years for them.  Schools are strapped of cash.  Parents are unemployed and can’t afford laptops or internet service.  In the meantime, my wife has been going to the house of these 4 kids and teaching them after school while social distancing.  Kudos to all you under appreciated, under paid, dedicated teachers."
2020-11-30 11:50,"This is not a fair assessment since I love remote teaching, even during a pandemic. Additionally, this is what the future will look like. Whoever decided to have thousands of kids the same age in school buildings for eight hours a day was normal, or even healthy? Stop you bellyaching and get back online. Finally, why not get up and go to the bathroom, and have the kids work in a cooperative group on a shared objective, just like in the Real World?"
2020-11-30 11:47,"Balancing the in person, remote, and full remote has created a relative Bermuda Triangle of education. As an educator, it is extremely hard to create lessons that serve the needs of all three cohorts. Teachers are effectively teaching in multiple ""classrooms"" at the same time, under different circumstances, and with different learner profiles/needs. At the same time, teachers do not accept the idea of ""lower expectations"". Instead, we push ourselves, attempting to serve the needs of all students regardless of their educational setting. If anything, as a teacher, all I can say to parents is: be mindful that your child's teacher is killing themselves. They are working to meet the needs of ALL learners to the best of their ability. The desparate nature of the current education system at the hands of Covid (and legislators with no educational experience) forces the learning for all students to decline a little. After all, not unlike the hospitals in the Midwest that are overwhelmed with Covid, ""everyone gets a little less""."
2020-11-30 11:38,"America's teachers have deserved a raise for a very long time.

The coronavirus exposes that shortcoming and many other societal ills in America, most notably the fact that poor children living in poor neighborhoods both urban and rural have serious connectivity, 'truancy', hunger, and family stress/abuse obstacles that render education efforts untenable.

Other countries don't seem to have this rainbow of systemic rot in their systems.....because they don't have the record income inequality that America has....they don't have the contempt that average Americans have for paying taxes for the common good....and they don't have contempt for government that America's greedy right wing has systematically infused into the American mind.

Raise taxes.
Raise teacher salaries.
Raise public investment in schools, libraries and internet connectivity.
Raise the poor.
Raise the future.
Raise this country's common good.
Raise this country's morality."
2020-11-30 12:03,"Thank you so much for this. In the competitive world of private schools , the number one focus is in not going under. I get that. But at what cost? If we lose a lot of great, talented teachers will it have been worth it? I know administrators are stretched thin, but the future depends on forward thinking here, and caring for front line teachers."
2020-11-30 12:20,"If the schools were allowed to focus on teaching and some other entities focused on social work, nutrition,  and psychological counseling, then teachers wouldn't have 13-hour days, wouldn't be so depressed and anxious (""burned out""), and resources could be focused on the right things. The current culture - especially amongst academics and policy makers- seems to be that we cannot talk about the failures of the home and parents, but that we throw any and all problems over the transom to the schools and teachers without the adequate resources or the network of broader support required for progress."
2020-11-30 12:23,"Teaching is a noble profession. Most teachers do it for love of the work, not the money (though most should definitely be paid more). That said, this story and many others about burn out (perhaps with the exception of front line medical staff), think about what past generations went through, World War II for starters, when millions were engaged in a vast global life or death struggle. Is the pandemic a challenge and sometimes painful and hard? Yes but I don’t think our generation knows true hardship."
2020-11-30 12:27,"Unfortunately, the only way to resolve this problem is to either double resources (like pay) or halve quality. Neither seems to be palatable, so teachers are asked (ordered) to volunteer their free time. The only way out, as I see it, is leaving the profession and moving over to industry."
2020-11-30 12:32,"Thank you for the great article. As a teacher in my 9th year, I am actually resigning today. Although my family is somewhat supportive, they just don’t get the challenges. All they hear are my lessons and interactions with my students - “Your students love you!” and “You’re so great with them!” but every time I sit after school hours to rewrite curriculum to be taught remotely, or put on a happy face for my students and colleagues (which is every single day because teachers aren’t allowed to have a down day), I am slowly losing who I am. Teachers are more than community workers - we are wives, mothers, children and best friends. Unfortunately the imbalance between my personal and work life has gotten to be too much and I am one of those teachers that has burned out."
2020-11-30 12:16,"It is ludicrous for any school district this year to try and adhere to the curricula used in the “before time.” Anyone who has participated in meetings with both on-site and remote participants knows how difficult it is for all parties. It’s a rule of thumb for meeting prep to expect to get through one-third less material in remote meetings compared to in-person. That rule applies to adults with dependable technology, so imagine the drag caused by tech issues on both ends. It’s no surprise students aren’t learning and teachers are getting burned out. Where are TAs when you need them?"
2020-11-30 12:11,"And imagine the stress of teaching in the pandemic and trying trying to help your own young children navigate this landscape. No, not sustainable."
2020-11-30 12:23,"Darn right it isn't sustainable. 

Nobody cares about the teachers in this equation of the new normal. I am willing to bet first-year teachers won't last a second year; mid-career professionals are searching the want ads, and old pros are packing it up and retiring if they are lucky to have the years in, mainly to avoid the health risks. The rest who are still in it are finding themselves bound and tied to the computer even more hours before school for prep, holding live/hybrid/remote classes during the school day, and remain online hours after school in group or one-on-one meetings with parents, students, guidance counselors and the like. 

It was already 13-plus hours BEFORE the pandemic that most teachers dedicated to teaching, grading, planning, collaborating, meeting, tutoring, guiding, policing, social-working, quasi-parenting, developing professionally, etc. 

Now they have to suddenly be their own ""learning"" channel. 

The sad thing is that some school boards (who can't find warm-body substitutes to fill in for even a day or two) want to squeeze every last bit of blood out of the remaining teaching force, have them cover for absent staff, ignore teachers' requests for PPE and permission to work from home when there are underlying illnesses to worry about, and don't care who, what, where, how and when they actually take a physical break, eat, sleep, and the rest of the bodily necessities. It is THAT BAD."
2020-11-30 12:07,"It seems many on the GOP side seem to forget that jobs they seem to take for granted, teachers, health care professionals, etc., are real human beings that do hard work that is physically draining, demanding, and stressful.
They’re so caught up in their politics of superiority (closet social Darwinists) that they continue ignoring reality and the opinions of those actually doing the work.
That’s something president snowflake will never understand, hard work, and especially hard work for the benefit of others."
2020-11-30 12:19,"As a University Professor Emeritus let my start by saying 

1)  Teachers are the very best.   We get their output and we know what a marvelous job they do. 

2) the same illiterati  who think they don't need to listen  to experts on disease spread or medical therapy or excess deaths now think they are the experts on instruction of young children.  

3)  As a risk regulation expert I can tell you that society can tolerate a certain level of disease spread.    It appears we can have schools or we can have restaurants bars gyms and churches.    Anyone who want to open schools, tell me what you are closing to reduce the overall spread."
2020-11-30 12:24,"The pandemic has exposed many tears in the fabric of our society. Included are the fact that teachers are overworked, underpaid, and under-valued. This last had led to many teachers not getting the support from administrators who try to balance the needs of students, parents any teachers, with no help from Betsy DeVos on down. No, not sustainable, January 20 can’t come soon enough."
2020-11-30 12:24,"The treatment of teachers depicted in this article (as well as anecdotal information from acquaintances) is deplorable. The school systems push everything onto the teacher with little to no support. Expecting people to work 16 hour days is not only unfair, it is educationally unsound and personally destructive. Expecting teachers to do remote and in class teaching is likewise untenable. It takes many hours to prepare remote lessons — instructional videos, links to information and learning resources and preparation of online exercises as well as conducting zoom classrooms. This in addition to normal preparation to teach in regular classroom? Really?"
2020-11-30 12:34,"Our two youngest are in middle school. Our daughter has special needs and is high risk. We have kept both home, so they are remote learners. We both work, but are able to stagger our schedules and I can do some work from home. I have been very impressed by the caring, dedication, and patience of their teachers, who have gone beyond all reasonable expectations to work with our son, who has struggled with all this, but has kept his grades high. I am very very grateful. 

It’s well past time that we increase the pay of our teachers, school librarians, and others who work at our schools. Through all of this, our government has made sure that asset owners (e.g., stocks and homes) are prospering. When are they going to start caring for the needs of our teachers and other public servants?"
2020-11-30 12:19,"We let our little children be gunned down sitting in their own classrooms, you think this country cares about what happens to them during a pandemic? Ha!  We are a highly dysfunctional, toxic country where the needs of the one are always more important than the needs of the many."
2020-11-30 12:28,Go in person...I’m a teacher..we don’t have a choice
2020-11-30 12:36,"When I was a community college instructor I was pushed into distance education  when the administration cut the workweek from 5 to 4 days and students no longer had as many choices for in-classroom instruction. So instead of teaching 6 classes and 5 preps in a room I ended up teaching 4 in the classroom and 2 online.  Night classes for adults working full time jobs died a slow death. 

This was not entirely ""choice.""  Students were forced into distance education regardless of their ability to afford a computer and access to the internet.    Thus, a new method of discrimination was created in an educational system that was already discriminatory in other ways.  

The end result was you had less free time on the three day weekend than you had on the two-day weekend.  If you didn't care about teaching you could make the adjustment, just like you could offer multiple choice questions that could be graded by a machine rather than questions that required the students to think.  But if you really cared about teaching then your work load increased tremendously.  

All tests became open book unless you required the students to take their tests in the Academic Learning Center, but few instructors required this.     

So I agree that Covid is a disaster in certain areas of teaching in our educational system.  Many of the best  instructors will leave."

Actually there are only 4 years in high school and the 32 classes that are taught should be filmed and guess what in the future during the summer studebts who fall behind can watch and practice on their own through the summer."
2020-11-30 12:35,"We need to LET GO of giving A-F grades right now.  At least give teachers and students some freedom of simplicity.

Something has to give. Let us teachers just report that the student is ""doing fine"" or ""has an issue"" in the course.  That's all most parents really want to know anyway."
2020-11-30 12:30,"Some of the best teachers I ever had growing up in the Fifties and have fond memories of today didn’t spend a lot of time actually doing back-and-forth teaching in classes. They assigned readings, passed out handouts, gave frequent quizzes, highlighted things they thought were important and expected us mostly to teach the details of subjects to ourselves. 

I believe this worked well for me and a lot of the kids I went to school with, and we got to listen to our teacher's comments about politics and what was going on in the world, many of which were funny.

Today, they would all be talking about Trump and the virus, which wouldn’t be the worst thing they could be doing."
2020-11-30 12:46,"A good article.  We most often forget about the affect the virus has on teachers. They are on the frontlines like other ""virus fighters"". Thank you!

2020-11-30 12:58,"The way this nation treats its workers has been exposed in shocking detail by this pandemic.

Teachers, nurses, EMTs, grocery store workers ... all of these workers have kept this country afloat while Congress has refused to do little or absolutely nothing to help them and the rest of us get through this.

Everyone talks about how Biden should be wary of making any concessions to the progressives of the Democratic party, but if it weren't for them, we'd still be nothing but a  country that serves the rich and doles out massive tax cuts while the rest of us struggle just to get by.   

Something has to give, or that so-called center will not hold."
2020-11-30 13:06,"Let’s call this the lost year and test all the kids for grade level and where necessary hold them back.  It’s just the right thing to do.  Add a 13th year to high schools and use it to guide students to their next chapter. 

Our kids need a longer runway due to  inequality and the digital divide.  This is the least we can do to make sure as many as possible get in a track to stability."
2020-11-30 13:09,"Neither is the state of our medical insurance.  Not sustainable.  I feel for the teachers, they are being used as a political pawn."
2020-11-30 12:52,I hope that we will not forget teachers when we think of the front-line workers who need the vaccine quickly so that they can be protected and go back to something more normal--their workspace is is in crisis and they can't hold out much longer.
2020-11-30 12:47,"I don't understand the fixation on having as many hours of live teaching as we do in in-person school. It's clearly a recipe for quick burnout for everyone, and we don't even know if the kids are learning anything. 

I am a parent. I just saw the schedule for my kid's virtual Kindergarten - 3 hrs on zoom daily + independent work on Seesaw. It came with lots of language that teachers need extra time to plan for such a day and that we need to be patient. Well, I don't have the time either to support such an intense zoom schedule for a little kid, and it's pretty clear children abhor this way of learning. 

I am not participating in this charade. I feel like telling our teachers to just stop working so hard, it's so pointless right now."
2020-11-30 13:07,"Meanwhile, thanks to the republican decision to pretend that the virus is no biggie, states are getting less federal resources for schools. We need the money to double or triple the number of teachers. We need better teacher training. We need to make teaching a respected profession again by improving the chances that schools will succeed. We need to stop pointing to the unions as a source of the problems and point to the problems that unions seek to address: oversized classrooms, unpaid working hours, health coverage, etc. And, no, I’m not a teacher but my grown kids went through public schools and the amount of help we privileged white parents were able to give(tutors, extracurricular) only grew and perpetuated the injustice in this country - all to the loss of our society because an educated populace is to the advantage of all!"
2020-11-30 13:05,"Has any job or profession not been challenged in the pandemic? Even grocery store workers face a different landscape in stores. They must come in close contact with huge numbers of different people and cannot judge whether these people have ben tested. Firefighters and police must be called to be in close contact with potentially infected individuals. How do you arrest someone with social distancing? The entire universe is stressed out, not just teachers. The end of this pandemic is in sight with vaccines starting in December. We must all do our best until then and our teachers are no exception. Children and parents depend on them. Closing schools any longer is not sustainable. The American people will not allow it and our public servants know very well that they are all, or many of them, subject to the judgment of the public come election time."
2020-11-30 13:06,"Two thoughts from a teacher:

1. Believing that teachers work 6 hours a day, 9 months a year is like watching a movie and thinking the actors only worked for two hours. 

2. For those of you who think we have it easy, with all the platinum things? You're right, it's a total racket. You should get in on it immediately. I hear there are several positions opening up."
2020-11-30 13:15,"There is so much more to the story than this article describes. Truancy is at an all time high. Not to mention older teachers have a huge learning curve when it comes to technology and teaching online, as do students without internet or computers at home. No one feels comfortable turning their camera on, so three months into teaching, teachers only know names, not faces. Teachers are exchanging the need to manage classroom behavior to teaching high school students how to save documents, download new browsers, and how to copy and paste. Never was there time for everyone to learn the tools they would need to rely on to effectively teach and learn."
2020-11-30 13:15,"I hear everyone on the exhaustion piece.  I'm teaching “hyflex” classes, which means I have to go into the classroom but students can choose to be online or in school, and I teach both groups at the same time.  What that really means is everyone gets less because too much focus goes into making the technology work.  What’s also awful about this is that students who are online can choose to show themselves or not.  Many of them are just names on the screen and if I didn’t call on them, I would have no idea if they were there.  There is absolutely no way to teach to a name on a screen.  All of this adds up to exhaustion because those who want to reach students are trying to figure it out.  Anything we would say or draw on a board now needs digital representation.  We search for materials, do voiceovers on ppts, post assignments but struggle to read them, and try to be engaging while talking to names on screens (while in a mask).  On any given day, I read student work online for about 3-4 hours in addition to teaching time and they must be doing something similar if taking a full course load. 

Imo, grade schools should have just closed, and the family and communities should have figured out temporary solutions, including non-academic activities.  There is very little creative adjustment or ownership going on; instead, parents and admins throw impossible demands at the educators."
2020-11-30 13:15,"People don't seem to understand how different teaching is from almost every other profession. You can't ""phone it in"" for a day. There are kids expecting you to be there for them, be patient kind, and also actually teach them, every day. There aren't casual bathroom breaks or walks to the cooler, or shopping midday, or even daydreaming opportunities. The job is a sprint, every day. You have to take care of yourself enough to be able to do this job, and it's a very fine balance. You need to find ways to make it sustainable regardless of the circumstances. It's not easy. But, it's also the best if you can figure it out."
2020-11-30 12:44,"I quit my job to stay home with my child. It’s financially possible for us to do this for a year or so. My wife and I respect teachers, we believe their safety and the safety of students and administrators is paramount. That being stated, my kindergartner has 2.5 hours of on-camera instruction per week! The rest is computer-based, click through nonsense that seems designed to instill a deep hatred of learning. Kindergartners learning about Venn Diagrams, etc. ?!?!

I understand this is tough for everyone - my wife works in healthcare and has to see people in a high-risk environment all day long. But the question persists, what are these teachers doing for the other 37.5 hours of the work week?"
2020-11-30 13:03,"It's time for a NATIONAL REMOTE CURRICULUM.

We have the Common Core, we have great teachers.... It bothers me that teachers all over the country are replicating the same work. Why don't we just hire a core group of great teachers from each grade to make this once and for all? It could be used outside of the pandemic as well. Instead of burdening our teachers and watching them burn out, DO SOMETHING to fix it!"
2020-11-30 13:12,"Teaching is a profession. Yet it exposes teachers--who are in many ways powerless over the personal lives of children, the choices of their parents, school administrators, politicians, the pandemic--to a degree of responsbility that is insane. They are held accountable for factors they have no control over whatsoever, and when they are powerless, it is easy to scapegoat them or turn them into martyrs. Yet most teachers are, like all of us, people doing their best to fulfill their obligations in difficult circumstances and doing a darn good job. They aren't all saints and they don't want to be bullied. They want respect for their wisdom and experience, dignity, and the right to make  powerful decisions in the school room based on real learning, which is gritty, hands-on, and time consuming, not some facsimile version, which requires only a magic wand, a screen, and charm. They want to be properly paid. And they don't want remote teaching to become the ""new normal"" because it is cheaper and more expedient."
2020-11-30 13:31,Thank you for giving voice to this. It was cathartic to read.
2020-11-30 13:33,"I read this as I sit here trying to gear myself up to head back to the classroom after Thanksgiving break. Even after a week off, I am still exhausted, physically, emotionally, and intellectually. I want to do what is right for my students but I am doing it at the cost of myself. 

The people making the decisions about what teachers are supposed to do really have no idea what they are demanding of us. All the work is supposed to be on-line, I'm supposed to also meet with students via the computer, students in the classroom still need attention, and I'm supposed to enforce safety measures to keep Covid at bay. I'm also supposed to provide extra support to my ESL students and those students who are receiving special education services. On top of all of that, I am teaching three different subjects with 195 students across six sections. It's no wonder I am exhausted. 

If I can figure out a way to leave the classroom at the end of this year, I will. Unfortunately, I am the person in my family that brings health insurance to the table. Leaving my job means figuring out how to pay for health insurance and health care. And that's an entirely different set of problems to figure out."
2020-11-30 13:07,"Before getting laid off due to Covid, I spent years in the corporate world doing 12-15 hour days and being treated poorly, complete with cruel bosses and gossiping coworkers. I was burnt out constantly for over a decade. I don’t wish that life on teachers. I hope they are at least having a better time of their job than I did."
2020-11-30 13:21,Remote learning is more difficult than remote teaching.

2020-11-30 13:23,"I'm sorry if I didn't sign up for martyrdom.   So with two BAs and a Masters Teacher degree and certification, twelve years of  high school classroom experience and two more as a Principal, I quit.  I now farm myself out as a very expensive private tutor to the wealthy.  I ""teach"" the necessary tested curriculum as well as what was once called a ""classical education"".  i make no promises other than these kids will be well-read, critical thinkers and curious to know more.  About everything.  What direction their parents guide them in is up to them.  Thus far the waiting list, were there one, would be longer than the noses of the elected officials who lie to us every day.  You're either predator or prey."
2020-11-30 13:25,"This 61 year old teacher is exhausted. I have figured out on-line teaching for kids with disabilities, I have figured out how to teach art swathed in PPE. It's the job, we all do it to the best of our abilities. I've had some amazing educational moment on line with my students during the pandemic, that keeps us all going. 
The exhaustion comes from lack of support from the community, horrible criticism of teachers -- we are all doing our best in impossible circumstances. Our NYC Department of Education has completely and utterly failed teachers and students -- they are incapable of planning, and make many promises about safety and testing and manage never to deliver. Then they inform us via twitter. Lack of leadership is depressing and discouraging."
2020-11-30 13:20,There must be existing online learning resources such as videos and pre-packaged instruction. Teachers might be able to help their situation by pulling such resources together.
2020-11-30 13:22,Among the fastest and best ways to get schools up and running again is to put teachers and school staff on the top priority list for vaccines. Not only will that help get students back in the classroom it will help working parents get back to work.
2020-11-30 13:19,"Both of my parents were public school teachers. I cannot even begin to imagine how they could have taught their classes from home, while also dealing with a couple of kids at home taking classes. It's not mentioned in this piece that a majority of teachers are also parents. Growing up, I thought this was the most ideal situation, because everyone was always on the same schedule. Today, it would be an absolute nightmare!"
2020-11-30 13:27,"I think we need to stop pretending that COVID cyber school truly functions as school.  I see the blood, sweat and tears that teachers have poured into it but it’s not close to working for many many children.  My fear is that next September the schools will move on as if everything is normal and not remedy the harm."
2020-11-30 13:42,"What we are seeing is the result of a systematic disinvestment in public education nationwide since Brown v Board in the 1950s. That, plus the inefficient and unreasonable piling on of social duties onto schools (like the similar piling on social work jobs onto police). In normal years we teachers have too many students and too little support. We are not paid commensurate with our education. The right, and now The NY Times (see Eliza Shapiro’s articles) have been attacking teachers’ unions as villains who prevent live streaming and double teaching of in person and remote kids. But this article (finally, after waiting since March) tells the truth about that bad plan and about the big picture. Why keep teaching if the society says it’s not worth it? Teachers’ unions are practically the only force for decent funding of schools, and they aren’t winning that fight. The country’s families are saying, in effect, I will make sure my kids are educated, but not yours. That is not a good plan for the future of the United States."
2020-11-30 13:46,"""This is not sustainable""? Of course it is not sustainable. It is an emergency paired measures meant to get through approximately one year. Everyone is fully aware is that the year is worse for all involved, and it is going to be worse for all involved no matter what steps are or are not taken.

Doing something ""for now"" is not always license or implication to do the same thing forever, even if people with ulterior motives sometimes pretend otherwise. Fatigue and indifference are among the biggest risk factors."
2020-11-30 13:48,"Teachers are not good at writing curriculum, and they’re spending extraordinary amounts of their own money on sites like Teachers Pay Teachers to buy untested curriculum. There are people making lots of money off this disaster. And there are teachers not getting sleep so they can create visually attractive presentations in a desperate attempt to keep students engaged - another skill set they didn’t learn in school.
Education was in crisis before the pandemic. Schools are rolling out new programs that are really old programs with new names, and there isn’t time to properly train for new things in a pandemic."
2020-11-30 13:36,"“Teacher burnout” will soon (if not already) be joined by nurse burnout, respiratory therapist burnout, physician burnout. 
People who think they should be able to carry on their “normal” lives in the face of this out-of-control pandemic are soon going to be given a wake-up call in the form of righteous rebellion from these frontline workers. 
When teachers and nurses go on strike, things are going to get real."
2020-11-30 13:29,"For over a decade I worked on average 12 hours a day.  It wasn't exceptional.  It was a job that paid the rent.

Teaching is harder than usual, but lets be real.  They are not storming the beaches of Normandy."
2020-11-30 13:30,"I’m a veteran high school Language Arts and EL teacher. Thank you for reporting the truth surrounding teaching during the pandemic. The stressors are real and ugly. No one wins in a pandemic, especially our children, and it’s imperative that parents give teachers loads of grace. As we smile and cajole your children, we ourselves are overwhelmed and stressed to the core. We are doing our best, but we are also dealing with the ramifications of the pandemic; we are not immune to the disease nor to its immense effects on our own families and loved ones. Spread grace, dear readers, spread grace."
2020-11-30 13:30,"I’m a music teacher and work in a county district that serves special needs and at-risk students. I have been teaching virtually since March (including our extended school year which ends in August). 

This moment shows us how teaching is a creative profession. It also shows us how “school” means different things to different children. For some it’s a social hub; for others it’s a (literal) food bank. Our schools play multiple rolls within their communities, and we now know that daily functionalities like people going to work and a stable economy are reliant on them being open. 

My hope is that when we begin to emerge from this moment we reevaluate not just the work of teachers, but how we are trained. Again, ours is creative work and while most don’t see it as that, it’s a fact. Teachers (regardless of subject) should be trained as creative individuals, and a teaching/education degree should be awarded as a BFA. This will prepare us better not just for typical days in the classroom, but moments of disruption like we are currently experiencing 

My other hope is we finally realize that education is dynamic. It’s not just about grades and intellectual development, but also self discovery, social and emotional development, as well as empathy towards, and understanding, those around you. We’re going to need to accommodate our children as they emerge from this extraordinary moment and allow them to express themselves and what they’ve been through. It’s all a part of education."
2020-11-30 13:41,"Don’t knock teachers for having the sense to organize in unions, it’s the only reason they get living wages and benefits. Teachers in a lot of a rural areas make peanuts cause they cannot organize effective unions. All other essential workers making < $20 an hour should be earning livable wages."
2020-11-30 13:52,"As a former teacher and administrator, I must point out that teaching is a unique profession: there is nothing that comes close to it in terms of the complexity of managerial, technical, interpersonal and administrative demands.   The rewards, when it goes well, are concomitantly great.  But if you haven't done it, you cannot imagine the stress on most teachers now.   At a minimum, no teacher should have to do actual instruction during the pandemic for more than four days per week.   That fifth day must be reserved for planning, administrative tasks and just plain recovery from exhaustion.   Employees of parents who work on site must be required by law to make accommodations for this, even if it means losing a day of operations if there are insufficient workers.   We've gone through waves of teacher retirements before, and it wasn't pretty.   If nothing is done to ease their burden, the next wave could change the whole system."
2020-11-30 13:55,"Teaching is an alchemy between a good enough teacher who forges a relationship with a somewhat available (ready-to-learn) student. So difficult to do in these times and circumstances! Trust gets built- usually through many hours shared together in a classroom- as learning is a vulnerable process for most students. To really stretch and grow, students take risks that are predicated on tolerating some of the discomforts of making mistakes and a willingness to modify attached stances. Not surprising that even in the best circumstances it’s sometimes referred to as an impossible profession- and in these times and circumstances, well, it’s likely even more impossible. My heart aches for those caring  teachers out there struggling to reach their students!"
2020-11-30 13:56,"Of course a hybrid approach is unsustainable. We're trying to prop up a process that hasn't changed fundamentally in about 100 years all the while teachers are being asked to implement a process that they've never been trained for.

With the technology we've had available for at least 20 years now, there is no excuse for this situation. From grade school right through college, kids have been required to come into a classroom and listen to lectures when distance learning could have been used to a much greater extent.

It's inexcusable that teachers and students (and parents) are paying the entire price for the failure of academia to keep pace with technology. And, the people responsible for this, the ones at the top of the academic totem pole, have kept their jobs while layoffs, early retirement and doubling of workloads are the norm throughout the rest of the academic enterprise.

What a surprise."
2020-11-30 14:07,"The parents club at my $50k a year school gave all the approximately 150 teachers/staff a $10 Amazon card to thank us.  The tone deafness of the wealthy is striking. Once the vaccine is widely available, teachers and staff likely will NOT get an appropriate amount of credit or bonus money deserved for basically saving this country from ruin."
2020-11-30 14:07,"I'm doing both in class and on line learners at the same time, every day, every class.  I'm within a few years of retirement.  Fortunately I work in a district that is giving us lots of leeway for our annual evaluations.  In other words, admin is taking into account the difficulty of the situation and doesn't expect miracles.  Will I retire early?  No way with the financial situation created by the pandemic.  I may work an additional year to be safe."
2020-11-30 14:07,"Instead of trying to replicate in person school in online classes, we should have done something much different.

We could have spent this time reading books, writing and talking about them, or drawing pictures about them and the world around us. 

Reading and writing are the most basic skill sets of all, skills that almost every school system in this country needs to improve anyway (nation wide, only 35% of our students read at a proficient level for their grade, source NAEP). 

This pandemic will be over in a year. We can make up the subject matter content we all lost then, because clearly, we're not making much of any progress this year anyway, and we're about to lose a good percentage of our teaching core.

We could have instilled a love of reading nation wide. What a lost opportunity."
2020-11-30 14:09,"Teacher's are essential - essential to students, essential to parents, communities and the entire nation.  So they have been called to do their best despite the risk they're being asked to take.  

Remember, teachers range from 21 to 65+ years of age and they have all the same health issues as the rest of us.  Teachers also have school aged children, parents and spouses that may be high risk if infected.  So if we want them to be there for us over the long haul they need to be treated with dignity and respect.  Make the classrooms as safe as possible for them. Provide them with PPE and disinfectants.  Back off on things that stress teachers out that make keeping their classrooms going harder.  If their rooms and schools become a hot spot, get them out of there ASAP.  

We need creative and dedicated people to want to go into the profession of teaching as we lose those who are susceptible and close to retirement.  The exodus already began over this summer."
2020-11-30 14:11,"As a professor at a state university teaching remotely, I've struggled every day with my responsibilities to deliver the content of the course in a manner that is manageable, comprehensible and actionable for my students. I've also struggled with the difficulties my students are facing outside of the course. But I'm absolutely confident that what I've gone through is literally nothing in comparison to what primary and secondary school teachers have gone through, and they have my utmost respect for everything they've accomplished in the last 9+ months (summer was, without a doubt, not time off for anyone in teaching this year, and usually isn't anyways). I genuinely wish local communities, school boards, county and state governments and the federal government would do more than just express their genuinely well-intentioned gratitude for all of the hard work that teachers have shouldered and actually make a concrete effort at some form of additional compensation and actual support with long term effects. If not I fear, like the article, that we will lose many, many brilliant teachers who will be unable to continue in the profession because they no longer have enough strength."
2020-11-30 14:14,"I keep seeing the ""this increased workload is really tough on teachers"" people and the ""this reduced instruction time is really tough on kids"" people talk past each other. Both can be, and are, true at the same time: teachers are absolutely working much harder than ever, but kids are simultaneously getting much less education and much less of the crucial social connection that school normally provides them. It's possible to have empathy for both, but we have no choice but to meet their needs in the frustratingly difficult middle somewhere until we can deploy a vaccine."
2020-11-30 13:59,"There are two great things about forcing everyone to go remote (i) it has made everyone aware that remote classes are an inferior replacement for most in person classes and (ii) it has forced everyone to become more tech savvy sooner.
Knowing that learning outcomes are not better online is actually a relief, you can’t blame the teachers for learning failures when the students or their parents simply refuse to participate. The demands on the teacher to be a tech maven (on top of being a teacher) have been unreasonable and unrealistic, yet teachers have tried hard to fill those demands...while under too much pressure, so they burn out. Devos was hired to destroy our educational system with covid’s help she’s coming close to succeeding."
2020-11-30 13:45,"For a start, maybe we shouldn’t make teachers, students, and parents pretend that this school year delivered a year of education to our children and pick up with the next year. Instead, we should throw this year out and accept that it was a total loss. Yes, throw it out. If a child was in fifth grade, they will do fifth grade again, and their low grades from this year will be wiped away. A very tiny percentage of students may be able to move on as if they had made normal progress, but even this isn’t wise (where are all their friends?). And maybe some high school seniors can attend college (as freshmen with a partially defective senior year). But let’s not cripple the vast majority by forcing them to move on with the scars of this truly lost year."
2020-11-30 13:51,"If you sift through the comments, you will notice why strong candidates for entering the profession choose not to do it. There is no respect for teachers. We are facing a considerable shortage of qualified candidates to enter the field, but the negative perception of teachers as overpaid babysitters never helps. Try teaching for a year and see if you can handle it, then feel free to comment. There will be plenty of opportunities in two years."
2020-11-30 13:53,"Hybrid teaching is a horrible idea. Where's the logic in it? Protecting kids three days a week but not the other two, or children in some grades and not others? And children are a very low COVID risk group anyway. Kids should be doing in-person schooling full time. It benefits everyone. The long term ill effects of being behind educationally due to difficulties with remote learning far outweigh the health risks of in-person schooling. And parents' careers and incomes are suffering due to the remote teaching ""system"" because, let's be honest, school functions also as a babysitter."
2020-11-30 13:42,"As an IT guy in a public school system, I feel for the teachers.  I will say, our particular tech setups are too much for the teachers, creating more of a hassle than aid, but if planned right would be highly effective.  One thing I will say though that surprises me is finding out just out tech-illiterate parents, teachers and students are. For those out there that don't know this yet. Tech literacy is just as important as being actually literate in the 21st-century economy.  It may seem really annoying having to use a computer and troubleshoot issues on the regular with students, but those two things are just as essential to learning as social studies. If anything, this pandemic will give everyone a crash course on how to use their computer to its fullest."
2020-11-30 13:45,"I can see how hard it is for the teachers, but the huge cost is being born by everyone as well. Every other day for my third grade kids is virtual, and is it a constant battle to get the to navigate the dozens of web programs, zoom links, tutoring them when they don’t understand the assignment, troubleshooting broken links and other myriad technical mishaps, calming them down when they have meltdown after meltdown because it is just so hard.  Oh and did I mention this is all DURING my full-time day job that I no longer have child care for?

And what do we gain—the kids are still at school every other day so at risk of infecting teachers or bringing the virus home. In-person school every day is the only thing that makes sense any more."
2020-11-30 14:17,"I believe some students and perhaps a few teachers thrive in this environment but I also believe that most students are probably losing ground and will only get further behind as this continues.  Needless to say, teachers cannot put in that much time on a long-term basis and they have already done that long-term, which means the quality of their efforts are more than likely in decline.

Why point this out?  Once the nation is vaccinated and we can go back to life as normal, I believe the educational system needs to consider putting students in the grades they were in when this all began.

A second option would be to assign them to the grade their age would put them but install the previous year's curriculum.

They will be at least a year and a half older and would be able to learn at a faster pace the curriculum for the lower grade.  In time, they might catch up to where they normally would have been but more importantly, there would be fewer gaps in what they needed to know.

The students who thrived in this environment could be identified and placed in separate classes that enabled them to continue with the curriculum they would have received pre-pandemic.

This is not the time to have false pride and group children by age, even if they had no Internet at home and could not attend school.  Start them off where they are educationally."
2020-11-30 14:19,"When teaching different learners, the unifying theme is learning itself.  For example, bridge, the card game, is a dynamic thinking environment where you learn to identify what you want (to prove) and set up models to get you what you want.  Getting students to memorizing for the test, which is what teaching has become, is not sustainable, but learning is.  It's what sustained us all these thousands of years they way soup had, before fast food culture came along."
2020-11-30 13:45,"“Distance Learning” and “Hybrid” models are being implemented very differently for a variety of reasons.  In my district, the largest in MN, the entire teaching force has an A/B rotation for students coming to school and a C group for students who are staying home.  You teach all of those kids all hour, every hour.  So you have half in front of you, and half at home on the computer, which means you need to sit in front of a computer so they can see/hear you and also teach to the student sin front of you in lass.  To teach in this model, every teaching tool needed to be rethought as what we did for the live students needed to be “the same” for at home students.  This created decision fatigue- you couldn’t proceed with the simplest of task without an issue arising for one group or the other.  I thought I had it bad until I spoke to an elementary school teach in the district (I am high school) and was blown away they they too were to teach in the same model. Think of a K-5 teacher and think of being tied to your desk- all they do to engage student in the classroom, and then think about trying to engage those as home- I teared up for her and the level of frustration and failure that you face day after day, working harder than you ever have in your career and to know that you are not engaging, not creating a love of learning.  And then to get comments from parents/public criticizing, asking why are their kids not motivated to work, “they loved school before”. It is like torture."
2020-11-30 14:12,"You left out one role in that list that teachers are asked to fill:  tech support.  I hear every day from students, ""it won't let me,"" as if their device has a will of its own.  They can stalk their favorite Tik Tok star, but they don't know how to re-boot their iPad or upload a document.  And they've quickly learned that they can claim their mic or their video doesn't work and we can't verify that.

Yes, my workload has doubled, and my district hasn't even begun hybrid teaching yet. What used to be simply passing out an assignment in class now takes about 10-20 clicks, after converting the assignment to a web-based work on the district platform, providing links, images, videos, to make each assignment more interesting.  I want my students to pass, not just because they need to learn, but also so I can reduce the number of parents I have to contact and document because our district anticipates scores of lawsuits about inaccessibility. 

Despite all the stress, all the hollow ""we're in this togethers,"" however, I'm still extremely grateful to have a job during this time.  

Thank you, too, for finally publishing something about the teachers in all this."
2020-11-30 14:10,Teachers should have priority in the vaccine distribution scheme. Right after medical professionals and first responders. They are essential workers.
2020-11-30 13:54,"Let's not mince words, teachers needs have been completely disregarded during the pandemic. Their safety and wellbeing are meaningless. The low pay they typically receive doesn't begin to cover the extraordinary time and effort they have been forced to exert to meet the needs of teaching remote and in person at this time. While I appreciate their professionalism and devotion to their students, they did not take a vow of selfless poverty nor sign on to risk their lives and that of their families. As an adjunct professor, I was used to abusive behavior from the administration, but after not being paid for the dozens and dozens of hours worked to convert my classes to remote teaching and watching the administration give themselves raises a few months back, I decided I had enough. I put myself FIRST ! I now do private tutoring. I make more money, set my schedule and rates, chose who I want to teach and have the respect of my students and their parents. To my colleagues, you owe your school and administrators absolutely nothing. Yes, it is hard to leave your students, but they are the administration's responsibility, not yours. Put yourself first, there are other opportunities out there now. You deserve better, resign today."
2020-11-30 14:11,"It would be great if there were a way to harness the knowledge and experience of retirees right now, if they could come in to teach segments, tell stories about their lives and things they’ve survived, and relieve some pressure on the teachers.  I realize this requires infrastructure, and could ask even more from a teacher, but if there was a way, it seems like one possibility for lightening this truly unprecedented burden on a profession that was already burdensome and undervalued.  I think of this remembering reading about a program that connected retirees to immigrants trying to learn English, a successful ELL program.  A creative federal administration could facilitate a response like this."
2020-11-30 14:23,"It should be clear by now that teachers are doing everything they can to give students and parents what they're asking for. The problem is that what they want from teachers isn't what they're actually asking for. What most people want, of course, is for school to go back to normal and the pandemic to be over. Of course, students and parents can't ask for this from teachers, because teachers can't possibly give it to them. So instead, they ask teachers for what they can ask for and blame teachers for not giving them what they want. A little self-reflection would go a long way here."
2020-11-30 14:34,"Before the pandemic we were already having problems recruiting young people to the teaching profession. Unless there's an immediate, drastic change, our K-12 educational system will collapse."
2020-11-30 14:35,"As usual, there is a solution to this problem but it requires the federal government to step forward with money, the unions to get out of the way and rigid administrators to think creatively.  

There are legions of retired teachers out there around the country.  Why not speed up the resurrection of their certificates (at no cost to the retiree), and assign them to a teacher in a school?  Pay the retired teacher the salary of a 5-year employee for full or part-time work.  Phase them out as vaccinations slowly tame the virus.

Every teacher should have an at-home retired teacher who can log in along with that teacher and field the tech questions, give one-on-one student help to remote learners, help the teacher through difficult times and really provide their seasoned guidance.  Many of us would welcome the additional income as well, especially if we did not retire with a full pension.

I'm a retired middle/high school English teacher.  I could easily do this and come up with writing assignments, grade papers, troubleshoot computer problems, help prepare students for ACT's, etc.  But I'm not doing it for free."
2020-11-30 14:40,"Teachers have long been asked to do the work of three people at a third of the wage of comparable Masters-level professionals. What's being unearthed in the pandemic is the degree to which teachers already bear an inordinate burden, often thanklessly, in the face of parental complaints, student disdain, public criticism, bureaucratic restraints, and woefully underfunded working conditions. I was in the profession for 15 years; I left completely drained. The talented teachers I've worked with, teaching five classes of 30+ students a day with all variety of needs and challenges, are the most remarkably talented and resilient people I have ever known. It's time that, pandemic or no pandemic, teachers are offered the dignity and respect they deserve. It's my hope that this pandemic will bring to light the sacrifices teachers make on a daily basis. In stable European countries, teachers are considered the backbone of society, as honored as doctors and lawyers, essential to perpetuating the health of a civil culture. Without valuing and supporting teachers, the ability of a democratic citizenry to think critically erodes. Imagine what happens to a society in which that value and support is lost, when teachers are demoralized and 60% leave the profession within the first five years. The last four years might offer some clues."
2020-11-30 14:41,"Hmmm.. first, I do feel empathy for teachers- many don’t get paid nearly enough and the pandemic has pushed limits, on everyone. Where do the unions fit in here? At our small district outside of LA, three elementary, one middle and one high school are all remote learning. My middle schooler while doing well, has maybe 3 hours of synchronous learning- or live learning with teacher and students online together a day. Asynchronous, when teachers dole out work to be done alone is increasing what seems daily with online collective work decreasing.  So back to my question about the teachers unions...seems that the union in our district is pretty powerful, the amount of live learning decreased considerable from the 1st quarter to second because that’s what the teachers wanted. My point is, yes there are districts across the country where pressure is becoming intenuable; there are however in my opinion instances where teachers use their union to get what they want. It’s usually that way, no?"
2020-11-30 14:42,"Thank you for this article. It has made me feel less alone. I’ve never wanted to quit my job so much. I’m 10 years into my career and seriously considering leaving a profession that I am passionate about. No matter what I do right now, I feel like I’m failing at all aspects of my life as teacher, wife, mom, and individual person. My school does hybrid, with simultaneous streaming for remote students. This means I am teaching students in my classroom and students via a camera at the same time. It is ineffective and extremely stressful. It’s hard on students, too, as some of them are on the computer for 8-10 hours a day. One of my seniors stated, “I’ve never done so much work yet learned so little.” Additionally, We are in a designated micro cluster zone. I’m lucky if I know the night before whether I am reporting to my building the next day or teaching from my basement. My admin is paying lip service to providing socio emotional support for staff, but what I really need is time and meaningful training. There are myriad reasons why I am fortunate and grateful, but at the end of the day I’m tired, burnt out, miserable, and pretty sure I’m going to quit doing something I used to love."
2020-11-30 14:45,"This article captures the emotional and physical toll this has taken on a workforce that was already struggling with burn-out and turnover. As a first grade teacher attempting to teach 28 children online, I can attest to the all of the burdens mentioned in this article: the technical difficulties, the absurdity of teaching phonics over zoom, the heartbreaking struggle of families as they navigate a loss of opportunity, health and stability due to this pandemic. 

One aspect of remote teaching that is not mentioned is the invasion of privacy that tens of millions of kids and teachers are experiencing without true consent or understanding. In my zoom lessons, I have seen shirtless and naked family members, witnessed private conflicts between family members, and have been allowed to see the living conditions of all of my students. Additionally, all of the other families can see every other small zoom square, hear every mistake a child makes, witness every time I have to correct a behavior. Interactions that should be private are now broadcast to an unknown and unseen audience, and I don’t feel like any of us agreed to this. 

I am deeply concerned for the privacy of my students, and my own. 6 year olds are being watched for hours by people they have never met. I am also on display, for a huge group who can see me but I can’t see them. It’s not just the other kids: anyone in any of these homes and apartments and shelters can see all of us. How is this not creeping everyone out?"
2020-11-30 14:50,"This article reveals the complexities of teaching during the pandemic. Let's start with expectations:
The Feds and State issue guidance that we are expected to have as close to a regular school year as possible.
Grades are expected to be 'at standard.'
Teaching is expected to be 'at standard' or 'above standard'
Students are expected to be in class.
Students are expected to run their own schedules, complete and submit work on time or be penalized.
Students, who might have struggled with routines during normal times are expected to have routines and follow those routines.
Districts are expected to account for all students being in class or they lose funding.
Parents are expected to run the show from home while working.
This is all expected to work flawlessly.

I expect that:
Students will not learn as much; not because they didn't try but because we are in the middle of a pandemic. They don't see their friends, they are in front of a screen 13 hours per day, their lives lack balance.
Teachers will burn out; not because they didn't try but because we are in the middle of a pandemic. They don't see their friends, they are in front of a screen 13 hours per day, their lives lack balance.
Parents will burn out; not because they didn't try but because we are in the middle of a pandemic. Because they have to make a living; because they may get evicted and they may be hungary.

I expect that our new President and his wife, an educator, will do something to help us all."
2020-11-30 14:51,"Teacher burnout is very real and this pandemic has just shone a spotlight on what is, in normal times, an extremely difficult profession. However, saying that the issues facing education due to the pandemic are stymieing the ""reopening of the economy"" is completely backwards. It is the virus and the failure of our leadership at all levels, from the president to state governors to local sheriffs, who refuse to take the steps necessary to mitigate it. There will be no economy until the virus is under control."
2020-11-30 14:28,"I work on the periphery of K-12 education and I cannot even wrap my head around how teachers get through day-to-day. How their students get through. How parents do this. 

We were not built for this pandemic. 

And the refusal (not failure, but refusal, because failure would imply they tried) of the current federal administration to imagine the needs of people at this time — teachers, students, parents, workers, nursing home residents — is criminal. Lying and braying commands (“open schools!”, “open [insert State]” has taken a lost year and made it infinitely worse. 

In hard times I remind myself that this too shall pass. This time, however, the damage is so profound that it offers no comfort."
2020-11-30 14:24,"I was devastated to learn that my child, who was allowed to attend in person due to severe dyslexia, never saw his teachers.  They quite literally gave written assignments with no instructional time.  When he told us this we simply didn’t believe him but his home room teacher said it was all true. Her in-person students, all with IEPs, were seated all day in front of computers, on different schedules, and not given any instructions.  She herself spent all day keeping the kids on their separate schedules and providing work to “her” remote students- she was merely a babysitter to the children sitting in her room. 
Our child is now remote so that he can see his teachers- for five minute lessons.  It’s not much but it’s something.  
We need guidance from a federal level- suspend testing and just keep the kids interested in learning.  Anything besides “here is a written assignment, Google the answers so you can go home”."
2020-11-30 14:34,"Former college lecturer here. I put in a year's worth of work in 9 months (you can do the math yourself: 34 weeks at 60-70 hours a week vs a 40 hour work week 50 weeks a year). As I told people, ""I don't have summers off, I just don't work 15 months a year."" Every K-12 teacher I know works harder than I ever did. That means they work harder than almost anyone reading this article, especially as their summers are getting eaten away by administrators and weaker unions. I've been several years out from teaching, and I still feel like I'm on vacation every day working 40 hour work weeks. Now I have this little thing called nights and a little something called weekends. I'm happier, more relaxed than I've been in a decade of teaching. I've thought about what it would take to get me back, and nothing less than a 6-figure salary would do it. I'm serious. $120,000 would make me consider going back. Consider it, not take it, consider it. America needs to stop villifying teachers and start treating teachers with respect, compensating them well, and bending over backwards to make their lives better and easier. As it is now, I would recommend to any young people that they steer far clear of the profession, and I would recommend to any teachers who are thinking about leaving to do so. There is a better life out there for you."
2020-11-30 14:28,"Teaching in the pandemic; ""This is not sustainable""....Neither is over whelming our hospitals and medical workers with Covid-19 patients. We are about to have a coronavirus vaccine and if we keep our heads, normalcy will return by the fall school season next year."
2020-11-30 14:17,"There is to be a vaccine-numerous ones according to the media- to effectively intervene with COVID-19’s chaos. Reinforced by the outcome of negligent, mismanaging, dis coordinating personally unaccountable elected and selected policymakers.

There are numerous available and accessible effective ways to minimize as well as prevent experienced “burn out.” For teachers as well as health professionals exhausted physically. Psychologically. Spiritually. And diverse people experiencing life’s daily challenges as existential threats. Real threats; not imagined ones. 
Perhaps people who know how to gather these materials and make  them known to those who can benefit could organize a range of media sites for easy access. Everyone is not familiar with YouTube, for example. Everyone doesn’t have a TV. A computer. Religious leaders can be trained in relevant techniques. They can transmit them to parishioners. 
Students who are social media adept, learning the relevant techniques can reverse their roles and help groups of teachers. Treated COVID 19 patients, saved in so many ways, if not “long haulers,” knowing the techniques, with necessary safety precautions, can also reverse roles and help diverse health workers.
An opportunity to also overcome rooted WE-THEY into a celebration of a much needed sustainable US."
2020-11-30 14:28,"This is a crisis. We can't just keep calling teachers, health care workers, and custodians heros, we need answers and action on a nationwide level. We need to listen to these workers and have them tell us what is needed and provide it."
2020-11-30 14:43,"I've been a building sub at both the MS and HS level in southeastern CT, and my town is employing a hybrid model. The kids have been handling this superbly, but no matter what improves post-Christmas, this was be a largely lost year for them. I feel for them, and for their teachers. That federal money wasn't provided for mass testing, enabling schools to stick to as normal a schedule as possible, has failed them--miserably. A national shame for which elected officials should be held accountable."
2020-11-30 14:56,"The simple solution would be to have teachers only teach in-person school, and live stream it for remote learners who could ask or answer questions from home.   We have the technology to do this and it sure beats teaching two classes with two different lesson plans.  School boards had a full six months to reimagine the current school year and it's surprising that doubling teachers' workload was the chosen path."
2020-11-30 14:03,"No surprise this is happening on Betsy DeVos's watch.

She is SoE precisely because of her lifelong mission to kill public education."
2020-11-30 14:37,"There it comes again! Another set of articles about schools and how miserable and dangerous is to teach our children. This is becoming ridiculous.What about healthcare workers, grocery store workers, agriculture workers, people working in meatpacking plants-list goes on and on.
What makes teachers so special and needing more attention than others? High level burnout has been also seen in Healthcare industry and Police Force, even before pandemic. We all have to work and share inconveniences and stress of life in pandemic.Stop glorifying one group!"
2020-11-30 14:43,Maybe we can have school in the restaurants and bars since the government seems to want to keep them open for some reason.
2020-11-30 14:55,Actually my son’s Endocronologist hasn’t seen him in person since last year. It’s frustrating but her crowded office determined it wasn’t safe for her and many other doctors to return in person. I wish everyone would have a little more empathy and realize we’re all doing the best we can with a horrible situation.
2020-11-30 14:58,"When people ""urge self-care"" to teachers, it implicitly blames teachers for the lack of work-life balance. When one has to work 12+ hours per day, self-care is not possible. And if a teacher actually does self-care, they are vilified for neglecting their students.

The notion of self-care looks like a matter of responsibility, but here it is a form of toxic individualism. ""Do it yourself,"" we tell teachers, nurses, and doctors, thinking we are entitled not just to their care but their sacrifices too."
2020-11-30 15:20,"I am a public high school biology teacher.  We need to ensure that distance learning is consistent across school districts; for example, in my district, students receive 4 50 minute periods per day with the option of attending a drop in 90 minute office hours period with any teacher, all via Zoom.  Compared to the commenter from Montana whose dyslexic child was receiving 5 minutes per day per teacher, that is a huge difference.

If we had leadership ensuring high quality, consistent distance learning (instead of ""local control""), perhaps we would have fewer attempts to undermine it.

I just got blocked from a parenting group on facebook (I am a parent) for suggesting that teaching was the teacher's responsibility but that learning and earning grades were the student's and family's responsibility, and that high school students who are failing right now could remediate their skills at community college. This apparently was excessively insulting on my part.  These (wealthy and privileged) parents cannot back distance learning and said that they can't focus on equity, because ALL they want is to reopen schools in the midst of skyrocketing cases. They have said COVID only kills people past their average lifespan or people who don't take care of themselves.  They worked very hard to loosen state metrics for opening schools.

We are in the middle of a pandemic.  Distance learning allows for greater consistency than the yoyo of hybrid and quarantine.  It is time to support it."
2020-11-30 15:26,"Perhaps the school district could have their best teachers concentrate on recording the classes which would give the remaining teachers  break.  Teachers assistants could be employed after hours to help with questions and homework.  To help those in need the district should send a letter to all students or their parents with information on where to get help. My suggestions may, or. May not, be workable, but there are enough people reading this article and commenting that some will suggest solutions."
2020-11-30 15:30,"Teacher spouse here for 22 years, and parent of a middle-school virtual learner. Teachers that are also parents have even more difficulty.

2020-11-30 15:33,"Thanks for this article. I'm in my first year of teaching, at a private elementary school in Southern California. This year has been exceptionally hard, and three things really stand out to me: (1) Teaching has long been considered ""women's work,"" so it is no surprise to me, in a country that expects so much from women and mothers yet suffers from such deep misogyny, that teachers are also expected to carry everyone else's burdens. (2) Caring is not compensation. Just because someone enjoys their job or finds that their job aligns with their personal values doesn't mean that the enjoyment is a reward that pays the bills. (3) Parents are stressed, too, and I totally understand that. You've got a job and maybe two kids to help with distance learning. My job is that *times 15* (30 kids), and I also have a life and family outside of work. So cut me some slack."
2020-11-30 15:03,I feel for the teachers.  The added bureaucracy from the administrators must be totally draining.  Not only must live and hybrid teaching be difficult I can only guess at all the non value added bureaucracy they must deal with from school administrators who are tracking and micromanaging meaningless metrics and statistics.  This current environment is a bureaucrats dream for adding non value added work.
2020-11-30 15:17,"Keep bashing teachers, don’t listen to their concerns, and this is what you get. Every teacher I know is taking early retirement."
2020-11-30 15:02,"Sounds like the problem might be the pretense that good learning can happen during the pandemic, especially when the federal government refuses to help! 
People need to stop pretending they can have it all like there’s no pandemic! 
This is what happens when the government is run by crooks at the very highest level who would rather give money through tax breaks to their wealthy friends, than to people and institutions that really need it, like schools! 
Of course, it’s a mess, and it will continue to be a mess until the new administration can provide some help, if the other party can let them and not sabotage them, and until the vaccine can be widely available! Otherwise, it’s going to be a mess for a while longer as we get out Donald Trump’s chaos!"
2020-11-30 15:16,"And Zuckerberg, whose entire business is based on tech other people worked to design and create (and their work was based on middle class tax payer money employed for fundamental research that private  companies wouldn’t even touch because there was not profit in it) makes billions and spends hundreds of millions a year on avoiding his taxes (just another thank you to the American Middle class tax payers).  

This goes for all of Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and Ultra wealthy investors - who con us all into believing that we need them,’when they couldn’t function without the rule of law, government (“our” not “the”) regulations, infrastructure- and yes the teachers who teach our children, the next generation of Americans.

That teachers are struggling and, as an added slap in the face,’are paid so little, is the clearest picture of what Finance and the ultra wealthy have done to corrupt both our democracy and our capitalism.

At some point, we have to take back our capitalism from these corrupt Con men, and reward - and provide support to - those who actually contribute to our American community -‘not those who extract as much as they can take."

2020-11-30 15:27,"Seriously, this infuriates me. Who thought teachers could do both-teach in-person and remotely? As a communications professional working with Fortune 500 companies, it never ceases to amaze me how “leaders” somehow design massive, complex processes that are deeply flawed and unsustainable in reality. If it looks too good to be true on paper, it probably is. 12-he/day nursing models, massive open work environments, centralized IT, this scheme. The list is endless. The governance and process architects have no clothes!!!"

2020-11-30 15:11,"At least this pandemic has brought into sharp focus the lie that our institutional education systems have anything to do with true learning, investment in our future, or the health and well-being of any of the students or teachers involved in it.

Apparently, the true purpose of our schools is to keep kids occupied while their parents slave away in an exploitative economic system, making profits for oligarchs who have no concern for work-life balance or any other societal needs—and to condition the kids to accept the same eventual fate as their parents."
2020-11-30 15:41,"If the country had been in a forward-thinking mindset in recent years, demand would already have produced AR or VR to make simultaneous live and remote teaching (and most work or communication) seamless. The development of such technologies has lagged not because of their unavailability or because industry has failed to respond, but because of insufficient demand -- insufficient curiosity and even outright resistance on the part of the public -- including many educators -- too much pooh-poohing, too much looking backward in hopes of recapturing the easier economy of the 1950's, and not enough thinking about the future. And, of course, public education has never been fully funded to begin with. Someday we will be on Mars, and to do that we will have to adapt. Soon enough we will experience the more serious effects of climate change, and to survive and thrive we will need to embrace technologies that transcend space and time. The world at large is advancing and people who aren't on board with working with live and remote people and machines at the same time will be left behind. Look forward and use the tools we have."
2020-11-30 15:42,"Coming from a corporate training background and having some experience with virtual instructor led training, I can only hope that the school administrations will realize that hybrid teaching is taking the worst of both worlds. Virtual instructor led training has it's benefits, such as wider choice of learning media and formats with option to select modularized content, and most of all less need for full-time presence, which can give instructors more time for prep and yes, for themselves. Face-to-face training on the other hand needs constant contact, and is more immediate and conversational, with instant feedback from the learners. All that needs to be compensated for when teaching virtually. But expecting effective learning when treating kids to jam packed schedules of 1 hour lessons via screen, while balancing a classroom full of face-to-face students is going to be messy at best. I would love to see some support from versed online instruction specialists for the general education system to help make best use while not wearing out the teachers."
2020-11-30 15:42,"My school district, the Los Angeles Unified, has gone entirely to remote, or ""Distance"", learning, with a schedule that reduces my time with each class from 285 minutes per week to 140 minutes per week.  Classes meet every other day on Tuesdays through Thursdays, and every other Monday I see half my classes one hour each for a ""catch up and get help"" day.

I teach children of color who are also children of poverty.  I have no idea how many are food-insecure or are dealing with the possibility of losing their home.

I teach seventh-grade Social Studies, and am doing the best I can to cover the curriculum with the tools available to me.  Mostly, however, I'm providing a safe, cheerful environment for my students where they can be encouraged and try to feel normal.  I encourage them to bring their pets to class, and have a number of kittens/cats/small dogs, a turtle and a couple of birds.  My attendance rate is higher than most of the other teachers in my school according to the counselors.

I'm getting less exercise, I've gained almost ten pounds, and I'm experiencing a higher rate of fatigue, but I also know this will not go on for longer than the rest of the school years.  I'm the grown-up, and have to present myself in a certain way for my students.  Their lives are infinitely harder than mine right now."
2020-11-30 15:43,"I’m a retired teacher. I can’t imagine how it must be for teachers right now.  This article is a good insight into how hard they are working.  It was hard enough before the pandemic and now most teachers are in reality, doing two jobs, as they have to put in the in person time and then do it  over again with online students. The former involves being a “front line” worker and putting self and family in potential danger from Covid.  The second requires a lot of technical skills and hours online preparing and presenting material.  Then there’s the grading and recording and behavior issues both in person and now on line.  Yes, teachers have always done this,  but now it’s  like having two jobs, and teaching has always been more than a full time job.

Our teachers need our support.  This could be a kind word or an appreciative note.  This could and should also be local, state and government help for materials, supplies, PPEs, computers and high speed networks, extra personnel, whatever it takes to keep teachers and our children safe and able to get through this time without massive burnout and without contracting Covid."
2020-11-30 15:44,"To be sure, the current effort to provide good quality educational services to elementary and secondary age students represents a clear example of the art muddling through. While the pandemic has presented a challenge, it has also forced the nation to re-think systems of instructional delivery going forward.  

 While we are clearly in an information age, the general methods of educational delivery are still rooted in an industrial model. The technology needed to provide effective remote learning has evolved significantly in recent decades.   As such,the future of education will be based on a hybrid model of instructional delivery. 

The issue to be resolved, is whether educators will embrace the new reality, or resist it.  Regardless, the change is under way and it will be controlled by educators, or someone else."
2020-11-30 15:47,"I am a high school physics teacher and also teach pre-service “student” science teachers at the local university. While we are burning teachers out who are currently teaching, we are doing little to inspire a new batch of teachers to replace them. My student teachers are experiencing the same burnout that I am due to lack of resources, student motivation and inexperience with many of the digital platforms that were thrust upon us in March. Moreover, these student teachers will have no actual classroom experience when (if?) we return to in person learning. So who will replace teachers who opt to leave their profession? 

Articles like this underscore the importance of schools to the basic functioning of our society. Yet we continue to be underfunded and under appreciated. From all I have read, teachers and school age children will be at the back of the line for the vaccines when the come available. Guess we aren’t that important after all."
2020-11-30 15:48,"This is so hard. I'm a retired teacher and I've been working with 826Boston tutoring high school students with their college essays via zoom. The classroom teachers are working as hard as they can to hold it together, but the technical challenges, keeping any sense of ""classroom"" in a virtual space on a screen, the pressures on the students, the distractions of family-- it's near impossible to keep any kind of continuity going for any but the most dedicated, focused students and their families. 
These students, families, and teachers need every bit of compassion, understanding, and support that we can give them if this country is to have any future at all."
2020-11-30 15:48,"Thank you for this article, finally revealing the truth about the education profession during the pandemic. I am a young woman whose parents have been teachers in low income public schools for the last 36  years. They are the hardest workers I know. 

I came here to write a comment because I think the most important point, is that the pandemic merely exposed the truth of the teaching profession. The lack of respect in our society, underpayment —my father hasn’t had a raise in his district in 15 years, can you imagine any other profession where this would be acceptable if your yearly reviews were consistently the highest possible? — and asking schools and teachers to be more social worker than educator. Does this sound like an environment that anyone in any profession could truly thrive in? And yet, my parents joy and true care for their students wins out, but the institution isn’t sustainable as is. 


One of the greatest gift my parents have given me is encouragement to NOT become an educator. I am now in law school instead, and the vastly different amounts of respect between our professions is apparent, even at this early stage of mine. Teaching is in my blood, I should have carried on the tradition, and wanted to, but the immense and often impossible self sacrifice the profession now requires doesn’t translate into a living wage, or respect for molding and caring for young minds it deserves. They wanted better for me. That shouldn’t be a truth in our society, but it is."
2020-11-30 15:51,"This is difficult and exhausting for everyone, and I feel for the teachers. Hybrid learning just never made sense to me since you still get a lot of the virus risk for little return AND you have to support two learning platforms, which falls solely on the teachers. I have a special needs child who is attending only remotely because it just didn't seem to make sense to send him to school twice a week for a couple hours of in-person learning and risk everyone's health. So... he is home with me while I try to work full-time and tend to his academic, technology, social, and physical needs. Everyone is exhausted and stressed out and it is definitely not sustainable. But we all need to remember that this too shall pass. And perhaps we will all be more grateful for teachers and more supportive of public schools when things get back to normal. One can hope."
2020-11-30 15:32,I’m amazed that teachers are expected to teach both in the classroom and online often at the same time as some school districts are requiring. A good friend just quit. You really can’t physically or mentally be in two places at once. Nor is teaching half the students in person half the work. This was simply done so that administrations didn’t have to hire the teachers they need.  It’s still all about money pretending to care about kids.
2020-11-30 15:41,I'm a special education teacher. This is my 15th and final school year. I hope that society starts picking up some of the responsibilities that they have abdicated and left schools to deal with. Until then the profession is going to continue to hemorrhage teachers.

Teachers are always last in line in the discussion on the merits of reopening versus remote learning, and simply an afterthought in the struggle of surviving Covid 19. My wife for one - a teacher of 15 years - is hanging on by a thread, has vowed this is her last year teaching no matter what, and has joined a “teachers looking to leave the profession” support group that is growing by dozens by the day."

Yet in education we still have the equivalent of Miss Crabtree wanting to stand in front of a chalkboard and teach the Little Rascals. Time for the whining to end and for educators to educate themselves on how to learn and adapt. Set examples for the children you are suppose to be preparing for the future."

I am so tired of being undervalued and overstressed and criticized for not doing enough, or for not putting my life at risk, or being lazy...I could go on. Thank you."
2020-11-30 15:37,Ir is a travesty that teachers struggle to get testing. We are obviously not as important as Big 10 football players.

2020-11-30 15:35,"As a former eighth-grade English teacher, I was never caught up.   With the subject matter encompassing all language arrts, writing portfolios, weekly spelling and vocab quizzes, a literature text book to get through, a grammar text book, independent reading, book reports, at least one term paper, and prepping for statewide exams, never being caught up was a given.  Of course, I'll work has to be graded with thoughtful comments, and hours, and hours, and hours, of reading.  Even with the help of an aide once a week to correct quizzes, It was an enormous job.

I think about teachers everyday, I pray for them.  I pray for their students, and I send them both love.  This is so heartbreaking, and unsustainable almost sounds like a euphemism."

2020-11-30 15:55,"Look at how our educational system in general and teachers in specific are suffering because of social-economic inequity in America !  Teachers calling millionaires begging for funds to connect Internet?  Working 13 hour days because no funds are available to hire helpers?  Expecting teachers to be counselors, nutritionists and social workers because raising the next generation of Americans is not seen as being as valuable as sending armies and drones all over the world to battle and bomb nations into compliance with our policy objectives? 

The day is coming in America, and sooner that many realize, when poor people (who used to be middle class people) will begin voting as a block.  And when that happens, we will be demanding increases in human concerns like:  teachers' wages, child care, health care, elder care, food safety, immigration sanity. 

Right now 2/3 of both Republicans and Democrats are controlled by the oligarchs' implementation of plutocracy in the U.S. Congress.  But this isn't going to last forever.  Even with Biden's direct falsehood of  ""a few hundred billionaires are not the problem"" -- when in fact their profits off increased GDP and worker efficiency is EXACTLY the problem -- cannot last forever.  

The the explosion of interest in the DSA has everything to do with the country's misplaced priorities around the God of profit at enforced at the swordpoint of our mighty military power.  Everything is based on coercion and force.   This cannot long endure."
2020-11-30 15:56,"I taught  young pre-school aged children for 6 years, but found the excessive data collection draining and not beneficial to the children. I left the profession this summer because I felt the school system did not truly value teachers and staff as human beings. The irony is that the children need present, grounded and solid human beings in the classroom, but the system is set up in a way that constantly pushes staff to the brink of exhaustion.

I can’t help but feel enormously grateful that I changed careers when I did. I miss the kids, but I refuse to be a martyr. As the saying goes: you can’t pour from an empty cup."
2020-11-30 15:57,"I disagree with readers' views that teachers are unappreciated. They are more appreciated than most workers; they just don't think they are. In fact, Americans don't appreciate other essential employees. What about truck drivers? Stockers? Farmers? We don't even think about them. Many teachers have the benefits of union membership, tenure, full benefits, job demand, flexible schedules, and frequent raises. Most American employees aren't that lucky. Teachers aren't unique. We are all burned out. Everyone has excessive demands placed on them now, or even worse, no job or income. Perhaps some gratitude is in order here. Signed, a part time traveling healthcare worker."

2020-11-30 16:07,"I was hesitant to post a comment, but reading through the ideas presented, I feel the need to weigh in. I'm a veteran NYC middle school science teacher, who has been teaching for 17 years. This article does a great job of addressing the challenges that teachers have been facing since the spring, and, no, I did not have the spring off. I am sorry that some parents were left with the impression that their teachers were AWOL. I can assure you, in the vast majority of cases, they were not.

What remote and hybrid learning has done, more than anything else, is highlight parental responsibilities in their own children's learning. I ask parents who complain about the time they need to put in now. Were you reading to your children before this (if they were young)? Were you sitting down with them, and going through their homework to make sure they understood it? Were you reaching out to teachers when your child seemed to be struggling? If you were, then the amount of work you are putting in now should not be a surprise, and if you are one of my parents, thank you. This used to be the expectation when I was in school. Now we teachers only hope for it. 

To parents who were not. I'm sorry, but successfully educating a child involves a partnership between parents and children. I know that I am doing my best to live up to my end of the partnership. Are you?"
2020-11-30 16:24,"Thank you for this article. I'm 16 years into Middle School teaching, and have it easier than my colleagues who teach in less well funded schools. However, this has been one of the hardest years. Aside from the regular teaching of racial literacy, writing, reading, citizenship, social work, policing, and therapy that we do for students(and Covid-19 protocols to keep us all safe), the new insomnia that I and many of my coteachers are having due to the stress of 2020 has made a hard job even worse. Hang in there, everyone; we will make it!"
2020-11-30 16:28,"Great article that clearly explains the Herculean effort required to teach our country’s children during this pandemic. I’m the parent of a college graduate and the wife of a high school teacher, so I have seen our public schools from both perspectives. My conclusion? The work that teachers do is among the most difficult and important work done by anyone in our society!! Teachers deserve our respect and gratitude. I’m in awe of the work they do every day to help our children (the literal future of our country) grow, learn, and develop into creative and critically-thinking adults. Thank you, teachers, for devoting your careers to such a huge and important task!"
2020-11-30 16:30,"The challenge lies in translating brick and mortar classroom lesson plans for teaching online.  If school districts can provide the lesson plans that have been modified for online teaching and also pre-recorded lessons for those who are either choosing to learn remotely, then that would free up a lot of time for teachers to do all the things they usually do—teacher, parent, nurse, counselor, coach, partner, friend..."
2020-11-30 16:35,"Like the science teacher in the article, I’ve had to rework everything. I agreed to take an extra section of 28 more at the beginning of the year to help with staffing, when my county assured us that they had a plan to separate teachers based on whether they planned to teach on a hybrid plan at school or 100% online for the families that opted for that. Long story short, our cases rose and we started our year fully online. The county abandoned their initial plan and now I will have to teach the hybrid and all-online students at the same time. I feel swamped and dread the point where students return. Not sure I’ll be able to keep up with it all and feel that I’m doing an acceptable job for all of them."
2020-11-30 16:37,"The only way this could possibly work is to bring the teacher to student ratio to no more than 10:1, or even lower. That way the class becomes the size of a team and the teacher is the manager/coach. Very small class sizes are an absolute must for students connecting to each other and to a teacher. Even without a pandemic it is crucial. Hire teachers! Make it a national project to put education dollars into hiring teachers. And yes, internet. That's important, but it is the human connection that matters."

2020-11-30 16:39,"This is part of the continuum of the lack of respect society has for teachers. Low pay, always looking over your shoulder with the fear you may hav esaid one word that offended one student and the list goes on. Teachers are dedicated to the well-being of their students through their education. They are also counselors, absentee parents, social workers. Those who have never taught think it is easy. In reality it is a job that challenges and drains many emotional resources teachers have. And there is no ""leaving work"" for good teacher as troubled students' lives follow you home."
2020-11-30 16:46,"Thank you for this article. I have been in public education for 21 years- as a classroom teacher, then school counselor, and now a specialist at my district’s central office. Educators have always been degraded and under appreciated by our society at large, I believe because education is a woman dominated field. On top of the low salaries, ridiculous amount of work, incredible obstacles, and stress, educators are now being tasked with an impossible job of hybrid teaching during a deadly pandemic. Luckily my district chose to create a robust virtual only education program for the first semester, which is going well and receiving praise from even the most apprehensive parents. But the teachers are still working harder and longer than ever before. They are stressed, depressed, anxious, overwhelmed, and burnt out. My district already recruits anyone with a pulse off the street to substitute or be a contingent teacher. I cannot imagine the teacher shortage in the coming years. It’s sad that such an intrinsically rewarding, important, and noble profession is treated this way."
2020-11-30 16:47,"Teaching was a mid-life career change for me, so I don't have the years invested in a district to entice me to stay in the field to receive a pension. There is simply no way I will return to the classroom next fall after this experience teaching during a pandemic. I predict there is going to be a tidal wave of people leaving the profession this summer."
2020-11-30 16:48,"Meanwhile, highly successful, award-winning teachers who want to work part-time are ignored.

2020-11-30 15:43,"Thank you fellow teachers for aptly articulating culminating thoughts on what we are going through. Currently, some of my colleagues are ver sick from covid. Now their spouses are sick too, within no one to care for their own children or substitute their classes for those students who are strongly not quarantined. The superintendent make decisions solely based on parent complaints. My friends that are stay at home
moms are constantly complaining about online learning because their children and most children cannot engage in this format. And they are the lucky one with wifi and quality online instruction. They don’t have empathy and don’t realize that working teachers have no idea what’s going on in their own homes whilst their kids are online learning. Then there are the less fortunate. Those with poor wifi. As of early November, many NYC students still had not received devices and are trying to use phones for online learning. At a time where we should be supporting educators, entitled parents are constantly complaining. My friend sent an assignment for her students in Yonkers and was told to F off by a parent. It’s all beyond reason. I teach kindergarten and work with students that are in high exposure homes. I need to tie their shoes, to help them hold a pencil. There is no social distancing in elementary school. It’s a mess with no clean solution. Parents hover during online learning and give their children answers. No critical thinking can develop. Please support teachers"
2020-11-30 16:02,I went to school to be a teacher. Walked across the stage and thought no way! Spent the next thirty five years working for a very good grocery chain. Now retired and working with young kids. Destiny! Teaching is a Hard job! If one teaches in the public school sector the job gets harder! The system is designed for the kids to fail! And the teachers all too often must fend for themselves. The education system in America badly needs restructuring! And Covid isn't helping the situation. Betsy DeVos is gone! It's time to overhaul the American education system and make the education system a system that truly educates our children.
2020-11-30 15:59,"Learning, while a lethal viral pandemia is being let loose by an irresponsible bully in-chief, is an impossible task for many students, let alone for overburdened teachers doing double duty...to exhaustion. It reminds some of us, as medical residents, the long hours while on-call, always tired out, and with symptoms of depression if not despair. Of course, it was a battle that bore fruits...for the experience and dedication it implied; and, as important, the knowledge it was a temporary ""slave-like job that, eventually, paid for itself. Similarly with teachers, the current overtaxing in time and effort shall pass, especially once mass vaccination takes place next year. As if we didn't know already, teachers and nurses remains the most respected, if not loved, professions in the world. And all of us are better for it, however undeserving when we become critical of their efforts when they fail our full expectations. Now, whosoever thinks is perfect, free of flaws, please raise your hand. No one? Thought so!"
2020-11-30 16:21,"After reading this article and the readers' comments, I have these words: Stop exploitation of teachers!  Nobody should work more than 8 hrs. per day. (BTW,  I wonder if school administrators work more than 8 hrs. per day).  I never thought that I would resort to and agree with the otherwise failing Marxists' agenda:  8 hrs. to the society (namely work), 8 hrs. of sleep, and 8 hrs. for personal life.  There is place for unions and hard bargaining, and it is now, for the teachers!  If society wants children to be educated, then the taxes have to go up to hire enough teachers so that nobody teaches more than 8 hrs. per day!"
2020-11-30 16:40,"Every professional who has a service oriented job is facing the same challenges.  Imagine how it must feel to be a public defender trying to effective represent defendants in criminal matters right now. Yet only teachers get to complain and refuse to work. I wish teachers would stop acting like disgruntled factory workers and instead act like the professionals they are supposed to be.  Is being a teacher a calling, or just a way to collect a city pension?"
2020-11-30 16:29,"When you put this situation in the context of (a) America's de facto herd immunity response to COVID-19, (b) the falsehood that 'children don't/can't transmit the virus', (c) the hatred for unions--and teacher unions in particular--that is so evident in so many of the comments made in these electronic pages over the past months, and (d) the unspoken (and unproven) assertion that full distance learning with the goal of promoting the safety of the entire community 'doesn't work'--one realizes that what is truly at stake is the loss of an entire generation of *teachers*--due to the failure of American society to provide the minimal necessary humane support for the work of these 'essential workers'. 

Teachers--as has been emphasized for ER and ICU doctors and nurses--did not accept their evident vocations *to become martyrs*. They deserve *all* the effective support, respect and protection that this society can muster.

The alternative is the loss of the most compassionate members of our society from the 'front lines'.

2020-11-30 16:10,"I’m one of the “part time” teachers that took 17 classes this summer. I took classes on every online learning platform I could find. I built my online classroom before the district mandated a class on how to use it. I spent that 16 hours teaching the instructor and other teachers how to do things easier. I earned advanced certification in three online learning platforms that our district uses that our “teacher” didn’t have. 
I recorded demonstration videos and uploaded them to my online classroom. All to find out that most of my students couldn’t get computers to access the content. I have a cart of iPads for in class use and use the online classes I spent an entire summer of 13 hour days setting up. 
I was getting hounded by administrators for a lesson plan. I added them to my online class so they could see the entire year planned out by the minute.
I didn’t get paid a dime for all the extra work I put in. Work that would have gone to waste if I hadn’t begged for iPads for my class. 
Burned out is an understatement. Teachers that are “part time” work as many if not more hours for their students with zero benefits."
2020-11-30 15:52,"I am a NYC teacher and, like all teachers, have been navigating remote and hybrid teaching, as well as the constant schedule changes, lack of clarity and abrupt closures and re-openings this city seems determined to inflict on all of us. The majority of my students don’t like remote learning any more than I like remote teaching. But they are frightened of returning to class and passing COVID on to their elderly relatives. They know that many of their peers do not come to school on COVID testing days. I understand completely: I want to be back in a safe classroom ASAP.

The students who show up regularly for remote class, or whose parents make an attempt to communicate when things are difficult, tend to do well in remote settings.  Yet, somehow, having students who don’t log on, or whose parents don’t read emails or messages or prioritize education in any way, is somehow the fault of that tired, careless, easy trope: the “lazy teacher”."
2020-11-30 16:01,"It is amazing to read all of the comments here about how hard teachers work, putting in 12 hour days , how underpaid they are, etc. You would think that these poor souls are risking their lives by going to work every day, even though a school may be the safest place from COVID.
However: They work 9 months a year, get paid for 12. They do not work weekends. They have at least  3 weeks off during those 9 months. They have a job with security- while the parents of many of their pupils have lost their jobs. They have great benefits, including the health care those same parents may have lost.
 How can a teacher’s stress be compared to that of a paramedic picking up an 80 year old  With respiratory difficulty? Or that of a nursing assistant caring for a COVID positive patient? Or that of an ER nurse treating an obese man with a cough? Or even a restaurant owner who is prevented from making enough money to pay his employees or even keep his business open, let alone worry about his own finances.
 As for those teachers terrified about getting COVID  from the classroom perhaps they should not be teaching science or mathematics; they do not appear to understand statistics."
2020-11-30 16:27,"Hybrid teaching is not sustainable though virtual learning is. 

To put it more bluntly, I say throw the concept of hybrid learning into the trash can. Nice try but it doesn't work. But do not give up on the idea that teaching via the internet, for this way of teaching and learning can accomplish many goals, and if done right, can often prove better than the teaching that takes place in the face-to-face environment.

Teaching via the internet is not only sustainable it but if done right can accomplish much.

To put it another way, hybrid teaching is just one form of vitual"
2020-11-30 16:04,"@teachers- give ourselves a break. For the last two decades this country has blamed teachers for every social ill that widens the opportunity gap, and used schools to compensate for every ignored social responsibility. We have to stop propagating the illusion that teachers / schools are somehow anything than qualified people doing their job of educating. We're not everything to these kids, nor should we be. We'll take the heat no matter what, so just let yourself survive this as positively as possible so you'll be there another day for the kids and yourself. It's okay that every other institituion of society does its part as well for these kids."
2020-11-30 16:36,"Do not add the responsibility of jump-starting the economy to my job description as an educator. Just, no. We are doing the best we can. No one took the spring off. We were just as shell-shocked as anyone by what we thought would be a 2-3 week stint of remote teaching. It is completely galling that people would dare say it is teachers’ turn to shoulder the burden, when we’ve been doing it all along, pandemic or not."
2020-11-30 16:52,"I worked as a long-term sub in inner city Los Angeles, for the better part of last year. As soon as we closed due to the pandemic, I quit, because I knew that there was going to be a tremendously outsized increase in required work and no increase in pay or any semblance of cogent direction with respect to how to proceed.

I understand that real teachers have to deal with this every day of their careers, and I have been disgusted by the way that the media has slanted conversations about education from the standpoint of how hard education is on parents. 

In my opinion, parents who do not teach have absolutely no idea how hard it is to deal with their children, and real teachers are not appreciated at all. 

It didn't surprise me at all that folks would feel burned out weeks into Covid - the administrators, the school districts, bureaucrats, etc., are all complicit  in a system which, in many districts, does not allow resources or competence to filter down, and engenders  a Darwinian approach to facilitating learning, often putting all the pressure on the backs of people who get paid less than $75,000/year. 

12+ hrs/day, these people have to deal with parents' problems, and parents get the spotlight, because teachers are supposed to be selfless. This whole education system is backwards and that's why I quit."

At our public school, second grade is when the kids start doing lots of projects on iPads (paid for by the PTO) so maybe it was an easier transition for her. My kindergartener’s teacher is not doing that well. My daughter cries everyday, hiding under the table, begging me to let her get off zoom."
2020-11-30 16:58,"Thank you. I've taught at all levels over the years, but nothing compares with what my daughter is currently going thru. She's teaching Spanish remotely, while her husband works at home with a heavier workload and constant zoom sessions AND her 10-year-old tries to attend school remotely -- AND her school offers a hybrid model for students. I'm seriously worried about her mental and physical health -- and whether she can stay in the profession. It's hard enough adapting instruction for zoom, dealing with student and parent email, working out a new system of evaluation and feedback -- She also has to try to keep her son on track, contacting his teachers for help with his assignments, and deal with the inevitable frustration and short tempers. We already have terrible teacher retention. I can't imagine where we're going to end up after all this."

2020-11-30 16:11,I almost became a teacher. And then I read things like this and am grateful every day that I didn't go into that profession. Teachers are criminally underpaid and unappreciated in this country. It's beyond disgraceful what the education system has become in the United States.
2020-11-30 16:43,"For everyone in the comments who is saying that teacher efforts are insufficient.... what would you consider to be ""sufficient"" effort? How much time should your kid's teacher spend with your kid for it to be ""acceptable"" effort?

Because let me tell you, my sister is a middle school history teacher. Pre-pandemic, she had 4, 1-hour long, classes of 25 kids per day, plus she supervised a study-hall period. For those counting, that's 100 students just in her history classes (lets forget about the study hall kids for now, and lets also pretend that all of her students now are fully remote, which is not actually the case, but which makes the math easier). 

If she spent a scant 5 minutes one-on-one per day with each of those 100 students, that's over 8 hours right there. When do you expect her to actually teach? Or grade assignments? Or plan for lessons? 

Oh, and where do you expect her to get the fancy audio/video setup necessary for her to lead remote classes? Her school certainly did not provide either the funds or the equipment, so where do you think that it came from? That's right - her pocket. How many of you need to pay out-of-pocket for the equipment and programs that you need to do your work every day? 

What, exactly, do you want?

Most of the commenters here seem to actually want private tutors - not teachers. And if that is the case, then I suggest that you pony up for that tutor and set up homeschooling for your kids."

The blow-back and aggression from people who think our jobs are easy because we ""get summers off"" is insulting and demoralizing; as if we're only working when we're inside the classroom.

Everyone is experiencing trauma from this but I worry about 1) the toll this is taking on our youngest generation and 2) the toll this is taking on the education profession.

There ARE schools doing this well. We should study them and apply the learnings nationwide. Worst case, we need to do a post-mortem to figure out a plan of action in case there's another pandemic at some point. Starting from scratch -- as Trump did, when he threw out the Obama playbook -- is just dumb."

The educational system, which could have served the needs children and acted as an equalizer of opportunity, chose to pursue a fantasy. Aided, I’m sorry to say, by irresponsible pediatricians and psychologists, looking for their fifteen minutes of fame with grand pronouncements on how children would suffer if they weren’t allowed to have face-to-face instruction. 

Not that I have any solution to offer here. The vote for Donald Trump shows that many Americans are attracted to stupid ideas and 100% predictable failures. Given that a large number of school boards are elected by such people, the prospects for improvement don’t look good. 

The wealthy and well-educated are often accused of “opportunity hoarding”, but the real problem here is opportunity squandering, aided and abetted by people who should have known better."
2020-11-30 11:46,"I get that this is tough. I did the job of two teachers on top of my full time job last spring. Not sustainable at all. I hope the teachers enjoyed having last spring off (I know my kids’ teachers didn’t do much for those 3 months). Now it’s the teachers turn for double duty. Oh and by the way, parents are still doing a teacher’s job on remote learning days"

Wait. What?!?"
2020-11-30 15:13,"The schools in Europe and all over the world are open. There is no scientific or medical reason they should not be. That being so why aren’t all schools open here? Catholic schools and other private schools have been open for months. Logic dictates that public schools have been closed for other reasons such as ideology, Democrat politics and the intrusive, undemocratic and overweening involvement of politically connected teachers unions. Remote learning for children does not work. It also requires fewer teachers working shorter hours despite the protestations of the unions. It galls ordinary Americans that the teachers of a failed public education system, working fewer hours from home, delivering a more deeply flawed education then ever retain full employment while millions of Parents are unemployed. Now comes Biden, working with the NEA, who has pledged to attack Charter schools at their behest.

If we can agree on nothing else we should be able to reach common cause that:

1. our children’s education is of tantamount importance.
2. That the schools exist to educate and are not a jobs program or a means of funneling money to.     Democrat politicians. 

If we cannot agree on this we are truly doomed.


Let our children go!"
2020-11-30 12:36,"I was a teacher for 15 years. Trust me, a lot of them have a special ability for complaining and whining - especially the ones who have never worked outside of education.

Yes, there the few who will work themselves to exhaustion, but they are probably not too fit for the job if they have to.

Interestingly, your article left out phys Ed teachers, elective teachers, guidance counselors - most of whom are loving the pandemic and all of the pay they receive for doing next to nothing. 

Some contrarian viewpoints here - something I thought was once a staple of any respectable journalist - could be useful."

2020-11-30 14:08,"By refusing to go back in the classroom, teachers have admitted they are not essential workers.  Imagine a firefighter, LEO, or healthcare worker refusing to go back to work because “it is too dangerous “.  

Education is essential.  After looking at the minimal risk to students and understanding how to protect those at risk, teachers should go back in the classroom or consider another career, just like a firefighter should quit if they refuse to go into a burning building or if a healthcare worker refuses to treat a patient with an infectious disease."

I can say with confidence this is is not what I see.

In NYC, the burden is very much on the kids,

2020-11-30 11:47,"I am so tired of hearing the “ woe is me” complaints from public school teachers with steady incomes whether they teach in person or not, who have great benefits including top of the line health insurance and job security. So they have to work a bit harder during those  9 months  when they get a year’s salary. Their risk of catching COVID at school is less than catching it at the grocery store, yet I have seen some advocate for “ hazard pay” for simply showing up for work. Health care workers across this country have been dealing with real issues of possible infection and extended work schedules for months but I have yet to meet one with the “ fatigue” mentioned by the teachers interviewed here. Where are the same complaints from private and parochial school teachers- teachers that in most cases do not have the level of benefits the public school teachers have?"
2020-11-30 11:48,"Have school—ordinary school—for all kids. Kids who are so high risk or who have guardians so high risk need to figure out how to make up class work on their own, just like we did years ago before the world of Zoom. There is no good evidence that kids are harmed in any way by Covid. Death rates are well below flu levels, and practically speaking 0. Healthy teachers under the age of 65 are also not at meaningful risk. Use the data available and stop fear mongering—the economic toll on people matters."

2020-11-30 15:06,"I am a high school teacher who used to love my job. Now I'm looking for a way out. It isn't only hybrid learning (which is ineffective), the 12 hour days, the privileging of (in my district) white students; it's also the decision-making by the superintendent and other administrators who seem to have forgotten that teachers are humans. In addition to tossing out all the public health metrics that should be guiding decision-making about being in-person or remote, regularly changing the calendar, and fostering a divisive narrative that the union is standing in the way of all students returning to the building, they have completely undermined any collaboration that used to exist between teachers and administrators. As a result, teachers feel as though we are under attack from all sides. This is not sustainable and we are not widgets who are easily replaced."
2020-11-30 12:30,"Yes there some good teachers just as there are some good cops but they are all part of and uphold a corrupt, racist, unequal system that has been broken and inept for a longtime. 

Long before the pandemic it had been almost impossible for young qualified new teachers to get a job unless they were connected. Many of the teachers today are those who shouldn't be near children, couldn't pass their own tests and got their jobs through cronyism. 

My son did his student teaching requirement at two different schools and he was disgusted at the disparity in resources. The really amazing part was seeing the incompetence of the teachers at one of the so called top high schools in the country.  The majority of teachers didn't even know how to turn on their computers and refused to learn. A rare  few brought my son lunch to teach them basics they should have already known.

It is why he decided he wanted nothing to do with the system . He went on to get a master degree in STEM studies at a top university and never looked back. I know so many other bright people like him but the corrupt education system has lost them. The pandemic just exposed what has been wrong for decades and many of these teachers didn't care until now. They just wanted a safe paycheck."
2020-11-30 12:45,"Poor Babies !

One thing the pandemic has exposed is that everyone believes they are put upon.

Yes education exposes the problems of the USA. But why has it become the schools responsibility to fix family problems? 
For example schools are now responsible for feeding children every day! Why are their parents not feeding them? Before the state used to remove children from these households.
Now? We cry about them."
2020-11-30 12:53,"Teachers need to realize that they are not the only ones having to work longer hours and go ""above and beyond"" what is normally expected of them. They also should be thankful that--at least in NYC--they work in a workplace with a very low rate of cases of Covid-19.  As a Healthcare professional, I am showered with potentially infectious aerosols daily, and work in an environment with a very high number of cases of the virus. And yes. my colleagues and I are burned out, too. It just seems that the teachers, and especially their unions, complain louder than anyone else, aided by articles like this one. How about an article focusing on the minimum wage workers who go to their jobs every day in workplaces with higher rates of cases than in the schools? I bet they're just as burned out and scared, but they don't have the luxury of being able to retire with great pensions and fully paid health insurance like the teachers. I respect what teachers do for our kids, but they are in the same situation as everyone else. And BTW, this is not a ""hoax"" if you haven't figured it out yet. So stop complaining,  wear a mask (properly), wash your hands frequently, and we'll all get through this together."
2020-11-30 17:05,"I teach 7th grade in a working class community.  We had been in-person teaching until Thanksgiving; we will now teach remotely for the two weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas break.  In-person is, as is well known, much better for the students.  Part of the challenge with remote teaching is that many administrators are absolutely clueless when it comes to technology and provide ""guidance"" that changes from day to day.  I don't have a magic key, but what has worked so far is to plan for the students to do most of the work during our regular class meetings (we meet for one hour a day for each of 4 classes) and to be ""teaching"" for 10-15 minutes of that.  

Of course, the challenge is to get students to log on to our meetings and then to actually engage with and complete the work.  While I try to make it as engaging as possible, it is ultimately up to the students - and their responsible adults - to make sure they actually do the work.  Many do, some do not - and I'm sure it will surprise no one that the kids who try less in the classroom are the ones who also try less online.  

The workload increases when we're remote, because of all the changing directives, need to reach out to students and parents, and the additional time it takes to plan and deliver instruction online, to say nothing of dealing with potential tech issues.  The wonder is that more teachers haven't already left - many are just hanging on."
2020-11-30 17:13,"In the town I live in we had to close our schools because so many teachers have either contracted Covid or have come in close contact with a student, a teacher an administrator or a parent that had Covid that required quarantine that we ran out of enough teachers including substitute teachers in October, and closed.

So, how does reopening address this issue?  How do we protect teachers, because it didn’t work in October?"
2020-11-30 17:16,"I have noticed a few think pieces from the Working From Home class about how there is no excuse for children to not be getting in person class. My child started the year remote learning and in September went to in person class. It lasted a week. Less if you take into account the child with coronavirus was in class four days before the test results came back. Before it was over the teacher was in the hospital and there is zero chance they can get to in person class before the end of the year. 
Anyone willing to suggest teachers should take this risk needs to volunteer at least a month at their local school."
2020-11-30 17:17,"I haven't heard a single good thing about the hybrid model.  I think we should abandon that idea.  

My school is 100% remote until at least January.  Honestly, I hope we just stay fully remote until we're able to go back in person 100%.  Hybrid sounds like a nightmare for both teachers and parents, and certainly not worth the immense effort to pull it off."
2020-11-30 17:23,"I can relate to every single issue in this article, and I teach at a 4 year college, with 2/3 first gen college students.  The headlines says it all.  Burnout it rampant. This is not sustainable."
2020-11-30 17:25,"The lack of respect for teachers in these comments is always so evident.  I teach remotely in which the hours are arduous and never-ending.  I have to teach myself how to teach remotely, and still plan lessons, grade incessantly, make phone calls to parents and meet children on google meet for individual conferences. I often meet students at nine o'clock at night because we can't penalize them for not showing up for google meet.  We can't mandate they turn their cameras on either.

  I assumed last spring when I began teaching remotely, students would at least understand how to navigate technology.  But my experience has been that students haven't been able to, and I have to troubleshoot daily.  I also have parents sit in my class instead of their children and take notes while their children nap.  Good teachers and good parents know that they work together to help the children in the class.  I am not surprised by the disdain in the comments, however, since the same people expected teachers to take bullets for their students instead of helping provide the political will to have sensible gun control"
2020-11-30 17:27,"I teach at a community college.  In addition to the challenges described in this article, there are others that could have been avoided with passage of a timely stimulus package that included funding for states and localities.  In the absence of that, we've experienced many layoffs.  Among those are administrative assistants who know how to get things done and provide what we need to teach effectively.  So much institutional memory is gone.  Job duties are combined and recombined.  Administrators as well as instructors are overloaded and undersupported.  Most or all of us live in a state of anxiety over losing our jobs.  In that situation, we are also subjected to extra scrutiny from people who don't have time to provide feedback but must turn in reports about our online courses, assessments, interactions with students, grading progress, etc. The added scrutiny may reflect the numbers of students who don't enroll, further starving the college of revenue.  We're in an exhausting and unsustainable loop that we fuel without extra compensation while we also function as counselors.  Increasing numbers of students exhibit signs of not only distress but of mental illness.  Counseling services are overwhelmed and underfunded too."
2020-11-30 17:33,"After 29 years of teaching, including the wonderful experience of teaching AP classes, I retired at the end of October. I had switched from the classroom to our state's version of virtual school because of my age and health issues. Being a virtual teacher was extremely stressful with all the requirements including: grading work within 48 hours, monthly verbal parent/student contact and documentation, Zoom lessons,  being ""on call"" from 8 AM to 8 PM daily, and rampant plagiarism, which necessitated filing a report, contacting parent and student, and more documentation. I hated every minute and missed interacting with students. My bp rose dangerously high due to stress. I realized that it was time to leave; and after hearing what my former colleagues have been saying about their present circumstances and reading articles like this, I know I made the right decision."

Most school boards require, at least on paper, teachers to have a daily lesson plan for every subject. Teachers, as licensed independent professionals, are free to either develop their own or to buy pre-made plans than can be customized. 

The dirty secret of the profession is that most teachers have neither. The failure to systematically plan has been laid bear by the pandemic. 

Please don't whine to us now, for your professional failings."

We are doing everything we can as parents to support them-- from family walks to a friendly ear to academic help, but I feel deep frustration that the same teachers that in California are too fearful (understandably) to be in the classroom, also complain that this is unsustainable.

Like most parents, I’ve felt frustrated with schools remaining closed. As an essential hospital worker, I want to push back, ‘I didn’t sign up for this either, but I’m stepping up.’ As an immigrant, I am confused as to why bars are prioritized over schools. As a therapist, I want to stand up for our children’s’ mental health. Schools are safety. As a citizen, I recognize that socioeconomic disparities don’t only impact students, but their teachers. How “sustainable” this is perhaps depends on the zip code you teach at. But I’ve been around long enough to recognize when a problem lacks a clear solution. It’s all so complex and there is much vulnerability (and I’m not just referring to covid). It’s the problems where we need to sit with uncertainty, confusion, and distress that tend to be the hardest."
2020-11-30 18:03,"I will not even comment on Gina’s comment regarding what sounds to me a rather tongue-in-cheek assessment of what teachers do ‘in our spare time’.  My district gave us three days to convert all our classes to online in March.  Five community college classes, 125 students, learning zoom and how to put up recorded lectures, grading, administrative duties, manage a household, and working without a new contract for the past two years.
We do it because of our students who at this time need not just a class in history to transfer.  Teachers need the patience of Job.  We are social workers, parents, psychologists, and yes, baby sitters.

Most of the lessons (for middle and high school subjects, at least) are already out there--at Khan Academy and elsewere. For decades we've been singing the praises of all the wonderful educational content available online. And now, when teachers could really use it, they are instead wasting their precious time reinventing the wheel. Think of the thousands upon thousands of basically identical lessons in biology, math, Spanish that teachers across the country are killing themselves to produce. Districts should have spent some time setting things up so that teachers did not have to deliver so many hours of live lessons and instead could focus on other aspects of the job: Q-and-A sessions, one-on-one help, feedback, etc."

My two middle schoolers are honestly getting a good academic education and their teachers and our school's administrators are doing everything possible to maintain cohesion/community/and a sense of optimism for students. 

I'm proud of them all - doing their work with heart and with a can-do spirit in the face of some many daunting unknowns, so many challenges. What they cannot do and it is not their fault - is deal with the emotional, developmental losses due to the pandemic and the isolation it has brought to school-age kids.  

Just so you know, our family attends school in the 2nd largest school district in the country and I'm not sure I could ask my kids' teachers or their principal/admin to do any more than they are doing."
2020-11-30 18:15,Schools and teachers are left picking up the slack of society once again. We depend on schools to provide meals since many people do not have the means or access to buy healthy food. It should come as no surprise that in a country of eroding social fabric and declining democratic institutions that schools are the safety net for students’ social and emotional wellness. ￼￼It is a fascinating time to reflect on the purpose of schools and teaching in theory and practice.
2020-11-30 18:17,"Like every other institution in this, our feudal country, educational achievements and lack thereof are exacerbated.

I'm entering my 30th year as an educator. I've taught the obscenely wealthy in Switzerland, the rural poor in Maine, the inner city poor in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and the upper middle class children of professionals as well as, currently, being an educational consultant for three middle schools.

We are working twice as hard for half the results. 
Generally, the poorer the families and/or the more challenges in the home, the worse the students' results.

Same is true for medical care, internet availability, infrastructure, healthy food availability, etc, ... and on and on."
2020-11-30 18:27,"We're conflating two separate things in a lot of these comments. I am both a teacher and the caregiver of two partially-remote teenagers, so we got a really interesting view of how things worked, especially this spring. It seemed a lot of the time that the older (think 50+, not that 50 is OLD) were just generally less comfortable with the amount of technology they were suddenly expected to use. Couple that with the general mentality of ""we'll be back in person by May,"" I think SOME teachers hedged that they wouldn't have to learn the remote ropes in any meaningful way. I'm not excusing that, or dismissing anyone's experience when I say that we had NO idea (and really not a lot of leadership) on how to proceed at first. I'm lucky - using technology has been a part of my class since the get go (which was 2006, lest I come across as a fresh university grad, here). 

My point is, we shouldn't blame individual teachers for a lack of leadership. Many of us were just told to make the best of it, and unions, though they claim to protect us, have really only ever protected the folks who didn't deserve the honor of a public service job in the first place. I would be far more likely to place the onus on unions poor understanding of how to serve both the community AND the teachers, before I'd blame teachers as a group. (All that to say, I have met a good many teachers who hate their jobs and want nothing to do with kids, and those are the ones that are always heavily involved in unions.)"
2020-11-30 18:31,"Not all teachers or school districts are the same.  The statement that ""America's teachers"" deserve one thing or another, or ""teachers didn't have the Spring off,"" or ""teachers work 13 hour days"" is not universally true.  In my area, the amount of instruction in the Spring was close to zero.  There was virtually no effort from the administration or the teachers to do anything close to regular instruction.  There were one or two short zoom meetings a day, and the rest was self-directed learning.  For Kindergarten.  

Over the summer, I know many of the teachers in the public school districts in my area did nothing to develop their online curriculum or learn about how to teach remotely.  They used only three weeks before school started in September (school starts in September here) to get things together, and then the district created a number of additional in-service days for more support for the teachers.  

My son's teacher posts a lesson plan at the beginning of the week.  There is about 1 hour of self-directed activities per day, two 30-minute zoom meetings, and one 45-minute specialist zoom meeting a day.  I know his teacher meets one-on-one with the students in small 15-minute meetings, but my son gets about one of those a week.  He is in a class of 18 kids.  There is no graded schoolwork.  So his teacher is, at most, doing 2 1/2 hours of zoom instruction a day.  Maybe some teachers are working hard, but let's not ignore the fact that many are not."

The numbers were growing daily because kids didn’t like the rules of school and wanted to continue working, which they thought they could do with online classes. I had ESL and Special Ed students who were not going to get the needed  assistance as required by law; I had too many angry parents who thought I should tutor their kids individually since they weren’t in school. No help from administrators or the superintendent’s office despite repeated requests. I have a sick family member that I take care of, so I decided that family and my own well-being come first. Twenty-eight years. They had to hire two people to fill my role. Go figure. I’m happy with my decision, but I’m heartbroken for my friends who continue to struggle with unreasonable expectations and demands while trying to meet the needs of the students."
2020-11-30 18:51,"First, thank you to all the teachers who are working so hard! I can definitely envision how difficult it is for you because my high school senior is having a hellish, unrelenting, mind-numbing school experience. While I support the need for online learning right now, learning in a remote format has to be one of the most unhealthy experiences I have ever witnessed. I think if everyone lowered learning expectations with fewer classes or less work, maybe it would be better, but I think that needs to come from admin. AP and honors teachers are trying to keep everything per usual with getting through the material and more, but the remote format for some reason is not as efficient and my child is on the computer from early in the morning until at least midnight trying to keep up. Teachers seem to be giving more work, extra videos to watch, etc. I understand that they are desiring to do their very best and not let their students down, but it's over the top. They need permission to tone down the volume a bit. 

For the parents in this comments thread who are complaining, my children have always needed support, help and guidance throughout their school years.  I would sincerely hope that we don't feel resentment about the fact that we are going through a very challenging time in history and that we have to rise to the occasion to do whatever is necessary to look out for our children.  We are all tapped out and exhausted, but our attitude matters. Let's drop the entitlement."
2020-11-30 19:09,"Covid has parents both helping and turning against teachers.  The bigger issue is how teachers are valued and compensated by society: politicians at both federal and state level have not made teaching a priority, the pillar of a truly strong economy and healthy society.  Think how far the funding of useless wars would do for our kids, especially as  US education lags behind other developed countries."
2020-11-30 19:12,"While our situation (at least at my university) is nowhere near as bad as in the public schools, the issue of burnout and exhaustion and stress and depression is as real. It is impossible to imagine surviving another term of this.

Uni administrations keep promising an ""excellent"" ""student experience,"" which borders on the negligently misleading. But we are tasked with providing that, with no real support or decrease in expectations about our non-instructional responsibilities.

While I'm grateful to be well employed and paid, it's still enormously difficult and, indeed, ""not sustainable."""
2020-11-30 19:20,"One issue many teachers are experiencing is the lack of leadership from upper administrations and government. There has been a negligent lack of transparent communication and solid foundational strategies for the many situations educators and the families they serve are facing. There was plenty of time prior to the start of school for politicians, district leaders to plan for the various scenarios schools are currently experiencing, and they failed. The unexpected should have been expected, approached, and managed with various strategies that met each situation.  Leadership failed in doing their jobs and teachers are solving their problems."
2020-11-30 19:34,"All my classes are normally hands-on, lab-based courses at the undergraduate level
Yes, it is taking at least quadruple the time to run classes never intended for online and it is an absolute nightmare to teach and administer these classes remotely.
However, looking ahead I wonder what will happen to students who have been learning remotely in these hands-on majors for what will be over a year (spring will be remote too now).
How can they compete in their fields of study against graduates with not just more experience on the clock, but competency in the hands-on arena that the classes of '21, '22, and beyond won't have.
What kind of future are we really giving them?"
2020-11-30 19:47,"I'm currently working as a contact tracer in a high school of about 2,000 students. From what I have observed, this article is spot on. Teachers are working way too hard and not receiving enough compensation for their efforts. They come to work everyday, risking their health and safety for the well being of their students. The situation changes everyday. One day, all of their students are in class. The next, half of their students are online because they are out on quarantine. After that, the teacher finds out they need to quarantine. A week later the entire school has switched to online only for two weeks. This cannot keep happening, there is a better solution out there. 

Additionally, I would like to add that school nurses are taking on a huge burden with the COVID-19 response during this pandemic. They are often already spread thin by working at multiple schools, and now they are expected to coordinate and administer school's contact tracing, quarantining, and testing efforts. They no longer have the time to care for students and their health in situations not related to COVID-19."
2020-11-30 20:17,"In a once in a 100 year global disaster, after the initial shock, many people of good will tried to craft some schooling for children while preventing as much illness and death as possible and constantly adapting to the changes ( close?, open? ) needed to adapt to new research about this evolving threat. A holding action. Not sustainable, not a return to any kind of normal, not fair, completely exhausting, impossible to do and guaranteed to tick off everyone involved at one point or another.  But also highlighting how important schools are in making communities work and where supports ( eg reliable technology, teacher planning time, smaller classes or access to counseling ) were always lacking. I am grateful to those doing the very best they can for right now. And I hope when the pandemic is tamed we won't forget what we saw and rush back to the old ""normal"" that wasn't working that great for many in the first place."
2020-11-30 19:46,"I work in a school district where we have been required to teach in person. There is no testing for staff nor for students, yet administrators proudly stand up and claim that we have a low case count in the school. This is unbelievably ignorant, and we can thank our president for the idea that if we just don’t test, there won’t be any cases. Meanwhile, both staff and students continue to come down with cases, and the state case count is increasing exponentially. But according to the school districts that won’t test, there is no spread in the schools. As an educator and a scientist, this leaves me simultaneously mortified and petrified. I expect to be leaving the profession at the end of the semester. It is not worth my life, nor that of my family."
2020-11-30 18:34,"I'm glad I quit teaching. The endless articles and comments about whether I was a hero or a lazy complainer gave me whiplash. Really I was just overworked and underpaid, like many people, no doubt. I can't wait to enjoy my lazy new career where I'll make twice as much money to do half as much work in the business world and no one will bother to notice, write articles, or have angry comments about my worth or lack-there-of to society."
2020-11-30 19:03,"At least one teacher that I know of has committed suicide this year. I consider this to be another COVID-related death.

These times are not normal and the pressure we are putting on people is unreasonable."
2020-11-30 19:30,"25 years of Republicans attacking teachers, slashing pay,  pensions, and health care whenever they get the chance, and denigrating professionals by trying to tamper with curriculum had already created a huge national teacher shortage. 

It is going to get worse. Way worse. 

Without qualified, well paid teachers we lose our place at the table to other nations who value and invest in education."
2020-11-30 18:40,"It’s not just burnout.

Some teachers, like me, are getting covid from their schools. I’m still suffering after a month, and I don’t know if the damage is long term.

Teaching was hard enough before when it was just the flu raging through schools. 

Once again, teachers are being asked to make up for all the inequalities and ills of our society.

I’m ashamed to be an American, where money matters more than people."
2020-11-30 18:39,"The last quote is so powerful. “Self-care” is not going prevent teacher burnout. The only thing that will is to pay teachers a salary that befits all the work that they do. That will require a complete reimagining of how we fund education in this country. The wealthiest among us, you have to get comfortable with sacrificing some of your assets for the good of this republic. We’re begging you."
2020-11-30 18:55,Why must teachers lead in-person and on-line classes  separately when they could live stream classes for all of the kids at once?
2020-11-30 20:27,"Devil's advocate:  Eliminate remote learning.  Do rotating, alternate-day, in-person-only instruction.  Asking teachers to assume the burden of making remote learning work for all students is too much to ask."
2020-11-30 18:35,"I was a special needs paraprofessional for four years before becoming a special education teacher. I loved being a para but when I became a teacher, the world fell apart.

My life became nothing but work. I spent 12+ hours a day planning lessons, writing individual education plans and tracking student goals. I went to work with students who were autistic and had severe behavioral challenges. I was asked to co-teach subjects that I knew little about at the secondary level, like science.

I spent weekends doing the same. My friends complained that I didn't call them back. My social life disappeared. And then there were the administrators who expected you to do outside activities on top of taking care of your students, like arranging quad activities or running a club.

It took four years for me to burn out and quit. A hybrid model? Teaching in person and via Zoom? Facing a deadly virus every day? I was able to handle lockdowns when men brought guns on campus but I could never have withstood the anxiety of possibly contracting this virus each and every day on top of the other stresses I faced managing the children.

These teachers are heroes. Anyone who hasn't taught will not understand the immense challenges they face. These teachers deserve our respect and gratitude. Give teaching a whirl if you think you can do better and you will soon cease your criticism of teachers."
2020-11-30 19:30,"Like so much else, this is all the product of underinvestment in our public schools.  As Rob Lowe's character Sam Seaborn said on ""The West Wing,"" schools should be palaces, good teachers should be making six-figure salaries, and our public education system should be incredibly expensive for government and absolutely free for our citizens."
2020-11-30 19:19,"It would interesting to know what percentage of teachers considering, or taking, early retirement are doing so because of in-person health risks, versus due to online burnout. both are bad of course!"
2020-11-30 18:46,"Yes this!  My job is completely unmanagable with 3 different classes to teach with 5 sections total.  Live classes everyday originally both hybrid and online students.  Now fully online with no clear restart date.  I have to keep forking over $3000 a month to keep my kids in daycare, yet we keep getting quarantined so we lose daycare for up to 2 weeks.  I can't just take ""sick"" days when my kids are home or when I am actually sick because there is no curriculum and no subs to step in.  I can barely manage to work the 40 hours of my contract, but we are expected to be doing at least 60 to meet all the student needs.  This is not sustainable, maybe this will finally help people see education needs more funding and teachers need more time to do all the things that aren't just standing in front of students giving directions."
2020-11-30 20:31,"The part that really has been bothering me during this pandemic and in reading all the articles of how challenging the struggle of teaching remotely is, is how obvious it should be that numerous kids are simply lying about their internet connectivity or hardware issues.

Come on. We were all kids once. Snow days were a god send. People pull fire alarms during exams. You know these things.

Kids are very fluent with todays technology, so the ones saying something isn't working is just lying.  They're sleeping in, they're sexting on their phones, watching Jake Logan on Tik Tok, and playing Fortnite.  Then telling their teachers that their internet is down, or their laptop is busted.

There was just a story today about how the public school system in Baltimore had it's remote learning system hacked.  Spoiler:  It wasn't North Korea, it was Jayvon."
2020-11-30 19:10,counselors are very very tired as well. and no-one is acknowledging us or our pay. please do this. we need to be heard.
2020-11-30 19:37,"To parents who are insisting that schools stay open right now, I have some questions:
Is this because you are seriously worried that your kids won’t learn stuff and will “fall behind” during these pandemic months?
Is it because you are exhausted trying to keep them busy, and you need a break?
Is it because you have to work and can’t do this with the kids at home?
Is it because you are seriously worried about the mental health of your own children, or that of other children whose home lives are less fortunate?
Honestly: what is your overriding concern that makes in-person schooling a critical issue right now? I am really interested."
2020-11-30 18:28,"Formative teachers have it the worst for certain. But let's just add this: college teachers and professors ain't hanging in there much better. 

Yes, you ""pay"" for college. But let's cease pretending that college teaching is some kind of high paying racket."
2020-11-30 19:14,"The other article that needs to be written is about the unsustainability of being a healthcare professional during a pandemic when such a large percentage of your fellow citizens refuse to follow simple health directives then over run your hospitals.  We're several months down the road with this thing and it's beyond pathetic that folks won't wear masks, won't distance, won't quit having gatherings , and won't quit travelling unnecessarily.  If were in the healthcare field and I could afford it, I'd quit.  It amazes me that more don't."
2020-11-30 18:39,"In 2018, why didn’t the Republicans give a $2.3 trillion tax cut to America’s teachers?  Just asking."
2020-11-30 18:23,My family is nearing a breaking point. Open the schools. Shut down the bars the restaurants the salons the the gyms the shopping. Open the schools!!!!! Teachers should be first in line for the vaccine behind medical professionals.
2020-11-30 19:04,"By the way, the prob here isn’t that different from what it is with infrastructure and many other things.

We simply coasted along, fat (boy, are we ever!), dumb and happy, cutting taxes, howling at regulations, screaming about commies in schools, and so on. We prepared for nothing, though we were again and again warned that sooner or later, we’d see a pandemic. Heck, we were told it was very likely to be caused by a coronavirus. 

Our response? We screamed at Obama and elected Trump, who cheerfully went about chopping taxes more, slashing regulations, and amping up the screaming at teachers and unions and other professionals. 

So when this thing hit, there we were, with crummy public transport, aging schools, no day care system for working people, and millions more who’d lost their insurance—you know the drill. Oh, and science and scientists systematically undermined. And selfish stupidity made a national virtue by a lazy fool. 

It’s like watching grasshoppers complain that it’s started to snow. Those darn teachers."
2020-11-30 21:03,"This article is spot-on.  I have worked with students learning English in Philadelphia for 14 years, through budget cuts, school closures, and environmental crises, and have never felt as demoralized as I do now.  I want to meet the needs of my students, yet there is not enough time in the day to teach, plan, create and adapt materials (for both language proficiency and remote teaching), grade, communicate with parents and colleagues, and also sleep, eat, and ground myself.  We are stretched too thin.
As an elementary teacher, I have to adapt lessons for 5 core subjects.  Everything takes longer to do in the virtual/remote context, and most students now need even more small group instruction on topics like multi-digit addition than they did in person, but time is finite, and our district expects us to keep pace with the planning and scheduling timeline.
I am grateful to be able to work safely from home.  But to see so much more struggle than one can effectively assist with is depleting."
2020-11-30 21:05,"Teachers may not indicate to society that they are dissatisfied in any way with work situations. The mere fact that teachers get paid at all irritates people. 
Any time someone points out what is going on it becomes like any other societal ill, so deeply uncomfortable to talk about it is made to be their fault. 
Teachers are expected to work dozens of extra hours for no additional pay. They're not good teachers if they don't. 
It is too bad there are no longer experts in the fields of science, medicine, and education."
2020-11-30 21:07,"Some thoughts from a high school teacher who has been 100% remote since August. I see a lot of comments criticizing teachers for not giving enough work. I began the year giving the same amount of work I normally would, with homework each night. As the year went on and students’ stress levels increased, I found that work completion rates were down, which meant I had to give more 0’s, which meant more students failed. I dramatically cut down on the amount of assignments in the interest of student mental health and success. At my school, our Quarter 1 failure rate was 176% higher than what it was last year. Are some students being lazy? Sure. But more often than not, they're doing their best amid extreme personal and political upheaval. Some of my students have become family breadwinners. For others, COVID-19 has hit home. I can’t expect teenagers to function at their highest levels when I (and most adults I know) am not capable of it.
I care first and foremost about my students as human beings. I prioritize their mental health over blowing through curriculum. And I prioritize my mental health above theirs, because I’m a human being first. We’re slated to head back to hybrid in January. I love my students with all my heart, but I am terrified. Like a lot of teachers, I’ve already sacrificed free time, money, mental health, and relationships for my job. I draw the line at risking my life."
2020-11-30 20:39,"Teachers are burning out because students in need gravitate like water flowing downstream to whomever is willing to help. (When schools were open, which teachers always had a line waiting outside their offices? Which teachers didn't?) 

At the same time, colleagues and administrators who in the best of circumstances shirked their obligations are now too eager to complain and argue loudly for sophomoric solutions rather than buckle down and do their job. Better to find a soapbox and horse-trade with management. (Union leaders, you know who you are.) 

And some of us walk away since we know that, beyond a certain breaking point, we become useless to others. We refuse to become ""The Giving Tree"" (Shel Silverstein's book for children). Or as Hillel the Elder said, ""If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?”

Today's headline is teachers, some other day it's hospital workers, etc. The pandemic is merely exposing the general institutional rot. In such conditions, fledgling organizational opportunists continue to find their mentors, but mentoring the next generation of truly committed helpers is impossible."
2020-11-30 20:40,"I’m a speech-language pathologist with 20 years experience working in various school districts. I loved my job.

In March, our school went remote.

My already substantial workload literally tripled overnight. 12-14 hours a day staring at a computer screen, butt glued to a non-ergonomic kitchen chair. Hours upon hours watching YouTube tutorials on technology I had never seen; scouring the internet (and paying out-of-pocket) for digital materials; troubleshooting technical glitches; racking my brain trying to come up with magical lesson plans that would somehow keep the attention of special needs kids without the use of toys or games . All while simultaneously trying to meet the minutes on each child’s IEP.

The stress was insane. I couldn’t eat; I couldn’t sleep. Previously a weekend-only drinker, I found myself needing a cocktail nearly every night in order to ‘take the edge off.’(I didn’t know that was a real thing.) 

In May, I had a nervous breakdown and quit with less than a month left of school. 

Best decision I ever made. I still pass by my old school nearly every day and each time I do, I experience an overwhelming sense of relief that I never have to go back there again.

I just feel sorry for my colleagues for whom quitting isn’t an option if their health begins to suffer."
2020-11-30 20:48,"I'm seeing a lot of kind and helpful comments saying that teachers need to be paid more. That's largely true, but it's not going to solve the problem. My first teaching year was in a district that paid better than most, but I still burned out because the amount of work was unsustainable. Higher wages are important, but no matter how much you pay people, if you set them up for failure they will burn out. Teachers also need more prep time, smaller classes, fewer preps, and more genuine, realistic support from administration. A lot of the support we get right now consists of admin saying in voices of concern, ""Make sure you're taking care of yourself! We don't want you to burn out!"" which doesn't actually do anything to help."
2020-11-30 20:54,"Thanks for this article. I would like to see some articles about the technology the teachers are having to use. For instance, as I understand it, Canvas takes three times longer to use than the old way of prepping for classes. And there are bugs in the various platforms that are sometimes very difficult to send in to the platforms due to the imperviousness of their sites. In other words, a lot of time wasted and aggravation for the teachers.￼"
2020-11-30 21:27,"My children attend a highly regarded NYC public elementary school...and remote learning days are a complete joke. The burden isn’t on the teachers so much as it’s on the parents who have become de facto teachers. I don’t necessarily blame the teachers, they are just cogs in the wheel, but more the overall organization and requirements for remote learning that place a disproportionate burden on parents. 

In the spring, each morning my son’s 2nd grade teacher left a quick message of daily activities to do and only in the last two months had two hours live teaching a week. The rest was up to me to sit through and help my son step by step-3 hours a day.  If his teacher ever commented at all on his work, it was days later. 

This fall, on remote days my pre-k daughter has 20 minutes of live morning meeting and activities to do independently, which I sit with her to do the entire time. To her credit, her teacher does respond fairly quickly, which helps keep my daughter’s enthusiasm up for school.  This takes me 2 hours a day.  

My third grade son on remote days now has two hours of live teaching a day. After which I check and correct any work from this and then check and correct work from anything else he’s had to do on his own. I haven’t heard a single comment on any of his work from his teacher. This takes me another 2-3 hours a day.

So I’m teaching with my two kids 4-5 hours on their remote days, at least double the time their teachers are. Remind me who’s bearing the burden?"
2020-11-30 21:34,"Miss. Clayton was one of my 8th grade teachers when I went to Farmington Central Junior High, before moving to Indy. She is such and incredible teacher. She works so hard and always stays positive. To see that she is struggling, even with her outstanding work ethic really says something to me."
2020-11-30 22:10,Glad to see the Times finally acknowledging that the problem is that teachers are being asked to do too much with no resources instead of pushing hybrid programs that are requiring teachers who are already overburdened to do twice the work.
2020-11-30 22:39,"As a 25 year veteran, i have been amazed how much harder I’ve had to work this year, even with only 4 days a week of instruction. Beyond having to reinvent teaching Earth Science and AP Biology,  I have been consumed by the shift from having actual relationships with students to having more intimate encounters with their documents. The on-line tools compel me to write exhaustive comments to students, and some work is passed back and forth four or five times. It is adding another full day to my work week. Post-pandemic, this process is here to stay for me, but it will be more difficult to balance work/family/self without some recognition of the cost to teachers by stakeholders at all levels."
2020-11-30 22:56,"This article made me cry. I am not a teacher but I am a parent of three children - two in college and one in high school. All three are  are doing 100% online classes, per restrictions in southeast Michigan. It's hard on the students. It's hard on the teachers, It's hard on the parents/guardians/caregivers. Can we all just take a 1-year sabbatical?"
2020-11-30 22:50,"I am a teacher and I despise being called a ""saint"". This common statement  implies that I am making outsized sacrifices to do my job well. This is unreasonable. I am not a martyr and I should not be expected to be one. Does that make me a coldhearted villain? The public perspective seems to think I'm either/or.

Meanwhile, how can we expect a system that was already struggling to work in a crisis? 

Where is the outcry for communities/companies to invest in families to ensure that they have their needs met at home? 

We MUST invest in our kids. ALL of our kids. Which means, investing in and trusting educators--especially when they unanimously say this is NOT working."
2020-11-30 23:09,"One point I'd like to make in all this is that teaching is creative work. We're expected not just to design lesson plans, but to design original, creative, engaging, fun lesson plans that will get every student enjoying the subject. Creative work takes more time than other forms of work; you have to have an idea, play around with it, figure out what it would look like, all before you start researching and designing resources. In your early years of teaching, that part of the job takes forever because it's all new and you don't have the confidence in your own ideas that comes with experience. And it's very hard to do effectively when you're exhausted and short on sleep."
2020-11-30 23:14,"This is my 26th year of teaching and my first year of teaching during a pandemic.  Friends, do the best you can and shut it down at 5pm."
2020-11-30 21:26,"Quit, there are many better educated and energetic young people able to replace you. I am a boomer but many of these teachers needed to go years ago. We can sweeten the pot by offering to reduce student loans for those who switch to teaching. 

I guarantee you it will revolutionize education in the United States and we will no longer rank at the bottom internationally."
2020-11-30 23:36,"After over twenty years in the classroom, I can now Zoom and Loom. I can even manage an online platform for my students. Does any of this make me a better teacher? Of course not. Students learn best, and teachers instruct best, in school."
2020-11-30 23:52,"It seems to me that a lot of people who are bashing teachers (a favorite pastime of some NYT commenters apparently) must really hate their own jobs. 

They are forever talking about how teachers have it so much better than they do: the summers off, the huge salaries (ha), the unions, the “easy” work. 

If so many hate their own jobs, why not try to improve things for everyone? 

If they felt they had worker protections, they wouldn’t begrudge teachers their unions. The same with working hours, salaries, job satisfaction.

Teachers, for the most part, love their jobs, despite the hardships and low pay. Perhaps this is the real reason so many people hate on them.

We all want to love our work or at least find it rewarding. Let’s start with valuing teachers, healthcare workers, and other “essential” workers. Then let’s create a rising tide that lifts all boats...and all jobs."
2020-11-30 23:52,"To people who are in these comments accusing teachers of complaining, being lazy, not working, etc., this is an article about burnout. Complaining is not the same as burnout. Not wanting to work doesn't cause burnout. An unsustainable level of work, too many competing expectations, chronic sleeplessness, an inability to leave work behind because work time and home time bleed together, and an overwhelming sense of guilt at not meeting every one of the nearly impossible standards set by administrators, parents, students and ourselves - these are the things that can plunge bright, dedicated, creative teachers into severe depression. Burnout is a form of mental illness, and when a profession routinely pushes people into it, you need to stop blaming the victims and start asking why we tolerate those working conditions."
2020-11-30 23:59,"I feel like I have not had a break since the week before schools closed in person when in NYC we were directed to revise lessons for both in-person and remote students b/c the schools would not close but students would probably stay home.  I taught live, every day, I prepped 170 (yup) students for 2 different AP courses, learned new technologies, with NO assistance from the DOE. I spent evenings grading, trying to reach students, our religious holiday was taken back from us. We got derision from almost every corner. I spent the summer revising for an unplanned fall.  I was up at 5:30 am - I took a break to look at the paper at 6:30 pm.  I can never ""get on top"" of my coursework, grading,  web issues, student issues.  I felt disrespected before.  Now, I am just worn out. Exhausted - wishing I could retire but can't.  I write college recommendations, too.  Get on my zoom class and it's happy teacher time! Because it doesn't matter how the teacher feels, we just keep on keepin on,
And to read comments that we are a bunch of lazy, do nothings, just adds to the demoralization.  In Junes past, on the last day of school, I could breath, for a moment before preparing college recommendations and trying to read up on new developments in my area.  This year, summer never started. There was no break. I used to love being teacher,  I like high school age kids, I like their energy and creativity. But this has broken me.  I hope I can fake it long enough for my kids to get through June."
2020-11-30 23:47,"I retired from teaching high school English in May. I really feel for these teachers who are doing everything they can to be there for their students and help them learn. They deserve our utmost respect. That said, why is this so hard? We are a country who sent people to the moon, who has broken all kinds of records in all kinds of fields. Why is it so difficult to give our children an education? It seems that the materials are there so what is going on?"
2020-12-01 0:17,Solving an unprecedented problem is not easy. Our broken system of public health and public education must be fixed. Only then we can imagine a 'sustainable' solution.
2020-12-01 0:38,"This is my thirtieth year of teaching secondary math and science. Teaching simultaneous live and remote classes, as several teachers in the story say, is not sustainable. After last spring's debacle of just ending school and going completely remote with no training or equipment, let alone a clue about what works, I have survived twelve weeks of full time school with both a screen for kids who are not attending and a semi-distanced group of eighth graders in the room. The whiplash between live and remote, which require different methods and materials, is spectacular. There is no continuity in the day or the term. My administrators have decided this is a good year to emphasize social emotional learning, and have given the teachers a whole new curriculum with neither time nor training to implement it. When we lose a teacher or student to the virus, we get an email that does not name them. Testing is voluntary for both students and staff. Contact tracing is inadequate at best. Without comprehensive testing it is an exercise in medical whack-amole. Adult communication in the building is reduced to moments in the hall rather than an hour a day to work together to build curriculum and provide for the needs of our students. I still spend time badgering students to wear masks properly and get some distance between them. It goes against their biological nature- they try for a while, then magnetically stick together again. The hard part is about to begin."
2020-12-01 0:36,"Nonsense. Ms. Clayton is not working 13 hour days. No teacher is working 13 hour days. If that's occurring, then that's on school administrators for allowing it to happen. Nor are most teachers acting as grief counselors and social workers. Teachers are not qualified to perform those functions and again, if that is occurring, it's an administrative and frankly disciplinary issue. Most teachers were not working after the summer break, but still getting paid. Making up for lost time may indeed be taxing in the short term now, but it was their own professional associations more than any other that created the chaos, the ""whiplash"" that this article alludes to."
2020-12-01 0:54,"We were instructed by our administrator to give less work because parents complained their children were stressed out By the high standards and the amount of work.  In NYC we can’t fail children, even when they don’t turn in work.  But hey the “experts”on  Here think they know everything about teaching because they were once students."
2020-12-01 0:57,"Did I really just read an entire article that did not make one mention of the fact that teachers who are teaching in-person are teaching through a mask? It seems like a detail worth emphasizing. Teaching is about connecting. It’s about body language, tone of voice, facial expression—the million little cues that teachers use to get through to kids. The mask changes everything. It changes how well the students can hear you. It changes how you hear the kids through their masks. I wonder if the writer had emphasized just how much all the teaching challenges are made exponentially worse by mask-wearing (though of course it is life saving and everyone, teacher or not, must wear them indoors) would there be less ugliness and contempt directed toward teachers? Sadly, probably not, but it’s a huge part of the story."
2020-12-01 1:24,"I was a teacher. Now I am not. Some teachers rise to challenges and inspire students, and some do the least amount of work possible. The pandemic has exposed both."
2020-12-01 1:28,"This article is spot-on!  I've been an educator for 22 years, and I am feeling the stress, because I cannot do both remote and in-person learning, simultaneously, as we're supposed to start in January -- as well as be a health worker and ask our students about Covid-protocols. But the worst is that we can't keep our teenage students accountable, so task completion stays really low, even when lessons are dynamic. Their parents are working and can't help them stay on task. They're hiding behind black/blank screens, and the online system makes high-level discussions and seminars nearly impossible -- breakout rooms were designed for corporations, not for schools!  If we can't go back to in-person learning soon (not ""hybrid,"" and idea probably created by an administrator), I will most likely go for retirement, in June. I'm at that age. (It's much worse for younger teachers, especially those with children at home.)  I love teaching, but this isn't classroom teaching, not by a long shot."
2020-12-01 1:44,Time for teachers to strike? All across America!
2020-12-01 2:14,"Thank you so much for this article. So many emails. I wish there were more accounts from elementary teachers in this article but nonetheless thank you for bringing light to this. So very tired. 10 more students than I would have in person, I have through a computer/iPad screen and separated between an AM and a PM class. Double the prep. I am dreading doing report cards. How am I even going to do them?? I’m dreading doing this until the end of June."
2020-12-01 2:09,"I'm a substantially separate special educator.  This has been really hard.  I have 13 students, 3 wear masks, and 4 para professionals (who wear their masks) but that makes 17 people in my classroom.  I can't have more than 10 people in my entire house but I can have 17 people in my classroom.  I spend my day worried about who is spreading what.  My student do not social distance and aren't wearing masks.  I spend my day telling kids to give space or go sit down or put your mask over your nose or put your mask on.  I have a cold.  I cannot go to work.  Now my students do not have a teacher until my Covid test comes back negative and when I am symptom free for 24 hours.  This is not teaching.  This is crowd control."
2020-12-01 2:52,If there is a silver lining to be found in the middle of this nightmare: the realization that parenting is really hard and that having children is not much of a good idea anymore once you can’t offload a big chunk of daily childcare to your local school. Thank goodness we live in a country where having a child  is optional as we still have the freedom to decide not to do so.
2020-12-01 2:52,Are police and fire fighters asked to supplement their supplies with their own money? But the Republican senate in their tax bill gave HUGE write offs for yachts and almost no write offs for teaching supplies (that should be supplied by schools anyway)!!!
2020-12-01 4:01,"It is no different in AZ. Unfortunately, I don't have any answers myself. the number of teachers leaving at the end of this semester could be disastrous for students. We keep telling ourselves to hang in there, they say help is on the way. But, it is really?"
2020-12-01 4:35,"Oh please. Teachers have been a bunch of babies throughout this entire ordeal. Try being a nurse, or a doctor in your average hospital. Those people have something to complain about. Teachers are just a bunch of whining little babies! Try saving a life once in a while! I live in a household with one teacher, one nurse and one person who lost their job. I can tell you who has the real pressure on them- it's not the teacher"
2020-11-30 11:41,"I have been a school principal for 20+ years, and can tell you that teachers work hard in “normal” times.  
This past year has been cognitively, emotionally and physically exhausting for them.  I’m not sure anyone outside of education - with the obvious exception of physicians and nurses - understands the toll.
If you have a kid in school, take a moment and thank their teachers.  They’re doing superhuman work."
2020-11-30 11:35,"These concerns about burnout are all very real.  As a public school teacher who works with special needs students we always spend a lot of time worrying about what is going on outside of school for our kids.  This has been a difficult year for teachers and no doubt there will be even more of a shortage after it is all over.

One thing they do not even address in this article is the extreme stress of being EXPOSED to the virus every day by meeting in person with large groups of students/staff.  When policies are made to keep schools open it is often for the sake of ""the economy"" or based on the assumption that the students won't get that sick (untrue!).  Often there is no consideration for the age, health conditions, or safety of the staff on site.  Add to that a lack of respect for the profession and mediocre pay in most states and it is absolutely a recipe for disaster."
2020-11-30 12:21,"21 year veteran here. I teach Middle School, all virtual. Of course, this is the most challenging time of my career. I have never worked so hard. Already the comments reveal the ignorance of what teachers are going through. ""Paid for a year, for nine months work, stop complaining"". ""'Only teaching for a few hours, teachers are working less..."". None of that is true, or shows that there has been even a moment spent to try to understand a teachers perspective. Some of this attitude is natural, in that for teachers, and parents, the focus is on our students, and rightly so. That being said, I have never experienced the anti teacher vitriol that has been unleashed by the pandemic.
We are demoralized as it is through concerns about our students, our own families, our own health. Teachers are people too, we are human, and we are at a breaking point. When this is all over, there will be a lot of teachers leaving the profession. Teaching standards will be far lower than they are at present, as the qualifications to be a teacher will have to be lowered to meet an acute staffing crisis. We are at the beginning of a downward spiral for teaching and education standards. The targets of community ire will stay the same, public education and the ""lazy"" teachers that are viewed as little more than grifters by too many. This pandemic has been politicized with poisonous effect. The same is currently happening to education and educators. As always teachers are easy targets."
2020-12-01 6:48,"It's absurd that school districts are trying to teach as if it's a normal year, dishing out Ds and Fs to students in way higher than normal numbers, instead of redesigning expectations and practices to be more realistic and helpful for students and teachers.  The lack of adjustment to reality beggars belief, and certainly doesn't say much for managerial ""know how"" or pedagogical adaptability among too many school admins. When it snows, put snow chains on the car tires and drive accordingly.  When it storms, dump the ballast, trim the sails and steer the ship accordingly.  It's not like these are new concepts."
2020-12-01 8:58,"While some parents like to think they are doing the job of a teacher while at home facilitating remote learning for their child, they are clearly ignorant of what goes into the planning, preparation, and execution of an actual teacher’s job. And, yes, you were were working full time while juggling the “job” of a teacher? Let me clue you in on something...teachers do that every single day. We are educators, mentors, counselors, advisors, problem solvers, not only for our students but also for parents like you who complain and only see the world narrowly through your own perspective and situation. I find it laughable and unkind of you to suggest that your children’s teachers did nothing last spring. Try to be mindful (or compassionate) and perhaps think about what struggles they may have been handling in their personal lives. Oh wait, but why bother? The only struggle that matters seems to be your own."
2020-12-01 0:34,"I’m teaching kindergarten remotely, sitting in front of my computer with the camera on for seven hours a day - five hours of teaching, plus one hour spent supervising lunch and recess, plus one prep period.  The good news is that the students who are there every day are actually learning to read a bit faster than they did in the classroom.  The bad news is that only  3/5 of the class attend all day, every day.  The rest come sporadically, don’t stay logged on the whole time, or never show up at all.  Those students are losing out, but not due to any laziness or lack of care on my part or on the school’s part.

It’s hard work.  I invite anyone who thinks it’s not to imagine being strapped into a seat for a transatlantic flight every day, with the inflight entertainment screen demanding that you entertain IT."
2020-11-29 16:32,"There is enormous, almost unthinkable sorrow in this article. It demonstrates clearly what happens when business and politicians and other well-meaning people take precedence over the very scientists to whom they entrust their own public health. 

It happened on Italy the first time around and they learned. It is happening a second - or maybe a third - time in my country and we have not yet learned. How many more deaths will there be?"
2020-11-29 16:44,"My sisters and I spend a magical day in the spring of 2017 in Bergamo. Seeing it become one of the early hotspots of this global pandemic was heartbreaking. When we were there, we marveled at the beauty and sophistication of the city and its people. I can not tell what a shock it was to see last March a place that is both modern and ancient in the best ways devastated by the Coronavirus. Knowing that made me understand how serious and deadly the virus was. The loss for the world is unimaginable and still unfolding. Bergamo's tragedy is now everyones tragedy. Bergamo you are in my thoughts."
2020-11-29 16:46,"I believe the „Ospedale da Campo“ at the fairgrounds was first opened on April 6th, was later shut down and then reopened (with extra modules) on November 2nd.
Where I am in Germany, we were also told in March that only people with a connection to China or to the Austrian ski resort Ischgl or to Heinsberg, where there had been superspreader events, would be tested for free. One colleague had all the symptons, but never got tested. Another person I know of here decided to pay extra to get tested (and was positive). Similarly in Val Brembana which belongs to Bergamo Province, where we stay in the summer, three of our neighbors definitely had caught the disease, but decided to stay home,  sweat it out and not get tested rather than deal with the frightening situations at the PGXXIII or Humanitas Gavazzeni Hospitals. I suppose some older people did the same and wound up dying at home."
2020-11-29 16:49,"I will never comprehend the rhetoric that we hear constantly that the economy is more important than human lives. Without question the economic outfall from the COVID-19 pandemic is very bad. However, the human cost is completely devastating. What is the point of profit when you don’t have a workforce? By keeping businesses such as restaurants and factories open, the virus continues to spread and will do so unconditionally. The countries that have solved this crisis have had mandatory lockdowns - enforced by military and law enforcement - which is why they have all but eradicated the spread. This article brings that wisdom right home to us. The sting is that America has never learned the lessons and continues to be a super-spreader nation to its citizens and the rest of the world."
2020-11-29 16:49,"There will doubtless be fingerpointing - but the challenge here is much deeper.  There were so many gaps, misdirection and redirection, deadly delays....this within the community of highly-educated and disciplined scientists.  But it happens within an 'Alice in Wonderland' environment stateside and even worldwide amidst claims of 'fake news' and the Deep State.  How will we negotiate the coming next wave of the virus as well as the distribution of the new vaccines?"
2020-11-29 16:52,"Having lived across the frontier in Lugano, this is a  tragedy of one of the warmest communities that there is.
It seems it is a fractal of what happened to the U.S. The balance of power between health and industry, always leaves the former in the grave. Wether black lung in Kentucky coal mine company towns or northern Italian business lobbies. 
Science has been displaced in higher education by make a buck per quarter ""business"" degrees. Interestingly, two generations ago business degrees were not well regarded in academia. Few enrolled, and was usually represented  in two year ""Business Schools"". That is elitist, but it did not pull for the best and the brightest. 
In many ways the present titular head of the U.S. is a product of that demise. The stock market trumps health. His decerebration of science and belief in superstition may eventually kill and maim, more people in America than all recent wars combined. 
I do not think this will change as America now quickly forgets what it forgot."
2020-11-29 17:22,"I was born and raised in Bergamo, and was living in New York when the crisis unfolded. I will never forget those days, with ambulances outside my window in Brooklyn 24/7 and ambulances in the background of every call with my family and friends in Bergamo. My dad told me that people were chasing ambulances there to ask for some oxygen. We lost many friends. Now life goes on in Bergamo, with a heightened awareness and yet a deep wound that likely will never heal. Maybe it must be so—trauma is a loop trap, but memory comes with a price, and memory cannot fade. It’s the best tool we have against the mistakes of the past. One day this crisis will be over, and I hope we’ll all meet on the streets, singing, perhaps dancing. I live for that day to come, and will keep fighting in the meantime. We’ll get there."
2020-11-29 16:12,At least the Italians can say they didn't realize that what was coming was unprecedented. The US states with their lost days and tragedies right now have no such excuse.
2020-11-29 16:15,"With all due respect, perhaps this matters from a “hindsight epidemiological” standpoint, but let’s just please keep the focus on the United State’s and trump’s failure to address the virus."

Worst than Italy in the spring."
2020-11-29 16:13,"We were all fools.  Scheduled to go to Rome in early March, I made the decision to switch to the UK instead, because - it was safe.  We drove around and (had I been exposed on that initial flight) I could have carried it through the north, through Wales. . . we came home early because, wakened by the texts of relatives, we were told borders would be closed.  Getting a quick (and much busier) flight back home, I called into work that first day to check and was told ""No, come in, you got in before the border closed, you don't need to quarantine"".  I'm a nurse, in a busy clinic.  I just wanted my vacation.  It could have been my (and others) epitaph."
2020-11-29 16:04,This story is being played out in the US we just don’t know it. Our elected leadership does not serve the electorate it serves their donors.
2020-11-29 16:32,"Last night I watched “The Social Dilemma” on Netflix.  It gave me a new insight as to why our country is so divided.  It raises the question, can our Republic be destroyed by people willing to take large, uncompensated, for profit risks, with other people’s lives?

Having started my working career in the Nuclear Navy, I have a strong respect for the risk and ease of spreading contamination, be it radioactive, chemical or a virus. 

When working with nuclear materials, there was no shortage of the availability and need to wear PPE including masks, testing and cleanup to prevent the spread of nuclear contamination.   

The lesson we should have learned is the spread of contamination, be it radioactive, chemical or a virus, is dangerous, can and will make people sick and kill them."
2020-11-29 17:01,"I lived abroad during the early months of Bergamo's experience. In fact, I was in a hospital in Japan, having surgery. One day, all the staff was wearing masks and gloves the world's hearts broke to see Bergamo struggling to understand how to deal with it. 

When I got back to the US in May, the incompetence and anti-science posture of government at every level was panic-inducing. Everyone was doing a different thing. In Japan, since the virus was not well understood, everyone masked up and stayed home...immediately.   In the US, despite not understanding, people did nothing because of Trump's refusal to be guided by scientists. 

The US today has had 273k Covid deaths, but Japan just 2k. The US is at least as resourced and powerful as Japan. Japan's experience makes it clear that Trump could have avoided prevented those deaths. His ignorance, incompetence and and inability to lead has killed our friends, family and countrymen. 

My father and all of my uncles fought in WW2 where 292k soldiers were killed over six years. Before he is out of office, Trump will surely exceed that number in a matter of months."
2020-11-29 16:13,"We ambulance workers became innocent spreaders due to the same mistake. Only links with China were considered when evaluating a feverish patient. By the time the error was corrected and we were instructed to wear full gear regardless of the call, we were already contaminated. But we couldn’t quarantine as we were essential workers. We had to go on. Only a test in July (!) revealed how many of us had been infected."
2020-11-29 17:18,"Individually, the story of the virus in Italy is tragic.

Taken as a whole, the global experience with SARS CoV2 is not so much a tale of this novel virus, but of the strength and wisdom of governments. It is a stark demonstration of the need for good governance, the power of governments to save or waste lives, the relative helplessness of individuals and the absence of of private industry in this time of crisis. Clearly, the individuality and ""freedoms"" on which the USA was founded has been carried to extremes. 

The Lancet and the Journal of the AMA both lauded Taiwan, which took action on 12/31/19 when WHO reported unusual pneumonias in Wuhan. The last of Taiwan's 7 deaths was on 5/18/20. Lock downs, school closures were not needed. Crushing the virus was attributed to trust in the government, it's fast action in testing, tracing, use of cell phones and speed in deploying their pandemic response plan.  The USA may be on the opposite end of the spectrum as a (or the only) wealthy, developed nation whose government denied the existence of the virus, whose central public health department (CDC) had atrophied then got cowered by the president and which made the virus a loyalty test for the president. In between these extremes are the experiences of European and Asian countries, each unique and of varying effectiveness. The pandemic in Africa seems under reported, but will be need to be explored to round out our picture."
2020-11-29 17:23,"This happened here too—a Seattle flu researcher broke protocol to test flu samples for Covid, and thus identified community spread. The WHO and national guidelines did not recognize that the cat was already out of the bag."
2020-11-29 16:22,"the tragedy of death in our country was criminal. 
""a Times investigation found that faulty guidance and bureaucratic 
delays rendered the toll far worse than it had to be.""

you COULD say the same for America - except that Trump AND his 
administration KNEW how bad it was in February, even in the summer 
he STILL did nothing, so now out situation is 3x as bad as it was before.

he needs to be prosecuted."
2020-11-29 17:05,Congratulations for this report. I think it is important and useful to hnow how to face better the new waves of Covid.
2020-11-29 17:31,The WHO’s exclusionary testing guidance was a major part of the failure to identify cases.  The testing guidelines were absurd and negated valuable observations of frontline doctors and scientists who knew they were seeing something unusual.  We owe a debt of gratitude to rebellious doctors and scientists in Seattle and Italy who ignored the deadly guidance given by their governments and the WHO.
2020-11-29 18:13,"Thank you for this very enlightening piece of reporting work. It’s truly heartbreaking, and I deeply admire the doctors who were breaking protocol - it shows the importance of independent, anti-authoritarian and scientific thinking in fighting the pandemic. In this vein, what we’re seeing in the US is not just the virus rampaging through communities but the results of a lack of clear-minded, independent and rational thinking on the part of people not heeding scientific advice. I wish this and the other articles in this series would be read and taken to heart more broadly."
2020-11-29 18:21,"A quote from the article that can be said for anywhere, anyplace within the last year:  “As the authorities decided what to do, the virus seemed to spread everywhere and touch everyone. Infections ravaged homes and apartments. People started dying.“

With hindsight as an advantage now, we will see again how history will keep repeating itself until a vaccine is distributed and effective."
2020-11-29 18:41,"Excellent article. While the guidance from the W.H.O. may have been partly to blame in the beginning, it was the lack of leadership by the Trump administration that made the pandemic worse here in America. I believe many lives could have been saved if the leadership at the highest levels had allowed the scientific  community to lead us out of the catastrophic situation.  Instead,  states were left on their own to figure out what to do. They begged for help. Trump called it a democratic hoax.  He called our governor a snake. I feel fortunate to live in a state where the governor and scientists took the pandemic seriously and began early to mitigate the situation as best they could."
2020-11-29 18:46,"""...it is easy to forget how alone among Western democracies Italy was in February, confronted with a threat for which it had no playbook.""

They were canaries in the proverbial coal mine. All the issues that still dominate the response to this deadly virus first surfaced in Bergamo: the conflicts between industry and the medical establishment; lack of supplies at the worst possible moments; sometimes flying blind until new evidence is confirmed; the medical burnouts that occur in successive viral surges. 

Reading this is both instructive and not. Hindsight is always 20-20 sadly enough."
2020-11-29 19:12,"There is a saying:  plan for the worst, hope for the best. It’s truly remarkable how most governments have proved to be inept in acting on this philosophy. 

Obviously the downside of acting on this rule is that you do such a good job mitigating risk that you actually prevent something bad from happening.  Then the citizens accuse you of over reacting.  

Also remarkable is how the authority figure of the WHO prevented doctors from thinking for themselves when it came to testing."
2020-11-29 20:00,"New Zealand too was looking in the wrong direction in February to mid-March. The first cases at the end of February and in early March were not linked to China. They arrived with travellers from Iran, Italy and the U.S. 

One thing NZ did right, however, was to use the tests recommended by the WHO instead of trying to develop its own test as the US did, causing lengthy delays - the last thing needed in a pandemic. With those delays the US lost any possibility of controlling the virus.

I think the WHO failed its duties badly in two respects. Firstly its officers  were guilty of over-thinking things. It should not have recommended that testing be limited to patients with clear connections with China. Testing materials were in short supply. The WHO therefore sought to influence the way in which tests were prioritised. That was a terrible error of judgment in the circumstances. It should have left poltical judgments to individual countries to make based on their particular circumstances. 

The second failure was its attempts to weigh in on other political issues. It advised against border closures because it judged that the economic effects would be too harsh. As a result there were delays in closing borders or introducing border controls, vastly exacerbating the the scale and the economic cost of the pandemic and the resulting misery and hardship.

The WHO needs to take a good hard look at its own decision-making processes and become clearer about the limits of its purview."
2020-11-29 20:16,"When I lived in Italy, I had an amazing weekend in Bergamo. It breaks my heart that people of that city had to suffer so much.  I hope we all learn from this disaster and define better protocols to prevent the next pandemic"

2020-11-29 21:40,"Whether infected or not, frontline medical care providers and their families are suffering mightily from Covid-19 emotional trauma. That toll has to be compromising the care for everyone needing a hospital for all the other diseases affecting us.

People, everybody’s overreacting to this. Facemasks are NOT a proven safety method“ This was this past Friday’s show!

Now remember this is the same “doctor”That said back in April that the coronavirus was less harmful than the flu. So that he still has a public platform to dispense his fantasies is very upsetting.

At least we have learned, by terrible trial and terrible error, and we are getting better at this fight.

2020-11-29 19:49,"Among the most populous countries in the world, China was the only one to avoid the Covid- 19 spreading from Wuhan City to its continental-size territory. The protocol was to impose a severe lockdown in a city of 11 million people. Such a measure would be impossible to be carried out in Western democracies.

In the case of Bolsonaro in Brazil and Donald Trump in the USA, the pandemic became entangled with politics as a tool to spread fake news. The result is a convergence between the two countries.  The US and Brazil are leading the ranking of nations with the largest number of infections and deaths."
2020-11-29 21:13,"But Italy learned, put its knowledge into effect, and recovered.

The United States, under Trump, dithered, prevaricated, and covered up. 266,000 deaths later and more than 3 million infected, the United States, under Trump, has all but given up even trying to stem the virus, ignored it, and instead had one major political party in control of the federal government insisting that opening up the economy was more vital than stopping the spread.

2020-11-29 18:26,"In spite of mistakes, what is so striking about the response to Covid-19 in Italy and Europe in general is that it was driven by SCIENCE and EXPERTS.   No European leader suggested that citizens inject detergents, no European leader said there was “too much” testing, no leader said that they knew more than the doctors about the virus.  By far the biggest failure in response to the virus is right here in America.  The failure was caused by Donald Trump's ""leadership"" and yet because he champions white power, 74 million Americans still love him."
2020-11-29 19:12,"Hey, Jason:  You're making it seem that Dra. Avogaradi is responsible for the death and for the outbreak of COVID-19 in Bergamo.  She isn't.  If you want to attach blame, it should rest squarely on the shoulders of China, which failed to divulge what was known about COVID-19 at the outset.  Remember that physicians there also initially treated patients as if they had influenza, which has signs that are similar to the much more pernicious COVID-19."
2020-11-29 20:28,"The early confusion in Bergamo in February 2020 is understandable. Covid-19 was a novel disease then, not much was known about it. 
The same confusion happened in China in the last 1 or 2 months of 2019. Chinese government was criticized for “hiding” the disease outbreak, but what really happened was most likely that the Chinese government didn’t know what kind of disease they were dealing with. Even the “whistleblower” Dr. Li Wenliang was wrong by calling it a SARS outbreak. 
It’s only in January 2020 when the Chinese scientists successfully isolated the virus and fully sequenced its gene that they began to realize they had a new killer disease which turned out much harder to control than SARS."

Americans who insist on solemnly complaining about the current president, however, many of these same people are completely silent on the for-profit ""healthcare system"" that exists in America. A system that surely is leading to more Covid-19 deaths and worsening the pandemic in the US. Oddly, it's rare to see any online comments pointing this out. 

At least the patients and their families featured in this article and the photos won't be faced with 6 figure inflated medical bills while they are trying to recover from this disease. For all the missteps in this article, at least the Italians can be proud that they don't deliberately kill their own people by insisting on getting some health care corporations rich off the pandemic."
2020-11-29 17:50,"We are in debt to the doctors who broke protocol and tested for covid.  They bought time for others to observe and prepare.  BTW, it is not an accident that the Italian doctors who broke protocol were women.  People in the “out” group are used to thinking differently and are less afraid of going against the group, because they are already outsiders in a sense.  Thank you for illustrating why diversity in leadership matters.  We are stronger together."
2020-11-29 18:06,"It appears that the influence of ""national business lobbies"" on the national government was the main culprit in keeping Bergamo open too long. And that single-minded concentration on thinking China had to be the source of any infection set the table for that."
2020-11-29 18:52,"The United States had at least two months warning of the pandemic arrival and did nothing .
The Lombardy region of Italy was taken by surprise in February, due to too cautious advice by WHO, that simplistically tied the pandemic to China travelers.
In this world, where the border between human developments and animal habitat is getting smaller due to destruction of nature, these pandemics will be more frequent and deadlier.
Perhaps China should have been more honest, instead of being buried in secrecy, and should have given a strong alarm to the world about this extremely dangerous virus.
Bureaucracy and secrecy were used instead.
Nobody was prepared for this disaster, no PPE and especially no test kits( even the CDC sent millions of defective test kits nationwide).
Bergamo suffered the inflexible bureaucracy of Rome, following the WHO advice, while the adjacent region Veneto took matters in their own hands and tested symptomatic patients with no connection with China and partially won the war against Covid."
2020-11-29 18:59,"The reports of unusual pneumonia in Wuhan China in December 2019 was known worldwide but was ignored or not acted upon with the exception of Taiwan who have now reported only 7 deaths. Other Asian and African countries have also faired much better than Western countries because not only did the governments guided by science take effective early steps but the population were overwhelmingly on board. The contrasting approaches demonstrate the the virus loves the situation where government and/or science politicize their decisions or dither before taking decisive action.

I find it inconceivable that we are still debating the merits of prioritizing public health for the economy and jobs. With a pandemic ravaging the workforce and overwhelming medical facilities there cannot be a functioning economy. Why is this so hard to understand?"

2020-11-29 21:43,"I work in medical field in setting with immunologists and experts in protocols for medical biohazard labs. This is how the thousands that I work with all stayed free of COVID-19. Back in early Feb we read the first medical research reports on the viability of the virus both Aerosolized and on surfaces. And we read reports from doctors in China treating patients. Then we all realized the CDC the WHO and US government talking heads were ALL LYING TO EVERYONE  about proper protection against COVID-19 (and still lying to this day). So beginning late Feb all the medical trained people I know already had purchased PPE and we all IGNORED all their lies and followed our own biomedical lab hazard protocols for a virus of this nature. If we went outside our home we all wore Surgical gloves and N95 (or N100) masks and eye protection. All clothing gets removed and washed upon returning. EVERY SINGLE ITEM (mail, packages, food) gets disinfected (by a family member wearing PPE) before the item enters our home an if impractical to disinfect it doesn’t enter our home. We DO NOT wash our hands more than a couple times per day no more than we did before COVID-19. Hand washing is another govt lie that’s an intended distraction... because if your behaviors allow COVID into your home and you need to try washing hands every 5 min to try to mitigate that then you have a FAILED biohazards control protocol. Got it? Now you understand how my family has been so active but never caught COVID"

As an educator these words jump out at me, “In June, Italy bestowed a knighthood in the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic on Dr. Malara, the physician who exposed the outbreak by disregarding the protocol.”   How do we educate students to be the one to disregard protocol and do what they believe is right?  What experiences are we providing our students so when the next pandemic arrives, they will do the right thing and save the people?  Our lives will be in their hands.  Are we teaching them to work inside the box or teaching them to question the status quo?  These are the questions running through my mind."

People knew that wearing masks, social distancing. washing hands, contact tracing. Isolation and treatment are the most effective way to deal with any pandemic.

What happened here was negligent at best and criminal and fraudulent at worst.

Corruption has been a secular and sectarian problem in Italy for millennia."
2020-11-29 22:09,This seems like old news... you should instead continue the pressure to root out why china’s regime and secrecy failed the world rather than publishing the same old insights about western bureaucracy. Go after the source for once and don’t be afraid.
2020-11-29 22:04,"One or two elements are missing in this otherwise nice and factual article. Bergamo and the region of Lombardi where Bergamo and Lodi are, have in the recent years tried to rely as much as they could on the private health industry instead of the National system, and this was one of the reasons of the bad coordination inside the region. The pressure from the Confindustria, the attitude of the religious Bergamaschi on their religion and ethic of work and profit made a bad case worst."
2020-11-29 21:49,"Mr.  Horowitz, in recent months you have reported with great scruple and honest self-citations, the dramatic epidemiological and human events that took place in these months in Italy often choosing Bergamo as a paradigm of the dynamism of this story.  
In a relatively short time, Italy went from a ""place to be avoided as a nightmare"" to a ""country admirable for its ability to contain the epidemic.”.
You leave unresolved and perhaps unsolvable questions to us ,readers.  It is a time of questions, of suffering, of hopes.  But ,above all, of sharing.  My gastritis got a lot worse when Trump attacked Fauci.  Now it is a little better.  But no more.  There are doctors who work without protection in Italy and hospitals where there is maximum safety.  My relatives in NYC get sick like those who live in Rome.  I suffer, as a doctor and as a man I ask myself: will I get it tomorrow?"
2020-11-29 22:29,I live not far from Nembro in a small village of ca. 2500 inhabitants and in one month we lost about 50 people. Maybe the Dakotas and Co should pay a bit more attention to what happened here and stop sacrificeing their elderly and infirm while overtaxing their hospitals.
2020-11-29 22:34,"Mr. Horowitz you have just told what any Italian knows. We went through a first phase (January-February) in which the Government underestimated the danger (basically, the Government did nothing). Then, for a sort of strange compensation, the Government started to overestimate the danger and decided to shut down, not one province, but the whole country. The disaster was the result of these two mistakes."
2020-11-29 22:43,"This explains how the virus managed to spread so quickly. What question the article doesn't seem to answer is why the mortality rates in this region were so high. Looking at the pictures in the article, one gets the impression that an aged population is the culprit. Yes, yes, we know - anyone of any age can die of Covid. The fact remains that older people still seem to be at greater risk. At any rate, that's only really my surmise. It would have been nice if the article delved a little more deeply into what the research has been on that aspect of this tragedy."
2020-11-29 22:46,"We don’t yet know why Australians agreed to lock down quickly and put an end to coronavirus, when so many other nations wasted time. When our large outbreak happened we went hard at it willingly. 
We are now free of the virus because of the many measures introduced early and enforced, with leadership that showed us the danger and seriousness of it.
We did about six weeks of severe lockdown and now life returns to more normality.
We didn’t know how rare it is to nationally and locally adopt behaviour for greater good and we still have politicians prepared to act swiftly despite the political cost. Unlike Italy."
2020-11-29 23:25,"I vividly recall watching on cable news in late February, Don McNeil of the NYTimes discussing the oncoming train that was coming out of Italy.
Confusion and disbelief was tempered by his reasoned and rational explanation of the life and death decisions that were being made, and how we needed to prepare here in the States.
That reporting turned out to be spot on accurate and allowed informed decisions about the misinformation that was to come from the current administration.
For those that watched that chilly evening in February, thanks to Mr. McNeil for his reporting. And thanks to the NYTimes and other responsible organizations for their judgement and responsibility in reporting what is really the news."

My takeaway: When in unknown territory, consider setting aside the rules.

It is always good to know why rules were put in place and in what circumstances they apply, and to use them when appropriate. But blindly following them is just as dangerous as blindly rejecting them."
2020-11-30 1:00,"And Trumpers still consider the Covid pandemic a hoax or a joke. A conspiracy carried out all over the world, so he wouldn't get reelected. What are we to do with these science-hating Americans and their willful ignorance?"
2020-11-30 1:02,"I was shocked not to find an epilogue reflecting on the lesson applicable to the tragically ignorant situation here in the US.  This lengthy white-paper critique of Italy's failure and modest successes is best written for their internal consumption and from an Italian native perspective.  Although  instructive and curdling, I became more and more self-conscious and squirmish by the paragraph.  Perhaps an Italian author will be published in the NYT with the same critique of monumental self-examination, but with New York City as the focus."
2020-11-30 1:10,"Italy was the first country to ban flights from China, yet it didn’t help much. 
It now seems clear that about half of the patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic. Researchers in Milan, looking for the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in preserved serum previously drawn from volunteers, have just published their results suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have been in circulation in Italian communities since September 2019, several months before the Italian government prohibited Chinese flights. This puts in question whether the Wuhan outbreak actually may have started earlier than reported, or, alternatively, the SARS-CoV-2 infection may have originated outside China. 
Anyway, it’s clear that when dealing with a new disease like Covid-19, it’s better to be more cautious. Testing only those with symptoms or those with China travel history definitely was not enough."
2020-11-30 2:23,"The WHO, like our national government, proved unequal to the task when confronted with a major pandemic.

Over 321,000 Chinese citizens live in Italy, the largest numbers in Lombardy, Tuscany, and Veneto (not even counting former Chinese citizens who have acquired Italian nationality or Italian-born people of Chinese descent).

Many of those Chinese hail from Wuhan province.  Not to incriminate these people is fully appropriate, but it beggars belief to look at these demographics, to ignore asymptomatic person-to-person contagion, and to conclude, ""Let's only test those who have flown to or from China recently."""

2020-11-30 6:06,Nice article.  But remember their real problem was to ignore the experience in China where the virus had already ravaged Wuhan since the end of zjsnuary.  China was truly dealing with something she hadn’t seen.  What was Italy and our excuse with the benefit of hindsight?
2020-11-30 7:48,"I am italian and I live in Bergamo. This article is thouroughly lacking. It should be amended to say the least. Throughout the article the authors keep talking about the response of the national government, but not once they mention the actual responsible of health care, i.e. the local government (Regione Lombardia - Region Lombardy), as defined in the Constitution of the Republic of Italy, Title V, Article 117.
To avoid talking about the choices and the orders from the local government (only authority for health care) is just like talking about the response of the federal US government to the Covid-19 outbreak in Columbus OH, without mentioning once the choices operated by the state of Ohio.
The quality of this article is defnitely below the minimum standard required for reporting."
2020-11-30 6:24,"The inefficiency and delays and then the blaming elsewhere is something I noticed in daily dealings with many Italians. I would like to understand the root of these behaviors or problems or national characteristics, whatever you call them. Most of the times they are just part of the package and there is too much I love about Italians and Italy to care too much but when they result in unnecessary deaths like this it is just so tragic. I learned that a local shopkeeper has passed away recently due to this virus, and it really hit home for me. He was a 3rd generation owner of a neighborhood shop that sold anything from nails to pasta machine. It’s so sad to see his shop shuttered."
2020-11-30 4:13,"We must not feel superior to the Italians as in New York State 6-8 thousand nursing home staff and residents died needlessly from Covid 19  infections and we have not had one public review of exactly why this happened .
Old people ,the infirm and the  underpaid nursing home staff are seemingly dispensible here. Where are the Federal investigations as to how this happened?"
2020-11-30 9:08,"How can you expect people to stop working and quarantine at home when they have no resources to feed their families and keep a roof over their heads?  Not to mention pay for healthcare. 
At least some of the European governments were making sure that those who couldn’t work received continuing guaranteed income.  What did we do here for waiters, small business owners, and Midwest meat packers?  Cut off unemployment benefits and toss them a fifteen hundred dollar check that was gone in a few days. Who’s surprised the virus is still spreading.?"
2020-11-30 9:47,"Why are we getting this article about Bergamo, Italy, every day for the last three—when the US has a Pandemic crisis of far greater magnitude? Why rehash this old news? We were trounced with it back in April/May and we know all we need to know about Bergamo now. We have more photos coming out of Bergamo’s hospital wards than we have seen of the entire United States. Is there no one reporting from the frontlines of US hospitals in cities and rural areas that are already beyond capacity ? Isn’t that news more relevant now? 

Where are the photographs of our shanty morgues in alleyways? The videos showing exhausted doctors and nurses begging us not to travel as they’ve no more beds and no doctors to care for them? Where are the photos and stories of the thousands in the US lying on gurneys for days and nights in hallways because there are no beds and the hospitals are beyond capacity and short-staffed? Why are we reading about Italy and not the small rural US hospitals trying to transfer their patients to larger hospitals and getting refused ? Why aren’t we interviewing exhausted doctors on the frontlines in American hospitals who’ve been battling this pandemic far longer than Bergamo has? 

What lessons are to be had from Italy when the US can’t even look at itself?"
2020-11-30 3:44,"All across this nation we have towns, and areas of cities, that are their own Bergamos. Our federal and state governments have done a miserable job responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. If we could get over our superiority complex, we could look at smaller, poorer countries that have responded to the pandemic in masterful ways, and emulate the reasons for their successes.

I took from the Nov. 22nd WHO report the data in their columns entitled “Cumulative cases per 1 million population” and “Cumulative deaths per 1 million population.” See below a comparison of those two figures, between the U.S. and :

United States: 35,616 and 763

Thailand: 56 and 1

Vietnam: 13 and <1

Mongolia: 178 and <1

Ghana: 1,637 and 10

Sri Lanka: 923 and 4

Trinidad & Tobago: 4,474 and 81

Senegal: 948 and 20

Rwanda: 434 and 4

Q: What is at the taproot of the U.S.’s miserable response?
A: Greed. A significant proportion of monied people sustained all anti-lockdown initiatives. They did so at local, state, and federal levels. Money trumped public health.

Q: Who suffers the most?
A: Low-wage workers, people of color (the overlap of those 2 categories is significant), and frontline workers, who can’t possibly do their jobs from home.

Q: Who suffers the most from school closures?
A: See previous answer: those people and their children."

The National Cancer Institute of Italy in Milan underwent a research study for cancer screening from Sept 2019 to March 2020 (included blood samples and low dose CT lung scan. They had recruited 959 healthy enrollees throughout Italy.

The scientist in Italy basically asked the question , how could in Jan 30 2020, a couple of Chinese tourist in Italy tested positive for covid-19 and the first case reported of covid-19 in Italy in Feb 20, 2020 ( There was no connection between the two events ). It  has exploded into aa epicenter of infection in Europe. The researcher looked into early blood samples to see if there was any hints to explain this phenomena. To their surprise, they found 11.6% or 111 participants out of 959 tested positive for SARS-COV-2 specific antibodies. In addition, there was at least one positive antibody test in 13 regions out of  20 regions in Italy. It was circulating in Italy as early as Oct 2019. (They theorized that there must be low level transmission and infections.Therefore it was not easily detected ). There were two peaks, one in late Sept to mid Oct 2019 and the second was in mid Feb 2020 corresponding to the explosion in Lombardy. The study was published in Tumori Journal in Italy Nov 10, 2020. The serological antibody tests were performed by University of Vienna in Italy."

Surprise surprise – it’s not a surprise to me, It’s certainly raised an eyebrow but when you look at the link and the silk worms and the silk ties made in Italy… The tragedy begins to make sense. I would find out who besides the Kushner, textile manufacturers and that industry, own land, ￼￼and have factories in the Wuhan area￼...Enough  Italians of Chinese extraction went to visit families at Chinese New Year and returned.￼And went back-and-forth p; businessmen in the textile industry and related firms traveled to and from Wall Street.

2020-11-30 10:01,"it's impossible not to shed tears while reading this. The anger, the sorrow, the memories of our lives swept away by this disease. It has not even been a full year but life before the pandemics feels like forever ago. Italy had a modest success the first time around even though someone will have to pay for what happened in Bergamo. However, I wonder now while being in lockdown again: who will pay for what is happening now during the second wave? who will pay for the delays? Who will pay for not being able to have long-term visions for our politics? who will pay for having ruined the public debate about Covid? Is there even someone to blame? Or is it that our modern western states with their hypertrophic bureaucracy are inapt for a meaningfull decision making? Is it that our government, so dependent on an ever changing electorate, cannot think of itself as more than a temporary guide exclusively for current matters?"

2020-11-30 10:52,"Sir,
The excellent survey on Bergamo and the local and central governments  may, perhaps, be  seen  as against what happened in Vò, a town not far from Bergamo. 
Professor Crisanti of Oxford and Padua Universities designed a survey to trace the diffusion of the virus in   the community, identifying   asymptomatics and  people needing urgent care, by isolating the source of the diffusion of the infection from  community life.
He looked at the web of social relations, rather than to single cases, like a community study..
For reasons needing a serious explanation, since we are are dealing with countless victims,  the Italian government and the  Scientific Committee did not  pay attention to the ""Vò model"". 
We need a judcial enquiry.
My best regards,"
2020-11-30 12:43,"In stark contrast to Northern Italy and the USA, several countries in East and SE Asia worked proactively to prevent the virus from gaining a foothold. I've had an expatriate American worm's eye view of how this played out in Thailand, where the death toll in this country with more people than Italy stands at sixty and the vast industrial estates surrounding Bangkok never closed. On January 5th, before the corona virus we know as Covid 19 had a name, Thailand was monitoring flights from Wuhan, China and isolating people with symptoms similar to what had been reported in China. Without knowing much about the disease other than it was respiratory in nature, health authorities took the precaution of isolating people with symptoms in negative pressure rooms. Less than a week later China sent genome information to scientists around the world, and the race was on. Thailand found the first case outside of China on January 13th. By early February, with Lunar New Year still in progress, Thai health authorities understood that masks and other critical supplies were supplied from China and were therefore at risk. By mid February, mask shortages had been resolved with production by cottage industries within Thailand. Meanwhile, authorities in the USA stayed in denial. Here, in mid March, as super-spreader events threatened, non-essential business closed and remained closed through May. Epidemiologists understand lives are saved with quick action. This requires trustworthy leadership."
2020-11-30 14:31,And so who is going to trust the WHO and Western national health experts the next time they tell us we don't have to worry about an outbreak of a new deadly virus? Not I. Their blindness to local community spread and to the extent of global interconnectedness led to the pandemic exploding all over European and American countries.
2020-11-30 14:51,"Human beings are fallible and they make mistakes. It seems to me the first mistake and the most deadliest was the assumption that there were few or no asymptomatic infections. Perhaps that is rare in other viruses. Based on that premise the protocol was to only test symptomatic people who had traveled from China. This allowed the virus to begin community spread long before anyone realized. A previous NYT article showed how many hundreds of thousands of people from around the world flew in and out of Wuhan, spreading the virus long before any lock downs. 

The second most critical mistake was not producing more test kits as soon as they were developed. The lack of the ability to test, saving the tests for only those who met the criteria of some connection to China again allowed a large amount of community spread prior to the first recognized case. 

Combine the above with politicians and businesses focused on the economy and you have more critical delays. Add in a US President who actually says idiotic things like ""The only reason our cases are going up is because we test too much"". Then add in people who are too selfish or in denial and refuse to follow directives to wear masks and stay home.... Well here we are.

I can understand the initial premise that only symptomatic people are spreading the virus but the lack of testing (the inability to widely test early on) was preventable and hid the virus from sight way too long. This gave a false sense of ""The virus is not here."""

Part of the problem is that when something goes wrong, our focus shifts to the blame game. The lawyers arrive and all common sense goes out the window. We need to learn from our mistakes and do better with uncertainty. The problem is when it involves peoples health the lack of affordable health care makes it even higher stakes. Easy answer is to not even try. This could have been a great time to update all the school buildings and create jobs for lots of people.

I am so tired of the union-bashing going on. I am so tired of people expecting teachers to potentially sacrifice their lives for their students' well-being...we teachers have been sacrificing constantly since teaching became primarily a woman's job. We sacrifice income, time, dignity and respect from our communities and fellow Americans, our own money to supply our classrooms because of highly inadequate funding, and more. And now they want me to sacrifice my health and my family's health? Seriously? 

And why do we cling to this idea that ""back in the classroom"" is the only way to teach kids? Let's find ways to improve what we are doing now. Teachers are doing amazing things through their own ingenuity, and with their own money. Maybe if we teachers received adequate support, we could make remote teaching/ learning even better. I have students who, along with their parents PREFER remote learning now. 

On that note, how about do some reporting about the successes...there are plenty of those, but as usual, the media uses teachers and unions as pariahs."

With monetary support from the FEDs, they will be able to make up for lost time although many are learning virtually. A dead child is gone forever; a sick child may never feel like herself again..and the same with an educator..."

In most of Europe, I’m based in France schools reopened in September. My son is daycare age and even in the worst surge weeks not a single child was reported to have caught the virus. Moreover the infection rate is much lower in younger folks and most of our cluster surges were due to social gatherings - bars, return to work etc. This isn’t a critique, just really trying to understand what the situation is over there."
2020-11-28 17:57,At this point I say cancel in school learning through summer 2021.  The fight is just too exhausting.  Not all but many teachers unions just don't want to go back to work.  Are we really going to work on the ventilation/HVAC of every school?  This seems to be a common talking point.  I have worked at home since March I get it but I also know that it is not perfect.

The desks are barely 3 feet apart and there is not money to buy partitions. When a teacher is exposed to covid from a student, he/she is expected to remain in class unless symptoms are present. The child is quarantined, as are the 4 students sitting 3 feet away. Everyone else remains. Schools are going back to all-virtual next week, as our infection rate has jumped  In person education is possible and necessary if proper restrictions are imposed; smaller class sized, better protections and cleaning procedures, HEPA filters, etc. My Republican state of Indiana is the poster child of what not to do."

Now, the alarms are removed and we are encouraged to open the doors for greater ventilation as mitigation against transmission of Covid-19. I am particularly worried about virus transmission post-Thanksgiving to late January as people attend holiday celebrations. Anxiety is high among many teachers at my school. We don't have a union.

Just imagine if the official Administration of Incompetence and Self-Aggrandizement had made it a top priority to pour all the federal dollars possible into addressing this horrible quandary with a focus on internet access, technological equity, etc. to make learning available to all, no matter what. Yes, virtual learning is especially inadequate for teaching the little ones, but it could at least have been better than nothing!"
2020-11-28 17:42,"By the way, for those that aren’t aware, teachers are teaching with students in front of them, all around the nation. Obviously policies vary in different regions. My union asked for a “holiday pause” to teach remotely for two weeks in order to stem possible outbreaks such as the infection spike we saw after Halloween. The teachers, the majority of the school board, principals and coordinators, and many parents were on board with this idea. The superintendent shot it down, probably fearing a vocal minority opposing it on Facebook groups. Teachers are also, for the record, still receiving observations and find themselves subject to evaluation scores based upon testing. However, back we go on Monday, doing what we always do, working hard and preparing students with all the resources we can muster."
2020-11-28 19:20,"I teach history at a middle/high school in Germany in a socially and economically problematic area. We went into lockdown and switched to distance learning back in the spring and many students couldn’t handle it. They lack the structure, self discipline  and support at home to participate in zoom calls, to check assignments online. Often the few students who do hand in work online, without a teacher to help, the quality has plummeted. I’m part of a teachers union but think kids need to return to school. If hospitals can stay open, so can schools. And honestly, if we don’t, these kids are further going to be socialised by more nefarious elements of their communities."

2020-11-28 18:21,"The very real impact of school closure on learning and social progress in children doesn’t alter the fact that the school environment cannot be kept safe in a US reporting over a million cases a week. “Operating schools during COVID-19,” the CDC’s web page, notes how “evidence is growing that children of all ages are susceptible to...infection and, contrary to early reports, might play a role in transmission.”

Consequences follow not just for teachers and staff, but for kids as well, the CDC averring that if hospitalization is uncommon at such a young age, the ICU becomes destination for one-third of pupils who enter the hospital at all. Kronbichler and coauthors tell us that SARS coronavirus 2 induces lesions in outpatients despite the mild clinical course; these included ground-glass opacity on lung CT scans and abnormally low white cell counts in blood tests for most of the elementary schoolchildren they reviewed. Whether the lesions will affect future health remains unclear.

I wish we’d done more this summer to get those caseloads down. Bar crowds, motorcycle rallies, Trump campaigns and people flooding the beaches then are a reason the district superintendents face a devil’s choice between educational loss and the virus menacing our communities now.

If it were just about showing up and teaching and learning with special protocols in place, as a teacher I would have no problem returning. However, with lunch, passing period, discipline cases, and the day-to day of teams, clubs, ASB activities, and the like, one quickly realizes the many ways infection can spread.  Not to mention custodial duties in most comprehensive high schools are virtually always stretched to the limit.

Very few chose to do so, despite the access to technology hurdles in our community. All of my parents cited the health risk to their multigenerational households/bubbles when declining in-person school. They aren't wrong: My colleagues who have fallen ill are the ones who don't wear masks at work (and don't follow precautions elsewhere, I presume). My students' parents are trying to make it all work and they're exhausted. The leadership failures at the federal and state level enable these local failures."
2020-11-28 21:17,"1.  Plexiglass shields are hygiene theater.  Air currents can move around them.

2.  The science that transmission is low in schools is not ""strong"", it is based on one study by an ECONOMIST at Brown University who has a ""dashboard"" of non-randomized, self-reported data who drew her conclusions that ""schools are not superspreaders"" on two-weeks worth of data back in September for a disease that has a long lag time.  That ""study"" gets quoted and reported on over and over, while peer reviewed studies in the Lancet and Science showing school closures are effective are ignored.

3. Teachers and school staff who advocate for distance learning are not being obstructive;  they understand the nature of school buildings and students' behavior better than anyone else.  School staff who say schools are not safe are protecting the community as a whole.

4.  I think it's time to stop undermining efforts at remote education and start thinking of how to remediate gaps in education once the pandemic abates."
2020-11-28 21:48,"We have been doing this in Vermont since September and our Covid rate is still quite low (even though we are rising with the rest of the nation) and the rate of transmission within the schools is also very, very low. I have a 3rd grader and a Kindergartener who are in school M-F full time. They’ve completely adjusted to wearing a mask all day, socially distancing, staying in their classroom (as opposed to moving to different rooms for the Arts, PE, Guidance, Lunch and Library), and constantly washing their hands. They think of “following the safety rules” as their civic duty and they are overjoyed to be in school. 

I’m a high school teacher and am teaching in the hybrid model, as well as fully remote classes. (Theater classes, no less - ponder that!) My husband is a college professor, taught hybrid classes for the first 1/2 of the semester, and is now teaching online until February while students are on break. My husband and I both get tested regularly at our schools and each one of us (kids included) have to fill out an online health form each morning to be eligible to be in our buildings. 

So - for a family of educators and students, it can be done! In the district where I teach and where my kids attend school, the schools shut down if there are any Covid cases - knowing the administration will do the right thing at the drop of a hat helps us feel better about sending our kids to school and working in schools ourselves. None of it is ideal, but it works, at least for now."

We are doing hybrid classes, and most kids work virtually.  Those who do come, however, have a hard time wearing their masks correctly. If I had 25-30 physically in the room doing that, I'd retire--I'm close to sixty and my spouse has cancer.  Also, I keep reading about the kids who are struggling, and I agree they would do better in class, but we also have kids who are admittedly doing better without the behavior distractions.  The bottom line is that we're just going to have to push through this, whatever happens, with education. Some kids not going to college due to this situation is certainly a good trade off for some teachers not dying."
2020-11-28 20:45,"Kids need to return to school in as normative fashion as is possible. Though no longer in the classroom myself, I will always be a teacher and have supported many of teachers’ grievances/concerns for well over a decade. I’m sorry, but I feel strongly that teachers have become far too comfortable teaching from home. I fear they have lost sight of how damaging it is for many of our kids, even the very high achieving ones.

I know Covid-19 is still a great concern (as it should be); however, studies have shown that transmission is far less likely with students attending brick and mortar school as opposed to folks dining out, visiting one another, etc. 

We talk about achievement gaps; well, if students aren’t returned to schools - why aren’t public school kids’ education just as valued as those of private and parochial school kids?! They absolutely should be! - there won’t be a gap, but an ocean. To paraphrase the young lady in the article: Can’t we even try?"

Also - Normalizing at home learning while it is necessary is not the same as embracing it as a long term solution. At home learning is trying to make the best learning experience possible faced with really hard realities. Listening to the front line hospitals workers these is a big flashing red light.  We need to hear and respect what they are experiencing. We are at thousands dying a day and climbing. How many more have to die?"

I'm surprised that race and racism are not more of a focus in the liberal media about the schools.  Our local private school is almost all white while minorities prefer the public school. 

It will take time for the Democrats to realize that school closings are negatively disproportionately affecting minority students.  Then, they will have to figure out how Trump, the Republicans and racists outsmarted the Democrats, again, by using the virus outbreak as a ruse to provide substandard educations to students of color."
2020-11-28 22:32,"In my mind, the key benefits of in person schooling are not educational but social. For kids at risk, school is often their one safe haven, a regular meal, healthy and happy interactions (hopefully) with other kids and adults. It's also probably more important for younger kids, who need to learn the basics, rather than older kids who, realistically, can probably survive without a term of learning some inaccessible Shakespeare/Chaucer text or memorising their country's politicians.

On a final note, if anyone thinks that the lockdowns in Australia/NZ etc were excessive/govt overreach, kids have been back at school since April in some states. They don't need or use masks, no sneeze guards and the kids get to play together as usual. Which is real freedom?"

2020-11-28 22:28,"High school math teacher here.  The question isn't whether my current distance-learning classes are as good as my in-person classes were prior to March 2020.  For most students, they're not.  The question is whether the new ""hybrid"" classes are an improvement.  

Here's an analogy.  Suppose everyone agrees that the campground on the northern shore of a river is better than the one on the southern shore: nicer views, better campsites, better swimming holes.  However, due to a massive landslide, the northern campground is inaccessible.  So we must use the southern shore campground instead.  And then someone has the idea: let's compromise!  Let's camp in the middle of the river instead!

Hybrid classes are like that: an unwieldy compromise.  You cannot do all of the best activities that you used to do (such as students huddling together over a math problem).  You cannot even see their facial expressions.  And you are supposed to be handling your distance-learning students at the same time (which makes the online experience much worse as well).  It simply is not as good."
2020-11-28 22:49,"To everyone saying “kids are resilient,” know that there are limits to how much isolation and stress that developing minds and bodies can absorb. 

Data from past school closures—after the Brown vs. Board decision in the South, after Hurricane Katrina, and in other countries during the lockdown of this spring—paint a conclusively bleak picture. 

Kids with resources at home may be able to “bounce back” from a year out of school, but kids in under-resourced communities are likelier to face lifelong obstacles because of our failure to provide them with this essential service.

Europe, Canada, and other parts of the world are intimately aware of the toll that school closures would take on their students and societies. It’s why they’re avoiding them at all cost. They’re also finding, fortunately, that their testing data support reopening schools, anyway."
2020-11-28 22:42,"Plastic shields and face-masks are like running the pumps on the Titanic.  It postpones the disaster, but it does not STOP IT.  The virus is airborne, and while we send our children to school, they are exposed to it.  And then they bring it home.

Trump pushed for schools to re-open in August because he wanted parents to go back to work and re-start the economy.  He thought an economic rebound would make people forget about the pandemic and would win him re-election.  It didn't. And 265,000 Americans paid the ultimate price for Trump's hubris.  There will be more.

I'm a high school teacher, and I'm putting my life on the line every day that we're in school.  I love my students and, quite frankly, I need the paycheck.  We've already recorded four cases of Covid-19--two students and two faculty.  There will be more.  I wear a face-mask religiously, I practice social distancing sternly, and I wash my hands obsessively.  Still, I wonder when my luck will run out--because it will.

It is a PANDEMIC, people.  It is not a seasonal thing.  The virus doesn't get tired.  It doesn't think about ""getting back to normal.""  It spreads, and it kills.  That's what viruses DO.

Every time I go to the grocery store, I can tell who the Republicans are--the ones who refuse to wear masks, the ones who insist it's all a Democrat hoax. And when they get Covid-19, they'll be the ones screaming, ""Why didn't the government do more to protect ME?""

2020-11-28 23:01,"I am the parent of 2 kids in a school district in central Pennsylvania that has been committed to in person instruction since August. About 1/4-1/3 of our students opted for a full time virtual program staffed by dedicated teachers. The remainder have opted for in person instruction. 

K-5 is at school 5 days a week, with masks and social distancing. The district somehow was able to shrink class sizes with some creative uses of teachers and space: my 3rd grader is in a class of 14. Middle and high school are in a hybrid model with 2 days in person and 3 days asynchronous. It proved impossible to give the high school a full day even with half the students, so they only get 7 periods instead of 9. 

Until now, we have done very well. It's only been in the case surge in the past few weeks that has seen cases pop up and force temporary closures. The cases have occurred from out of school contact. We can keep schools open safely--but it requires investment and trust. Teachers do not trust politicians to do this. We also need to make school a priority. We cannot yell for schools to be open while also wanting to go to church, bars, and parties, then yell at the unions. 

We cannot dismiss the losses from distance education. In a city like Baltimore, children lack internet access and appropriate supervision. Even when those are available, distance learning does not provide the same quality of education, especially for young learners and special education students."

2020-11-29 2:11,"I'm 67 and teach on an Indian reservation in a very rural area. We have high poverty, homelessness and addiction. Our Elders are raising the young ones, often in crowded homes. We need our schools open and have been since mid August. I feel very safe even though our county of around 11,000 has had nearly 50 COVID-19 related deaths. Sadly, two of my students have lost caregiver-grandparents to the virus, but those exposures happened outside of school. 
About 1/4 of our students have opted for online learning using a school-provided program and laptop.  They can re-enter classrooms at the start of each quarter. 
My largest class is 12 students and I have 7 tables with sneeze guards. Masks are mandatory, and the kids help clean everything with soapy water after each class. 
Keeping schools open definitely requires staff and community cooperation to maintain a safe environment. I haven't been anywhere except the grocery store and I don't mind that. I believe we are doing what is best for our children. 
The bad thing? Our school board refuses to approve a 2% raise on this year's contract!"

2020-11-29 2:08,"I am a teacher in BCPSS and I would be concerned about my own safety and that of my students if we were to be told to return to buildings. However, I am more concerned about the hospital capacity in my area, since the positivity rate in my city seems to be doubling every week, as it is in many parts of the country. Instead of closing bars, restaurants, and gyms we have decided to keep all those open and be upset when teachers object to going back into buildings when we are in the biggest surge of the pandemic. I am confused about the timing of this article, as we are about to enter a period of time when hospitals will be pushed to the brink and the NYTimes is still publishing pieces about how opening public schools in major metro areas is even an option right now. It really isn't. That ship sailed when we decided businesses were more important than schools. All of the surrounding public school districts in MD have stated they won't go forward with any of their opening plans in light of the skyrocketing covid rates. Because that is the responsible thing to do. Sonja Santelesis is doing a performance right now, as she knows that the very few schools she has forced to open will move back to virtual very soon. This is what we can call ""opening schools theatre"". She wants to up her profile as she is on the short list for Biden's Sec of Ed. I am sure Biden's people are noticing this."

2020-11-29 2:24,"As a teacher of students with disabilities who my district has determined are not required to mask or observe distancing guidelines, I will fight going back into the classroom with every opportunity I can. On parent facing videos our superintendent talks all about how EVERYONE is masked and we are following all the guidelines and I just roll my eyes because he has also said “but not these students”. Awesome. Glad that because I chose to teach special education my health doesn’t matter. As a mother of 2 young children (one with asthma) and another on the way I refuse to sacrifice my health or life because parents are so desperate for childcare. This is macro problem that requires macro solutions, and to just bring kids back into a classroom (even with dubious masking) is putting the responsibility of fixing a social problem on the teacher. As usual."
2020-11-29 2:11,"what's with all the hate for teachers?  most are doing the best they can under difficult situations.   quit telling teachers to ""get back to work.""  Teachers teaching remotely ARE working.  Also,  for those making the ""doctor""/essential worker comparison--haven't you noticed that many doctors are providing ""visits"" online whenever possible? of course private schools are better.  who would pay for a private school to be worse?  they have the money, the infrastructure, the small classes and the flexibility to address the pandemic...and many are still not in person but hybrid or remote.   pull yourselves together, people.  we are all on the same side."

2020-11-29 3:37,(None of this apples to essential workers who don’t have a choice but to send their kids to school.) For the majority of parents who have a choice I can t understand the level of parental insanity that thinks that going to school like THAt is better than staying home and getting live distance instruction 5 days a week. Maybe this just continues the long history of parental insanity that says that stranger danger is a bigger risk than cars and pools. Because that looks a whole new level of long trauma.  Me I would rather be doing my class work at home safe than to be in either an unsafe school or plexiglass fear school that might be less unsafe but is also not truly safe and way more traumatic.
2020-11-29 2:51,"I am very worried about our children. I hope we get Covid-19 behind us quickly, or else we might face a generation of anxious, isolated, psychologically damaged and undereducated kids. 

It's like the lead in the water in Flint, MI. We don't know yet how that will effect the brains of the children that were subjected to this neurotoxin. All we know is that the Roman empire collapsed a few years after introducing lead pipes...

It would be interesting to see how past epidemics / pandemics have affected children psychologically, but I believe there is no data available. Well, back then they didn't _have_ Zoom etc., and probably also didn't fuzz so much about children's health as we do today. I was allowed to play in dirt and mud as a child and I'm as healthy as a bull for it today at 55 :-)"

There's no question in my mind that the youngest-K-3 students, special ed students, and low income kids desperately need in person schooling. There's also no question that in person poses public health risks and that most public schools don't have the resources for the necessary personnel, PPE, custodial services . Heartbreaking. Hats off to teachers everywhere who are doing their best under unbelievably tough circumstances. You're heros in my book."
2020-11-29 3:21,"As an educator I am not comfortable with the portrayal of teaching being a holier than thou profession, it’s just a job. In fact I think it creates a barrier at times(not always) at negotiations for salaries and better working conditions and moving forward with getting kids back into the classroom. I don’t think I am any more worthy than the janitor in this article or any nurse, grocery store worker, or anyone who shows up to work to keep things going. I think a bunch of teachers are going to be the escape goats when the budgetary cuts happen during the next fiscal year due income tax revenue loss."

We simply have to stay safe and prevent the unnecessary deaths of others.  The problem we must solve is the cruelty and greed of the Republicans including Trump and their refusal to put money into the hands of Americans.  Instead they have put billions of taxpayer dollars in the pockets of their friends through corrupt practices through the Treasury dept, the SBA, the Fed, and the Cares Act.  The corruption of Trump and his administration is killing us."

The change in his mood and outlook have been obvious. I realize I am privileged to have been able to do this, hopefully temporary, switch. But what has been said elsewhere in the comments: the priority of the German government, even in the latest Lockdown, has been, above all else, to keep schools open. Bars and restaurants are closed. It helps to have a capable leader."
2020-11-29 7:04,"It’s really interesting to read. Here in London UK.  Schools have been open fully since September. Children kindergarten age and teachers do not wear masks in school. The youngest ones do not socially distance either. We have the windows open and enhanced cleaning. Certain toys aren’t in use such as sand and play dough as well as soft toys. We also have extra hand washing and cleaning. We are in a bubble so don’t mix with any other group or other teachers. If anyone tests positive we self isolate for 14 days. . I don’t see how you can teach phonics with a mask on,  children need to see the teacher’s  mouth move. Online learning doesn’t work for most primary age children. Plus the disadvantage just get further behind."

Those between the ages of 12 - 18 are the most likely to be asymptomatic. We now know the virus is airborne and can linger for hours. Everyday I conduct class I am putting my life on the line. My mother is 85 and has multiple underlying conditions. It may be months before I will be able to be in the same room with her again. 

All this while it’s too dangerous for the state agency that deals with public education too even be back in their building. In fact, no state agencies are back in their buildings because it is too dangerous because of the virus!

Teaching remotely is incredibly difficult. It takes hours and hours to take a successful in person lesson and convert it to an online lesson. And, it’s never as good. 

I care deeply about my students but am angry I could get this virus and die while the decision makers meet via zoom."
2020-11-29 10:25,"I’m a speech-language pathologist who worked for 20 years in the school system. I  loved my job. 

We went to remote teaching in March and my already substantial workload tripled over night. 12-16 hour days sitting in front of a computer screen at home, trying to learn new technology I had no experience with, searching for (and paying out-of-pocket for) appropriate digital materials, dealing with constant computer glitches, all while simultaneously trying to meet every child’s IEP minutes. In May, I had a nervous breakdown and quit- one month before the end of the school year.

The whole situation was traumatizing. But it has turned out to be the best decision I ever made. I feel sorry for my former colleagues who don’t have that option. 

FTR- The school district still hasn’t been able to fill my position."
2020-11-29 10:55,"In my school district we aren’t permitted to open the windows (safety issue).  The classroom doors can only be opened for a few minutes each hour when classes change. The student bathrooms have no hot water (burn risk) and the cold water only runs for a few seconds so the kids can’t leave the water running.  Student desks are about 5 feet  apart, but in the hallways the kids high-five, hold hands, and huddle head to head around cell phones. Classrooms are not cleaned until the end of the day and mask compliance is poor, with noses constantly exposed.  When they sneeze they pull their masks down and spray droplets all over. The enhanced cleaning that parents were promised is nothing more than a disinfectant spray of the classrooms at the end of the day.  With poor ventilation, inadequate mask compliance and effective hand washing impossible, this is not a safe work environment.  My high school age daughter has not been back to school and is doing distance learning, but I am risking my life to keep a job that provides our health insurance.  Crazy situation. The stress is overwhelming."

It's is the sine qua non, i.e., the indispensable & essential  condition for students sharing a classroom/hallway/school bus/etc.   It was originally a Latin legal term for ""[a condition] without which it could not be"", or ""but for..."" or ""without which [there is] nothing""."

This too shall pass people. Enjoy the time with your kids. No one else in our modern history or future will get this opportunity again."
2020-11-29 5:43,"You know, with a strategic mix of hard borders, contact tracing, quarantining, necessity support, shared knowledge of effective therapies, education, and someone/anyone taking leadership, this whole prolonged period of adaptations, sicknesses, disabilities and death could have been avoided many months ago. Basic rationality. But that would have been too Draconian for us Live Free or Die Americans to bear. It could still end this pandemic a lot sooner than when the vaccines are effectively provided sometime in 2021. But who trusts anyone? Look at those island nations like Taiwan and authoritarian nations like China who are well past many of the negative effects of this pandemic. In any case, what’s been done to head off the next pandemic. We humans depend upon, “Necessity is the mother of invention.” and panic and temporary chaos for our disaster recovery plans."
2020-11-29 4:28,"Look at the picture.  At least she has the plastic mask and a barrier because she also has that cloth mask below her nose, a common occurrence in most elementary schools with no face shields or plastic dividers and with desks crowded in.  We all know kids sneeze and sneeze far.  Yes, having all that protection seems a lot, but is it too much to be safer?   Think of the kids in the Middle East who have been living with war and terror and kids in Africa with war and famine...right now.  Sure it  is hard and wearing masks and having plastic barriers are a pain but wouldn't you rather be safer?"
2020-11-29 14:27,"Believe it or not, this is not a black and white issue. It may be that after the pandemic ends we enable more flexible schedules especially for older students and families that need this. Yes, schools socialize students and provide routines, safety, food, and childcare. But many, perhaps most of the hours in the day, are spent on activities that have nothing to do with academic learning. Look at the classroom schedule in this article! What if all learning wasn't building-based? What if teachers were not primarily paid to be child-minders? What if our health care wasn't tied to our jobs? What if we paid people decent salaries and they didn't need to rely on public schools to feed their children? As a teacher, thus far, I have been able to teach remotely, and I am very grateful to my colleagues who are teaching hybrid. In some ways it is more work at home. I spend a lot more time planning Slide-decks and materials, teaching, learning and using ed tech, helping families and students, and have a caseload twice as large as my elementary school colleagues or my prior caseload in school. But, there's a much better chance I won't pass the disease on to my very frail husband. And not having to commute is a real privilege. I appreciate having a choice, and that my district has been able to offer families the choice that best serves their families."

Absolutely dedicated mask wearing by every single person in this country any time they step outside their front door.

But instead, the rest of us must jump through narrowing hoops to coddle the naysayers who are entirely to blame.

Caught outside without adequate masking? You get ID'ed and lose your license for a week and get placed on a healthcare list of people who get no Covid treatment if they become ill.

To my disgust, this pandemic has literally unmasked the depth and breadth of this country's stupidity and arrogance, and our unwillingness to assign penalities. 

Now I truly understand America. And will never renew my misplaced love affair."

2020-11-26 13:15,"It seems like common sense has gone out the window. I know someone who sings in a church choir in New York, who early on in the pandemic became quite ill with COVID-19. Obviously the combination of congregating, singing and being in an enclosed setting is considered a super spreader."
2020-11-26 13:17,What kind of court releases a decision in the dark of night? One that is openly embarrassed to be reversing itself in the same year by a 5-4 margin.  This isn’t so much a court as a political religious commission.  Comparisons between church gatherings and going into a liquor store or pet shop are absurd. Same goes for comparisons between an hour long mass and a hurried twenty minute trip to the supermarket.  The Court is doing harm to it’s already poor image.  It won’t allow elected leaders to protect Americans from guns or now from a public health crisis.  Perhaps states and localities should disregard its rulings because they diverge too much from reality.
2020-11-26 13:18,"As a physician this decision is at a minimum reprehensible and on the extreme the majority is an accessory to involuntary manslaughter. Not only are the attendees at a packed church or synagogue at increased risk of contracting COVID but so are their families and members of their community.

To compare a packed house of worship with congregants singing for an hour or more to a bodega or pet store is ludicrous."
2020-11-26 13:17,"What a perfect ruling for Thanksgiving.  Our ancestors came here in search of religious freedom. And our Founding Fathers enshrined those rights in the Constitution. Petty, modern-day King Georges, aka Andrew Cuomo, need to know the limits of their egotistic tyranny."
2020-11-26 13:15,"Indeed, Justice Amy Coney Barrett played a decisive role. It will likely result in the death penalty for some irresponsible individuals and a number of those to whom they serve as a link in spreading the coronavirus."
2020-11-26 13:16,What kind of liquor store does Justice Gorsuch go to? Do people congregate in large numbers there for hours at a time? This comparison is absurd from a viral transmission perspective.
2020-11-26 13:18,So...wow...Here in Europe we shake our heads at the insanity of the United States.  Religious extremism comes in all flavours.  This is one of them.  So it is up to the local churches to show some sense and restrict numbers and make parishioners keep socially distant?  Good luck with that.
2020-11-26 13:19,We all need spiritual support in this very difficult time.  Does this mean places of worship should welcome persons with contagious diseases?
2020-11-26 13:22,"Gorsuch's argument that 'Constitution tolerates color-coded executive edicts that reopen liquor stores and bike shops but shutter churches'. But the argument is specious - its not 'churches are as valuable as liquor stores', its the numerical limit. As long as the liquor store has a numerical limit then they are being treated the same, even though its clear to me as a public health doctor that churches are  higher risk locations. They are generally an older population (with more susceptibility), with singing (proven airborne spread) and much more likely to have physical contact with greetings. I wont see 10 people at a time in my local bike store, let alone 10 people who would like to hug or shake hands.  
With the quality of argument from Gorsuch, and where 4 judges set themselves as competent in public health matters, deservedly points to the end of the Supreme Court as we know it."
2020-11-26 13:24,"The Supreme Court is putting itself into a strange position.  It has now chosen to prejudge the propriety of New York pandemic rules in the middle of the pandemic. They have enjoined the New York rules before the matter is fully argued.  The result calls to mind words from a famous dissent by Justice Robert Jackson, ""There is danger that, if the Court does not temper its doctrinaire logic with a little practical wisdom, it will convert the constitutional Bill of Rights into a suicide pact."""
2020-11-26 13:22,"Church members can easily nullify the Supreme Court decision by using their judgment and staying at home instead of going to church.  The diocese may have won in court, but parishioners can decide for themselves.

Let individuals decide what is best for them."
2020-11-26 13:23,"Rather than “blaming” the vote on Justice Barrett, why not blame it on the other four justices as well.  She is not the only justice who voted for it.  But that of course would not have sensationalized the news.  The decision does not force people to attend church services.  It only permits them to do so.  The decision will be left up to each congregation and I have little doubt that reason and common sense will rule."
2020-11-26 13:21,"This is absolutely right. While I am not personally religious, I do believe in being consistent. When crowds are allowed to gather for demonstrations , protests and celebrations, they should also be allowed for religious services."
2020-11-26 13:22,"And so it is as predicted.  Judge Barrett has weighed in  on the side of  the self-righteous ""Moral Minority"".  People shouldn't wonder why organized religion is losing appeal.  My right to a healthy world should not be impinged on by a small group who all want to go a central place and show that they're wearing the same jersey as all their fellow congregants.  I am not against those wanting to practice their faith.  There have been numerous instances in history where people avowed their faith in smaller groups out of necessity- Moses in the desert, Christians in Rome, and others.  Don't say it can't be done, and don't say we are discriminating against you.  But the science today says we should be smart about it.  
Is that the message that Catholicism and Judaism want to convey- ""our faith makes us smarter than science, and only God will deliver us from the COVID?"""
2020-11-26 13:23,"Will the Court mandate the increase in hospital beds to handle the spike in COVID cases?  Ask God to create more doctors, nurses and other hospital workers to relieve the exhausted ones?  It’s all very nice to say you’re protecting freedom of religion but it won’t address the problems. And people don’t sit in a liquor store and sing for over an hour. Let’s see how many more deaths result from this short-sighted move."
2020-11-26 13:23,This is not about the First Amendment. it's about the religious views of five justices.  And so begins the Court that will put religion over public health.
2020-11-26 13:21,"That is a terrible analogy, people do not congregate in liquor stores and bike shops.  As a religious follower and a new law maker, your first decision will cost lives.  Bad choice."

2020-11-26 13:16,Well this is really quite clear. The impact of Ms Barrett will be quite measurable. She will reap what she has sown.
2020-11-26 13:16,Tragic for us all for the Court’s majority to “rule” in a fashion that virtually guarantees more people will sicken and die including health care workers who decide to go to church .
2020-11-26 13:24,"From my perspective as a physician this strikes me as one of the most dangerously wrong decisions that I know of in the history of the Supreme Court. Permitting religious services with unlimited numbers of people, which have been shown to be the source of superspreader events, is dangerous not just to the people who attend them but to the population at large."
2020-11-26 13:23,"If the decision becomes final the five justices should be held morally responsible for any serious injuries or deaths that come out of it.

Cuomo did not ban religious services, he just limited attendance like with any other group store including liquor stores.

Any religious org. that becomes a super spreader as a result of this decision should be held liable in Civil Count for damages, just like with the child abuse cases going on now.

If people value their health, they should stay clear of any person that goes to one of these super spreader events and if by accident come down with Covid and can be proven within a reasonable doubt a super spreader event was the cause they should sue. 

This is not religious freedom. It is giving special treatment to religious groups."
2020-11-26 13:24,"Is anyone surprised that we will see a wave of legislation siding in favor of religions groups. But I don't care, let them go to church, temple or wherever, get the virus and spread it to others and possibly die. If they feel the need to be closer to god this way. So be it. I don't care what people choose to do or not do any more. I know what I need to do keep my family safe and help others."
2020-11-26 13:24,"So the Supreme Court just ruled against the constitution it supposed to interpret? No where in the constitution does it mention god and protection of organized religions. As a courtesy, organized religions don’t pay taxes, but it’s congregates and leaders are still required to follow all state and federal laws. Did the Supreme Court just elevate organized religion above state power to protect its citizens?"
2020-11-26 13:17,"Simply solution would be to pass a law making churches liable for the costs of covid treatments.    

With decisions comes consequences."
2020-11-26 13:22,"So does this mean that the five justices who think it's a good idea to congregate in a church during a pandemic will be in attendance on a regular basis?  Hope so, otherwise their ruling must be interpreted as ultra-hypocritical, as well as deadly."
2020-11-26 13:21,The current majority of the Supreme Court thinks America is a theocracy. It is not. Religious liberty is not a license to spread a deadly disease.
2020-11-26 13:25,"Well there is scientific medical opinion and there is mystical belief, in conflict.  Where have we heard that before?  And, as in all the other such conflicts, the religious congregants will suffer.  For example the Church of England opposed anesthesia into the 20th century because pain was considered to be divine punishment for sin. This time it will be sickness and death because the services must be attended."
2020-11-26 13:25,"I just don't understand the need to have churches and synagogues open during a Pandemic! I just go to my local medical marijuana dispensary, then off to a liquor store, make a pitstop at a government office building, stand in a crowded line for a COVID-19 test and make a day of it. Then I drink myself to sleep and glorify in my complete lack of a need for anything spiritual in my life. Religion? Totally unnecessary to ""modern"" man."

2020-11-26 13:27,"I'm sorry this case was taken up by the Supreme Court.  The state of New York should have been given the chance to come to some accommodation with the religious groups.  The state rule could have been refined to allow larger gatherings that are still safe (for example, basing the number of congregants on some fraction of the occupancy capacity of the indoor space).  This seems like the Supreme Court is micromanaging the response to the pandemic.  Given the amount of uncertainty we are dealing with, the Supreme Court should let public health officials try to do their jobs."
2020-11-26 13:28,"Interesting reading this article and then reading the opinion piece penned by Pope Francis.  There seems to be a disconnect between the Roman Catholic Diocese of New York and the Pope.  

The dichotomy is striking.

If the Church would like to be taken seriously it should refine its message and speak with one voice. A voice that protects its parishioners as well as all people."
2020-11-26 13:28,"Rambling thoughts:  We see the future of Supreme Court rulings, but this seems to be an emotional rather than logical decision.   No freedom on religion has been imposed. People are allowed to worship, just in smaller numbers. Yes, some of the venues could hold 1,000 people, but equivalently things like concerts are not happening. How much of this is really about money, and how much religious institutions are currently losing?  How is this different than other capacity (for safety) rules?  
The restrictions limiting the amount of people are about public health and safety.  How is it that one's right to religion supercedes another's right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?  Americans are so big on ""my rights"" that they forget about ""our rights"" and ""our"" greater good.  It's time many people looked beyond the tip of their own nose and recognize they are part of a greater whole whether they like it or not."
2020-11-26 13:27,"Religious organizations do not pay property tax, income tax, sales tax, etc. They are effectively supported by we the people. If we are effectively funding their operation, we should have a say in what they do. By being open, they are allowing the virus to spread, thus they are putting us at significant risk. We should be able to shut them down until the risk from this deadly pandemic has been mitigated through vaccination or other public health measures."
2020-11-26 13:26,"Even applying strict scrutiny, isn’t public health during the coronavirus pandemic the most important thing? Those massive gatherings are putting my health, and the health of my loved ones, at risk.

I was always taught that God can hear your prayers anywhere you are so going to church may be a pleasant social experience it's not a requirement. Early Christians met in caves. I do realize that if you don't attend church you are not putting money in the collection box, so I hope the religious groups that are fighting to have parishioners attend churches in person are not more concerned about the cash flow instead of the safety of their parishioners and what happens in regards to weddings and funerals for large numbers of attendees if they claim the grounds for these gatherings are for religious purposes?"

When we are talking about infectious diseases there are implications for others, and they do not have the right to harm the rest of us.  

This is the third novel coronavirus since 2003, and scientists believe there are over 5000 more novel coronaviruses in bats, so there will be more pandemics, and some of them are likely to be more deadly than the current COVID-19 pandemic.  This sets a terrible precedent for the next pandemic.

Trump, McConnell and Senate Republicans’ pandering for votes have created an unelected House of Lords branch of US government, similar to the UK.

They act like children, but want to be treated like adults.  Enough. 

If they want to hold services during a pandemic, they must agree not to seek medical treatment if their meetings cause the inevitable spread in cases.  People acting responsibly, who nevertheless get COVID through no fault of their own, will die because of these selfish zealots. They shouldn't get to purposefully worsen a pandemic and then get to gum up the treatment works for everyone else. Instead, they can leave it in their god's hands as to whether they live or die from their selfish actions.

This version of the Supreme Court is the result of an illegal conspiracy to gain power and control of the country by currying religious support that erodes the constitution by undermining the separation of church and state,￼. It is part of a pattern of willfully committing acts against the constitution, willfully promoting oligarchy and subverting democracy, and so much more. I hope that all these acts, taken as a conspiracy against the republic will be the legal platform for roll backs of heinous appointments to the Supreme Court where the rule of law was not the prime consideration for an appointment, or where no fair, legitimately vetted appointment was made because the process was subverted by this same cabal of conspirators, as part and parcel of their attempt to gain power and wealth at the expense of.... everyone and every institution that could be corrupted to their purpose."
2020-11-26 13:36,"If we want to maintain the ""separation of church and state"" it is critical that governments not treat religious institutions differently from other entities.

Rules that limit occupancy of a church should be viewed in the same light as those that limit the number of people in a bar or restaurant. According to public health officials - those people whose business it is to know what constitutes a threat to public health - all evidence shows large gatherings indoors are conducive to the spread of the virus, so it is reasonable to have limitations put in place that protect the health of the public.

Religious belief is being privileged here by the majority on the court, and that bodes ill for the rest of us."
2020-11-26 13:37,"While the new court has imposed itself on a public health issue better left to others more capable of making scientifically informed decisions, it seems that the logic of the decision may be sidestepped by simply limiting the size of gatherings, period.

2020-11-26 13:37,"Apparently the Supreme Court has problems with Public Health. 
 
In the past, the government has instituted rules and had an actual RESPONSIBILITY to provide for and maintain an environment where we all have the ""freedom"" to go about our lives and assume that we will be able to maintain our health.  By overriding the decision to restrict religious services during a pandemic, the Supreme court is saying that the government isn't allowed to protect our health.  
The problem is, a lot of people still look to the government for direction, under the assumption that smart people who had studied the problem were trying to protect their health and welfare.  I guess this is no longer the case.  It is truly becoming every man for himself out there.  Watch out!"

I am no fan of religion. The Abrahamic religions, in particular, come up short compared to more sophisticated mythologies, such as the Greeks of antiquity, that reflect a deeper understanding of the human psyche and are not as prone to absurd binary judgments. I wish we were more like Europe in separating the cultural traditions of religion from the ludicrous dogma.

But we are not close to being there. We have proven to be the least civilized Western nation and our recent national election proves we are likely to remain so.

Thus, this recent SCOTUS decision is hardly surprising. Empires in decline always go to ground."
2020-11-26 13:40,"OK Governor Cuomo. Put the good lawyers on it and replace the restrictions with some that better fit the constitution. Don’t forget - you’re up against a. Supreme Court with justice barrett and she attended trump’s superspreader event at the White House. Nothing comes before her personal beliefs, which she has stated many times and include her devotion to the almighty.

A person in the United States can freely and openly pray anywhere anytime or choose not to. One can pray at home, in the woods, at the beach, or on the sidewalk in a city. But wearing a mask and social distancing should be required to slow and hopefully stop the spread of COVID-19. I don’t think she’s interested in that. 

Is the almighty ultimately responsible for the coronavirus? And did the almighty guide the scientists who are developing vaccines and treatment? Then one might say the almighty guided Andrew Cuomo to take steps, even if they were imperfect, to slow the spread. We should respect that."
2020-11-26 13:38,"Some of these justices approved Trump's bigoted anti-Muslim immigration orders because he gave them just enough of an anti-discriminatory veneer. Let Cuomo rewrite his regulations to treat all gatherings in affected zones equally, and then we'll see what this court really values or doesn't."
2020-11-26 13:37,"In the midst of a once in a century health crisis, these supposedly highly educated, brilliant analytical minds cannot distinguish between going into a liquor store for five minutes to buy a bottle, versus sitting in a church or synagogue for an hour plus, surrounded by others breathing, singing, and probably coughing in the immediate vicinity. So much for Barrett's phony contention that the judiciary should never substitute its judgment for other branches of government."
2020-11-26 13:41,"This isn’t so much about religious freedom as it is about tithing. If there aren’t bodies in those pews, the collection plates remain empty. There is no doubt that religious organizations have seen a decrease in donations since attendance became restricted due to the pandemic. Few people will go out of their way to mail in their donations directly to their churches. Therefore attendance is imperative."
2020-11-26 13:49,"Like it or not the law seems to have been written to target religious worship - read it before adding your name to the list of people claiming that houses of worship are treated no differently. 

The law specifically says that regardless of capacity, limits of ten or twenty five are being instituted only on houses of worship . That means that a big department store with a capacity in the hundreds will be allowed to basically operate normally allowing many  customers inside , whereas a mega-church that seats 1000 can only have ten. 

When you add the fact that anyone who’s been around shopping in New York recently can tell you that many places of business are for all intents and purposes carrying on normally - I’ve been in plenty of crowded supermarkets and Home Depot’s as far back as May  - essentially allowing the customers to make their own choices as to what is risky. The distinction between houses of worship becomes starkly visible- this law essentially stops public worship (the limits make any church or synagogue with a large congregation basically useless) even when there are certainly ways to carry on safely. 

So to shop for my groceries (or yes, my liquor) i have the freedom to decide wether I would like to enter a store with fifty shoppers and spend an hour or so there, but I do not have the right to decide whether to sit in the pews six feet away from anyone else for an hour or two. 

Like it or not - the court got this right."
2020-11-26 13:50,"I'm on the fence on this case. But, considering that religious administrations demand to interfere with government and secular life, does it follow that they are exempt from social and legal constraints that affect the rest of the country? I don't think so. Religion demands more rights than citizens and business receive without any accountability or tax contribution. If people want freedom of religion, the other side of that coin is everyone deserves freedom from religion."
2020-11-26 13:44,"Really got to hand it to Majority Leader McConnell for tying down the Supreme Court for a generation. He really knows how to run a minority government. SCOTUS no longer reflects in any way, shape or form, the opinion of the vast majority of Americans - just the way Mitch likes it. From here on out, SCOTUS will be the biggest obstacle preventing government officials from addressing any of the great problems of our times. Yes, Biden won the election but the larger game has already been lost."
2020-11-26 13:45,"From the article:

""... Chief Justice Roberts wrote...'government officials should not ""be subject to second-guessing by an unelected federal judiciary, which lacks the background, competence, and expertise to assess public health and is not accountable to the people."" ""

In other words.... his co-Supreme Court Justices.

Get used to that quote. Memorize it.
This Supreme Court does not reflect the American populace, not on anything any more.

Thank you, Justice Roberts, for saying it out right.
I shall quote this often in the next 3 or 4 decades."
2020-11-26 13:49,"From my understanding, the zones limited the capacity of churches. Max of 10 in red (though to be honest, it works make more sense if the rule was a percentage of max capacity). Nevertheless, if secular indoor activities also have similar restrictions then I don't see any unequal treatment.

In a similar manner, government  impose health codes for kitchens in churches and one cannot claim that government is forcing church members to wash hands after using the bathroom, if their religion forbids it."
2020-11-26 13:48,"Unfortunately the difference between philosophical decisions and real time, on the ground decisions, are stark.  The 5 that backed the Religious Challenge should visit the overwhelmed hospitals and talk to the doctors and nurses who are taking care of the dying patients.  The 5 should also speak to those patients, who can actually speak with tubes down their throats, so that the 5 can tell these patients why they voted to allow severely spiking communities, that gather thousands for affairs and services, to continue.  If only the 5 could limit the ill to just those communities and not the surrounding neighborhoods who suffer the upticks in sick and dead.  Better yet let the 5 treat the patients who have gotten ill because of their ruling rather than my daughter who is treating them as a trained ICU nurse."
2020-11-26 13:41,"So according to Alito, ""“Whenever fundamental rights are restricted, the Supreme Court and other courts cannot close their eyes.”

2020-11-26 13:42,"As usual the corporate media favors getting people upset rather than informing them.  There is a lot more money for them in putting heat on the division than in giving an actual clear description of what happened.  Presumably this ruling had an element of not treating comparable secular activities different from religious activities.  The question is what you define as comparable.  There must have been a lot more details about that, but you cheated the readers out of that information - in order to get their adrenaline going so you can make more money."
2020-11-26 13:50,"If this decision revolves around adjusting the gathering restrictions to create seeming fairness to various institutions based on what is known about how the virus spreads, it has some merit.  If it is about deference to religion, it is both nonsensical and dangerous.  We cannot be certain of any gods but we are certain that Covid-19 is a threat to personal and public health."
2020-11-26 13:46,Many members of SCOTUS are religiously devout. And they want all of us in the USA to be the same. They are against limiting religious institutions in any way for the purpose of controlling a pandemic and saving lives. I and many millions of Americans are still euphoric about Biden's victory and his humiliating defeat of Trump. But Trump damaged our lives in ways that will not be fully evident for decades to come. The Supreme Court will rule on many issues with the same 5 v. 4 margin.

2020-11-26 13:46,"So, Amy Comey Barrett made her first important decision, and she’s made a costly human error. I could understand if people couldn’t exercise their religious rights at home, but they can. Gathering into an enclosed space during a pandemic makes absolutely no sense. This is how my sister contracted Covid￼, along with a good friend of hers. My sister is on the mend but her friend unfortunately is not doing well. I don’t think it’s too much to ask people to pray at home in order to keep the larger population safe￼. Sadly, this will separate those who can make an informed decision on their own - taking into consideration the health of all those around them￼, from those who need to have the decision made for them because they’re too lazy to think it through to its logical conclusion."
2020-11-26 13:51,"The counter arguments used by the churches as why they should remain open are silly at best, dangerous at worst. Alcohol stores are open in order to placate the masses. While there isn't a need for them to be open, imagine the uproar if they were closed and people couldn't get their beer or wine. 

At first pet stores might seem silly to remain open. After all whom needs a new pet or a squeaky toy for their dog right now. However, they do carry many brands of food for animals that the major stores don't carry. Pet stores are an excellent fit between big-box stores and veterinarians whom typically supply specialized foods.

The third example given was bicycle shops. Many people have decided to change from public transportation over to bicycling. These stores have become an essential part of infrastructure as people need to try a bike before purchasing and also go there for servicing their bikes. It is not something that can be done virtually.

All three of these stores don't involve people going to their premises and gathering for an hour or so at the same time. There are alternatives to their business models that could lower the risk of COVID spread. For example, in the case of the first two, online ordering with curb side pickup or delivery. For bicycle stores, using appointments to limit the number of customers.

There was never any threat to the practice of religion. Practitioners weren't allowed to gather. Alternative forms of delivery would be allowed."
2020-11-26 13:52,"The conservatives in this country just cannot help themselves. Even the Supreme court cannot rise above politics and do the sensible thing. Simply put, public health should trump (no pun intended) congregating in a church or synagogue. Restricting the number of individuals in these settings has nothing to do with the Constitution or religious freedom. Everyone can still exercise their right to religious freedom, from the safety of their homes!"
2020-11-26 13:53,"In response to this irresponsible decision, I give you Pope France's observations in an NYT opinion piece today: 

""With some exceptions, governments have made great efforts to put the well-being of their people first, acting decisively to protect health and to save lives. The exceptions have been some governments that shrugged off the painful evidence of mounting deaths, with inevitable, grievous consequences. But most governments acted responsibly, imposing strict measures to contain the outbreak.

Yet some groups protested, refusing to keep their distance, marching against travel restrictions — as if measures that governments must impose for the good of their people constitute some kind of political assault on autonomy or personal freedom! Looking to the common good is much more than the sum of what is good for individuals. It means having a regard for all citizens and seeking to respond effectively to the needs of the least fortunate.

It is all too easy for some to take an idea — in this case, for example, personal freedom — and turn it into an ideology, creating a prism through which they judge everything.""

Justice Barrett, given your personal religious leanings, you just made a mistake. So says Pope Frances."
2020-11-26 13:45,"The fear was that she would ignore the law, precedents, and reason in favor of her personal beliefs. Here it is. American theocracy advances."

2020-11-26 13:45,"Once again this court gives religion a superior position over the public good.  This is a terrible decision that deprives the government of essential tools to protect public safety. 

1.  Data shows that religious services are a significant contributor to the spread of the virus 
2. These restrictions are temporary and tied to the presence of severe virus prevalence 
3. There is a big difference between the brief time people are in a liquor store any hours of taliking and singing shoulder to shoulder in religious services 

This also creates a huge loophole. Restrictions on weddings or funerals with any religious content are out. You can just start a convention with a prayer even though it has a thousand people and you are home free"
2020-11-26 13:44,"I can't help but see the tragic irony of this. In 1995 Pope John Paul II wrote the encyclical, ""Evangelium vitae,"" where he decries the ""culture of death"" sweeping the world. He was focused on things like abortion, capital punishment, euthanasia, etc.

Who would have thought that decades later it would be the religious of the world who would be exhibiting so much tolerance for unnecessary risk and death by defying common sense protections against a deadly virus for which we have no defense.

Who would have imagined how the encyclical words can be applied to today:

""In our present social context, marked by a dramatic struggle between the 'culture of life' and the 'culture of death', there is need to develop a deep critical sense, capable of discerning true values and authentic needs."""
2020-11-26 13:41,"As with courts ruling against mask restrictions, ruling against limiting gatherings confers on the successful challengers the right to die and the right to kill. That religious groups are aggressively seeking such rights is unimaginable. Yet they are."

2020-11-26 13:41,"With the proportion of Americans that do not identify with ANY religion now over 25% according to Pew research in 2019, it seems like the churches that are willing to put their congregants at risk would be more effective at spreading COVID than the word of God."
2020-11-26 13:42,"I gave up on religion several years ago because of all the inconsistencies, bad behavior of priests & other preachers who claim to be different but offer the same thing.  I decided to explore the innermost deepest thoughts of my mind alone & I figure I surely don't need to be clouded by some self proclaimed servant of God telling me I need to go to church during a pandemic and risk my life for God because God would do it for me.  Americans act like they can't suffer a little bit and not go to church.  They can't stand staying home so they complain about eating out, going to the gym, and now going to church.  Allow these people to have their space.  If they choose to risk their lives, let them."

2020-11-26 13:45,"If the health and safety of population isn't first in the Supreme Court's rulings, then why even have them.

Religion has been around for over six thousand years, this virus has only been around 1 year and hopefully will be gone in 6 months to a year, then we can get back to having large groups again.

Long before the Constitution talks about freedom of religion it talks about promoting the general welfare, these justices need to go back to school."
2020-11-26 13:38,"And so it starts. ACB shows us right away what path she'll be taking. Forget common sense, forget the common good, forget the fact that the virus doesn't care where you are packed in as long as you're packed in. If you need to pray, or worship, there is nothing stopping anyone from doing it privately, but if you think it only works in the petri dish of crowded churches and synagogues you are not helping your fellow man, just the virus."

Good to see however, justice Robert’s recent tilt towards balance and away from the activism and originalist justices.

2020-11-26 13:56,"I feel like I’m getting a glimpse into what it was like in an earlier time when organized religion was openly anti-science. I’m wondering if the justices even bothered to consult scientists in this case.  I am religious, but it would never occur to me to feel like a martyr because people were allowed to go into the store for 5 minutes to get pet food, but not allowed to gather in large groups for an extended period of time in a church or synagogue. A lot of emotional grandstanding for religion in my opinion. And at a tragic cost.  Nobody is  telling people of religion to not practice their faith. Just not in large groups. Saying this is “taking away their rights” is laughable. But I’m not laughing.  These are Supreme Court justices, supposedly the best minds we have."

""There is no world""? That scalding, self-satisfied, intellectually dishonest, insulting Scalia-ist rhetoric is infuriating. Adding insulting rhetoric only serves to highlight the weakness of the argument. It always has and it always will. If you're making sense you don't need to be insulting. The obvious fact is there was such a world, and we were all living it. It existed right up to a month ago, before Coney Barrett arrived. 

So now, at this very moment, as the country is about to suffer daily deaths at a previously unheard of rate, and the healthcare infrastructure is about to collapse, we get this. 

The orders were Constitutionally fine. All religions were being treated equally - churches, mosques, synagogues alike - in the interest of pubic health. People in large parts of the world have spent thousands of years butchering innocents in the name of religion. When the free exercise of religion extends to causing innocent bystanders to die we've entered a dark, dark theocracy."
2020-11-26 13:56,"As has been proven throughout the pandemic, and is evident now during the Thanksgiving holiday, millions of people are making decisions that endanger themselves and others. They foolishly go to bars, houses of worship, and travel, against the advice of health professionals, infecting family, friends and strangers, and spreading the coronavirus throughout the country. That’s why we need government to make sensible decisions based on reason and science, not religious beliefs - for the health and safety of the public. People will be able to return to churches and synagogues when the pandemic is over or under control. It’s so much better to attend a service when you can sit in a pew, instead of lying in a casket. 

This is why we need separation of Church and State. Allowing unelected religious conservatives like Alito and Coney Barrett to overrule elected leaders like Gov. Cuomo makes us no better than Iran or Saudi Arabia.

Welcome to the Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett. I wonder how many people will die because of your unwise decision. Are you really doing God’s work?"

2020-11-26 13:52,"Excellent news. Can't believe it took so long for judges to throw out ridiculous, unconstitutional and discriminatory executive orders like this one. Next up, Governor Cuomo's pathetic attempt to ban gatherings of over 10 people in private homes. Pandemic or no pandemic, the rights of the people shall not be infringed. Governments can issue recommendations, they cannot order unconstitutional restrictions."
2020-11-26 13:43,"Oh boy!  Here we go.  Perhaps the court's decision should have been that churches, synagogues and mosques are free to be jammed to the gills for services, but that each individual in attendance must them quarantine for 14 days.  Or does the court also believe that people who attend religious services in a pandemic, with record high numbers of infections, have a ""right"" to then go about their lives infecting others?  Our local church hold Sun. Mass in the parking lot, with people staying in their cars for the service.  Services in many places are live streamed so that people can still exercise their rights, while at the same time protecting themselves and the rest of us.  Justice Amy Coney Barrett owes us an explanation ."

Yes, allowing a shop that sells booze or bicycles seems on the face to be unfair if Churches are closed. 

But as many have pointed out it is about places where people congregate and sign indoors that is the issue.

There is no Right in the Constitution to Murder by Proxy.

Allowing people to congregate in large groups in any way during a pandemic is in fact Murder by Proxy.

Instead of five actual judges we see that we have five Jim Jones's.

This is just another brick in the foundation that will become at some point in the next 50 years the Second Great American Civil War."

2020-11-26 14:00,"How noble that activist republican justices are defending religious freedom. Too bad it is at the expense of public health, but something had to give. The right to infect your community while others sacrifice so much of their lives by staying home and remaining separated from family must be protected at all costs, else as a nation we are lost. And Gorsuch is of course right to think that bike shops, which help people avoid public transit, are a threat as well - it is all that congregating and singing while they shop that bike riders are known for that threatens us all."

Expanding the court is not a political tactic. It is a necessity."
2020-11-26 14:00,"Churches host a congregation of people, a gathering. Liquor stores and bike shops sell goods and services.

The church/temple attendees will now clog up all the hospitals and no one will be able to get the very best care no matter how had the doctors try, because they will be so overwhelmed.

Freedom to practice a religion was a major historical issue when the Constitution was written— the situation impacted the creation of the document. The “religious” folks who are more concerned with their “right” to practice their religion by congregating with others might consider the Biblical message about being one’s brothers’ keeper. No one can take away what’s in another’s heart, but one can take away another’s health or even life by spreading this virus."

However, who is financially responsible to pick up the tab when lemmings knowingly expose themselves to the Covid-19 virus?  Are the health insurance companies responsible to pay for such irresponsible behavior?  Are the taxpayers?  The cult-like pressure the religious feel to attend a super spreader service puts them at higher risk since part of being religious is submitting to the collective will of their organization.   Would parishioners now be permitted to sue the Churches if they are infected since they were lured into them by such forces and the Supreme Court abandoned them?"

Last time I checked neither bike shops nor liquor stores have capacity for hundreds of people from disparate households in close proximity praying and singing aloud.  What specious arguments and non sensical reasoning - are we supposed to take that argument seriously - its lack of common sense is an embarrassment. Is this what we can expect from the cabal of religious conservatives on the Court?
2020-11-26 13:37,"For thousands of years, untold numbers of people have died in the name of religion and now we are continuing that tradition, albeit in a different manner. The Inquisition, Crusades, Salem Witch Trials, and now the Pandemic Religious Freedom Act. Schools are closed, yet the Orthodox in Brooklyn still need to have weddings with hundreds of people not wearing masks. This is the idiocy of today. Can't wait to see what the Supreme Court makes of upcoming environmental cases."
2020-11-26 13:39,"Well, that didn't take long for the new Inquisition Court to show it's colors.  I always thought (erroneously, it would seem) that the constitution did not grant special privilege to any religious institutions.  So why are churches deemed any more (or less) special than a bowling alley or movie theater or mall?
  I hope you're all ready for the red robes and bonnets!"
2020-11-26 13:54,"Last time I checked, you couldn’t get a large congregation in either a liquor store or a bike shop - whereas large gatherings of people in an enclosed house of worship is ripe for COVID transmission.
I’m not opposed to anyone worshiping as they wish, perhaps they should put themselves in bubbles, like the NBA did so they don’t infect anyone else.
As for the latest SC justice? She did exactly as she was expected to do - no real surprise there just another disgusting example of Trump’s legacy that will be a stain after he is gone."
2020-11-26 14:01,"Of course there was a reasonable basis for distinguishing concentration of individuals in business establishments and places of worship. A few people,enter a “liquor store or bike shop”, they must wear a mask (here in NY) and remain for a limited time with for a limited purpose. Religious congregants remain in a fixed location,for an extended period. Although attendance at  services among all religions has dimished, and certainly many individuals who usually attend services are staying home during the pandemic, some congregations are well attended. The esteemed Justices on the Court may not remember, but the original super spreader in NY emanated from a synagogue. Throughout the nation well attended Church services of all denominations have been contributed to the spread.
What the Court’s protectors of “religious freedom” ignore is that the reckless free exercise of customary religious ceremonies puts the rest of society at risk, An infected congregant spreads the virus throughout the community, and adds to the burden on our stressed healthcare system. Limiting attendance and requiring social distancing and mask wearing are reasonable restrictions where prayer alone will not thwart a virus. The religious institution could accommodate it’s parishioners with multiple services. 
A state must be able to protect it’s residents from a contagion; no member of that society has a right to add to the death count."
2020-11-26 14:01,Time to start counting how many times the new court shoots itself in the foot.  Too bad there's nothing in the Constitution that talks about the nation's health and well-being.
2020-11-26 14:02,While we are fight religious extremist outside USA we put the same in position of power to wreak havoc  on our lives. Many peoples lives will be in danger because of this ruling. This ruling basically says to the population that religious extremist have legal right to cause harm to others because of their belief.
2020-11-26 13:59,"I am sad that Justice Barrett forces Chief Justice Roberts into the minority on a decision that interprets the First Amendment in a life-endangering manner—a dramatic reversal of when Justice Ginsberg was on the court.
Would hospitals or hospital staffs be permitted to refuse to treat parishioners or Hasidic Jews who place worship above community health? I wonder if the Court might soon rule against other state-imposed pandemic safety-related restrictions.
If the Court majority supports some ‘unrestricted public gathers,’ why don’t they, as the highest court in the land, resume open sessions themselves?"
2020-11-26 13:36,"The right to practice religion is greater than the right to public health. 

This country’s morals are backwards."
2020-11-26 13:49,"The freedom to practice your religion is not really what's at stake here, lives are. Freedom means you will not be thrown in jail for your beliefs. Restricting large gatherings is all about safety not keeping you from practicing your religion. When the pandemic is under control, go back to church all you want. Until then, be sensible and stay away from crowds."

The misguided religious fanatics on the Supreme Court who interpret every public health order as a First Amendment violation must know that their ruling will surely trigger super spreading of Covid. States should reframe these orders as banning all (generic) large gatherings and leave houses of worship out of it."
2020-11-26 14:02,So much for stare decisis. Amy Coney Island lied in her confirmation hearing when she said she cared about following precedent. Isn't that prosecutable? I hope she enjoys her Sunday Mass.
2020-11-26 14:03,"I am afraid if we couldn't get a vote or two from the five most conservative justices on elevating life of the living vs the right to attend religious services during one of the darkest times in our nation's history (more Americans will die from COVID then during WWII) I fear for my country.

What will these five justices do when there isn't a national catastrophe occurring?  Do my secular rights to be free from religion matter?  Those five justices have blood on their religious hands."
2020-11-26 14:02,"So, here we are. The eleventh-hour appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett has worked its hyper-conservative magic for the first time, and we can only hope that lives of religious Americans (and the innocent people with whom they then interact) are not lost because of it.

How readily and dishonestly Justice Gorsuch equates the level of risk in a quick visit to a liquor store or bike shop with prolonged attendance in a crowded church, synagogue or mosque.

There is something very wrong when Supreme Court justices attack elected officials trying to cope with a deadly national health crisis, and the attack involves spouting cute applause lines intended to incite radical followers of the president who appointed the justices."
2020-11-26 13:50,"This is an about religious restrictions. There’s nothing that’s preventing people from practicing their chosen religion. The only thing restrictions are barring are large gatherings in an attempt to save lives. Ironic, given that the Republicans and conservatives promote themselves as the right to life party. Again showing their hypocrisy, that life only counts before you draw your first breath after that you have no right to your life. They are happy to take it from you if it serves their agenda.￼"
2020-11-26 13:58,Let the attendees sign a waiver to not receive hospital based care should they become sick.

2020-11-26 14:03,"Agree with commenters that this is an anti-science, anti-life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness decision.  I'm afraid that the decision draws upon the myth that Covid-45 is like the flu.  Would the decision be the same if the virus raging through our country was Ebola, with death rates of 60-65%?

This decision, like those in states where there are suits against the emergency powers of governors to require masks, mandate business hours and occupancy, etc., is short-sighted to the extreme.  Do we just let selfish, ignorant people kill off others.  Once again, this demonstrates the ignorance of the rights without accompanying responsibilities crowd."
2020-11-26 14:07,"The timing of this decision couldn’t be worse- Thanksgiving travel underway, family gatherings, a few weeks and then Hanukkah and Christmas.  Our nations healthcare workers and healthcare systems are overwhelmed - on the brink.

2020-11-26 14:08,"When you vote for President, you don’t just vote for that person, you vote for many, many people by extension, including Supreme Court justices.

The 2020 election may have just passed, but we’re still feeling the effects of the 2016 election (and certainly earlier ones), as we did in this Supreme Court ruling. 

I hope this lesson is not lost on us liberals now that we’ve scored a more recent win."
2020-11-26 14:08,"Trump’s pandemic meets Trump’s supreme court and wins. The real downside will be if a local government needs to take measures again to quell hotspots, like churches, they will have to treat all other businesses the same. This will cause economic suffering for the non-religious and religious alike."
2020-11-26 14:08,"For Justice Gorsuch to compare a liquor store and bike shop to a church, temple or mosque as places of congregation is absolutely bazaar. This comparison suggests that if I can sit down to a meal with my wife and three children I should be able to sit down to a meal with 500 people as well. In the commercial enterprises, the maintenance of social distancing and wearing of masks is possible. Uncontrolled gatherings of whatever nature put all those who come into contact with participants at risk, including vulnerable populations and health care providers. Perhaps the Supreme Court could become a destination for those infected by reckless behavior. Unfortunately, rather than achieving balance, this decision places organized religions’ rights above those of everyone else. I do hope that contact tracing will lead those who voted for this decision to reconsider what may be in the broader societal interest."
2020-11-26 14:07,"I write this sitting on Sword Beach in Hermanville-Sur-Mer, Normandy, where French, Canadian and British soldiers landed on D-Day. It is a beautiful autumn day of sun and a cool breeze, and it is easy to feel the immense history here.

As we think of what we are thankful for, I truly wish I could be thankful for the behavior of all fellow American citizens uniting to fight against and defeat the pandemic.

Unfortunately, we are a divided country where we have lost the ability to talk and listen to each other. 

Perhaps on this day we can all remember the immense sacrifice of our war hero’s and try and emulate their sacrifice is just a small way to unite against the virus."
2020-11-26 14:06,"Booze and Bicycle shops are only allowed X number of people in them at any time, including employees, depending on the state you live in.  Many retail enterprises have these restrictions during Covid and are doing their bit to help in the Covid fight.  Religious organizations should too.  Comparing the gathering of hundreds of people in a religious building to a retail business is poor reasoning.  But alas, religious fundamentalists now occupy the Supreme Court.  This does not good for democracy."
2020-11-26 14:06,"Alito, Thomas, Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, and Barret, the Covid 5, Republican justices displaying the cold hearted arrogance of religious zealotry to maximum effect during a national emergency. Daring to order that greater society must suffer excess death and despair in support of narrow religious interpretations made by a handful of reckless demagogues. As has often been said, the constitution is not a suicide pact."
2020-11-26 14:05,"I have to respectfully disagree with the majority on this one. 

A solution but not a great one:
Then if those who ignore the guidance of the medical teams and seek a higher authority while becoming infected by this pandemic seek help they should be put in the back of the line or let the higher authority cure them. However if they cause the death of another and it can be proven without a doubt, murder charges should be brought."
2020-11-26 14:07,"It's nonsense that your constitutional right to free exercise of religion is under attack by limiting the number of people allowed to gather during a pandemic. As far as I've heard Mr. Cuomo is not locking up Uyghurs or any other religious group in re-education camps,  just asking people to stop gathering for the greater good. The greater good I would think is one thing most religions would advocate. Religion can be practiced anywhere anytime and does not have to be practiced in a building with others. Though many people find comfort practicing their religion with like-minded people in a church or synagogues it's not mandatory. This idea that as a nation we cannot give up any of the simple privileges we live with for the safety of others is hard to wrap my head around. In the end, I'd hope that the people of the United States could find it possible to become less selfish, one can dream."
2020-11-26 14:07,"Based on a sampling of comments that I have read, it seems to me that the underlying assumption of the negative comments is that religious leaders are viewed as irresponsible people. That they disregard the concern of spreading a disease to others in favor of a religious practice. That they make no effort to protect the health of their congregation and others. This is patently false."
2020-11-26 14:10,"Cuomo should just ignore this ruling and test our system. When have populations with greater numbers and greater wealth ever subjected themselves to minority rule under relatively smaller and poorer populations? This is a matter of public safety and, realistically, what is the Supreme Court going to do?"
2020-11-26 14:09,"The Supreme Court acts like rulings on religion are pieces of cake that can be cut and served generously. But many people practice their sincerely held religious beliefs in aggressive, even violent, ways. Extremists who gather to plot a bombing in the name of their god are practicing their religion, too. There's an enormous difference between a terrorist and somebody who goes to church during a pandemic, and the court would no doubt sanction the government's right to monitor religious extremism, but that's what makes this ruling so grating. Instead of delineating what is and is not considered acceptable religious practice, wouldn't it be fairer and more consistent for the court to flatly recognize that matters of public health and safety justify requirements that religions be temporarily practiced a little differently?"
2020-11-26 14:09,"I would have no objection to seeing the devout gather for lengthy religious services in close quarters, provided that in doing so they were risking their own health and no one else's.  If people want to show their love for God by risking their own deaths, so be it.  Unfortunately, these people claim a First Amendment right to expose me and everyone else to a higher risk of death by participating in a super-spreader event.  That a majority on the Supreme Court would agree with them is mind-boggling.  There is no constitutional right to inflict harm on the public in the name of religion.  Period.  

So what is the high court majority in this case really up to?  I'd say it's burnishing a legend in anticipation of future cases.  The legend is one in which ""religion"" is oppressed by the forces of secularism and requires the special protection of the court.  The real intent of the five Justices, however, is to grant religion special privileges that will inevitably disadvantage others or subject them to discrimination.  Will the age of Trump give way to the dawn of Theocracy?

It is way past time to reform the courts."
2020-11-26 14:09,"Are we to understand that Justice Gorsuch would have sided with the state if the numerical limits had applied to private businesses, too?   Seems simple enough to change to rule to limit occupants per square foot in any indoor space.

An unsigned opinion? How Republican!"
2020-11-26 14:09,I think that the conservative justices should have personally investigated these church gatherings before making their decision.
2020-11-26 14:10,The restrictions were in response to the real world problem of viral transmission. Even limited contact tracing showed these religious congregations were spreader events. Obfuscating person irresponsibility behind a smoke screen of religious freedom is not a victory for anyone.
2020-11-26 14:08,So...it seems neighbourhoods as a whole will need to be quarantined with barriers and police surveillance and church attendees will need ankle monitors and house arrests. It won't be pretty but if that's what they want...

The autocratic  and arbitrary way these mayors and governors close and open things, or limit seating is the kind if things you see in dictatorships. It’s really sad how this whole thing has been mismanaged from the start. The goal line always changes, in the beginning they told us they were locking down because there wasn’t enough testing, or enough PPE in the hospital, what’s  the reason now? I am glad that Paris ended their lockdown weeks early , and everything reopens on Saturday, they learned that when they locked down they took away hope and joy from people, this causes more harm than good. You can live with this virus and get on with life with just a few simple moves

1. You fine people who don’t wear masks - 500 dollars to start with, believe me , one day of ticket blitz and everyone will have a mask on, and they will learn it’s no big deal
2. If you have a cough you stay home , we all fear the coughers. We the public understand many things our autocratic rulers don’t . A cough is the viruses main transmission system .The city needs to inform the public of this and advertise this fact so the coughers stay home .
3. If you have a fever stay home , it will be proven that people are most contagious when they have a fever. In China and Japan they scanned people for fevers before they entered big stores or public transportation...and eradicated the virus.

3 simple things . That work...as should we."

2020-11-26 14:07,"Oliver Wendell Holmes is remembered for his view that freedom of speech was subordinate to public safety (you can't yell 'Fire!' in a crowded movie theater). Why is freedom of religion different? Where did the 5 judges in the majority get their expertise in the aerosol spread of viruses? And why is the Archdiocese of New York, (whom one might expect to be more-or-less in the ""right to life"" camp), leading the charge against regulations enacted by public servants in good faith to keep people alive?"

How about ending the barbaric practice? There are surely criminals that have committed heinous crimes but I don’t want my tax dollars spent on killing them. It doesn’t deter crime. It doesn’t bring back the murdered. Incarceration for life? No problem."
2020-11-26 14:12,"Those who in large numbers ignore restrictions to keep ALL of us safe should pledge not to endanger the lives of any health care providers by seeking care when they become ill, unless those health care workers are members of their congregation.

2020-11-26 14:11,"This is perhaps as misguided and reality-denying (or perhaps just ideological and disingenuous) a decision as Citizens United and the WWII Japanese American internment decision.   Arguably worse, since it overrules a very recent precedent and overlooks the fact that we're experience a surge in Covid infections and hospitalizations.   This is the result of the small rural state bias of the Senate, the casting aside of norms by the McConnell-Trump Republican Party, and the quick shift of the Court's center from Kennedy to Roberts and, now, probably Kavanaugh."

Maybe they believe it’s “God’s Will” whether they get the Corona virus at these congregations. For the rest of the sensible, we’ll put our trust in Science as opposed to their blind faith to religion over Public Health."
2020-11-26 14:12,It’s amazing to me that a group dedicated to replacing the six million murdered would refuse to practice proper masking and social distancing and treat their population so cavalierly -  it doesn’t make any sense.
2020-11-26 14:12,I love Karaoke and have missed it terribly these past few months but I’m pretty sure singing in enclosed spaces right now isn’t a good idea and understand why I cannot.

2020-11-26 14:04,"There is no freedom for the dead.

There is a reason you cannot shout 'Fire!' in a crowded building.  The supreme court has apparently forgotten that all our constitutional rights end when they jeopardize the lives of others.

Let's be honest, they didn't forget, they just don't care."
2020-11-26 14:12,"Me, personally I am cheering this decision.  If people aren't smart enough to figure out they can pray at home and connect with God outside of a church then have at it.  A few less religious zealots the better.  He gave us a brain and freewill to chose faith.   There are plenty to churches that broadcast their sermons and if I want to tithe there are ways to do that to.  So let them have at it.  Gather in the largest congregations possible.  Everyone with good sense wear a mask and stay home.   God will bless you for doing so."
2020-11-26 14:04,"This decision lends itself to proof of many narratives, including “ACB is a religious zealot using the Court to proselytize.” The issues tend to be more complex than a newspaper headline, and in a case like this, it’s more a question of whether the state is treating secular and religious gatherings equally, and the ruling is limited to the very specific facts of a temporary rule. But if you don’t understand the law and tend toward conspiracy theories, you’ll believe and recommend a comment stating the Court is trying to kill religious people, which is nonsense."

2020-11-26 14:12,"In a liquor store 200 people don’t congregate and sit side by side and breath on each other. In a church, mosque and synagogues they do.  Even with in a liquor store, people are walking in with a mask and they provide hand sanitizers. And no it is not essential services, if they show irresponsible behavior, they should be shut down and fined. 

Did you see the picture of the 1000 Orthodox Jews cramped up in a synagogue, sitting close next to each other and not one of them wearing mask at the rabbis family wedding. That is irresponsible behavior and irresponsible if committed by people of any religion. And I agree no one should be targeted. But Cuomo and De Blasio have been right on that.

To compare the two is shame on part of Supreme Court. Gorsuch is plain wrong. Shame that he sits in the highest office in this country."
2020-11-26 14:13,"Reasonable people can disagree on what constitutes an unconstitutional abridgment of religious expression. Gov Cuomo should change the rule to respond to the criticisms stated in the SCOTUS opinion. Social distancing, masks and other health requirements similarly imposed on other places should be constitutional as I read the opinion. If there is still a majority in opposition to reasonable health standards then another nail will be added to the SCOTUS coffin and we’ll see a reform of the Court. Minority rule will be countenanced only so long as it doesn’t adversely affect others. Yelling “Fire” in a crowded theatre is not protected speech. Neither is conducting super spreader meetings-religious or otherwise-protected."

And I would like to remind their families, you will NOT be allowed in to see them.  In their hospital room, in the morgue and also not in the funeral home.  So get a very good look when they are wheeled upstairs for treatment, this may be the very last time you wil see them.  They will die alone.  No one may be there when they pass."

2020-11-26 14:17,"More and more the US is moving towards an extreme influence of religion on the political sphere. Compare a pet shop where people stay for a few minutes with a religious facility where hundreds of people congregate, come and go at the same time and spend time singing out loud (which has been shown to generate a large amount of aerosols) is completely wrong. 
The conservative judges are acting against health experts’ recommendations and out of fanaticism. It is sad to see a country founded upon principles that were in opposition to what mainstream religion was defending at the time go backwards like this. 
It’s almost as if humanity is regressing towards superstition and tribalism. And shows once more that these religious people who sued the government are more interested in stuffing their own pockets than protecting peoples’ lives.

My question for the Supremes is that for many of us our local bar, bowling alley or gym are our houses of worship, seriously, where we seek communion, fellowship and spiritual awareness. If God is everywhere, then anywhere is a church or synagogue or mosque. Weddings and even funerals for example have been held everywhere including inside bars, gyms and bowling alleys.  So, Supremes, cannot everywhere and anywhere be claimed a religious exemption by at least someone?  And, doesn’t that mean that authorities are really powerless to restrict access to anywhere, if someone claims religious grounds for doing so?"

The several decisions that religious schools may discriminate while receiving public monies through tax exemptions, infrastructure grants, and student vouchers as well as corporations with ""deeply held religious beliefs"" may ignore laws they don't like were clear indicators of where SCOTUS was headed prior to RGB's death. This Court now clearly prefers supporting particular religious beliefs over widespread public safety science. Separation of church and state? Ha!"

2020-11-26 14:18,"Today, Pope Francis has a message published in the NYTimes  as this article analyzing Judge Barratt’s recent vote in the Supreme Court, which I urge her to read.  It could help her to rise above the opinions of some of the people who helped her be nominated and approved.  She doesn’t owe them anything, and as she stated, she makes up her own mind independently.  

Governor Cuomo is being talked about as a future presidential candidate. His opposition may seek her vote just as a way to spoil his chances.  I think it fair to say openly, that in her new role on the Supreme Court, however, she should take a broad approach and scrutinize the many, long-term political strategies regarding a future President, even though they do not appear to be specifically part of the case brought to the court.  Or as Pope Francis has written – “It is all too easy for some to take an idea — in this case, for example, personal freedom — and turn it into an ideology, creating a prism through which they judge everything.”

The pandemic has opened a rare opportunity to work together. It has also revealed how heart breaking it is to die alone.  We need each other more than ever."
2020-11-26 14:20,"Why are seat belts mandated and bans on cigarette smoking appropriate? This decision invites groups to celebrate religious freedom / fervor through singing, sitting close to one another, and perhaps chatting after service with others seems like a recipe for increasing transmission.  And so I mourn my medical friends in all our hospitals that are beyond exhausted in fighting this plague. When do we examine the consequences that CNAs, nurses, and doctors face every single day with the tsunami of more and more patients?"
2020-11-26 14:19,"A thoughtful post in the WaPo:
Why is the city able to enforce fire codes but not pandemic rules in regard to building safety?"
2020-11-26 14:24,"The New York rule did not discriminate against any one religion or against religion in general. Building codes and fire codes similarly require church safety.  They limit the number of people in a space, require safe architecture, and specify exit numbers, wheelchair access, and bathrooms. The New York rule was about making human interactions safer during this crisis.

The 1st Amendment makes clear that religions should not be singled out for special privileges (establishment) or for persecution. The 14th Amendment guarantees Equal Justice. To rule that religions can crowd their building, but workplaces, restaurants, taverns, sports arenas, or political gatherings cannot is to establish religion as worthy of discrimination in its favor.

If the Court cannot also clearly define what constitutes a religion and what such defined religions are not allowed to do, then this decision represents open license for anyone or any group the right to do anything they want in the name of religion."
2020-11-26 14:23,"This is the most blatant example of judicial activism that I have ever seen.  The Supreme Court is micromanaging emergency regulations.

And it's intellectually dishonest; NY is not being more restrictive to religion, it is being more favorable to religion.  That's because the relevant comparison to mass is not a grocery store but a movie theater, which are completely closed.  The Justices know this, they can't be taken seriously.

I think it's time to punk the Supreme Court, impose a regulation which is slightly less restrictive, instead of a 25 person limit make it a 35 person limit and let them take up up the case again.  If they are going to micromanage let's put them to work."

By rejecting the structure of ""peace, order, and good government"" (i.e., justice, reason and competence) this court has condemned the individualist's ""pursuit of happiness"" to nothing more than a suicidal pact of drinking toxic koolaid.  The only recourse now is for municipalities to sue, sue, sue any religious organization who permits a covid super spreader event for all health and medical costs incurred to the greater community.  It would seem the power of money is the only affordance and constraint America understands."

2020-11-26 14:24,"I do not recall in our history, any time when any of our governments' chief executive's emergency powers were negated by a court to the extreme detriment of the well being of this country.  It is obvious that the current SCOTUS is engaged in political hackery, and that ACB is going to be Trump's poison pill to this country.

The only solution to this is one I have suggested in the past:  Joe Biden will be given no choice, but to make recess appointments to pack the court so well in favor of progress and constitutional forthrightness, that the 6 conservatives' votes will become irrelevant in any case.  My suggestion is to appoint 16 more justices, who can be a far left as Biden is willing to go.  They should understand that their time on the bench should not be for life, but as they age, they should rotate out when intelligent Presidents are in office to refresh them.  thus keeping regressivist ignorance where it belongs - in the past."

2020-11-26 14:22,"The real question is if someone (person A) living near a church gets the virus from one of its members (person B) who got the virus during a church. As a proper conservative argument, person A should be able to sue person B to make person A whole again. If the virus which struck person A ends up with a life long debilitating condition, person B will have to pay person A full remuneration to pay for the life time of care person A deserves. Furthermore, person A should be able to sue the church for providing the setting where person B got infected.

2020-11-26 14:20,Welcome to the Supreme Court Justice Barrett. May you take part in many more rulings like this.
2020-11-26 14:21,"What a predicament we are in, the religious claim that the state may not infringe on their 'freedoms', given there is separation of church from state. But do churches forget that 'Public Health' is applicable to all the people, religious or not; and that your freedom must end where mine may be trampled upon? Can't we be more rational, and be concerned that what we do, especially if carrying the lethal coronavirus while asymptomatic, may be the death knell of your neighbor? Was it not enough to watch superspreader Trump, irresponsibly and in the name of egomania, cause so much harm and remain unrepentant and indifferent? What is being advocated is not 'freedom protection' of any given church to do as they please in the midst of necessary public health restrictions, but the license to infect others with impunity. We humans are social beings and need to protect each other for the common good. It's that simple!"
2020-11-26 14:23,More people will die because of this decision. Let that sink in.
2020-11-26 14:27,"It seems to me that this ruling says that one's personal religious beliefs and conscience are more important than the safety and life of others.  More important than that of people within your faith, your children, and your neighbors.

Sounds like a good argument for leaving choice on reproductive freedom up to each person's individual religion and conscience."
2020-11-26 14:23,"“Where two or more of you are gathered together there am I in the midst of you “Matthew:18,20.Look to the word of God and stay safe at home.The Supreme Court isn’t the best guide to staying well."
2020-11-26 14:26,"Frankly I don’t see the parallel - “no world in which the Constitution tolerates color-coded executive edicts that reopen liquor stores and bike shops but shutter churches, synagogues and mosques,” ah I get it...so next time I go into a bike shop or liquor store, I’ll be sure to sit for at least fifteen minutes and pray out loud and sing. This is LOGIC from our nations lofty brains? Beats me!"

2020-11-26 14:24,The comparison with liquor stores & bike shops is unfair.  You're in and out of those stores relatively quickly and they're not as crowded with people singing like they do in church.
2020-11-26 14:25,"Trump is right now getting his plans together to challenge the election at the Supreme Court, and this Court will probably work hard to find a way to hand him the office we the people have denied him.  They will probably decide all mail-in ballots are invalid or something like that, and it won't matter to them that they are wrecking a free and fair election, because once Trump is reinstalled, there will never be another election.  

So much for our happy Thanksgiving, destroyed in a late night ruling the night before.  Roberts better twist arms better than he has in this case, or democracy will die ON HIS WATCH."
2020-11-26 14:25,"While we must agree with the fundamental principles of separation of State and Church as also that religious institutions,  in the minimum, have to be treated on par with commercial establishments in such matters, it would be highly irresponsible of any religious organization to flout social distancing and safety rules at this time.   Religions have an obligation to emphasize duties even more than rights. The right to life should first apply to those who are already here and are breathing today!"
2020-11-26 14:26,"OK, Mr. President-elect: Let's get to work on restoring some balance to what was formerly a Supreme Court."
2020-11-26 14:26,I think the result of this and future Supreme Court actions will in effect be that we now have only two branches of government:  executive and legislative with the courts joining the Legislative branch.
2020-11-26 14:25,"The next question: Are any governmental  regulations applicable to any religious gathering or activities? This same argument can be used to ""protect"" every religious practice, including polygamy or even human sacrifice, not just the right to assemble to worship. This argument is just too narrow and weak to pass such an important test.."
2020-11-26 14:25,"So, another step back towards the time when the influence of religious leaders were unquestioned and used to repress science. In so many ways the conservative minority in this country seems to desire a return to feudalism wherein the lords and ladies, together with their courts of sycophants (including self serving religious leaders) retain all the power while using their considerable resources to keep the rest of us in our places."

2020-11-26 14:26,"Justices who voted with the majority should have to work a 12-hour shift in a Covid ward when the faithful start showing up from nearby parishes and synagogues. Somewhere in the Great Beyond, the Founding Fathers are doing face palms, massaging their temples and shaking their heads at these feckless Federalists."
2020-11-26 14:28,"My synagogue is holding services via Zoom.  Many other religious groups around the country are doing the same thing. Of course it is not as satisfactory as gathering in person, but it keeps the congregation together and it endangers nobody.

Moreover, Michigan fire prevention law limits the number of people who can be in the building (or any building open to the public) simultaneously.  Nobody assumes that fire safety codes infringe on freedom of religion.  Occupancy limitations during a pandemic are in the same public safety category."
2020-11-26 14:22,"Does this mean we now have to shun members of religious groups known to ignore Covid restrictions?

It does."
2020-11-26 14:21,"When will this 'the only true religious expression is a crowded one' group of flip-flopping Justices get around to some other inhibitions against the free expression of religion?

2020-11-26 14:21,"Early on in the pandemic, the NYT had an article which detailed the levels of risk of contracting Covid for a dozen common activities, based on the opinions of experts.  From what I remember, religious services were one of 2 activities that are ""High"" risk, along with bars. The  only thing higher (""Very high"") is nightclubs."
2020-11-26 14:19,"RBG give us another sign please?  Bigger than a fly hopefully?  We need to be especially vigilant if more of these suits start coming from other states.  How will this effect travel, if people are going to big gatherings  and a week later getting on a plane?  Not much time left for this abominable administration to end, but we need President elect Biden to start adding liberal judges to make us safe from  Evangelical Amy."
2020-11-26 14:19,"So in May, when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was still alive, the Supreme Court said that California restrictions limiting the size of gatherings were acceptable in a public health emergency and were neutral toward religion.
Two months later in July, when Justice Ginsburg was still alive, the Court maintained that stance in a similar case from Nevada.

Now in November, just two months after Justice Ginsburg's death, the Court turns 180 degrees and rules that similar restrictions in New York violate the Constitution's freedom of religion clause.
This just seven weeks after the maskless, super-spreading White House reception for newly nominated Justice Barrett.
And Mitch McConnell is doing his happy dance.

Pathetic."
2020-11-26 14:26,"Those houses of worship may want to stock up on more

2020-11-26 14:20,How this decision affects the death toll from Covid19 over the next year may decide the fate of the Supreme Court for decades to come. Lord forgive them for they know not what they have done.
2020-11-26 14:29,"I think the Pope explains it best in his Op-Ed on this very page this morning:

""With some exceptions, governments have made great efforts to put the well-being of their people first, acting decisively to protect health and to save lives. The exceptions have been some governments that shrugged off the painful evidence of mounting deaths, with inevitable, grievous consequences. But most governments acted responsibly, imposing strict measures to contain the outbreak.

""Yet some groups protested, refusing to keep their distance, marching against travel restrictions — as if measures that governments must impose for the good of their people constitute some kind of political assault on autonomy or personal freedom! Looking to the common good is much more than the sum of what is good for individuals. It means having a regard for all citizens and seeking to respond effectively to the needs of the least fortunate.

""It is all too easy for some to take an idea — in this case, for example, personal freedom — and turn it into an ideology, creating a prism through which they judge everything.""

The justices aren't protecting religion, they are protecting their ideology without regard for the common good."
2020-11-26 14:19,The Ct decides to allow super spreader events as they sit and hear this case virtually.  Perhaps they should abide by their own reasoning and allow unlimited visitors to worship them as they sit in judgement of us all.
2020-11-26 14:19,"I am a conservative Jew living in New York, where my Governor is Andrew Cuomo. I supported all of his decisions and how he handled the COVID-19 spike here in NYS last Spring. 
I also was horrified with the secret ultra orthodox wedding this month were 10,000 attended, not masked and not socially distanced. 
I am a senior, with pre-existing conditions (cancer remission) trying to stay alive until the release of the vaccine sometime next year. This ruling upsets me, restrictions here are for health and safety, not taking away ""Freedom of Worship/Religion"". 
I am sure that many people who are religious have died or lost family members and/or friends during this pandemic. I am most thankful today, that we have elected a new administration, that cares about ALL of the populations. YES, elections do have consequences, three conservative right justices have tipped the SCOTUS, for many years after the present administration leaves office on January 20, 2021..."
2020-11-26 14:29,"I am in favor of restrictions, but if restaurants, businesses, colleges and schools are allowed to open, why not churches?

2020-11-26 14:25,I would hope that those attending religious gatherings include among their prayers one for the Supreme Court (and our Republic). Happy Thanksgiving.
2020-11-26 14:23,"American history in a nutshell:  bondage>protest>freedom>exploitation>justice>enforcement>bondage.

2020-11-26 14:24,Calling this action a “decision” suggests some kind of thought. It’s time to retire this terminology and simply refer to Supreme Court actions as “rulings”. Similar to what supreme emperors did.
2020-11-26 14:24,"Religion.  Sigh.  All based on human wish fulfillment fantasies, cannot cope with the reality of an infectious disease.  To think that gathering in a church or synagogue is any different in terms of a deity or deities than any other form of fantasy exercised anywhere else is delusion."
2020-11-26 14:29,"'Chief Justice Roberts rejected a similar argument in the California case. The order there, he wrote, “exempts or treats more leniently only dissimilar activities, such as operating grocery stores, banks and laundromats, in which people neither congregate in large groups nor remain in close proximity for extended periods.”'

If a  third-grader can follow this line of reasoning, why wasn't Cuomo's restrictions upheld 9-0? Because Alito and all the other activist religious zealots do not care about logic or ""calling balls and strikes"" but only reaching decisions that satisfy their personal preferences."
2020-11-26 14:29,"This is an early sign that this new Court intends to grant wider and wider latitude to certain religious organizations in a complex social framework where plaintive First Amendment claims will be oh-so-piously asserted.  From the forms of public funding made available to tax-exempt religious schools, to the conversion (pun intended) of corporations into 'persons' by allowing the insertion of specific religious commitments into HR policies, this decision at the very height (we pray--pun intended!) of a raging, nationwide spike in Covid19 infections is troubling, and terribly ironic.  Is there not a primary urging to neighbor love in the traditions represented in these suits?  Is it possible that the governor's restrictions are, in fact, a more courageous and more compassionate expression of the costly, sacrificial nature of such love?"
2020-11-26 14:30,"The SCOTUS has left cities and states seeking to protect their citizens with only one possible solution.

2020-11-26 14:18,"So in order to protect an idea, this religious court will allow religious, ill-informed people to die. Wonder how many of the thousands who sneaked into a wedding will pay for their ""freedom"" with their lives. Oh well."
2020-11-26 14:32,"Here in Maine we'd had the lowest transmission rate in the country, now we have among the highest. The super spread events started with a defiant Southern Baptist preacher and wedding partiers which quickly spread to an assisted care facility and a jail. Many congregations have bought into ignoring safety precautions as an expression of religious freedom.

In 2016, many refused to vote for Clinton claiming there was no difference between Democratic and Republican rule.  In 2020, many dug in deeper, despite the Trump administration's many abuses, the human catastrophe and economic crisis of GOP pandemic response, and conservative takeover of the courts.

Given the objections of the majority, is it possible to craft restrictions on a very strict health basis?  Example: X number of people within a density of Y over a time T, where singing and yelling is included?   We can get out our clipboards and stop watches and compare tightly packed religious congregations to less dense, shorter time visits with masks to liquor stores."

The conservative justices should at least be up to date on basic scientific advances. 

A conservative majority of SCOTUS justices seem to ignore the observation that no form of modern Germ Theory was available to the Founders. Maybe it should be no surprise--even to originalists--that these concepts never found their way into our constitution. Based on prior SCOTUS decisions, these basic concepts appear to form a major gap in their decision-making processes. [Note: I'd give Chief Justice Roberts some credit here--he does seem to understand the broader forces that may be at play.]

2020-11-26 14:34,This irresponsible decision is owed as much to ideologies of the court as much as to the economic greed or organized religion.
2020-11-26 14:34,A truly malignant decision that will have serious health consequences.  If the Supreme Court wont to pick up the costs for people who become ill or die because they just had to go to a crowded ceremony in a religious institution instead of using common sense to socially distance (and maybe even wear a mask).  Judicial activism in the name of religion is the new focus of this remade conservative court.   I foresee many problems ahead with this court.
2020-11-26 14:36,"This decision disturbs me on many levels. 

1) The opinion itself could be the work of a religious high school moot court team.

2) The hypocrisy of the flamboyently ""pro-life"" Archdiocese of New York in seeking to endanger the lives of its post-
born parishioners and every person they encounter,  born and ""pre-born"" is staggering. 

3) The hypocrisy of a church, whose own Gospel (I think Matthew, but don't quote me, i'm Jewish) admonishes the faithful to ""not be like the hypocrites who stand on the corner and in the synagogues"" but to pray privately and your prayers will be heard. 

4) What this potentially could mean for mandates to vaccinate or require proof of vaccination for school,  air travel, attending theater and sporting events. There have been heated battles over religious exemptions for vaccines.  We may never reach the level we will need to enable a semblance of normalcy.

5) Does this mean the ultra orthodox can now have 7,000 person weddings?
They are religious services. 

 We will be in trouble for a long time."
2020-11-26 14:35,"So instead of the possibility of dying to DEFEND the constitution, like going to war, we run the risk of dying BECAUSE of the constitution.  

The constitution grants many rights including religious rights. The trend of SCOTUS has been to make all rights pass subservient to religious rights. 

And judge Gorsuch has it wrong.  Don’t compare religious services with liquor stores and hardware stores.  Compare it with movie theaters, concert halls and music venues.  Last I checked, these places were closed."

2020-11-26 14:36,"Although the United States boasts of separation of church and state as a tenant of our constitution, in practice we are one of the most religiously compromised countries in the world. The all Catholic supreme court including its newest and most radically religious member (think Mel Gibson's dad Catholic) will be rendering many decisions to come based on religious nonsense. Other countries around the world such as Italy, France, Ecuador where the majority population is Catholic would not stand for this sort of religious intrusion on public policy."
2020-11-26 14:35,"Supreme Court:  ""Let them die"".   
I am anxious to find out how many people above the proposed limits are going to go to houses of worship now that they are not limited.  Moreover,  churches and others could celebrate several services a day and people could attend spreading themselves appropriately.  I wonder if the clamor against the limits came more from religious authorities than from the faithful.  Medieval priests complained of loss revenue when people  were reluctant to abandon their work to go to church on the numerous holidays declared by the Church."
2020-11-26 14:38,"Conservatives often defend our undemocratic governmental systems including the Electoral College and the apportionment of senators as a means of preventing the tyranny of the majority. It never seems to occur to them that a tyranny of the minority is even worse and is what leads to revolutions, including our own. The current political climate appears to be intractable as long as conservatives use their largely unjustified (if arguably legal) power to force the majority to comply with their views even when they are harmful to our safety and well being. A revolution would probably not bode well for any of us but an amicable parting of the ways may be the only way we can resolve this dilemma."

2020-11-26 14:40,"Gorsuch - get off your high horse. The “executive edict” could just be the governor selectively applying his authority to private gatherings (religious) rather than public.

The COVID pandemic has afforded us little time.  It was in this pressure cooker that local regulations were cobbled together as our understanding of the virus has increased and our healthcare response improves.   

Governor Cuomo at times has demonstrated the best of response in measured tones, at others he has been a political bully.  The same for the Supreme Court.

Unfortunately, this is a harbinger of what is to come with a conservative court.  This decision sets public health against congregate religious gatherings.  This is the conflict that has been set in motion.  There will be public health and human consequences for this decision--and it won't be long before it plays out in perhaps disastrous ways.  It will be more important than ever for individuals to make decisions for their own health and well-being that will keep them safe.  We've already seen the federal and some state governments abdicate their responsibility for America's citizens.  Now the Supreme Court of the United States has joined that issue as well."

2020-11-26 14:35,"Here we go down the road toward the Supreme Court’s relentless rendering itself not only irrelevant but also malevolent to people’s lives, safety, freedom, and security. What this decision and others like it fail to take into account is that we all must live together in this land; we do not live as islands unto ourselves, and although we may choose to divide ourselves into religious and other groups, those groupings are momentary, not permanent. 

Also, ironically, a person’s freedom of worship and assembly and all other rights die when the person dies, as do the rights of any person that individual is responsible for killing. 

This decision is the elevation of self-centered individualism over both sanity and human rights. How perfectly appropriate that it is the Trump court that has come out with it."
2020-11-26 14:43,"So under this rationale, can we reopen nightclubs? Because it would be unfair to restrict non-religious activities more than religious activities.￼ I’m not suggesting that we do this, but the decision seems to open a floodgate of possibilities under Equal Protection."

So while the evidence through contract tracing and tracking shows that houses of worship are virus vectors where bicycle shops are not, we will only allow the State to restrict bike shops.  We need another Constitutional Convention.  It is time for a rewrite."

Who are they to go against the advice of learned doctors fighting this worsening pandemic and allow House of Worship packing super spreader events? The Supreme Court has no medical authority in this matter and by ruling against Governor Cuomo they now will have blood on their hands. 

You are unelected and do not answer to the people. The right choice is to let Governor Cuomo make the calls he has to make based on medical science and for you unelected non medical amateurs to stay out of it.

2020-11-26 14:41,"I being a religious minority in this country, support freedom to choose how you will pray and which religion to follow. However, modern places of worship have become more social and political theaters, less to do with spirituality and God, whatever name you assign to Him. Visiting a grocery is not the same as spending long time in crowded places. Such actions not only endanger your own lives, but also others. This results in demand for medical and hospital  care which are overly stressed. This decision is more like a death warrant for the masses. Will the conservatives ever learn?"
2020-11-26 14:41,"It's so strange that some of these Supreme court justices openly lied during their confirmation hearing in the  Senate by promising that their personal religious opinions will not interfere with their professional legal duties.

2020-11-26 14:43,"Religious worship is not restricted to gatherings held in a building designated for that purpose alone. If you are devout you can practice your religion in virtually any location and even engage in solitary worship. The Supreme Court ruling is based on political partisanship overriding what’s the core issue. The individual and collective good of the American people. 

What’s additionally disturbing is the alarmingly deficient level of intellect the Justices of the Supreme Court have demonstrated with this ruling. Equating quick, in and out visits to stores with an assembly of what could amount to hundreds of people for a significant period of time under one roof. Message to the highest court in the land: it’s not the same thing."

2020-11-26 14:44,"This argument is as much about money as any other business is making regarding the closure of their establishments during this pandemic. 

Businesses have figured out ways to allow smaller numbers in their stores and made early times for seniors.  People don't need to go to restaurants and takeout has allowed many of them to stay afloat. People don't need to go to bars, unfortunately for them, but even they have made changes, if they could, with open air tables. Religious institutions have failed to adapt.  

People can pray at home. They can pray in an open air park. Many seniors watch the Pope from Rome on tv. 

The truly unfortunate piece is that these religious establishments haven't figured out how to do Zoom services to keep the public safe from their congregating. Nor do they want to.

It's hard to pass the collection plate when there is no gathered service. That is what we are really talking about here. 
 
Follow the money as it's been said."
2020-11-26 14:41,"Since when are liquor stores and bike shops equivalent in both crowds and sustained exposure to churches, synagogues, and mosques?

Did Gorsuch shy away from the more natural equivalency of bars and restaurants? Is he saying that if churches, synagogues, and mosques should be open, so too should bars and restaurants?

I'm confused."
2020-11-26 14:43,"The Supreme Court has now shown that common sense and assault on life and progress will be dispatched based on a theories of over 250 years ago.  The GOP have their wish that religion will supersede common sense.  Personally I think this approach of stopping services for public health is wrong.  My approach is that if you want to ignore covid, and attend the super spreader events.  Then you as a organization should be responsible for the healthcare.  Of the 10,000 people attending these church services we will see 1000 with covid, and out of that they will infect another 9000.  So the church wants to pay no tax, no income tax, and no personal property tax.  They should post a bond on their members for medical care.  So they want practice their religion I applaud this, and feel that it is a right.  What is not a right is that I pay for higher insurance premiums or public aid for this group to not act responsible."
2020-11-26 14:45,The SCOTUS is wading into territory they don't really belong IMHO. The components of making these restrictive and lockdown rules are many and varied. SCOTUS is making a broad decision where a broad decision is not safe or sane for the public at large.
2020-11-26 14:48,"Fundamental rights analysis has always been one of the tricky areas of constitutional law. Typically the court will apply strict scrutiny when a fundamental right is affected by the state.

But over time the court has been less prone to place those cases in either/or categories and instead has employed a sliding scale application of the equal protection clause.

On one side is the fundamental right and on the other is the state restriction. If the fundamental right carries considerable constitutional value they are more demanding of the state and may employ a strict scrutiny test.

If less weight is given they will use language that tends to mix the level of review without creating new categories of review.  

Curfew laws enacted to curb gang activity is an example of this approach. They restrict the constitutional right to free assembly but typically apply only to younger persons who might be either a member of a gang or potential victims of gang violence.

But in the New York case, it's clear that the 5 justice majority places great value in the free exercise of religion. Roberts alluded to the argument historically used in equal protection cases by asking are these restricted entities really similarly situated?

He found that they were not. The majority held that this didn't matter since religious exercise deserves special consideration.

This case is simply the beginning of the court's approach to religious exercise cases in the future."
2020-11-26 14:50,is not the decision of this court against principles of founding fathers - separation of state and church? the demography of the nation is changing in the sense less and less people attend church service and the supreme court should also change. would the court give similar rights to other religions? if that is the case then the country will deep into more chaos and polarizations. all religious views are not uniform and they differ depending on religious leaders as the  justices differ in their opinions. religions should be privately practiced at ease at home not in any institution setting.
2020-11-26 14:50,The case was not ripe for judicial review when Governor Cuomo lifted the restrictions on religious institutions.  That should have been the end of it. The Court is limited to deciding cases and controversies.
2020-11-26 14:53,"It’s an interesting juxtaposition, a decision that the Catholic churches in New York can ignore virus restrictions while Pope Francis has an Op-Ed speaking to our duty to make sacrifices for each other.

I hope that they follow the instruction of the pontiff and continue to restrict their attendance (voluntarily) and encourage people to keep their distance. I’m not too optimistic on that front."
2020-11-26 14:50,"Public Health is public health, subject to the rulings of elected public officials. A court, any court, and especially the Supreme Court is out of line here. They are not responsible for the health of the public. Or maybe they want to be, in which case they should individually be subject of potential prosecution for murder if anyone dies as a result of their decision. Maybe that will make them think twice before inserting themselves into issues in which they have no business to interfere"
2020-11-26 14:53,"I remember Justice Thomas dissenting in the gay marriage case telling same-sex couples their liberty was not at issue; that liberty meant freedom of movement, that if gay marriage was illegal in one state then getting married in another was okay. I'm nearly certain that is what he said or at least I understood it that way. So, in this case about religious ""liberty"" why is it not enough for people to exercise their right at home, outdoors in a plaza or a park (it does matter that it is cold, your faith will pull you through), what about a vacant parking lot? Or is this a case about money? Limited mass gatherings equal less dollars for the church. I bet this is the problem."
2020-11-26 14:51,"Limiting large indoor faith based gatherings is unconstitutional because why? Time to open theaters, ballrooms, anime conventions, and all other viral spreading friendly indoor gatherings then. On behalf of Catholics everywhere I apologize to my fellow front line healthcare workers in advance for the ensuing carnage.

2020-11-26 14:47,"This is not about practicing religion--practice all you want at home.  I would love to have gone to church at Easter and will miss the traditional Christmas services this year as well.  This, however is about safety measures of congregating in large groups regardless of the situation and has nothing to do with religion and is not singling out places of worship.  Agree with those who say that comparing this with a liquor store is absurd.  The liquor stores in my neighborhood limit the number of people allowed inside and you must wear a mask.   Plus, as others have pointed out, you are not in a store for more than a few minutes.  Where is the critical thinking and common sense? I had previously thought Biden should not rush to a decision about ""packing the court"", but now I think he should consider doing so for the greater good of the country."

2020-11-26 14:54,"I understand that people have the freedom to not take care of themselves according to the Constitution. However, they do not have the right to endanger others, that is also according to the Constitution. That is why we do not allow driving while drunk.

This decision sets a shocking precedent pitching religion against science and common sense."
2020-11-26 14:47,"In its opinion, the Supreme Court lays out the strict scrutiny standard and then totally flubs in it.  The Court properly recites that the restrictions ""must satisfy 'strict scrutiny,' and this means that they must be 'narrowly tailored' to serve a 'compelling' state interest,"" but then essentially fobs off a pandemic AND the undisputed fact that NONE of the churches or synagogues seeking relief are in the red or orange zones.  Where is the recognition of every state's broad police powers to protect its residents' safety and health of its citizens?  It's a pandemic for pete's sake, and there are videos all over the Internet showing massive religious gatherings.  Have you seen any videos of hundreds of people crammed into liquor stores for an hour while singing?  Me, neither.  First year civil procedure in law school teaches that a court should not write a broader opinion than necessary to address the issue before it.  I guess that's out the window now.  This Court just issued a prospective opinion because (clutches pearls) ""there is no guarantee that we could provide relief before another weekend passes."" Did they actually write that with a straight face?  One weekend -- during a pandemic -- without church is not irreparable harm."
2020-11-26 14:47,"Church services I'm familiar with tend to last over 45 minutes and involve sitting and kneeling and standing in unison and various audience acts that involve breathing and speaking and possibly even singing and hugging and shaking hands. When visiting a store to shop for beer and wine and other beverages of that ilk, I'm always in and then out again in under ten minutes and these days the only people I come within ten feet of for more than ten seconds are the people behind plexiglass screens, whom I interact with for about 1 minute each, while we are wearing masks. Personally, I think God would prefer we stick to shopping over churching right now, but I'm willing to let the justices lead on this.

I hope they visit lots of Red state churches in the coming weeks to show solidarity with the people they've encouraged to test God."
2020-11-26 14:50,"I was pleased to hear that the Chief Justice said the Court acted rashly.  I was also pleased that he observed that the restriction formula based on color-zones looked, on its face, to be unequal treatment of religion.  It definitely looks that way,  since limiting a church with a seating capacity of 500
people to the same 10-person limit as a liquor store is clearly unequal.  It was as clumsy an example of emergency executive action as Trump's first Moslem Ban,  and it definitely created an opening for court action in defense of a fundamental right."
2020-11-26 14:51,"Then religious institutions should pay taxes, as these events will surely have a cost in healthcare for those infected by such events. Saying religion supersedes risk to others is a dangerous precedent to use religion as a shield from other laws. We are on a very slippery slope indeed."
2020-11-26 14:47,"I am going to dock the federal government its share of my income taxes that go towards funding the Department of Defense, as I am religiously opposed to war.

The Supreme Court could not possibly overturn my decision since it would be impinging upon my freedom of religious expression.

No different than Hobby Lobby's refusal to provide birth control as part of its employee insurance package due to its religious beliefs, in particular pro-life, upheld by the Supreme Court on the same grounds. Meanwhile, Hobby Lobby had no problem profiting by selling goods from China during its one child policy. It was really all about money, nothing else."
2020-11-26 14:49,"OK, Supreme Court.  You want to allow church gatherings?  Then we have instant and immediate contact tracing, done by virtue of noting the number of cases rising in churches, either with a number exceeding normal rates of infection or a statistically significant increase within a geographical area.  

 Let's see how this turns out.  If churchgoers agree with the court, and wish to attend services, then they are obviously willing to suffer the consequences.  

It seems, also, that the Court has not factored in the health care workers' loads, and the hospitals' having sufficient numbers of beds.  But they viewed that as outside their jurisdiction.  

Nice going, McConnell...you got this one by rejecting Obama's right pick a justice during his term."
2020-11-26 14:42,"How appropriate that such an odious appointee to the court, confirmed in the dark of night, should issue her first odious decision in the dark of night.

2020-11-26 14:49,"Trying to imagine the hundreds of people who will be sitting close together at the “bike shops and liquor stores.” Considering the logic employed, I think I should have had more confidence in myself and aimed for a seat on the Supreme Court.

2020-11-26 14:41,"Well, I guess this ruling means that the rest of us will venture out even less than we already do, since there will be even more superspreaders out there, contaminating public spaces. Thanks, SCOTUS, for making our streets and shops even more dangerous."
2020-11-26 14:46,"Here we go folks. Once again SCOTUS is supposed to represent your top jurists whose main job is to interpret the law in accordance to logic and the times and make the adjustments accordingly, independent from any political leanings. This has obviously not been the case for a while now. For SCOTUS to make a decision of this nature during the middle of this crisis says it all. I wish my neighbours the best of luck."
2020-11-26 14:48,This is ruling fails to recognize the recommendations of healthcare experts that trying to save lives. These recommendations are based on prior examples of superspreading. Amy Coney Barrett and her conservative colleagues are displaying a twisted view of religious freedom. I hope that most religious leaders abide by the recommendations until the pandemic is under control.
2020-11-26 14:42,There is a silver lining.  Lazy and incompetent legislators may be force to pay attention to the details of legislation and pass bills ( and presumably executive orders) written in such a way that no such challenges of discrimination can succeed in court.
2020-11-26 14:47,"Well, America may as well brace for a return, not just to the originalism of the Constitution, but to the puritanical zeal of the pilgrims too. Coney Barrett has shown her mettle, much to her shame, allowing religious convictions to undermine the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, demonstrating the utter hypocrisy and inapplicability of originalism. 

It seems that originalism has the potential to stand as a political doctrine in its own right, akin to fascism, but with a uniquely American spin. By arriving at this decision, SCOTUS renders itself close to being the ultimate arbiter over how public health advice can be dispensed, applied, or ignored, and this endangers the court’s relevance in daily life.

It seems clear now that, as obviously partisan as the move would be, Democrats may have to stack the court with liberal judges in order to protect the country in times of ideological peril which loom menacingly on the horizon. The Supreme Court has now become part of the problem, not the solution, by undermining scientific advice and the judgement of local elected officials.

Barrett did a great job of showing how she felt about the pandemic at her nomination ritual which became a superspreader event. People like her and her apologists, who wilfully trespass into the health and safety of society, need to be removed from office and prosecuted for negligence. Millions of people around the world have become needlessly infected with over a million tragic death"
2020-11-26 14:47,"The self indulgence of many citizens is sickening. Basically, religious worship needs no edifice or human director to facilitate. One can commune with their God at home just as effectively as anywhere else. There is no price to pay, with your maker, if one practices self preservation and social responsibility.

Why are some humans so reluctant to sacrifice a basketball game, or holiday family tradition, for their own and others welfare? A true puzzlement.

A person's freedom to pollute and pass germs, ends at another person's immediate environment."
2020-11-26 14:48,"Justice Gorsuch hasn't been in a liquor store or a bike shop in awhile because neither can hold several hundred or even thousands of people. However, a church or a synagogue hall can, as recently seen in Brooklyn and Orange County.

This decision is shameful. Without some temporary restrictions on large gatherings, the virus will and is spreading like wildfire. I shudder to imagine the fallout of this decision."
2020-11-26 14:51,"Human sacrifice is back in fashion.
Church gatherings have been among the worst super-spreader events.
This kind of decision, ideology over reality, will undermine respect for the court and eventually destroy its authority."
2020-11-26 14:56,"What strange ideas we Americans have.  Our concept of freedom, loosely translated as do whatever we want, is more important than protecting the lives of our fellow citizens.  Now I guess our mythologies fall into the same category.  It seems that very insecure invisible beings require us to get together on a weekly schedule to praise them (and apparently take attendance) are more important than protecting the lives of our fellow citizens.  Apparently these invisible beings although claimed to be omniscient can not figure out how to incorporate zoom, television or other electronic media to beam religious services into our homes or onto our screens.  Apparently these invisible beings although claimed to be omnibenevolent and omnipotent actually have limits to their love and power that stop at the doors of churches and synagogues.  Funny though, these all powerful invisible beings never seem to be able to speak for themselves, instead requiring men (almost always men, usually older) dressed in outlandish costumes, speaking foreign languages and reading bronze age texts of uncertain authorship and often conflicting messages to speak for them.  Seems like the coronavirus, a particle consisting of a few proteins and nucleic acids with absolutely no intelligence whatsoever is much smarter than five out of the nine best legal minds in our nation.  Not good advertising for any of the premiere law schools in this country who somehow equate the First Amendment as a de facto suicide pact"
2020-11-26 14:41,"I'm sure there are probably a dozen or more concerns involved in a ruling like this -- jurisdiction, public safety, religious freedom, economic parity, differential treatment -- the list is large.  

However, for me, it all reduces to this -- the Center for Disease Control (CDC) says in order to reduce the spread of the virus you should not be in the presence of another person (6 feet closer) or less for more than 15 minutes, and that the best way to stop the spread of the virus is through avoiding all contact.  If you must be indoors, makes sure there is good ventilation.  Singing is particularly contraindicated, because it effectively spreads virus-laden aerosols.  

It feels to me like the  Court just made speed limits illegal.  Most people will drive sensibly, but a substantial minority of folks, currently an minority angry at recent election events, will now be able to drive as fast at the want on freeways, putting not only themselves, but the rest of us at risk.  

It's disappointing that what is essentially a conversation about public safety has instead become a political football.  I mean, how hard would it really be to come up with reasonable restrictions?   The nature of Gorsuch's ridiculous comparison between running into a bike shop for 5 minutes, fully masked, to get a replacement bike tire tube so you can commute to work and singing unmasked for hours in a church would surely serve as a stunning point of confusion for most 8th grade middle school graduates."
2020-11-26 14:56,"This decision is generally consistent with conservative values, so it should come as no surprise.  The opportunity missed by the court is one of rational thought ""trumping"" ideological hubris.  But for the reality of these times no governor would advance limits on religious gatherings.  By removing one of the few mechanisms governing authorities have to limit viral transmission, the court has invited the virus to share its bounty with untold numbers of innocent victims.

A sad day for jurisprudence, and potentially illustrative of what to expect from this court going forward.  Good luck to us all."

Will they pay their medical bills and funeral costs, and the bills of those who survive COVID-19, the infection which will be occasioned by SCOTUS supporting mass religious gatherings in New York, against the rules of duly elected state officials. So much for states' rights. 
What about the many costs of long-term care required if someone sustains long-term damage due to COVID-19 infection? They will not pay any of these bills nor compensate for lost income. They will not admit they signed these death and disability warrants. Yet, they did. May the dead rise up around their beds each night and speak to them of their suffering until these monsters too are dead."
2020-11-26 14:55,"The coronavirus is not the Black Plague which killed half of the people it infected , it is not the Spanish Flu which killed young healthy people turning their robust defense systems against them, the Spanish flu killed over 50 million people. From day one we have fought this virus as though it were something straight out of a Stephen King Novel, a virus with 99.8 fatality, it’s actually a virus with a 99.8 survival rate. If the virus was a work of fiction nobody would buy a book about a virus with such a survival rate 

The virus is always reported in the same fashion by the media who have seized on it and reported in it like no virus in history. Like no news story in history and always in the negative.

The news media reports on new  cases it will give you every number on that and post them in bold ink on the front page. But never the number of recovered . The news media will report on hospitals bring overrun, but never reports that the hospitals were pretty full before the virus hit.

The media blares the news of states or countries with upticks but quietly reports on the countries with hardly any coronavirus like Japan for instance.

Like the Media are autocratic governors never mention that the immunity of most people who have recovered from the virus lasts a long time , longer than was expected 

little mention has been given to the steroid treatments that work , anything that fails is front page.

The media is the message I’ve heard said."

How, then, does it happen that a temporary restriction on ""the free exercise of religion"" for SOME cannot be tolerated in the interests of ""the general Welfare"" at the time of a raging pandemic?  Because the right wing mind cannot weigh competing values  in arriving at a judgement and is over-focused on a single issue.  And so it seems that the right wing's free exercise of religion trumps my right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
2020-11-26 14:56,"Religious organizations have always needed to follow laws and it has never been considered an infringement on their rights.

This is an abysmal decision based on pique rather than reason and law. Chief Justice Roberts has lost control of his court."
2020-11-26 14:56,"While I understand this ruling, I don't completely agree with it. Limiting a gathering to 10 people in a small neighborhood facility makes sense; that limit seems out of place in a cathedral like St. Patricks'. But if this ruling upsets you, the solution for your concerns is so simple. Just avoid your friends and acquaintances who might now regularly attend religious services until this health crisis is controlled. While you are at it, avoid public transportation and/or car pools, supermarkets and in store holiday shopping. All those activities might put you and others at risk. And please don't go shopping for a nice bottle of wine to enjoy with your holiday dinner."
2020-11-26 14:59,"Under the separation of church and state that I enjoy as a U.S citizen, I in fact have the right of freedom from your religion. But that comes to an end when a court nonsensically decides that a church or synagogue has the legal right to endanger my health.  From what I have read in the news, the Orthodox Jewish community has been especially unmindful of public health, regarding both Covid and measles.  If I lived near a church holding services, I would not be happy about it. 

Mr. Cuomo has been outstanding in his management of this crisis.  It is truly disgraceful that his efforts should be challenged. The court's equivalence between religious services and grocery stores does not hold water. 

Democrats, please do pack the courts, as Republicans have tried to do, and as is your constitutional right, and please begin the long process of repairing the damage left behind by Donald Trump, who has caused significant harm to this country in so many ways."
2020-11-26 14:59,"My parents are very religious people; my father is a retired minister and his father was a minister, too. But they are not physically going to a church building to worship these days—zoom seems to work quite well for them. They don’t enjoy not going to church, but they have enough common sense to realize that church gatherings are not healthy for them or their fellow worshippers. There is something weirdly immature and irresponsible about so-called religious people who have so little control over their emotions that they get upset at being asked not to do something that will harm themselves and others."

These public health restrictions particularly apply to crowds gathered together for more than 15-30 minutes, which is precisely what religious gatherings do.
This is a willful misunderstanding of the separation of church and state.

But okay.  Covid-19 will have to teach the lesson here."
2020-11-26 14:59,"I'm a member of a church that one of the Justices and his family were also members of at one time, and I can assure you that its clergy, lay leaders, and parishioners will insist on continuing their Zoom-only services until a vaccine is available and has been proven to be effective. It's called following the teachings of Christ, including loving your neighbor and community as yourself. These Justices should do a little more reading...the Constitution, the Bible, and the writings of doctors and public health officials. Maybe also get out in the world and see how few people are permitted in most liquor stores in America these days for the sake and safety of customers, workers, and their communities. It's sadly been obvious for a long time that graduates of Harvard or Yale Law Schools are not automatically blessed with wisdom or common sense."

Just disallow any indoor gathering where people are seated or standing for over 15 minutes that has more than one person per 113 square foot of space (as a starting point). 

One person at the center of a circle with radius of 6 feet (= πr(2) =  113 sq ft) will meet the current scientific standard."
2020-11-26 14:59,"Justice Alito telegraphed his feelings on this case with his recent public remarks about the court’s intrusion on religious freedom.  Unfortunately, he picked a poor case to exact vengeance for his perceived notion that religion has recently taken a back seat to other public concerns. Setting a precedent that religious gatherings trump (haha) public health concerns is dangerous to those of all faiths and to those who choose not to practice a faith. The whole idea of a government is that there is such a thing as public good.   What if the virus were Ebola or Polio, would that have changed the ruling?
If you can’t see the difference between a grocery store and a church, you are indeed ‘blind justice’."

But your local food bank, homeless shelter, etc., would be grateful too."

                  The so-called ""secular"" authorities of this country have very good reason to comprehend that large religious gatherings are breeders for Covid.   To put them on the wrong side of religion is its own kind of arrogance.

                  As a sincere Protestant Christian who is descended from a Jew and with numerous Roman Catholic relatives I have no skin in any game designed to truly persecute religion or religious people.

                  But the restrictions secular authorities have put in place for public health that include restrictions on religious observance is not in any remote sense a violation of religion, and certainly not of the will of God as I understand it."

The proposed ordinances were to be restrictions imposed for public health, the good of the broader community, not restrictions imposed with a view to limit religious freedom. The purpose of the proposed ordinances and the danger of blocking them seem to have exceeded the majority’s capacity for reason. Or perhaps their own ideological and religious beliefs canceled reason and compassion? This decision does not bode well for our future as a nation."

2020-11-26 14:53,"“The applications both said Mr. Cuomo’s restrictions violated constitutional protections for the free exercise of religion, and the one from the synagogues added that Mr. Cuomo had ‘singled out a particular religion for blame and retribution for an uptick in a societywide pandemic.’”

The reason one religion - mine by the way- has been singled out for blame and retribution is because it’s ultra orthodox members are blatantly and selfishly ignoring public health laws. Who else is having secret 7,000 person weddings? The court has become dangerously out of step with everyday Americans."
2020-11-26 15:05,"To be fair, exercise of religion in the U.S. has come down to money and politics. Whether it’s gathering together to pass the collection plate or explaining how your moral and ethical principles don’t apply to your elected officials, your church leaders, and you. Religion no longer means much to many Americans because it no longer seems to be about anything except how little other people matter to you and your particular god."
2020-11-26 15:02,"To equate church services with liquor and bicycle stores is ridiculous.  We're talking about large, stationary indoor gatherings.  The restrictions apply to theaters, concerts, etc.  They do not single out religion and are therefore not unconstitutional.  The majority opinion is politically based.  No surprise there."
2020-11-26 15:02,"Most of the commenters  probably haven't even read through the full article. 

 Cuomo reversed the order on Friday, probably because he knew perfectly well it was unconstitutional.  But petitioners asked the court to rule anyway.  Consider that casinos could be 25% full but churches could only have 25 people in the entire church no matter how enormous.  As another commenter noted, it was pretty much a first reaction response by Cuomo similar to Trump's Muslim ban that was never going to be upheld."
2020-11-26 15:08,"Freedom of religion is a fundamental right. Like it or not. Any limitations in the freedom to practice one’s religion by a state actor must be narrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest. While the government does have a compelling interest to protect public health, these blanket efforts to restrict attendance at religious services are not narrowly tailored. This was the right decision."
2020-11-26 14:44,"In other news, soon you will be able to falsely yell fire in a crowded theater. As long as your religion calls for it.

2020-11-26 15:05,"Through the years certain  Constitutional rights have been curtailed to benefit the greater good. A most prominent example is how, despite the right to Free Speech, you may not yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater when there is none.

What we have here is an attempt by local government to limit the spread of The Virus which infects and kills thousands of people every day. It seems to me that preventing such spread and the resulting sickness and death supercedes peoples' right to gather in crowds for religious purposes or otherwise. Let us note that by attending religious gatherings it is not only the attendees who may get infected, sick and die, it is also the people they come into contact with. Don't they have rights too? 

What we have today is merely an interim order. I hope the Supreme Court justices, who meet remotely at present so they don't get sick, when this is fully litigated, will come to their senses and leave this call up to the States."
2020-11-26 14:58,"We don't need the government to legislate measures for us. We all have brains and should think for ourselves. We can choose not to attend church now whether the courts restrict it or not. It's called taking personal responsibility. We have the choice to wear masks, use hand sanitizer, and socially distance. And most of us don't go to church regularly anymore anyway. Let's stop constantly blaming the government and remind ourselves that Americans can do a lot to slow the spread of the virus on their own."

Common sense would have seen SCOTUS side with the short-term restrictions enacted as a public health measure but it seems that dogma trumps common sense!

Or bring Muslims from barred countries as an act of generosity. Or maybe the Jewish families of the people on the St Louis could have accepted them on behalf of the synagogues. Wonder what the Court would say about Presidential power in those cases

What about my religion allows abortion in specific circumstances. 

What a farce the Supreme Court and Republicans make of the idea of religious freedom. The First Amendment goes to lengths to keep government out of religion and religion out of government. It’s the separation that gives us the freedom not the infusion of religious organizations positions into government policy. 

Democrats should respond as this decision is an attack on religious freedom, not that religious freedom. 

Once again, we are letting the Republicans decide the language of the argument. We have to stop that. 
This is an attack on religious freedom for many reasons. One reason is that the SCOTUS put a wedge in the country’s divisions on behalf of religious ideology and did not have the guts to sign the decision. 

Of course it is an attack on the health of the people in a State that is a world example in controlling the pandemic but it is occurring by fusing religious force into the government."

Would this group of conservative judges decide that restricting this is unconstitutional? Unconstitutional on the basis of ""freedom of religion"" and the ""Second Amendment""? Why not?

They just made this decision. Churches and ministers who held weddings and church services in Maine without observing the Maine CDC and state precautions and requirements became super spreaders of covid19 in our state. People died both from initial contact and traced contact to places like nursing homes.

This decision is irresponsible. Justice Robert's is correct. He may have considered Maine's experience since he has a house in Maine."
2020-11-26 15:03,The court could have come up with a solution to the real reason the churches took these suits to the Supreme Court: a collection box chained to the front door or perhaps a drive through version. The arguments they used were more about business than tending to the flock. Telling.
2020-11-26 15:03,"If the State cannot tell the Church to restrict gatherings during a pandemic (recklessly endangering the lives of all citizens within that community), then we cannot let the Church interfere with the State upholding the rights of women to determine their own health care needs. Fair is fair. Under this Supreme Court we can expect the Church to get all kinds of benefits, which means we need to make it abundantly clear to the Church that those benefits WILL NOT extend to their legislating the lives of those outside their domain."
2020-11-26 15:01,The Supreme Court’s new majority has announced that the Constitution makes preserving religious observance more important than preserving human life.

I am genuinely surprised to see Justice Barrett's role play out so quickly.  It is a wake up call and evidence that precedent will not bind this ultra-conservative branch of government.  I truly hope the CJ Roberts can have his colleagues realize that they are headed for disaster if they continue to issue decisions that are so out of step with the vast majority of the country.  

I hope I am wrong, but this seems to be another step towards  giving people license to violate federal and state law in the name of religion.  We've already seen it in the Hobby Lobby case, and I can't see it getting better any time soon."
2020-11-26 15:05,"The Justices should read the Op Ed in this paper written this morning by the Pope.

Where the courts have drawn the line however, is when their members deny care to minor children. In those cases members have been prosecuted criminally and civilly when care has been foregone and it resulted in harm. 

This case is similar. The problem, as always, is when one group’s constitutional rights interfere with another group’s rights. This is not a case of religious freedom, it’s a case of religion being used as a shield to violate everyone else’s health and safety."

2020-11-26 15:15,"As usual, commenters don't seem to understand how the US government works.  The purpose of the Supreme Court is not to decide which policies are good or bad;  rather it is to decide which laws or regulations comport with the law and the Constitution.  Commenters invariably substitute their opinion of what is good policy, for what is legal.

The problem here is actually with the First Amendment, because religion can be anything.  The founders were concerned about religious discrimination and a state church, but the idea that you can do anything you like as long as it's in the name of religion, is unlikely to be something they had in mind, nor should we. 

""Free exercise"" does not, for example, include the right to human sacrifice.  However, when ""laws"" are made by autocrats, not by legislatures, as governors all over the country have been doing -- arguably legally under public health statutes -- a problem ensues when relgious gatherings that are an exercise of First Amendment rights are treated differently than BLM ""protests"" which are also an exercise of First Amendment rights.  At that point, there is Consitutional damage."

""And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. . .  Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him."" (Matthew 6:5-8)"

The obvious danger of congregating in large super-spreader groups for extended periods, masked (or unmasked), could be easily resolved by holding services of 5-10 people for 5 minutes in all liquor/grocery/bike shops.

2020-11-26 15:16,"The conservative wing of the Court made a terrible decision.  This is a public health emergency, not a civil rights or religious liberty issue.  The irresponsibility of religious leaders who flout common sense and the public interest in general should not be allowed to endanger the rest of us with their super spreader conduct.  If  a religion's  tenents embraced human sacrifice, it would not be tolerated in our society as an older Court ruling held that religious practice (in that case involving bigamy) cannot violate ""the positive law"". On a less dramatic scale, allowing unlimited attendance at churches and synagogues in the face of a real and deadly public health emergency violates the public safety. Reasonable restrictions on religious groups who show little concern about the public health in general is a far cry from restricting religion.  These restrictions should not even have been necessary.  Religious leaders, as moral examples for their followers, should have imposed these restrictions on themselves."

Discussing the COVID-19 pandemic the Pope writes: ""With some exceptions, governments have made great efforts to put the well-being of their people first, acting decisively to protect health and to save lives. The exceptions have been some governments that shrugged off the painful evidence of mounting deaths, with inevitable, grievous consequences. But most governments acted responsibly, imposing strict measures to contain the outbreak.

Yet some groups protested, refusing to keep their distance, marching against travel restrictions — as if measures that governments must impose for the good of their people constitute some kind of political assault on autonomy or personal freedom! Looking to the common good is much more than the sum of what is good for individuals. It means having a regard for all citizens and seeking to respond effectively to the needs of the least fortunate.

It is all too easy for some to take an idea — in this case, for example, personal freedom — and turn it into an ideology, creating a prism through which they judge everything."""

(They might fervently believe that their collective prayer is protective.) 

But, this is a public health issue. As a result of their private choices, they may affect others who are unable to make an informed choice – because of limited legal capacity (children…) or unawareness (those who share their air in grocery stores, elevators, public transportation, schools…). 

Should such religious practitioners quarantine after engaging in such voluntary practices, as though they had traveled from a hot spot state (zip code)? Or form communes with like-minded people?

2020-11-26 15:16,"Judge Gorsuch compares the treatment of houses of worship to bike shops during the pandemic. This is a misdirection, the real comparison is to how theaters and movie houses are treated as they operate on a similar model. The restrictions are not across the board but based on the local infection rate and their flexibility is essential to their reasonableness."
2020-11-26 15:18,"We conflate religion with morality when history is rife with cruel and bloodstained examples to the contrary. In primitive societies the prevailing spiritual beliefs played a necessary role in promoting social cohesion. We no longer live in such societies and the US in particular with its history of welcoming a diverse and gifted array of immigrants to its shores does not possess only one single religion. It never did. This is why freedom of religious practice needs protection. 

But religion is not a prime value. A person can be kind and highly moral without the scaffolding of religious belief. 

And there are limits to the scope of permissible practices, just as there are limits to all personal freedoms. It is a truism that no personal freedom can be exercised without constraint if it poses a material risk to the health and well-being of others. 

The provisions of the US Constitution have come to assume all the trappings of a religion. A common feature of religions is that their principles or dogma should not be questioned. Yet in fact religious beliefs continue to be challenged and refined. It is the only way they can survive and continue to serve society. It was once an acceptable religious practice for people who offended against prevailing beliefs to be burnt at the stake. Should the US Constitution protect such practices?  

Limiting the spread of the virus is necessary to protect the broader community. The Supreme Court should support this, not undermine it."

There are restrictions to attendance based on local rates of infection, not complete shutdowns. Perhaps he might be better suited to a job as a right-wing pundit.

Now, if houses of worship want to tend to more of their flock, maybe they should hold more services for them. If first responders have to work round the clock, why not their spiritual counterparts who are making their jobs all the harder?"

If these people, both those involved with this lawsuit and those who feel their personal liberties somehow are being undully infringed, or worse it is a hoax all lived in an isolated state, or county I say fine let them walk around blithely ingnorant to science and infect themselves and their fellow believers and suffer any consequences, even up to and including death!

Clearly, arch conservatism requires a mystical aspect to justify it as a credo, making greed, viciousness, and bloody mindedness aspects of godliness. A church provides an innocuous enough place to root political and business networks regardless of the fact that Jesus expelled the merchants from the temple. If religion was ever removed from conservatism, it would collapse under its own crushing immorality.

This decision is so narrow in its scope, diminishing all other considerations regarding public health and civic life, that it can only have an ideological purpose. America might do well to renegotiate its relationship with God before it can heal itself. 

Biden referred to God in his speech yesterday which was incongruous too. Before God can be used as a reason for anything, He, She, or It had better be fully scientifically, culturally, and philosophically understood for what the entity or universal force represents.

Here are some things to try:
Fine people who don’t wear masks 
Extend shopping hours in all stores , to spread out the crowds 
Study the Asian model of indoor dining 
Anything done outside is obviously safer, create more outdoors shopping ventures
Scan foreheads for fever before entering subway stations or malls  , very easy to do.

The pastors have installed hand sanitizers at the entrances and have ensured Churches are cleaned and sanitized after Masses. A tremendous amount of time has been devoted, as well as resources and expense, to enforce these strict requirements to help ensure the safety of all.”

Instead of an hour+-long service sitting in close proximity, a church service could be redesigned to be a walk-through - 'church in the time of COVID.'

For a deadly airborne virus I can't think of anything worse.

These Conservative Justices applied a test to contexts that can be compared only by deliberately disregarding both the obvious differences between what people do in a retail store versus a house of worship, and what those differences mean for the public's health and safety. 

In wielding their new majority power to achieve a kind of gross adjustment in some imagined, historical balance between Liberal and Conservative jurisprudence, these Justices have effectively applied the imprimatur of legitimacy to Trump's shamelessly partisan rejection of reality based in science, empirical evidence, and critical thinking. 

But what ultimately matters most is not the Court's sham, rhetorical-logical justification for a transparently partisan outcome.  What matters most is the effect of this outrageous abnegation of responsibility to the innocent men, women, and children whose lives are literally in the hands of these partisan Justices.

While I am generally a strong defender of Governor Cuomo's policies with respect to Covid -- I have become somewhat uncomfortable with NYS's concept of ""microclusters"" with designations by neighborhoods of Orange, Yellow and Red ""zones"" -- each with varying restrictions that are more severe than non-designated areas.

I applaud the State on the massive database it has obtained via broad Covid testing -- but remain uncomfortable with the use of the data to so narrowly target parts of the State for separate treatment.

Clearly this separation (segregation?) lies at the very edge of discriminatory treatment by the State based on location.  Location that is itself in New York (particularly NYC) often defined by ethnicity, race or even religion.

That said, the SCOTUS could have recognized the unique situation posed by Covid to reach an alternative conclusion under the rubric: ""The Constitution is not a suicide pact....""

I would urge the Governor and his advisors to consider alternative ways of dealing with congregate restrictions on religion institutions.

Firstly, of course, call for voluntary limitations with particular recognition for compliant churches, synagogues and mosques etc.

Second, with more worrisome implications, extend the legal restrictions Statewide so that the State is not ""picking and choosing"" between religious sites.

In fact, (1) we sign up in advance to ensure we don't exceed the per person limits set by applicable federal and local guidance and to permit proper contact tracing (should it be needed; it hasn't), (2) we are socially distanced (our policy is 8 feet, not 6), (3) we wear masks, (4) we do not sing (indeed, we shorten parts of the service that we are permitted by Jewish law to shorten), (5) we disinfect after each service, and (6) we utilize our outdoor space when we can and provide proper ventilation when we are inside. Many of our policies are more stringent than the government's guidelines. Aside from Saturday morning, when the service might be a bit longer, the services are relatively short; shorter than the time an average person shops at the supermarket. My synagogue is not an outlier -- many, many synagogues in New York (and elsewhere) currently operate in a similar manner. I don't say this in an attempt to persuade anyone to think differently about the Supreme Court's opinion than you do (although I do encourage everyone to read the Justices' opinions rather than rely on an article about it). I say this to provide some perspective to those of you who may have notions that differ from many of our actual service experiences."
2020-11-26 15:26,"There has never been a restriction on the practice of religion or one's ability to choose one's religion.  The scientific evidence is that ""houses of worship"" are a clear and present danger to the spread and lethality of CoViD19; bike shops and liquor stores are not."
2020-11-26 15:21,"When Justice Sandra Day O’Conner joined the Court she was known as a conservative. By the time she retired the Court had moved so far to the Right she was now a centrist. 

This is now happening to Chief Justice Roberts, O’Conner’s successor (the irony!). He is often voting with the liberal bloc not because he’s a liberal but because the court has moved to the far right—to the right of Roberts. 

This is why the Democrats, should they win the two senate seats in January, would do well to balance the Court. Otherwise the next 20 years will be a lot like this decision."
2020-11-26 15:36,"The ruling is correct and long overdue. I'm an atheist but the overall restrictions around the pandemic are increasingly arbitrary (why 10 people and not 15?). 

At this point, 8 months after the initial outbreak, individual rights should not be denied without due process. We cannot allow year-long unquestioned emergency powers allowing a mayor or governor to dictate how we conduct our lives."
2020-11-26 15:31,"Fine, you choose to attend a crowded religious service, and risk infection with Covid19. Then when you get sick, Instead of an ambulance taking you to an ICU funded by public money and private insurance premiums, how about we take you to a big tent where you can be healed by religion: no fancy drugs or immune therapy needed for you, just the laying on of hands. That way you get the freedom to worship even when you are dying of Covid, and the rest of us don’t have to pay for your choice."
2020-11-26 15:17,So churches sue so they can have more of their congregation die quicker? That's not quite how I read the bible.
2020-11-26 15:33,"You go to a liquor store, buy your booze, and leave. You don't stay in there for an hour or more, singing, shouting, and praising. Ditto for bike shops. Gorsuch's comparison is terrible, the ruling a danger to public health."
2020-11-26 15:38,"Religious freedom is a fundamental right and as such the SCOTUS decision is no surprise. Just as the Warren Court moved to more expanded interpretations of the US Constitution the Robert's court is moving to narrower understandings. Not being a Constitutional scholar, or attorney I find myself pondering a couple of issues. I believe each individual has the right to make their own decisions regarding their personal freedoms. The first issue where do those rights stop and start? The second issue, if the practice of individual rights and beliefs results in harm, i.e. exposure to a life ending virus, and subsequent death what is the consequence? Personal responsibility can not be legislated by the legislative branch or imposed by the judiciary or executive branches of government, at least not in Mr. Jefferson's model of democracy."
2020-11-26 15:25,"What has been lost in all this is that no governmental body is telling people they cannot worship. People are simply subject to a temporary time, place and manner restriction that saves lives.  As superspreader events in churches in Oregon, Washington, and elsewhere show, having people in close proximity for extended periods, with singing and chanting, is like lighting a match to dry timber.  People can worship by zoom, as our truly Christian friends who value others’ lives have done, or privately at home.  Just like any other constitutional right, freedom of religious expression shouldn’t give anyone carte blanche to infect or kill others. If a church and its parishioners opt to do that now that we have a religious zealot in the Court who has tipped the balance, then the rest of us should be entitled to sue them out of existence for the damages they cause."
2020-11-26 15:24,"I started to enter my local food store in Bethesda MD, on Monday--just outside DC-- and was firmly but politely told that I had to get on line and maintain social distancing. It was explained to me there was a limit on the number of customers allowed in the store at any time to reduce Covid transmission! I have encountered the same in other businesses. So the argument of the SCOTUS conservative justices is nonsense! Places other than houses of worship are also restricting the numbers gathering within them just up the street from the Supreme Court building. Our SCOTUS justices should start doing some of the food shopping for their families. It would awaken them to some of the real world and might give them some common sense!"
2020-11-26 15:20,"In the big picture, it's difficult to segregate church from mall, or church from bar, or church from schools, or church from a council hall, or church from Congress, or church from a hockey rink, or church from public transit, or church from a public building.  Unfortunately, if one is closed they should all be closed.  Selecting one place over the other is bias.  Inconsistency over fairness is disruptive."
2020-11-26 15:33,So.... Can Cuomo instate rules to limit gatherings to protect public health or not I am not clear about this now? Can he mandate masks and require social distance? This ruling seems crazy.
2020-11-26 15:40,"I am perplexed by Gov. Cuomo's action.  There is no reason to treat churches differently from other places.

In California, where I live, all businesses, in particular grocery stores, must restrict the number of people present, this number depending on floor space.  Restrictions are enforced by the by counters at the entrance and exit.  When a business has reached capacity the counter at the entrance allows someone to enter only when the counter another person has left.  In small stores, patrons enforce similar rules on themselves voluntarily.

Hopefully this doesn't tell you what you know already."
2020-11-26 15:40,"I am a healthcare worker in an elder care facility. I have personally cared for many patients who died from COVID , and continue to comfort patients and families who are dealing with the multitudinous losses this pandemic has ravaged on them and their loved ones. 

We need a class action suit to fight for OUR liberties- our rights to not to put ourselves and all those around us at continual risk of death and devastation. 

Religious services with congregants in indoor spaces, singing, potentially unmasked, infringe on my right to live, and the rights of those I care for both to live and to thrive."
2020-11-26 15:34,"There is a reason for Amy Barrett. She is trump's safe 5th vote. When the case of whether he can pardon himself reaches the court, he is depending on those 5.  They don't govern by the existing law. They are making new law and we couldn't be in worse hands."
2020-11-26 15:28,"Any person who attends a large gathering, whether in a synagog , church, hockey rink or bar, and who becomes ill with COVID should be denied medical care in hospitals struggling to deal with the pandemic. The families of people who die due to exposure to the virus from people who attend super spreader events should be able to to bring charges of murder.
Ironic how the pro-life Justices are ensuring that there will be many more deaths to come due to such large gatherings."
2020-11-26 15:35,This is a good test to see if the church you attend cares for the congregation or not.  Clearly it is not wise to have many people in an enclosed space for an extended period of time during a worsening pandemic.  That is just science.
2020-11-26 15:23,"Few rights are unconditional. The Constitution is not a suicide pact.  I've never been in a bike store or a liquor store with hundreds of people.  Even if the consequences of the religious observers' actions were limited to them, I'd still be concerned with effects on our healthcare system.  This is bloc preference in action on the court, ignoring the health of the population. This is primitive; as are all raw power plays."
2020-11-26 15:40,"What a goof decision. If you are going to shutter churches then next ought to be liquor stores, fitness centers, businesses, and on and on. There is a bias by some against religion, and thankfully the SCOTUS is bringing that pendulum back to a sensible and prudent place."
2020-11-26 15:37,"The Inquisition has come back to the United States and has infested our Supreme Court.
The Catholic religion lead by its extreme conservative leadership, along with the Hassidic Jews leadership and Evangelicals, have for years relentlessly worked on breaking all rules of separation of church and state.
Their hypocrisy is not hidden anymore behind close church doors, it is now brought into the daylight by the most extreme Supreme Court in modern history.
The latest addition to the Court, a Catholic Cult member (as noted in many newspapers and in media),  installed there  by indoctrinations of extremist Catholic bishops and cardinals, extremist Jewish religious leaders and Evangelicals, has succeeded to fully destroy the impartiality of the Supreme Court.

Already on the verge of losing its impartiality by Catholic members of the Trump cult, Barr, Pompeo and others, the Supreme Court is not defending the Constitution anymore.
President elect Joe Biden has no other choice than to increase the amount of Supreme Court members to 15."

They shouldn't judge with past agendas against today's (and tomorrow's) people."
2020-11-26 15:43,"Let's not make more of this decision than it is.  The issue is not that no restrictions should be applied to gatherings at houses of worship, but that any restrictions be commensurate with those applied elsewhere.  So if dining is allowed at 25% capacity, so should gatherings for weddings, as long as defined safety measures such as masking, cleaning, ventilation and separation can be enforced."

2020-11-26 15:47,"The Supreme Court has issued a flawed and sharply divided decision to prevent the State of New York from limiting the size of attendance in a church. New York’s order was not an effort to reduce religious freedom. It was to follow established protocols of public health experts. For the health of the overall society. That’s what governments do. Our Constitution does not confer unlimited rights. We have freedom of speech in the First Amendment but we cannot yell “FIRE” in a crowded theater. 

The purposes of government include maintenance of a social order, providing public services, providing national protection and making national economic decisions. 

I pray that this wrongly decided Supreme Court decision is not the start of a series of 5-4 decisions that twist the law and erode society. But I fear this is the start of a political and ideological court that no longer has lady justice wear a blindfold. And that should trouble every American regardless of political beliefs."

2020-11-26 15:27,The catholic church should self impose restrictions if there is any care for human life. the fact that the Diocese would even pursue this legally is the real question here. Why would any religion want to gather people in packed halls for hours in the middle of a pandemic?   As for ACB and the gang of five they only care about fetuses  not actual people or the planet so no surprises there.
2020-11-26 15:30,The Supreme Court decision will certainly guarantee religious freedom over public health. The result? Thousands of people permitted to attend Americans dying from Covid. This should keep funeral homes humming.

2020-11-26 15:32,"We have too many hyper-religious people anyway. Let them get sick, while we stay inside. The SCOTUS shouldn't be restricting my right to safely go outside, though."
2020-11-26 15:28,"Natural selection is playing out in front of our eyes. It’s unfortunate that this ruling will play a part and affect people who have nothing to do with a super-spreader church. 

An omnipotent God can be worshiped from home."
2020-11-26 15:27,"The lawsuit and the ruling by the court show very clearly that neither group believes in science.  This is a sad day for humankind.  
For if the religious leaders truly believed in the corona virus and the science behind minimizing it's effects they would understand the danger not only to their groups but to the rest of the population at large.  This ruling will result in the deaths of thousands of human beings in the US and likely worldwide.
So maybe for groups who believe that the ""lord works in mysterious ways"" this is his way of saying goodbye.  His way of diminishing the number of people who use his teachings for their own evil purposes.  
Because this action will accelerate the decrease in the numbers of religious zealots in the US, and in the long run make them less relevant to our nation and world. 
And that is a good thing for all of mankind and womankind."
2020-11-26 15:26,"This is the most ridiculous decision I have ever read - comparing church services to buying alcohol at a liquor store? Really?

I think the religious right has lost it’s mind.  What’s next - legalizing human sacrifice?  Oh wait, they’ve already done that with capital punishment.  Our current attorney general, an ostensibly religious man, has signed an order allowing states to determine methods of execution, such as electrocution and in Utah’s case, firing squad, if the drugs needed for execution are unavailable.  How about hanging or crucifixion?  Just so they get those five felons killed before they lose the opportunity to exact vengeance.  Thought that was the Lord’s job, but what do I know?  

Good luck to the congregants.  I guess they are true believers who envision admission to paradise as a palatable alternative to what we’re enduring now.  Or maybe they think they’ll be raised from the dead.  As someone who has been raised from the dead - went into cardiac arrest and had CPR administered to restart my heart- I’d like to tell them that it’s no piece of cake.  Bruises, stabbing rib pain that endures for months and a lasting awareness of one’s mortality are part of the bargain."

2020-11-26 14:59,"There was a case in Oregon last spring of a super spreader church service in La Grande.  The NYT should do an article documenting where church services have led to super spreader events.  Maybe compare these to other non-church related super spreader events.  Does freedom of religion trump freedom of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?"
2020-11-26 15:51,"Two bads here. A 10-person limit on a congregation over 200 is unreasonable. Better to restrict by percentage, then it would be clear that the religious group could schedule, for example, three 35% services, social distancing instead of 100% packed cheek to jowl. This should not be an insurmountable burden to religious practice, but still protect against infection.

For the Supreme Court to ignore the health consequences of unrestricted meetings of large congregations is misguided at best."
2020-11-26 14:54,"Intriguing logic. This seems to run counter to what a Supreme Court so deftly packed with religious zealots would want. 

The go-along-to-get-along parishioners will give mass a pass because of Covid, but the truly devout will turn up, infect each other, and some will die, thereby reducing and weakening the congregation.

Own goal."

What an abomination of a justice and decision that undermines the importance of society's laws intended to protect the many from the few who can injure our health and our economy. We are now living in an anti-science, anti-society, only me and my selfish beliefs are paramount. A day to mourn, not for Thanksgiving. Very sad and very uncivilized."
2020-11-26 15:16,"So the Supreme Court has decided that a constitutional amendment the guarantees freedom of religion also allows  churches to be exempt from public health  measures that protect all the citizens. 

So  can churches now discharge sewage in the street, disregard food safety rules in their kitchens, ignore zoning rules and building codes?

They are not protecting religions as much as giving them special privilege."

If all, then how will we define a religion?  Next, this ruling sets the stage for religious law or preference to overrule civil law.  This then becomes a religious court using religious law, hence we have a rabbinical, papal or even sharia leaning legal system.  Where does the limit of religious freedom end?  What if there is not agreement between many different religions, which takes precedent?  There was a fundamental reason that there is a separation clause in the constitution, are we abandoning it?  Finally, we are on a path toward punishment for not following religious rules, such as imprisoning those performing abortions or selling birth control measures.

So much for Love thy neighbor. Infecting and killing them is simply a Constitutional right."
2020-11-26 15:23,"According to Alito’s reasoning, there can be no restrictions on the “free exercise of religion.”  It doesn’t take a Constitutional scholar to see the potential peril in applying such a sweeping view of the First Amendment.

However, a church of 25 people was ordered never to meet. The church was the ""loser."" Other businesses were nitpicked--golf courses, gyms, bowling alleys, etc. The local store was closed but Walmart was open to selling everything. A lobbyist group would approach the Governor's office and get their activity deemed ""essential.""

I am quite sure their freedom of free exercise was never intended to endow them with special privileges to be a public menace endangering MY health and life.

All it ever meant was to acknowledge every person's right to believe as they may choose and to profess their belief without fear of governmental reprisal for it.  Profess does not include license to spread disease and death.

We need to impeach Judges that see their ideology scribed between the lines of the constitution -- never meant to be reduced to its literally ultimate irrational absurdity.

As far as I can tell only one verse of new testament scripture suggests that the god is more inclined to visit itself upon a group, of as few as two, than upon a single applicant: Matthew 18:20 - § For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.

No more are necessary.  Any claim otherwise is presumptuous elaboration of the plain text, therefore heresy."

These might include regulations on labor, civil rights and discrimination, health and safety, wages and retirement, taxes, etc.  This is in addition to further restrictions on abortion and family planning.

And with Mitch McConnell as Senate Majority Leader, there is nothing that anyone can do about it.

Welcome to the world of the Supreme Religious Court!"
2020-11-26 15:49,"The pertinent language of the First Amendment states: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;...."" The orders and conditions at issue here are LOCAL, not federal, emergency regulations issued to protect public health during an extraordinary circumstance -- a world wide pandemic of a deadly disease.  ""Congress"" has nothing to do with it.  There are a long series of federal and Supreme Court cases distinguishing between emergency public health protections and ordinary legislative actions. Further, nothing in the regulations prohibits religious worship nor specifies its conduct.  The regulations deal with the numbers of people congregated for any purpose and apply to these churches and synagogues because of the SIZE of the assembly and its duration.  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FEDERALIST MANIA FOR ADHERING TO THE ""PLAIN MEANING"" OF THE CONSTITUTION AS UNDERSTOOD BY THE FRAMERS!  These christian theocrats intend to return life to the cozy days when patriarchy and religious bigotry ruled; watch how fast those synagogues close then."
2020-11-26 15:36,"You couldn't see this coming, could you?

People can gather in the name of religion and put other people's health and life in jeopardy by thwarting efforts to curtail the virus.

Conflating churches with liquor stores and bike shops with churches is specious. Religious gatherings are much more like theatres or concerts than they are like commercial transactions. In this case, the rules for them are more stringent than for religious gatherings. 

Justice Sonia Sotomayor and the lower courts got it right, but she is now in the minority."
2020-11-26 15:51,"In this decision, it appears the Supreme Court majority is eager to assert its deference to religion, at the expense of common sense and public safety."
2020-11-26 15:52,"Gorsuch, presuming his opinion reflects the majority's rationale, has the Justices making public health policy from the bench.  But they are not elected nor are they public health experts."
2020-11-26 15:42,"I believe in a universal intelligence that gives us doctors, nurses, therapists and care workers. Formalized religion that puts simple words on existence instead of following the  obvious gifts provided by care and love leads to fear and hurt. If  we are all one, why would we hurt ourselves for words?"
2020-11-26 15:51,"It is clear from the Supreme court ruling against NY curtailing religious gatherings, that freedom of religion is more important than for the society to be free from disease. 

This harkens back to time when religion dictated governance. 

It is unfortunate that our highest court in the land has clearly stated that our country is bound to religion more than it is bound to science. 

This just scratches the surface as to the damage to our society a conservative court will do."
2020-11-26 15:42,"Thank goodness for Justice Amy Coney Barrett. She is the justice that made all the difference in this ruling happening for religious folks. Religious freedom and liberty are very important especially at this very difficult and trying time in our country. Many people need their faith and religious practice and the supreme court made the right choice by allowing churches to remain open. Those who want to attend must be allowed to but no one forces those to attend who do not want to be there. 

I have been back to church and I am so glad that I have that choice. I need my Catholic faith and no one will ever take that away from me. Nor should anyone else have theirs taken away either. This is guaranteed by our constitution and hopefully that will never change.￼"
2020-11-26 15:51,"With freedom comes responsibility.  No freedom includes the right to endanger others. When those, who in the name of freedom, act  irresponsibly towards others, they are in effect violating the freedom of those they endanger.  It's time for Americans to understand the meaning of the word.  Jean Paul Sartre pointed to the danger of defending ""freedom"" until there is nothing left of it."
2020-11-26 15:40,"I am thinking back to the Eisenhower 50s and the first half of the 1960s, when the New York City Fire Department often ""visited""  small theaters where Lenny Bruce or ""subversive"" experimental films were playing and forced them to close because of building code violations. I'd bet that many houses of worship are not up to today's DoB codes governing egress, ventilation, rules of safe assembly. The mayor and the governor should enforce these regulations. Time to play hardball with those endangering not only their own lives but those of all New Yorkers.  Once a building is shut, it is would be impossible to reopen without costly alterations. Perhaps that possibility would make the patriarchs of religion think twice about violating simple public health rules."
2020-11-26 15:31,"So, there you have it: the first decision impacted directly by the court packing of McConnell and the Federalist Society, ignoring stare decisis as irrelevant. (And as noted, echoing Alito’s imprudent screed to the Federalist Society just a month ago.)"
2020-11-26 15:45,"Why do they have to fight everything?  They have no tolerance and no respect for civil authority or for the health and welfare of the society in which they live. Nor do they have the kind of faith that, in the face of a pandemic, is strong enough to forego collective service.  Their continual court battles rest on the ""right"" they assert to disrespect others and their ""right"" to harm others.  It  belies their so-called belief in a loving God who calls on us to respect and love each other -- that which I did for the least of my brothers is alien to them."
2020-11-26 15:29,"It’s heartbreaking watching commenters here make arguments based on science, logic, and facts, when the new religious conservative majority on the court has sadly revealed itself to be governed by none of the above."
2020-11-26 15:33,"I don't see why it matters. If people want to congregate, even when they have been told it could be harmful to them if they do, why should anyone care if they go ahead and do it? I understand that governors have a public safety goal, but you can only do so much. If a bunch of people get COVID because they crowded into a church, I don't think it's any concern of mine. I don't want religious people telling me how to live, and I don't care how they live."
2020-11-26 15:46,"I'm wondering which religious leader will be the first to sue when one of their congregants is denied admission to the hospital, which is overflowing with COVID patients.

Yeah, yeah, they have rights.  The most exercised of these seems to be to do wrong by their communities."
2020-11-26 15:48,"Wow. Putting religious freedom above public health speaks to greater concern about the afterlife than the suffering to be endured by those trying to survive in the present. 

This latest decision signals religious ‘freedom’ will be a cornerstone principle of future SCOTUS rulings. Knowing this, conservative religious groups and advocates will try to flood the federal courts with new cases to expand the boundaries of religious primacy as far as possible. So begins our march to a theocratic state. 

Anyone doubt Roe v Wade will soon fall? Susan Collins, any thoughts or regrets?"
2020-11-26 15:37,"This is absurd. COVID is not going to distinguish between a gathering in a religious space versus a restaurant, bar, or gym. I am Jewish and have celebrated this year’s most important holidays—Passover, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur— on zoom. It’s what we should all do this year if we truly care about our communities. I will happily continue not to gather with others in my community to protect them and myself as long as necessary."
2020-11-26 15:40,There's a reason that more and more people are shunning organized religion. It's pretty sad that the make-up of SCOTUS isn't representative of of the nation's demographic.
2020-11-26 15:53,The Supreme Court is supposed to weigh Constitutional issues which in this case is a no brainer and yet four justices decided forget what the 1st Amendment because of a health emergency. What's next martial law?
2020-11-26 15:32,"I guess we should not be surprised when religious tradition trumps scientific truths: ask Galileo.  I suspect that this false dichotomy is not going to do any favors to religious groups who go down this all-too-well-trodden path, as many will take note of who refuses to take common sense, temporary measures in order to save lives.  

This should not be an issue: public health as a profession is a direct outgrowth of religious traditions and the care for human life that came with it. Why have certain religious bodies forgotten this? You cannot sustainably care for the social needs of a flock if your actions result in killing off some of its members."
2020-11-26 15:39,"The people of the religious world that have flaunted guidelines with little concern for their fellow citizens is shocking and disappointing. I was equally disappointed seeing thousands of people across America dancing together face to face in the streets after the Biden win. Many of them maskless as captured in the photographs of your own paper yet I heard of no outcry or concern for any of them. let's try and be consistent here people. the hypocrisy shows and it's hard for me to take any argument for ""concern for life"" seriously until you are concerned for all lives and restrict all social gatherings of comparable size equally without bias. Many of the comments and support here show at best a disdain for religion or outright hostility. this I believe is why the courts are pushing back. it has little to do with this actual case but everything to do with the increase in hostility towards religion."
2020-11-26 15:46,"This might help Joe Biden with his decision to pack the court ( if the people of Georgia come through with a touchdown). The same day he’s on a tv begging Americans to unite in defeating the virus by following the good advice of trained physicians, Supreme Court justices are putting up roadblocks to that very effort.

It’s reprehensible."
2020-11-26 15:50,"A congregate setting, where people talk and sing out loud in unison for a long period of time is a far cry from any other kind of experience in a store or shop. This decision is just another confirmation that non- liberal decisions of the Supreme Court are anti-science. The justices not in dissent may as well have said,  ""Sending our prayers, sorry for your future losses"" on the way out of the chambers."
2020-11-26 15:41,"Once the judges become clerics, the theocracy will have begun."
2020-11-26 15:46,"Seems like a poison pill ruling, which only this inept and Federalist Society driven scotus could come up with. Freedom of religion has nothing to do with crowd size. No one was keeping people from cracking open a Bible, the Torah, the Koran, etc. No one was preventing prayer or mantras or whatever. 

Gov. Cuomo was seeking to limit crowd size during this killer pandemic to minimize risk of transmission. But it would appear that further efforts to limit crowd size in other venues for other reasons will fall because of this brainless ruling. Watch for it. Meanwhile, wear masks, wash hands, distance, and avoid venues where unlimited sized crowds may gather. Stay safe this winter."
2020-11-26 15:53,"I am sick & tired of ""religious freedom"" getting special exceptions within our country. Churches don't pay taxes and are allowed to disregard basic health rules, and then ask for special political exceptions. If religious institutions want a seat at the political table - pay up!!"
2020-11-26 15:56,"Consistency in applying the law is important.  DiBlasio and Cuomo’s actions have seem targeted to certain groups, and restrictions have not been applied to protests and demonstrations.  This decision seems appropriate in that it protects freedom of assembly with respect to religion, much as freedom to protest has been recognized and protected."
2020-11-26 15:53,"Does this ruling inadvertently create a future legal loophole?  If a pregnant woman attends church during a pandemic, gets sick, and has a miscarriage, has she committed abortion, a practice we know these very same justices wish to make illegal?  Abortion bad; reckless endangerment (manslaughter) OK?  If this was an ebola pandemic, would this ruling have been different?  Perhaps the Catholic zealots, sorry, I meant conservative legal scholars, on the bench can better explain why ignorance of the law can never be an excuse for criminal behavior but ignorance of science can.  If they wish to rely on the mysterious workings of God, what exactly do we need a court for?"
2020-11-26 16:00,"This seems like a perfect time to remove the tax-exemption status of religious institutions. If they don’t want to play by the rules, then why should they be an exception to the tax law?"
2020-11-26 16:01,"This sort of decision does make one wonder what may happen if the Supreme Court becomes composed entirely of ""originalists"", such that all future decisions will be based on the actual wording of the Constitution as written 250 years ago. 

Mysticism triumphs over reason and science, aided and abetted by our right honorable Justices."
2020-11-26 16:02,"Two items. Interesting how most SC decisions take the better part of a year. This one seems to have been produced in a few days.
Time to activate the court packing plan and overcome the Amy effect as early as possible, before too much damage is done by unelected judges with lifetime appointments."
2020-11-26 16:04,"we need to  be careful to keep focused on the the specific issues under examination by the Supreme Court. Rights of any sort are not absolute. Freedom of speech does not allow one to shout fire in a crowded theater. The key question is: can freedom of worship be restricted during a pandemic? The answer is certainly yes if it can be proven that such worship causes the spread of disease. Reasonable restrictions on church attendance to protect society at large must be allowed. So what's with this decision by our Supreme Court? Apparently, if Cuomo allows the spread of the disease in certain venues, like bowling alleys, he must also allow its spread through churches. Let's get one or two 12 year olds to explain to the Court why this reasoning is flawed."
2020-11-26 15:45,"Wonderful, now everyone can form their own religious group(s) and hold meetings without impunity regardless of whom they give covid. Way to go AMY! Really smart!"
2020-11-26 15:55,Religion trumps Science and Medicine. Can freedom from deliberate danger be a legal argument against these church-goers?
2020-11-26 15:59,"I find it remarkable that religious folk cannot observe their faith individually with the quiet self confidence that their beliefs provide them before this god of theirs. The demand to congregate seems to me to demonstrate that their religious services are really a fashion show and competition to show who is most devout. As it is decided, they will congregate and they will die, taking a number of others with them. So be it!"
2020-11-26 15:55,"Reading the article and many of the comments, I am frightened to see the lack of common sense and compassion , to protect not just yourself but everyone else.
I remember the ""terrible fights"" over the smoking ban, that mayor  Bloomberg had to face, when he  instituted the law, bc he listened to science and facts and understood how damaging not only smoking was, but second hand smoking as well ; and he wanted to protect everyone !
I am very allergic to cigarette smoke and I will for ever bless him for banning smoking in restaurants and all public places. Europe followed his lead very shortly after ! 
Unfortunately we have very short memories in advocating, for what is healthy and safe for all of us and we allow the trumps of this world ,who only care about the stock market,  to poison us and  win."
2020-11-26 15:57,"As expected, the Supreme Court now weighs in in favor of freedom of choice, rather than favoring the common good.  This aligns perfectly with all the flag-wavers carrying ""FREEDOM"" signs all through the past campaign season.  I guess all I can say is that this further solidifies my stay-home decision, one I made last March.  

I very much miss going to Mass, but I know if I do I exposre not only myself to the virus but to those I may come in contact with.  That doesn't seem to bother evangelicals and the like.  All I ask now is please go breathe on someone else."
2020-11-26 16:06,"So I assume under the 1st Amendment bars cannot be restricted with in terms of numbers of people.  After all the 1st does allow ""freedom of association"".  

As a non-believer I too should be able to gather in as large a group as I choose.  The 1st is not simply limited to the ""religious"".  So I can only assume that any venue can allege it is being discriminated against when one set of rules apply to let us say ""Churches""  and another to ""bars."""
2020-11-26 15:58,"The ""logic"" of comparing a liquor store or pet shop with a house of worship--where groups literally congregate for long periods of time--is baffling.  I understand the argument of bias, but there's a clear lack of logic in this comparison that also reeks of bias on the judges' parts."
2020-11-26 16:03,"Sorry that we are at this point.  Early in the pandemic, the message I heard was we need to avoid getting the virus so hospitals, doctors, nurses and other medical folk aren't overwhelmed.  From everything I've read they have been, in waves since it started.  Seems to me, their needs should drive our priorities.  Besides covid, the preventable deaths of 2020 seem to be a direct result of the opening of bars, restaurants and now we'll be adding churches.

Personally, I haven't been to Mass since this started, and don't intend to until I'm vaccinated.  My Parish is a Newman Center that serves students, and that's where I would routinely get a cold or the flu.  In fall, the local bishop decreed  that Catholics needed to attend Sunday Mass.  I couldn't believe it.  He retracted that though a couple weeks later.  Seeing as our parish is a population of older folks and students, seems like a deadly mix to me.  Based on live streams of Mass, attendance is less than 25% - I guess my fellow parishioners are individually choosing common sense."
2020-11-26 15:56,"If health care workers aren't going to be valued and taken seriously then maybe its time for them to all take a long leave of absence. They have my permission! If I was working in a frontline health care position in an area that did not regulate the basics around curbing the spreading and I had the financial option, I think I'd give notice using a false reason like relocating and then hole up for the next six months. A decision like that might not just be for your own survival but if you have family, you'd also be protecting them. What a moral bind this country and our Supreme Court has put our health care workers in and done so in the name of religion, of all things....that place where people supposedly go to contemplate morality."
2020-11-26 16:02,"""The court’s ruling was at odds with earlier ones concerning churches in California and Nevada. In those cases, decided in May and July, the court allowed the states’ governors to restrict attendance at religious services.""

I guess we shouldn't expect consistent, logical rulings. Another example of SCOTUS making the wrong, and this case, deadly, decision. We're in the middle of a public health crisis. People can pray at home. It's that simple."
2020-11-26 16:03,"The Episcopal Bishop of Arkansas halted public services in March and lately has been allowing in person services to restart under tight restrictions--size of gathering, infection rate in the community, etc. In our on line service each Sunday, we have four masked choir members standing at least 15 feet apart. We did not need the State to tell us how to behave. The religious communities who feel a need to gather in numbers and sing in close array apparently now may proceed without restriction. Too bad infections will not be limited just to the participants; this could be a Darwinian moment."
2020-11-26 15:54,"Justice Roberts had this right in his concurring opinion in May. Imagine for a second that Covid-19 was as deadly as Ebola. Would we even be having this argument? Of course not. The only reason we're having it now is because five justices have made a calculation that going to a place of worship outweighs the risk of catching and spreading the virus. In doing so, they are stepping into the role of epidemiologists and public health experts, where they have zero training, and at the same time undermining an elected official's (accountable to the people) ability to maintain public safety."
2020-11-26 15:56,"In the age of social media, our rhetoric is riddled with inflammatory oversimplifications and half truths. Unfortunately the majority justices in this case succumb.   Rather than comparing churches and bike shops, this discussion should center on the equality of Cuomo’s treatment of congregate settings as a category, i.e. churches, Broadway plays, movie theaters, concert halls, etc."
2020-11-26 16:05,"Thanks to the Supreme Court for tossing science and common sense to the winds. In the face of a deadly pandemic, we have the obligation NOT to endanger the larger communities that radiate  outward 360 degrees around us. In a public emergency, it is not unreasonable to ask that people not assemble in large groups to sing together and exhale as much infection as possible temporarily. The operative word here is 'temporarily'--as in, for the duration of the crisis.

As for Justice Gorsuch's comparison of bike shops and churches.... I have yet to observe crammed bike shops with people breathing into each others' faces. 

And finally, if one's relationship with God (or whatever deity floats your boat) exists only in a particular building, then I question if this is a question of faith, or a case of ""Who moved my cheese?""."

It is grotesquely irresponsible, selfish and frankly unChristian.

If, for example, the rule is for non-family members to be at least 6-feet apart, the pastor -if responsible- should use this rule to calculate the maximum number of people he can safely accept during service.  However, if the pastor's objective is to fill the church to get as much donations as possible, then the church needs a new pastor who cares less about money and more about the well being of his/her community."

2020-11-26 16:26,"What are we supposed to do with this decision? Elected officials make policy to protect and serve the people who elected them. Supreme Court Justices pass decisions on cases that uphold their interpretation of the Constitution, with impartiality to the impact they have on the well-being of citizens. So, we’re are at another impasse. How do our elected officials push for restrictive Heath measures that WILL save lives, while navigating a legal system blind to the public health considerations of the People? The Constitution is an imperfect document by design. I’m just sad that in our effort to form and reaffirm a more perfect union, our current Justices rank a freedom to gather and worship higher than an oath of office to protect the lives of citizens. So I ask in earnest, what are we supposed to do with this decision? 

Personally, I’m going to do everything I can to protect myself and my family from people who choose to gather in-person instead of gathering virtually from the safety of their homes.

Hmmm... Tricky one!

What Gov. Cuomo did was basically that same as enacting a law. SCOTUS at least did not complain about how the restriction came into being, they complained that the restriction violated the first amendment.

So, this rule could be applied to any law too, right?

Let's say I'm a satanist and like to sacrifice children on the altar of my Temple of Doom (or however satanists call their places of worship) and later have their tender flesh slightly grilled for supper. It's religious! You can check out a lot of texts and probably even stone tablets...

There are laws against murder in the U.S., but if the first amendment is stronger than executive orders designed to save lives, and if there is no limitation of this ruling to executive orders, then why should I go onto death row just for eating little Mike or Judy? Unfair! The Catholics and Jews are allowed to kill people using Covid-19, why can't I kill people with an obsidian knife?

See, that's the difference between RBG and ACB: Justice Ginsberg would have thought this through to the end..."

2020-11-26 16:38,"Let's be clear on what the point was here..  The point is not that faith-based communities should be able to do whatever they want, whenever they want, or that they should get special treatment.  The point is that you cannot discriminate: i.e., you cannot allow secular activities while banning religious ones.

When EVERYTHING was closed - both secular and religious - the Court found AGAINST the faith-based communities - twice.  It is only now, when there is the perception (and often reality) that secular activities are being allowed while religious ones are not (or, at least, that the restrictions on religious activities are more severe) that the Court ruled in favor of the faith-based communities.  I totally understand the Court's decision here.

If Cuomo wanted to get around this decision, he would have to limit secular activities to the same degree he is limiting religious ones.  THAT is the ""remedy"" for the situation."
2020-11-26 16:38,"Religious freedom is a cornerstone of the American polity and a expressed right in the Constitution. Freedom of choice is at the heart of this decision and no government entity can proscribe this freedom. While there may be consequences of religious gatherings during the pandemic, it is the right of the faithful to gather for worship. Some atheists and agnostics may not agree with the exercise of this freedom, but it is not their prerogative to restrict it."
2020-11-26 16:39,NY officials brought this on themselves by imposing arbitrary rules and claiming they are based on science. If the rule was in terms of percent capacity along with mask and distance requirements it would have been much easier to defend than set small numbers regardless of the space.
2020-11-26 16:41,"Some want to say here that the superior court is just saying that the NY policy was limiting religious freedom but that it does not mean that it influences people's actions.
 Yes of course it does. If it is allowed legally to do something, then it implies that people will do it.
That is the basic concept of the intentionality of the law.
When you see that the superior institution of justice in the USA  goes against scientific advice for the well being of the nation and endangerment of its citizens to favor religious ideas , it shows the obsolete philosophy of the US law against intentionality and the US judicial system is based on rules for whom has the power to enforce them and not a Law for everybody ."
2020-11-26 16:43,"Doesn’t the ruling here imply that local health officials have to treat House of Worship similarly to all other places of gathering during the Pandemic?

Can’t this be solved by a new law that says you have a certain number of people per square foot inside, wearing masks and spaced at least six feet apart.

And lower that capacity for the length of time those people will be inside.

Can’t you now write a law that says that all internal spaces are restricted to have no more than 1 person per every 6 square feet of interior space if expected exposure times are expected to be 30 minutes or less.   For each expected increase in exposure of 30 minutes the maximum occupancy is cut in half.

So, a liquor store, barber shop etc can have a maximum indoor capacity of 1 person per six square feet, as exposure times would be expected to be 30 minutes or less.  If you hold any scheduled event such as a worship service, then the maximum capacity would be reduced to 1 person per every 12 square feet.  Want to do something for two hours inside - the maximum capacity is reduced to 1 person per every 24 square feet.

This would not prejudice anyone from doing anything they want inside and would apply the same restrictions to everyone regardless of what they were doing whether it be Religious or  not."

2020-11-26 16:34,"The biggest reason for Christianity’s decline is not atheism but Christians themselves. While a majority of Americans agree large gatherings are not in the best interests due to a highly communicable illness, Christians cry victim and demand to have thousands of mask-less followers crammed indoors. Talk to a Christian who isn’t evangelical and they’ll tell you that, while they miss large worship, they continue to show their faith by helping poor and being a positive influence in their communities through charity, prayer, and organizing aid to those hurt by the very real COVID-19. Talk to an evangelical and they’ll tell you they are Joan of Arc being set on fire because they can’t be indoors singing to their God while totally neglecting the poor and disadvantaged at their doorsteps. Evangelicals have no one to blame but themselves for the rapid decline in Christianity in America and come 2024, the new voting bloc of youth will resoundingly reject a growing minority demanding that their religious views be imposed on the majority."
2020-11-26 16:08,"As many commenters have noted, churches and houses of worship enjoy a tax-free ride in this country. Most worshipers will tell you it’s the large familial community that they go to church for. That is exactly what’s wrong- your social activities are no less dangerous during this time than people congregating at bars or movie theaters or anywhere else people congregate. Large crowds of any kind endanger communities right now. If you’re a godly type of person, I’d think you’d be all for protecting and loving thy neighbors! So yes churches should be under the same lockdown orders as the rest of the world. It’s time that religions are treated for what they really are- social clubs. Pay taxes, then you can have a say on what they should be used for but until then just follow the law and sit back while enjoying your tax exempt social clubs."
2020-11-26 16:37,"Since justice is a question of deserts, it has nothing to do with ACB replacing RBG or Flynn being friends with DJT, thus both decisions show government isn't based on justice.
Some commenters were taught otherwise, and are now upset. Had they been better educated, they would already know that rulers use their law to rule us, 'justice' being their cover story.
If you were in such a dominant position, why limit yourself with justice if you believe some other policy is better, especially if it meshes with your ideology or self-interest?
Government divides society into ruled and rulers, and their dominance breeds further injustice."

2020-11-26 16:21,"Like we’ve seen over and over again for the last  4 years, actions have consequences. Ignoring facts has consequences. Ignoring science has consequences. So instead of seeing the order for what it is - an effort to reduce the spread of a life threatening virus to ultimately save lives, of course the religious community frames it as an attack or religious freedom. How selfish. 

Ok, gather then. Worship in groups. Don’t wear a mask. Have a nice TG dinner this year with your family. The virus doesn’t care. Just be prepared for the consequences of doing so. 

The government isn’t trying to crush religious freedoms, its trying to save lives. The fact that even the Supreme Court can’t see beyond that is a cautionary tale of what’s to come. Quite frankly, this shouldn’t have to be a law - the lowest form of ethic. Observing distance, wearing a mask and not gathering is a civic duty that should be undertaken out of love for the well-being of the community.

Churches, synagogues, and mosques all have:

1 - high human density (a closely packed crowd of stationary occupants, by building design and in actual practice); 2 - a long stay by the individuals that make up the crowd (hour long services are typical); and 3 - singing, chanting, or other group voice (aerosol) projection amidst the high density, long-staying crowd.

None of these things applies to a liquor store or the other venues cited, where nowadays individuals are “in and out” as quickly as they can do it.  Apple and oranges.

The NY regulation treated the apples different from the oranges (singling them out specifically) because there are compelling reasons to do so from a public health perspective.  That is all our Constitution requires under the Establishment Clause."

This is far more upsetting. These five conservative judges have and will continue to place religious freedom above public safety and health. THIS precisely is Trump’s legacy - the new SCOTUS. 

I don’t understand the rationale of these five judges here: I understand that my right to worship my God is a fundamental freedom, but shouldn’t physical safety be a more basic right? Don’t I need to be alive and well in order to worship my God?

Lastly, a side note: ‘Conservative’ is not the right description for this ideology… One can be conservative   rational. This is irrational. One can be conservative   loving. This is uncaring. The term conservative is no longer enough to describe the views held by the current Republican party."
2020-11-26 16:23,"This is just the beginning of this Supreme Court finding ways to use ""religious freedom"" as a cudgel against humanity.  They are purposely ignoring  that part of the Constitution which really does protect religious freedom, the Separation of Church and State."

The court has ruled that all must be treated equally.
2020-11-26 16:14,"And so it begins, the radicalization of the Supreme Court to the right.

Governor Cuomo's restrictions are not a ban.  He instituted restrictions due to a global health pandemic. This is common sense.

We in NY recently went through a measles outbreak. It occurred in Rockland County in the Orthodox Jewish community.  It finally necessitated mandatory vaccinations for school children, after it was discovered many had opted out of vaccination as had been an option at that time.  Now, there is no opt out for religious reasons. It took 11 months to get the outbreak under control.

I believe this is similar.  Cuomo is not saying you cannot worship, he only addresses the amount of worshipers in a building at one time. Again, this is common sense in a global pandemic.

Last week there was an Orthodox Jewish wedding in Brooklyn, I saw a brief clip on the news of people crowded together.  There were hundreds of people shoulder to shoulder in the picture.

The danger with events of this type is not only to those who attended.  But also those who live with attendees and anyone who may come into contact with someone who attended. That 3rd person is who needs the most protection. They may have comorbidities and cannot afford to come in contact with an exposed or sick person.

So I find it completely unreasonable and lacking in basic common sense that the Supreme Court ruled as it did.

When did religion become more important than life itself?"
2020-11-26 16:22,"By my reckoning, notwithstanding the negative connotations to drinking (relatively) alone, churches are the same as bars in that you can imbibe either at home or in a bar - there's a social element that is enjoyed, but not required. Community is important in both enterprises (as a non-believer, that's how I see it). Obvious to anyone, comparisons to pet stores and bike shops don't form the basis of a winning argument. And if I could get my food without going to, say, Costco, another, and admittedly more analogous, example, I wouldn't hesitate to explore those options, at least temporarily, especially if they presented lower risk of exposure. 

All this to say/rhetorically ask - why not worship at home? And stop thinking you're being singled out and persecuted for your beliefs. Play that card another time, whenever your freedoms are ACTUALLY being assaulted."
2020-11-26 16:20,"Herein lies the ongoing problem of private benefit supported by societal risk. Those wishing to do so are now allowed to congregate in churches holding 1000 people, and then mingle with the general population, a population unable to distinguish who is or is not infected. All evidence clearly demonstrates that even with restrictions in place we are unable to control the spread of the virus. To allow these types of gatherings, universally described by medical and infectious disease experts as potential super-spreader events is unconscionable.

Advocates will applaud this as lifting an unconstitutional restriction on freedom of religion, but unless they also address the society-wide risk their practice of this freedom imposes unwillingly, uncontrollably and invisibly on those who prefer not to be exposed, their claim amounts to little more than selfish disregard."

What's next?  A ""Constitutional"" justification allowing states to impose religion-based prohibitions on abortion on everybody regardless of one's own personal beliefs?

It seems a bit unfair to allow outdoor dining and shopping accommodating more people in smaller spaces. Most people commenting here seem to be under the impression that the Court ruled to abolish restrictions on religious services. That is not the case.

The state's interest in preventing the spread of a a pandemic is without doubt compelling, but was the governor's order narrowly tailored?  I think there is a plausible case that it was not narrowly tailored, but the court's majority opinion fails to spell this out.  It fails to offer the state guidance on what types of mandates might further the state's public health goals while also passing first amendment scrutiny.   The governor ought to issue new restrictions that dont single out religious gatherings but rather prohibit all mass gatherings  greater than x number of people in red zones.

2020-11-26 16:17,"Most of the comments seem to MISS the fact that Cuomo backed off the capacity restrictions for houses of worship BEFORE the USSC decision was rendered.  They also MISS the core holding, which is that the government cannot treat secular activities better than religious ones.  Cuomo's retreat *does* call into question whether the restriction on religious services was reasonable, non-discriminatory and based on science in the first place.  If Cuomo (and his legal and medical advisors) had evidence that the Order was lawful and would save lives, I can only assume he wouldn't back down."
2020-11-26 16:18,"So if I now call my restaurant or bar or gym a house of worship I am good to go without restrictions?  Since when are human-built buildings necessary for their freedom of religion.  Do these buildings owners now have the right to not follow building codes, other heath codes, ADA codes.   Can they be sued if their ""flock"" spreads the virus and I am a recipient of their virus?  No one is restricting the exercise of their religion.  Other rights have been curtailed in times of emergency.  This is another power play by the religious right.  My advice is to switch to a religion that values your right to live versus the right to fill the collection plate."
2020-11-26 16:33,"Knowing that I'm slightly biased (believer of a strong secular democracy and being at least agnostic), I wonder if the interpretation given to the freedom of religion by the Supreme Court (also given in previous other cases) means that the government of the USA has always to follow the doctrins of any religion (like, provocatively, in a theocracy), instead of being independent from them.
Indeed, the judiciary seems to prioritise, especially in the present case, the wishes of the religions over the well-being of the persons, especially those persons which may be infected by the irresponsible persons coming from the gatherings.
This decision of the Supreme Court is in full contrast to a scientific and humanistic approach, which is for me the reasonably necessary way to tackle the present pandemic.
My hope is that the USA will see again its responsability in striving to the well-being of all the people, instead of following beliefs."

The idea that a group of religious people should be exempt from generally applied laws is a judicially created fiction."

It may be time to put a specific ""religious"" pseudo-brand on legitimate health-care institutions, so they can legally refuse care (in the name of their religion) to Covid patients who insist on attending church or holiday celebrations against all public health recommendations.

Tesla's Fremont plant is wide open, manufacturing away.  With people driving less during the pandemic, we can't operate such factories somewhat slower, with more safety in mind?

When I was growing up, my state had the Sunday ""Blue"" laws.  I disagreed with them, but at least, they made sense in terms of how they were implemented.  For quite a few years, pharmacies in drug stores and grocery stores were open, and that was pretty much IT, as far as I noticed as a teen.  People could get necessities, and that was it. 

I agree that safety should be the key determinant for how such closures are handled during the pandemic, balanced with keeping the ESSENTIAL things in the economy going.  Now that we have a highly probably timeline for getting the pandemic down to reasonably (at least comparable to the past 8+ months with restrictions) safe levels, we could and should help businesses and the unemployed during the next critical months, and make a meaningful difference in lives lost and lives damaged by significant health impacts.

Cuomo could have stated his ruling with more precision,  as a general restriction to any congregation of individuals that subjects the public to articulated risks.   The ruling then could have applied to sports events, bikers or nudist colonies.  

This could also provide a nucleus for a return of our culture to elevating secular humanism over the authority of an almighty God, who historically has allowed domination by those who speak in His Holy Name."

There is in fact more to unpack if you’re not going to Church today, like the amount of time Gorsuch spends in liquor stores and Barrett’s cinematically tortured relationship with an entity she calls The Creator.  And you’re bound to start making your own false equivalencies.  For example, those bike shops.  With all due respect to bike riders, how many of us spend any time at all in a bike shop?  Or track meets?  Or the student union at Trump University?  How many minutes do we spend standing at the corner of 71st Street and York at 7 a.m. buying pomegranates from the fruit guy?

2020-11-26 16:57,"Typical conservative dogma advocating for the free exercise of recklessness and to intentionally endanger and harm others.

So, tax exempt religions have no obligation whatsoever - even temporarily! - for the welfare of the society they're members of and that enables and protects their existence - like from competing monopoly seeking religions - with all the benefits society conveys; like the rule of law, first responder protections, infrastructure, defense and other benefits tax payer citizens (religious and not) pay for? And yet, when their deity fails to come through to bail them out, they resort to demand of government and tax payers to bail them out - with tax payer funds, no less.

Cuomo “singled out a particular religion for blame"" - really? When one religion abuses their privilege with 7000 person wedding parties and mass mask-less religious congregations, they're ruining it - endangering - the rest of us including those who practice their religion responsibly, acknowledging they are not the only ones who matter on this planet.

No doubt setting up quarantine zones around recklessly irresponsible groups would be viewed as violating religious freedoms too.

Someone's religious right does not override my right to be 'saved' from them inflicting a deadly contagion upon me.

Otherwise, to save ourselves, it will become necessary to identify those worshippers who deliberately disdain Science and therefore pose a clear and present danger to us by their willing embrace of the virus.

Therefore, to protect ourselves and our communities, the next burden is to identify which worshippers are spreading the disease through their willful disregard for our welfare. Monitoring places of worship, publishing the locations and names, photographing and posting the names and faces of the worshippers will likely be the only defense against the virus spreaders. I suspect that these worshippers also disdain masks, hand washing, etc., further endangering us.

We request that every such worshipper wear a red or orange armband so that We The People may avoid them. This applies to children in schools, obviously. Then, each of us can make up his/her own mind about whether or not to congregate with these worshippers, and thus expose ourselves and our families to the plague.

Healthcare workers must decide if they will treat deliberate plague spreaders. I urge them to not do so, along with other businesses. After all, the religious freedom to congregate has  its corollary: the freedom to not congregate. It shall not be abridged.

If they have any shame, any remorse, any awareness that they are intellectually and morally incapable of ruling on behalf and for the benefit of the people, I urge them to resign. Biden can nominate replacements who can guide and help the people with justice.

There is virtually no reason for the court to hamstring state government’s efforts to protect Americans from Covid-19.  The need for public safety far outweighs any religious freedom claims.  As far as the so-called religious ‘’leaders” who brought this case are concerned, their shame is even deeper.  Their first responsibility is to the well being of their congregants.  It should not even be a question in their minds as to whether or not to observe Covid-19 restrictions.  Houses of worship are super spreaders with singing and speaking indoors, including significant gatherings of people (with variable use of masks and social distancing).  This is not about belief in God or religious freedom; this is about pastoral malpractice."
2020-11-26 16:46,"First off, I respect the rights of all to practice their religion in peace and safety.

That said, it is time for ALL leaders to think logically and not emotionally about their actions and the impact of those actions.  There is incontrovertible evidence that large gatherings of people run the risk of spreading Corona virus.  And the risk is significant.

As pointed out by another reader (my apologies for not remembering who), and I paraphrase: If one’s faith is compromised by not congregating in large groups, then that faith is compromised to begin with.  Our places of worship are buildings.  Our Faith resides in our hearts and souls. 

I encourage religious leaders to see their congregations, people they should know, families they support and ask themselves: Which of these faithful’s lives are you willing to jeopardize? Which family are you willing to potentially irreparably harm?  If your answer does not exclude every member of your congregation, then you do not deserve to lead that congregation IMHO.

I encourage all, to look at their families, their neighbors, regardless of what faith is practiced and ask the question:  God knows what is in my heart.  I cannot fool God.  Is it worth jeopardizing those that are part of My Personal World when the Science that God has graced us with has given us the means to protect them?

I constantly marvel at the comparison of liquor stores and churches being opened or limited. Public health measures boil down to exposure time and concentration of the virus in the space.

People who go in a liquor store are in and out. The clerk is probably the person most at risk. If the ventilation is decent both concentration and exposure time are kept low

Full church services with no mitigation drive up concentration and exposure time is high. Every service a potential superspreader.

NPR has reported that public health arguments were not admissible in the arguments.

Limiting size and requiring mitigation measures plus the fact that we have technology to share religious services in no way violates the free exercise of religion. You want everyone to be able to participate? Have multiple small services, have them outside, stream them.

This was a bad apparently ill-informed decision. The issue is overlaid with so much political, cultural, as well as public health issues. This court has basically said there is no public health and has sanctioned superspreader events."

I'm sorry, but I find this ruling equivocal to the idea that personal freedom trumps the safety and welfare of the community, society, in general. While it is appropriate to work to achieve a balance, in the midst of a global pandemic involving a highly contagious disease that we know is spread in specific ways involving group activities, it strikes me as the height of hubris for the court to intervene in decisions made in conjunction with top medical experts to avoid unnecessary spread. 

Further, comparing activities in unscientific ways is disingenuous. There is more than enough evidence to show that sadly, gatherings in houses of worship can be dangerous and by matters of degree that involve size of crowds and specific activities, such as singing."
2020-11-26 16:51,"Does Gorsuch not understand false analogy. I do not remember ever spending an hour in close contact with five hundred or more people while shopping in a liquor store. The question is not whether it is a religious or secular institution, the question is what harm does the policy prevent. It is not that  the people who attend church services are only going to endanger one another. If that was the case, fine. However, after spreading the coronavirus to one another in the close setting of a church, the faithful will then leave that building and spread to others who did not choose to attend a super spreader event. Your religious freedom ends at the point where it endangers the lives of others. Also, why would his argument not now extend to restaurants and bars? Shall we now allow a few hundred thousand more people to die unnecessarily in the name of ""freedom""?"

care for everyone and how we are all neighbors and should be mindful of, especially those who are vulnerable during this pandemic

He speaks of the future when all of the parishioners can once again fill the Church and how sacrificing these gatherings now are aa expression of faith and love and care for others which is the core of the religion.

How is a ‘secular’ activity not just another set of beliefs?

Even without establishing anything, or without any religious institution, I can chose to believe whatever I want and call it my religion.  Which it is, in essence, since I believe it, and a religion are comprised of beliefs.

And if I believe in abortion, as part of my religion, how can it be less valid than those of another religion and be called secular ?

In the executive judgment of the majority of the Supreme Court in this case, the experiences are not significantly different. It’s too bad that, unlike Governor Cuomo, the majority is unelected by New Yorkers to make such factual local decisions in which their lives are at stake."
2020-11-26 16:54,"Justice Roberts gets it right: 

Let ""public health officials [determine] what is necessary for public safety in the midst of a deadly pandemic.""

However, Cuomo's directives are too inexact. Limits should not be based on numbers of people but on the total volume of the building -- height x width x length -- and the frequency at which the volume of air within the building is exchanged per hour.  

Open windows, sophisticated HVAC systems, and HEPA filters could improve air exchange but the bottom line would be the density of aerosols and droplets at the floor level where most congregants would be gathering.  We have no easy, sure-fire way to make this measurement but a CO2 meter can offer an approximation. 

Then we'd need to know the duration of time that attendees would be spending within that space to estimate how many aerosols and / or droplets they'd be subject to.

(CO2 levels and aerosol / droplet densities are still TBD.)

Then the purpose of the gathering -- alcohol purchases or religious services -- would be a moot point."

2020-11-26 16:59,"The very first right in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution is free exercise of religion.  That's the law.  It means the state cannot infringe that right without the most compelling of reasons, assertion of which puts the strictest burden of proof on the state to prove (not just assert) its claim AND that the claim cannot be addressed by any less coercive means.  There is NO evidence that religious institutions are any greater ""super-spreaders"" than grocery stores, alcohol stores, or any other institutions operating under less stringent norms.  And there is always a simple proof of a less coercive means: relying on peoples' good judgment rather than police power.  Kudos to a Supreme Court that now recognizes these fundamental truths AND that the credibility of the First Amendment is more important than the creds of some justices' (which they confuse with ""institutional reputation"") with the elite chattering classes."
2020-11-26 17:02,"The states have long used 'emergencies' to trample on the constitutional rights of its citizens. While an actual emergency may not have been the best occassion to push back against this overreach, I am glad the courts are recognizing this, and I look forward to the court striking down more dubious 'emergency' statutes in the future."
2020-11-26 17:03,"I’m a Christian myself, but I think this is an unwise decision.  I used to attend a church that had thousands in the pews every Sunday sitting very close together.  And all church services involve plenty of congregational singing, which tends to spread Covid even more than speaking does.  

If our government leaders singled out churches for Covid restrictions, then it would be understandable to conclude they are discriminating against churches.  However, instead, our government leaders have put restrictions on several secular places too, such as movie theaters, gyms, etc.  

It seems like many of my fellow Christians are not worried about the risk of our hospitals may eventually be forced to start rationing care like Italy did.  There’s already been discussions of that among hospital administrators.  Plenty of people don’t realize how exhausted our doctors and nurses are."

2020-11-26 16:59,"In the history of mankind, so many mistakes were justified in the name of “freedom”. One would hope we are evolving and learning from those mistakes. This decision crossed an important line: one’s liberty end where others’ start."
2020-11-26 17:01,"There must be a separation of Church and State.  This was a good decision for America.  HOWEVER, just because religions  can does not mean they should.  A good question to ask is what do Religious leaders care about most the well being of their flocks or something else."
2020-11-26 17:00,"I suppose now religious weddings like the one recently in Brooklyn are now OK also.  Is this what the founders meant when they drafted the first ammendment? I doubt it. They were sensible men who didn't want to restrict what god (or no god) a person worshiped, but wouldn't have condoned such blindnes to public health emergencies. So much for original intent as a judicial doctrine; it is just a cloak to be worn sometimes and taken off at other times."
2020-11-26 17:07,"Will the ""strict constructionist"" theory of Constitutional interpretation ever be reconciled with current issues?  One may debate whether the Supreme Court's refusal to permit  reasonable gun control measures because of the Second Amendment right to bear arms has caused more unnecessary deaths.  It is difficult, however, to ignore deaths that result from that Court's striking down reasonable restrictions on church/temple attendance.  Large gatherings in houses of worship have proven to be super spreader events, threatening the health and well being of all of us."
2020-11-26 16:58,"While the first amendment does not allow one to yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater, it apparently does give one the right to block the exits of a burning theater if it's a prayer service.

2020-11-26 16:25,"“Whenever fundamental rights are restricted, the Supreme Court and other courts cannot close their eyes,"" says Justice Alito.

Yet it is clear that only some 'rights' matter - gun-owners' rights, religious zealot's rights, employer's rights, multi-billion dollar corporation's rights - these are sacrosanct.  People who aren't allowed to gather in their own homes, who are wrongfully imprisoned, who are victims of 400 years of racism? They can kick rocks.

Justice Alito did us a favor with his little speech.  These five people were not chosen for the Court for any reason other than their diehard loyalty to regressive right-wing ideology, to the dream of recreating the 1820s at all costs.

The members of this court should not be paid any more than your average QAnon congressman from rural Kentucky."

Our country is edging closer and closer to an irrevocable divide between those who extend their libertarian views as hammers against the rest of us who recognize the freedoms of all run concurrently with responsibility to all. Our life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness should not be infringed upon by your religious liberty any more than it should be infringed upon by your right to gun ownership. Neither should be unleashed as a threat to our very existence."

2020-11-26 16:47,This decision by the conservative justices is more likely their making a “statement” about other religious freedom challenges that are coming before the court.  It is a precursor to what we are going to see ahead of us with regards to “religious liberty.”
2020-11-26 16:04,"As Charles explained so many year ago, nature rewards those who can adapt best, quickest, punishes those who cling to the status quo/past. 

Let these folks do as they please. The leaders who insist on sticking to past practices will ultimately be collecting donations from a smaller gene pool.

2020-11-26 15:46,"Freedom of religion is one thing, allowing the followers of thousand year old texts and fables to bring said dogma into our highest levels of government should be a thing of the past by now. Even disregarding the un-constitutional and hypocritical timing of the appointment of ACB to the Supreme Court, she should never have been considered due to her extreme religious views. It instantly renders her unable to be truly subjective on anything, and adds to the unacceptable permeation of far right Christianity into the foundations of our government. If we are ever to achieve true progress as a society we need to truly follow the mantra of separation of church and state."
2020-11-26 15:53,"When the people who get sick from these religious super spreader gatherings go to their favorite hospitals for treatment, and meet the medical personnel who are working themselves to death (in some cases, literally) I hope they will remember to take the time to say a prayer for these heroes. And, of course, send a hand-written thank you to Amy, Samuel, Clarence, Brett and Neil. And while they're at it, drop a quick thank you to you know who for the fabulous job of how he handled the pandemic and blow a kiss ( I wish) to Moscow Mitch for giving America the Supreme Court  that I, for one, believe needs to be re-packed."
2020-11-26 16:09,"The decision is nothing less that a victory for cognitive dissonance and superstition of science and logic. The decision is a another reinforcement of the idiocracy unleashed and turbo-charged by among the worst American Presidents. 

The Founding Fathers made plenty of mistakes. Separation of Church and State was not one of them.  Signers of the Constitution knew that religion had no place at the table of leadership in a free and tolerant society. 

Religions are man made objects. They are what you make them. So are Supreme Courts. We have a country where 70 million plus folks voted for a conman who cares as much for religious freedom as for the lives of ""people of color"". 

70 million people voted against their interests in voting for Trump. The Supreme Court just approved accelerating their deaths, in effect,  with Covid."

2020-11-26 16:14,"A religion which includes  human sacrifice is not protected in the Constitution because no single right is absolute, they must be judged in the context of other rights.

2020-11-26 16:29,"Well, it would be a simpler situation if what happens in church stays in church. If people want to go to places of worship and get infected and stay there in church while the illness runs it course, to be attended to by whoever happens to be there, that's their choice. Let them exalt in their freedom of religion.

But if they carry the SARS-CoV-2 organism out of that setting, into the secular world, and then infect others, we are no longer talking about freedom of religion. We are talking about causing other people to die.

So fine - during a pandemic like the one we are facing right now - people should be free to go to churches or other places of worship. But they should then have to stay there.  Didn't Bunuel make a movie related to this - called ""The Exterminating Angel""."
2020-11-26 16:21,"I guess church goers will get sick at higher rates and will suffer medical complications and the risk of dying at significant larger numbers than non-church/templo/mosque or any other type of gathering goers. Darwin would call this survival of the fittest. The hard part to understand is that it is religious leaders, politicians and judges claiming to act on the best interest of religious citizens, the ones putting them at risk for bad outcomes and a reduction of their population. Ignoring science, aka ignorance, has no limits."
2020-11-26 16:04,"Why can't people make this decision for themselves? If parishioners think it's unsafe, they shouldn't go to church. It's not hard. People make individual decisions regarding their safety (or not) every day. This is only one more decision they must make. The comments sounds more like sour grapes that ACB ruled against the liberal arm of the SC."
2020-11-26 15:46,"Looks to me that Cuomo can change the rules to be more ""neutral"" and still limit attendance to, say, six foot distancing with masks and 12 foot without."
2020-11-26 15:41,"Alright I don’t agree with this decision necessarily, but the commenters are majority incredibly misguided. 

This isn’t a legislative decision, this isn’t an analysis on what religious institutions should impose or not, or the judges personal policy.. This is a simple constitutional analysis. Comments like “this goes against common sense” are completely irrelevant"
2020-11-26 16:20,"The vision in my mind reading this, is of the recent wedding in NYC with 15000 attending.

2020-11-26 15:50,"Religious gatherings are at the top of the chart for Covid super-spreader events.

The religious right in this country are behaving like a drunk driver careening about and straddling two lanes, causing harm, all because of the self-indulgent and narcissistic notion that they are ""persecuted"" for having to follow neutral secular laws passed to reduce actual—as opposed to intra-cranial theological or metaphorical or allegorical—harms.

The only saving grace in all this is that the more privilege the devout exact for themselves out of the law (e.g., with RFRA statutes, or decisions like this one), the less respect they will get or deserve."

2020-11-26 17:19,"Even though I’m not a conservative, I understand that taking responsibility for one’s own actions is a conservative principle. If the litigating churches and synagogues want to pack in large numbers of people for long periods, infection and death rates will inevitably accelerate among them. This will draw more public resources (EMTs, ambulances, hospital beds/ICUs, etc) into these new hot spots. 

Since this￼ increase in illness is due to their actions, then it is not fair that valuable resources will be directed away from areas where the populace and organizations are more responsible, the proper thing to do is to prioritize service to the responsible areas away from the irresponsible ones. Certainly ACB would agree that this is fair, given that it is a conservative principle.

Then we might see the SC being called to strike down these new fair protocols and begin to micromanage ambulance schedules, ICU use, etc. Where does the new judicial activism stop?"
2020-11-26 17:28,"If these groups cared about their members and their communities, they would assume these restrictions voluntarily, before any government says anything.  But these are businesses, and they want revenue."

2020-11-26 13:49,"I agree with SCOTUS. City and State are getting too autocratic, and at the least should stay out of the cracking down on religion business. Inform the public, fine people who don’t wear masks. But at some point, and it’s been 9 months here in NYC, you have to trust that the public has learned how to deal with this situation. You begin to insult our intelligence after awhile. Expect more decisions like this going forward, closing things is not the answer, living intelligently with the virus is the answer. Understanding who is most at risk, this virus targets specific people and if our autocratic leaders can’t figure that out, then the problem is with them.

As we move into the Christmas seasons, the mayor must get tough with people who do not wear masks, most of us here in NYC know how to be safe, but we can’t do a thing when dealing with the 10 percent here who do not wear masks, that’s not our job to enforce, we pay our taxes to the people whose job it should be to enforce mask wearing .

The worst thing this city ever did was the lockdowns in March and April, history will show they took more lives than they saved .no more lockdowns, it’s time to be intelligent , not scared"

2020-11-26 15:34,"It is very important to note that anger should not be directed towards religious entities or the judges ... The problem here is constitutionality and when religious entities are targeted with arbitrary restrictions that is unconstitutional, irrespective of there being a health crisis. I see restaurants operating at full capacity, ""outdoor"" enclosed tents filled with people. Cuomo is not sitting down with community members to discuss the best ways to limit religious gatherings. Moreover, these ""laws"" should also be decided on a Federal level instead of states making up their own, often different/contradictory rules."
2020-11-26 17:39,"Up until now the 10th amendment has put decisions related to public safety during emergencies in the hands of state or local governments. In times of emergencies, such as a pandemic, or where public safety is compromised imposing sensible restrictions are decisions best left to local or state governments that must respond quickly even if imperfectly. The Supreme Court has now effectively ruled that the 10th amendment is weak in emergencies, local and state governments do not have authority to restrict certain activities in an emergency even if they threaten public safety. The consequences are going to be deadly."
2020-11-26 17:18,"I’m a Christian, but I find the insistence to meet in large gatherings during the pandemic the exact opposite of the Lord’s instructions to “Love your neighbor.”  The first churches met in small groups, in people’s homes, and the church flourished during that time. Still, in many places in the world, believers meet this way. Bigger does not mean better, and in this case it can be the most unloving thing to do to one’s vulnerable neighbor. My hope is that religious leaders use wisdom and common sense during these perilous times, and don’t stand on their rights, even if these rights are defined by the SCOTUS. Remember, we will answer to a higher authority."

His only contributions were destructive- to undermine, contradict, censor and silence scientist’s recommendations to reduce the spread of infection and protect the public.  He encouraged his devotees to spurn masks and protest state governments’ requests for voluntary lockdowns despite the growing numbers of infections and escalating death toll. It had to be a major factor why voters dumped him.  How do you explain why the five right-wing Republican hacks on SCOTUS chose this moment to hand down this commandment?  SCOTUS was not created in the image of a FISA court.  They are issuing too many unsigned decisions with no legal opinions and in some cases not even hearing oral arguments. Obviously no one in their right mind including SCOTUS would want to write an opinion trying to rationalize that Cuomo’s action was a permanent attack on religious freedom.  The court should set an example and stop hearing cases on a virtual bench.  Biden is not even President and SCOTUS is throwing down the gauntlet.  The court chose the wrong time and embarrassed itself by pandering to the conservative evangelicals that are an essential part of the Republican base. If the Democrats take the Senate, pack the court.  If not, follow Andrew Jackson’s lead, “John Marshall has made his decision now let enforce it.”"

Holier-than-thou has always had consequences. It's the reason the Constitution separated church from state. Now, the meaning behind that wise decision to be free of religious rule is being distorted. The Founders favored both freedom of religion and freedom from religion. But we now have a majority of justices who are slave to their narrow upbringings and the rigid black-and-white thinking that defines them. In this case, their devotion to their own beliefs and the fear of an assault on religious freedom that doesn't exist will spur more than esoteric  arguments among the privileged who gather in elite Washington parlors.

2020-11-26 17:08,Justice Barrett as a COVID survivor and super spreader should have recused herself from the decision. This precedent is ripe for reversal once a non-partisan constitutional court is put in place to remove politics and conflict of interest from court decisions.
2020-11-26 17:16,"What a wrongheaded decision.  As I think other commenters have suggested, the Governor should fine-tune the restrictions so that secular and religious venues are treated the same.  Liquor stores:  Nobody stays longer than 10 minutes.  No singing.  Churches:  Nobody stays longer than 10 minutes.  No singing.  I hope that that will satisfy Gorsuch.

Annoying that in the middle of a pandemic one should have to jump through such hoops, since it is obvious that conditions in liquor stores and bike shops, and in churches, are not at all the same."

The decision wasn't even signed so there is no basis for discussion of the departure from what had been settled law.

 I am a retired lawyer and am sad to see  politics  playing a part in in our Supreme Court's decision. Trump got what he wanted and the Senate was complicit in playing raw political power in rushing through a flawed candidate.

2020-11-26 17:47,"Just last week, I went to a Catholic mass with some close friends.  They had to go on line and reserve seating for us because this church would only allow 44 people to attend mass inside the court.  

When we arrived, church attendants made sure we were wearing masks, poured some hand sanitizer in our palm and then requested our names.  During this entire time, at least 8 ft separated everyone, at all times.

When we entered the church, the entire pew was reserved for us.  The pews in front and behind us were empty.  The priest wore a mask AND a face shield, as did his alter boys.

At communion, the host was placed in our hand by the priest and we ate it after he left.

I was utterly amazed and impressed at how well organized, thought out and orchestrated this entire scenario was done by this particular church.  I have no idea what or if any other churches follow a similar protocol.

Even without the Supreme Court ruling, a very safe, intelligent and thought out procedure was put into place at this one particular Catholic church.

People CAN gather safely, in smaller numbers, responsibly inside to worship. To be perfectly honest, I felt safer attending this mass than I ever do grocery shopping at any of the big food chains in Chicago."

(2)  I hope that I will always consider myself as a Christian 1st and as a American/ husband/father/Grandparent etc . 2nd.
(3)  Jesus said the two Most important rules are to Love God and  to love our neighbors. Christians show our love for God by worshipping Him and spending time with Him.  That Can happen ANYWHERE-- at church in person. watching a worship service on-line or at home alone with God. 
(3) Christians also show  our love for God by loving His Creation--that means the physical universe/ the climate/environment/other living creatures  and , most importantly, our fellow human beings who are also loved by and created by God.
(4) Wearing a mask/ social distancing/ on-line services/ showing compassion for our fellow human beings are all ways we show our love for God and our neighbors.
(5) Whining about our ""rights""  and the inconvenience of wearing a mask like  a spoiled 2-year old does not honor God.  Fellow Christians-- that is NOT a ""good look"" for us."

Shoulder-to-shoulder for an hour-plus is entirely different from brief proximity at a cash register or display.  Restaurants are comparable, but as the dissenters observe, restaurants are under similar or more stringent restrictions.

2020-11-26 17:06,"When the pandemic broke out in WA, Governor Inslee stopped all construction—even for individuals working alone in vacant spaces, except he allowed construction to continue on his new arena in Seattle where over 100 workers kept showing up each day.  I don’t like the idea of a packed religious service, but keeping a giant auditorium restricted to 25 people makes no sense either.  It seems like Cuomo and Inslee, among plenty of others in power, lack insight and creativity and are just as motivated by cronyism and irrational fear as they are by science.  I firmly believe in lockdowns, but they need to be applied fairly, not arbitrarily.  Had Cuomo’s religious gathering size limits and protocols made more sense in the beginning, it wouldn’t have made it to the Supreme Court in the first place, or so I’d wager."

2020-11-26 17:20,"What a difference a vote makes...

While the Justices may think this is an unreasonable restriction on freedom of religion, given the fact that we are not living in the Middle Ages and that we do now have Science that clearly tells us that these types of gatherings spread the disease, it clearly is a decision driven by personal beliefs that the assenting Justices had promised to put aside.

This opens the door for massive religious events. Some churches and synagogues hold 500 to 1000 people, all in extremely close proximity. The results will be swift, traceable and fatal for many. 

The Justices should look back on the long upheld logic that while yes, we do have freedom of speech under the First Amendment, we are not free to use that speech to harm others as in yelling fire in a crowded movie theatre."
2020-11-26 17:29,So much for the well-worn conservative complaint against “activist” liberal judges.  Here the conservatives went out of their way to rule on a policy that is not even in force.  They only complain about activism when they don’t like the outcome.
2020-11-26 17:19,"I have to wonder if Governor Cuomo himself has actually gone to a religious service himself to see all the significant changes they’ve made to make things extremely safe-much safer than supermarkets, gyms, restaurants, public transport.  I for one attend Mass and am impressed how responsible Catholic Churches have been run.  Hands sanitized, 12-15 ft social distance, masks, no physical contact, online reservations, sometimes a covid questionnaire and temp check. I feel much safer there than any other public space.  It really has been a testament of how houses of worship can be open and responsible.  The diocese is very organized, under one head, so the Catholic Church has a very directed and unified plan.  Can’t speak to other traditions.  Which is why any kind of legislation should be very targeted and only specific individual houses of worship￼ should be disciplined when they don’t follow cdc guidelines."
2020-11-26 17:37,"To have SCOTUS utilize a strict textual interpretation of the Constitution which will cost the loss of life of countless citizens calls into question not only the wisdom of the Court's decision, but also their judgement regarding religion's place under the Constitution. 

This SCOTUS giving primacy to mass attendance at religious services while a world wide pandemic rages begs a more thorough consideration of reasoned restraint(s) being placed upon the ""Free Exercise"" clause though that was certainly not their intent."
2020-11-26 17:18,I suggest Governor Cuomo continue to maintain sensible regulations.  Let the five justices come to New York and enforce their decision.
2020-11-26 17:26,"I am a former prosecutor. Theocrats now control the Supreme Court. Thanks to them whatever little legitimacy the court had left is gone. If a majority of the current Supreme Court had upheld the public health measures, as they should have, I would have been shocked. 

During her confirmation hearing Amy Coney Barrett refused to accept that climate change is real, calling it instead ""a very contentious matter of public debate"". Barrett then doubled-down, testifying she had no ""firm views"" on climate change because she was ""not a scientist"". Finally, Barrett asserted that climate science was ""especially...politically controversial"".

Everything imaginable was wrong with Barrett's statements. Lawyers and judges are not scientists, yet they are required to accept scientific fact. If this was not the case it would be impossible to obtain convictions or acquittals based upon scientific evidence establishing guilt or innocence. 

Forensic evidence is obtained by scientific methods such as ballistics, blood tests, and DNA testing and used in courts every single day, yet according to Barrett all judges throughout the US should disregard all scientific evidence because they are not hematologists, or ballistic experts, or Rosalind Elsie Franklin, the English scientist who pioneered our understanding of the molecular structures of DNA.

This latest ruling will lead to massive death; many more theocratic decisions will follow. However, this decision ends the Supreme Court's legitimacy."
2020-11-26 17:27,"People can be responsible for life and death decisions for themselves, but making bad decisions that may lead to the infection and death of others is not at play here. I don’t think that the Constitution and law in general can be interpreted as permitting a laissez-faire attitude for the potential of causing the death of others."
2020-11-26 17:46,"On the one hand, the decision seems irrational. On the other, there are Jackson Heights, Queens, and other areas of New York, where covid-19 is raging, and Cuomo and de Blasio are mum. Add to them, the extraordinary exceptions of riots and murders, which the mayor explained were ""important."" The unfortunate facts are that no matter how one looks at it, both the inept governor and the equally inept mayor have handled this crisis poorly from beginning to end, and, in fact, this has been the case with most local governments, the executive branch, and the legislature. We should not be surprised to see the Supreme Court follow suit."
2020-11-26 17:17,"If attendees at religious services (of several hundred or several thousand people, perhaps unmasked, perhaps undistanced, perhaps singing and speaking enthusiastically together) ONLY attended religious services, this decision would make might make sense. But those same attendees leave their religious settings and enter grocery stores, bike shops, liquor stores, and their workplaces- including hospitals, medical, and dental offices - and do things like ride buses and trains and fly on planes. 

The religious services by themselves are in no way, for the general public, the problem. The problem is the fact that attendees leave them and move about and carry on their lives in the wider world, where the rest of us, who may or may not be religious or want to attend such services but choose not to for safety’s sake, also, unfortunately, must live and move and have our being."
2020-11-26 17:35,"I can't recall another time when courts sided with people who ignore public health directives during a pandemic. The five justices would probably have abandoned reasonable public health directives during past pandemics like Yellow Fever, Cholera, TB, Bubonic Plague, Polio or any other infectious disease that ravaged humanity. Everyone should fear for their safety now that the Supreme Court rejects public health directives designed to tame this and future pandemics."
2020-11-26 17:18,"This isn't about rights. It's about privilege. And this is the tip of the iceberg. 

What evangelical Christians want is not that their beliefs and practices be treated equally by government. They want their beliefs and practices to be given special treatment. And this court will give it to them.

The previous court held that, when it came to public health regulations, states could treat churches the same way they treat similar organizations. That wasn't good enough for the new Barrett-Kavanugh-Gorsuch majority. They made is so churches have special privileges to violate regulations that other, similar but secular organizations would have to follow.

There's a reason public health officials want to treat liquor stores, where small numbers of people visit for short periods of time, differently from churches, where large numbers gather for much longer periods. But this court isn't going to be interested in science-based arguments about which activities are more likely to spread disease and death.

Trump would've never been elected without the overwhelming support he got from evangelicals. What they expect in return is not constitutionally guaranteed rights or equal treatment, but privilege. And thanks to this court, they're going to get it, when it comes to LGBT rights, reproductive freedoms, and other issues."
2020-11-26 17:39,Does the Constitution grant a parishioner who attends a superspreader church service and a first responder an equal right to a hospital bed? These justices espouse personal responsibility only when it fits their other values.
2020-11-26 17:37,"More than 10 p., in a critical zone. More than 25 p., in a more moderate region. To what limit are these numbers?
Does the new limit sanction increasing the attendance at religious services up to the point which 6 foot distancing would physically allow? 
There appear to be enough unknowns, to warrant, looking, before leaping, seems to me, such as, what is the quality of the air system in a given space?
I expect wisdom from The Court, more than I want anybody's pent-up fervor.
A church space designed to accommodate 1000, having, (under restrictions), (just, 25p), and then, increasing to what a 6' social distancing will allow, can have a very significant increase in attendance.
I think more caution is necessary here until the spreader potentials receive close scrutiny, which I am not seeing has happened, by Governors, by Church's, by Synagogues."
2020-11-26 17:37,"We missed the perfect opportunity to settle the Deacons Vs Doctors argument, once & for all, when we restricted any of the religious services.

The plaintiffs had the better case, and we need better rules."
2020-11-26 17:20,It is now clear that the Court cannot be relied on the make objective legal-based decisions any more. This dangerous trend will continue until the conservative ideologues are neutralized. They reflect neither the Constitution nor majority of American thought. The freedom to congregate in times of a public health emergency is no more in the constitution than is the freedom to carry wherever whatever weapon one chooses or to yell fire in a movie theater. Biden and the Democrats need to do whatever it takes to erase this sad legacy of the deposed trump. We need to remake the federal judiciary to reflect the true majority of constitutional thought by any and all means available.

I.e. in-person outdoor and indoor gathering have to meet infection rate thresholds or they have a choice: (1) abide by spacing, ventilation, PPE, requirements or (b) suspend in-person activities. 

Anyway, this is ridiculous as places of worship can easily move to remote services just like universities move to remote teaching and corporations move to remote meetings.  These places are not comparable to liquor or hardware stores because people are seated for extended periods, and singing."
2020-11-26 17:46,"And with that ruling, religious institutions should have to pay taxes. Yes, the very taxes that society will have to rely upon when needing to care for people displaced, unable to afford care, etc as the pandemic lengthens and/or increases in severity due to this ruling."

2020-11-26 17:56,"There are other cases where the Supreme Court has held that First Amendment protections may be overridden by concerns for public safety where people gather in large numbers.  The Court presumably would not uphold the right for a person to shout ""fire"" in a crowded synagogue or church, for example.

Yet in these cases here, the Court permits individuals who may be infected with coronavirus to put the health and safety of others at risk, especially as people may ignore instructions  to wear masks and maintain social distance.

Modern technology makes it easy to worship via Zoom and streaming media, where public health is not at risk.  Statutes to limit attendance at religious services don't interfere with worship, but only change the venue."
2020-11-26 17:21,"So tragic that the SCOTUS ruled yesterday in favor of religious freedom instead of pragmatism during the Coronavirus pandemic. What sad reasoning, since Covid has become political instead of a fact of our lives in 2020."

2020-11-26 16:56,We have another example of smart people blinded by religious fervor unable to think abstractly.  Religious people are not being singled out for persecution. They are free to have their religious beliefs and practice them in a safe manner.  They are not free to engage in behavior that threatens the health of others.  I can’t help but wonder what truly religious person or group believes that their God looks favorably on a blatant disregard for life.
2020-11-26 16:27,"Astonishing! The governor can still impose a mandate to require social distancing and masks in places of worship. Overflow can come to the next service.

CONGRESS didn't enact any restrictions.  The Governor of the state isn't prohibited from issuing lawful orders as circumstances require for the public safety.  Three of those more recently appointed Justices who made this ruling call themselves originalists or textualists.

And maybe these strict constructionists should also attend these services just to see if the virus respects the constitution too. Amy Sam Clarence, don’t worry, I’m sure it does.

There’s an ethical question with that—we generally don’t encourage people to commit suicide. In fact, we go to considerable lengths to prevent suicide, as on the Golden Gate Bridge. Still, one could make that argument. 

But this problem goes beyond that. The churchgoing are not quarantined from other people, they contact and infect them every day. So this terrible decision will spread sickness and death throughout the population. Trump’s legacy (and Mitch McConnell’s) is more death.

In 1918, Catholic Church leaders urged their parishioners to follow public health directives in that pandemic and stay home from mass. But now they (and other religious leaders) have regressed to a church uber alles position. Is the United States still a First World country?"

2020-11-26 17:36,"I really don't care whether the people who attend such religious ceremonies subsequently suffer or die from COVID-19. Those who refuse to accept antiviral restrictions deserve to do so. I care only that they are probably spreading coronavirus to others. 

Perhaps they will salve their consciences by praying over those they sicken as a result of their actions, or at their funerals."

2020-11-26 17:51,"I must admit to feeling depression today because of my fellow Americans who refuse to act in the public good and for public health of fellow Americans.  Houses of worship are not essential to our economy and people are still free to practice religion at home and do not suffer discrimination or threat because of their religion.  That is what religious liberty means - to be free to practice your chosen religion, not to be free to ignore and defy public health measures during a  pandemic.  In truth, their fellowship is just a social clique, not religious practice, if they can't practice alone or in their homes.  

Many Trump followers still claim the pandemic is a hoax despite the rising hospitalization, lack of ICU beds, strain on our health care system and the vital workers and death.  or it is self serving individualism instead of acting in the public good.  What they call personal freedom.

I live in a mountain resort town where we are adhering to  public health measures.  I haven't seen my son in a year.  Despite public health officials  pleading with us not to travel and gather in large groups, they are and here they come. Whole groups come into the grocery.  In the pool at our recreation center  a woman with a young child gave loud lip to the lifeguard who asked her to wear a mask and was rude to me when I offered her one.  Others wear their masks only over their mouths.  They are infecting us.  

That is what these houses of worship want.  Liberty to spread disease."
2020-11-26 17:40,They’re not immune to the virus. It’s upsetting when they come to the hospitals with their liaisons demanding the latest even experimental treatment.

Freedom of religion does not mean freedom to kill people
 -- no matter what the Federalist Society appointed constitutional scholars think.  Obviously, being highly educated doesn't necessarily mean having commonsense.   Next will be an assault on gay marriage, abortion, homosexuality and a myriad of other religious movement causes that have come to dominate our political system.  This ruling was merely the first skirmish in the religious liberty war that is on the horizon."

Other than the duration, what's the difference between a ""normal"" police action ""shutdown"" and this one? None really, except this one is more wide spread and has already killed more innocents than any law enforcement shutdown in history. Some choose to frame it as a matter of ""freedom"" whether to accept the necessity of the action to do what needs to be done.

2020-11-26 17:52,"So this is what we have to look forward to.  As far as I can see, Barrett and the others have put religion above the public safety and I believe that public safety is the more important of the two.  Religious gatherings should live by the same rules that other gatherings have.   

Church services usually involve sitting for a long time and singing; therefore, there is every reason to expect the virus will spread among the congregants, reducing public safety which means reducing my safety. 

If religious worshipping increases spreading the virus, I may be walking down the same street or shopping in the same store or going to the library and taking out the same books and all this means that my public safety is being jeopardized.  If my chance of getting the virus is increased than yours is too. 

What we need now is science.  It would be helpful to collect data on newly diagnosed Covid-19 and ask when they had last worshipped in a church, synagogue or mosque.  Another consideration is nonreligious groups who gather together for the purpose of  worship. They would be exempt from public health policy. So the circle could be ever widening. 

This ruling is ridiculous.  It shows that the Supreme Court's direction is going backward toward religiosity when the country is moving away from religion.
We have to consider ways to keep their religious sway from stagnating:  term limits?  mandatory retirement age?
increasing size of the SC?"

State and Federal governments cannot determine which entities are religious, or not.  As the 1st has always been understood.
  
So the high court's recent decision opens a Pandora's box. 
  
This SCOTUS now grants special status to any claimed religious entity, and deems of inferior effect the 14th Amendment's requirement for ""equal protection"" by the law for all places of assembly, religious or secular.  

Now every bar and restaurant owner may be ordained by mail order, declare their property a church, then exceed reasonable, temporary attendance limits to protect public health in a deadly pandemic under the police powers granted by the 10th Amendment.


Religious zealots on the Court are not thinking through the consequences of their positions.

But under guise of ""religious freedom"", the court has declared the Governor's action, unconstitutional.  

Scientists, doctors, public health experts, have pretty well identified the means whereby this virus  is propagated.  Wearing of masks,  social distancing, limiting attendance at social  gatherings, including churches, are a means of limiting the spread of the virus. 

But the court, by their error ridden interpretation of the constitution, places religious freedom above agonizing death

trump and his republicans have already ""packed"" the   US Supreme Court.  If we cannot ""unpack"". let's ""repack"" it."
2020-11-26 17:56,"The world would be forgiven if it thought the US was being run as a theocracy.

Whatever happened to the separation of religion and state so that true democracy, freedom, equality, and efficient markets could flourish?"
2020-11-26 18:17,"In the overall scheme of things this probably won't matter much.  The Covid-19 virus is already so widespread that a few thousand people more coming down with it on Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays will hardly be noticeable in the 200,000 or so who contract it every day as it is."
2020-11-26 17:53,Religion vs. science. Why do we elect people who want more social control? Because the majority of republicans don’t understand that they are voting against their own self interest.
2020-11-26 18:02,"I am dismayed to read so many comments from those who believe their personal religious choices take precedence over the faiths as lives of others.  Such people would do well to remember that, without exception, countries that are driven by the tyranny of faith are also stricken by violence and anti-democratic forces. Our Founders had the wisdom to incorporate separation of church and state, as well as freedom of expression, in the Bill of Rights.  The Court today overstepped its bounds in essentially declaring that a church can do just about anything, no matter how destructive of the faith, health, and rights of others. No one has ever said that people cannot worship, but only that during a pandemic, they must limit their numbers in person. Such a time, place and manner limitation, in the face of a more than compelling governmental interest, is consistent with the Constitution and protects the right to life of all of us."
2020-11-26 18:14,"There were religions in the past that practiced human sacrifice.  Would the SCOTUS consider that an acceptable practice today?  Presumably not but then I've been dumbfounded by them before (Citizens United).  So, if not, some restrictions are acceptable including, IMO, large gatherings during a pandemic.

The sooner we recognize religion for the business it is and regulate and tax accordingly the better."
2020-11-26 17:55,"It pains me to think that our Supreme Court justices, theoretically among our most well educated and trained, are incapable, as Justices Gorsuch and Alito demonstrated, in distinguishing between factors surrounding restrictions on a bike repair shop, a wine shop or grocery shopping, vs attending a religious gathering.  Trying to equate a grocery shopping trip to a religious service in terms of time is disingenuous at best.   Critical factors in infection are distance between people, length of contact time, strength of viral load transmission (ie,  talking vs singing, etc.), and touching of the face,etc.  Even if one shops for 2 hours, they generally are socially distanced and not in continuous contact with any one person; they generally are not chanting, singing, yelling, etc, they wear masks, and they can do constant hand cleansing after all contacts with common usage areas.   In a house of worship, we have seen that they consistently have people in close and longer time contact; they expel droplets with greater velocity since there is singing, etc. and they do not necessarily clean their hands after contact with common usage objects or wear masks consistently or effectively. That the justices dismiss these differences, when even a fifth grader can explain them, is a sign of how willing they are to bend their justifications in logically incomprehensible and twisted arguments.  This is both sad and dangerous."
2020-11-26 18:15,The intent of the first amendment was to prevent persecution of religious groups not to place them above the law. The present decision appears to do the latter.
2020-11-26 18:14,"This Supreme Court decision disagrees with the Pope's Easter message carried in today's NYT.

The Pope is right this time. He says it all as best it can be said:

""Yet some groups protested, refusing to keep their distance, marching against travel restrictions — as if measures that governments must impose for the good of their people constitute some kind of political assault on autonomy or personal freedom! Looking to the common good is much more than the sum of what is good for individuals. It means having a regard for all citizens and seeking to respond effectively to the needs of the least fortunate.

""It is all too easy for some to take an idea — in this case, for example, personal freedom — and turn it into an ideology, creating a prism through which they judge everything."""
2020-11-26 18:08,"As much as I fear the current Supreme Court, I am not sure people are reading the whole article here, and frankly the journalist should also have done a better job contrasting the laws in California and Nevada with this NY law.  In California the law restricted religious service to 25% of the building's capacity or 100 people, whichever was lower. Here, it  was 10 people regardless of how big the church was? Given the make-up of our current court, it was clear what this outcome would be - actually, I wonder why it was only 5-4."
2020-11-26 18:20,"Since the Constitution seems to mean different things to different people, why then are we surprised to see different interpretations as Supreme Court justices come and go?  Furthermore, why would we expect the Constitution to be perfect when neither its framers, those who have since amended it, or any of us are not either?  So, I guess, in a democracy governed by a Constitution, it is as with the universe or, as Carl Sagan states:


""The ideal universe for us is one very much like the universe we inhabit. And I would guess that this is not really much of a coincidence."""
2020-11-26 18:33,"While I respect and appreciate Governor Cuomo's strong stance in regard to dealing with COVID I believe that some of his edicts have been ""over the top"".  His approach seems to be overly strict in a number of cases.  For example, his quarantine procedure for people returning from non-contiguous states is obviously unenforceable. He needs to place more emphasis on educating the public regarding risk factors, rather than trying to make decisions for people. Nevertheless, his approach is a lot more sensible than Trump's."
2020-11-26 18:27,Do you think the opinion was “unsigned” because no one wants their name attached to this manslaughter decree? It’s almost like they know they should be ashamed. No one wants the “credit” for the thousands of people who will die because of this.

2020-11-26 18:28,"The courts have been more than willing, as unelected officials, to second guess President Trump. Chief Justice where were you when District Court Judges placed national injunctions on President Trump, absent I believe.

I know see a Chief Justice changing his views as a new administration arrives I have to wonder about your honesty to a nation."
2020-11-26 17:49,Sitting in close proximity to others for an extended period is qualitatively different from shopping in a liquor store or bike shop and easily distinguishable. The majority would fail this fact pattern on a law school exam. Shameful.
2020-11-26 17:26,"Justice Barrett did you perjure yourself before the Congress in your nomination hearings? I heard you described yourself as an originalist, believing the original text of the Constitution should be the basis of all rulings.

The first Amendment says, and I quote (emphasis by capitalization is mine): ""CONGRESS shall make no LAW respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"".

Um, CONGRESS made no LAW in this situation. A governor established a public health regulation. I don't see prohibitions for governors or regulations in that amendment. Can you show me those words? If not, then since CONGRESS made no LAW, the case is open and shut and the plaintiffs lose. That's being an originalist."

 Trump's three SCOTUS appointees want people to congregate closely in churches ,during a pandemic.Will these Justices themselves attend any such church gatherings ?
   If thousands of Science deniers  ( who are mostly GOPers ) catch covid and die,it will be a boon for Democrats. Of course Trump is not capable of this kind of logical thinking ."
2020-11-26 16:18,"I would like to see medical providers refuse care to people who deliberately exposed themselves and others to COVID-19 risk. We are entering a period when healthcare rationing may become a reality. Should I, at 73 go to the back of the line for care so that younger people who deliberately exposed themselves to disease should go ahead of me?
We knew who Amy Barrett was when we saw her attend a Rose Garden ceremony with her entire family unmasked. They flaunt health considerations for their own political gain. If only their political supporters were the only ones put at risk by their reckless, selfish, science-hating rulings, then I would be satisfied; but as the rest of us all know they put health providers and the rest of the public at risk. This is a deliberate decision to kill people in the name of political statements and religious domination."
2020-11-26 18:35,"Full disclosure: I am Roman Catholic. But during the pandemic, I am happy to exercise my religious rights at home, where I can harm no one. 

What shocked the Romans in the early days of the church was that the early Christians cared for each other so. That was unusual for the time. (It would appear it still is.)

But the Catholic church seems to have lost sight of the most important tenet of the faith: care of the other. 

There is a part of me that shrugs and says ""let them get covid, then."" But in fact, they become spreaders, and a bigger burden on the already stretched-thin medical community. The argument that their beliefs are being challenged is thin, worn out and simply not true. The true faith you carry is in your heart."
2020-11-26 18:27,"While I certainly support religious freedom, I'm leery of exercising freedoms in ways that pose risks to others.  The Second Amendment guarantees people the right to own firearms, but not the right to shoot them at anyone within range.  Is the First Amendment aimed at guaranteeing the right to believe as one chooses, or to behave as one chooses?  The virus doesn't care what you believe, but it does spread depending on how you occupy space, particularly enclosed space.  I'm starting to wish decisions could be appealed to a higher level, but the only level higher than the Supreme Court is the material world itself.  It will operate according to natural laws no matter what the Supreme Court says."
2020-11-26 18:29,"If religious gatherings cannot be restricted , then wouldn’t restricting non-religious gatherings also be considered discrimination based on religion? Can this principal now be applied to any restrictions of any behaviors?"

2020-11-26 18:25,"This is not a medical or even legal problem but if the Superior Court of the USA is against the basic principle of the philosophy of the law which is the concept of "" Intentionality "" , then it poses a serious breach of democracy because they just decided or could decide again against principles of democracy for the well being and justice of the nation to favor some groups of private interests or some particular ideology that has nothing to do with the constitutional right .Religion is not a constitutional right. Freedom of religion is a constitutional right .That is a grave confusion ."
2020-11-26 18:23,"Some of these responses presuppose that churches themselves, haven't already enacted social distancing, sanitizing before and after each service and reduced the number of parishioners allowed at any one service. Mine has."
2020-11-26 18:36,"If a religion is really a religion, it can be exercised in any setting -- it doesn't depend on particular locations or conditions to be observed.  In other words, no one's freedom of religion has been impeded by covid-19 restrictions designed to protect the lives and health of everyone.  And Justice Roberts is correct that decisions with respect to public health should be made by representatives of the people, and not unelected judges, who, in this and other cases, are imposing their own religious beliefs on others in an autocratic and dangerous manner.  Amy Barrett is of course a prime example.  She was disingenuous in her confirmation hearings when she said she would give deference to precedent.  But then, she equivocated about that too, suggesting there is binding and not-binding precedent, apparently to be determined by her own personal beliefs and prejudices."
2020-11-26 18:36,"So what are governors supposed to do in response to the shifting rulings of the Supreme court in face of their present crisis?  Must they throw out all of the regulations they have imposed against outrageous gatherings that threaten the public?  Might this same reasoning apply to political gatherings  or any gathering claiming it is religious?  What is a religious gathering anyway/  Will a bar be allowed to post a sign stating it is now the 'Church of Joyful Drinking'.  Originalism should not mean the throwing out reasonable rules to control a pandemic.  If they are unreasonable address that, but it seems the court is now making blanket rulings which do not allow for common sense or the ability of a governor to govern."
2020-11-26 18:29,"The time has come that we must accept the fact some people, for varied reasons, are simply not going to abide by public health orders, period. Now they have the high court at their backs. 

Those of us believing in the science, and the statistics, and understand our First Amendment rights may be inconvenienced, but not violated, must be vigilant and keep ourselves as separated as possible than those that don’t. 

Unfortunately, what the inability to legally impose restrictions will lead to is the shutdown of additional businesses and services that may have been allowed to stay open during the pandemic, and the subsequent loss of jobs. The challenge is how to keep the deniers from appearing at other venues and spreading the virus. I’m not sure this can be done, short of employers and business owners locking down and imposing strict health conditions to enter the places of business. 

It’s a human catastrophe that we live in a fantasy world of accepted lies, turning of heads to something we do not want to see and hear about, and a good portion of our federal government institutions supporting this ignorance. Ultra conservatives are willing to sacrifice lives to prove a point. If everyone would simply get on board, this pandemic could be cornered and it would be over a lot sooner than it’s now going to be. Sadly, we are steadily knocking on the door of 300,000 deaths from the virus."
2020-11-26 18:46,"Here’s a couple thoughts for everyone on both sides of the argument:

1. Read the opinion, it’s only 33 pages in total.
2. Realize that even the minority didn’t fully disagree with the logic, but, simply put didn’t want to act  now.
3. No one knows who wrote the opinion, so stop naming Amy.  Yes, she voted in favor, but there is no name on the opinion.
4. The justices acknowledged it is a tough decision.  
5. Please, please stop claiming everything is driven by fundamentalism.  All the justices did was say, ‘you have a reasonable argument’ so the appeals court needs to allow the litigation to go forward.

Frankly, as a liberal, I think the decision was better reasoned by the majority from a CONSTITUTIONAL point of view."
2020-11-26 18:37,I just can’t see why these people insist on congregating in large groups.  They can have virtual or parking lot services.  People can donate on line or send checks if it’s the donations the churches are worried about losing.  I suspect they are more worried about losing donations or souls or lives.
2020-11-26 18:29,"As a church-goer, my freedom to worship is not more important than my neighbors right to life and health.  During the pandemic, the church I belong to has learned to express worship in a way that protects my neighbor, the very neighbor that both Jewish and Christian scriptures say we are to love as an expression of our shared scriptural mandate to love the Lord.

We did not worship in person for a several months, and learned to use other tools to broadcast to our congregants and neighbors, alike.  Lately, we have worshiped safely in person and through broadcast.  Every other pew is blocked off, and family units are separated from others by social distancing, and we wear masks in worship.

We are not a huge congregation, certainly have never had more than 150 on any given Sunday, and mostly it's 50 - 60 on a good day.  And we are certainly not monetarily rich, yet we love our neighbors in our city, and in other countries.

Please, be concerned less about satisfying egos, and be more about loving one another.  

That is freedom."
2020-11-26 18:38,"This is a misinformed decision.  In the case of the religious strictures the goal is to prevent large congregation, no pun meant.  Bike shops and liquor stores are not destinations for congregation. Although the consequence, which may be limits on the size of assemblies, could safely allow a larger number in a church than a bike store."
2020-11-26 18:41,"This is not a religious issue.  It is a health issue.  The republicans control the Supreme Court and, given the need for Senate confirmations of justices, the republicans will likely control that branch of government for many years."
2020-11-26 18:37,"This is a classic case of Individual Rights trump the Rights of other people to be safe from harm from them.

2020-11-26 18:33,"This non-religious person used to be strongly supportive of religious freedoms. Almost all of the nones that I know were like that. Now, war has been declared against us by the religious right. Consider my support rescinded."
2020-11-26 18:39,"Who holds the true spiritual high ground here?  While the Catholic Diocese and certain synagogues earnestly complain about government's supposed curtailing of their religious freedom,  Pope Francis powerfully observes today on the front page that ""some groups protested, refusing to keep their distance... as if measures that governments must impose for the good of their people constitute some kind of political assault on autonomy or personal freedom! "" (""A Crisis Reveals What is In Our Hearts"", op-ed., Nov. 26) Certain of our Supreme Court justices might consider listening to a wider ranger of religious voices."
2020-11-26 18:40,The problem is the ham-handed approach by the governor.  If it’s a small house of worship then numbers could be low.  By St. Pat’s cathedral holds several thousand people.  Seems like you could get hundreds in there and still maintain social distancing.  Of course he is the wise man who though sending contagious COVID patients to nursing homes was a good idea.
2020-11-26 18:27,It’s safe to assume that mandatory indoor mask wearing soon will be ruled unconstitutional as it strikes at the very heart of citizens’ freedom to infect others with a potentially fatal disease.
2020-11-26 17:44,"Perhaps those in power can strike a deal with the citizens of this country. When they cease to attend indoor dinners in Napa, get their hair done without a mask, admonish the public for gathering during the holidays before jetting off to another state to do so, etc., etc., then they can tell is to not practice our respective religions as we choose. Bravo to the Supreme Court for setting them straight."
2020-11-26 18:47,"I have already commented, but left something out.  This is a statement by trump appointed justice Gorsuch.  In his statement, he points out that liquor stores and bike shops are not subject  to the same restrictions as houses of worship.

If this statement reflects the thinking of Justice Gorsuch, we are in trouble. A house of worship may have hundreds of attendees during  services.  How many people are in a liquor store or bike shop at one time?"
2020-11-26 17:19,"The governor is trying to let people remain in this ""Valley of Tears"", but the Supreme Court seems intent on sending them to ""eternal life""."
2020-11-26 17:20,"And this is just the beginning, next up abortion rights! Our court is now a danger to the freedoms that it proposes to protect. Perhaps the court will merely destroy itself and we can create a progressive version that is not stuck in conservatism with life-time appointments."
2020-11-26 17:11,"I find it sad that church leaders would not encourage people to tend to their souls, their spirits - with love for the health and well being of community at this time, and pray to God.  

Wouldn't the church leaders be of better service tending to the sick? 

Perhaps they need the money from attendance, and subsequent  funeral services. 

Perhaps they'd offer to help pay for the medical expenses foisted upon the larger community of equally precious tax-paying souls."
2020-11-26 17:44,"Just saying we should listen to the scientists, like Biden claims he will do, is not a basis for a lockdown.  I have read a number of comments and am surprised that no one actually cited any scientific evidence to support the governor's orders."

2020-11-26 17:19,"Curiously, the Court's ruling and commentary about it completely ignore the smart, careful, targeted and effective measures taken by New York under Gov. Cuomo's leadership to defeat the huge spring-summer ""first wave"" of the pandemic and try to avoid or mitigate the present ""second wave."" From March to September, the state went from a virtual lockdown of all but essential activities to a gradual reopening by four phases through multiple regions. When NYC entered phase four a couple of months ago, the guidelines permitted gatherings of up to 50 people BUT indoor religious gatherings were allowed at 33 percent of maximum capacity (at least 300 for many larger churches and synagogues, a lot more than 50). Pro sports were permitted to resume, but without fans. AND indoor concerts and entertainment remained banned. Thus, Broadway theaters, Lincoln Center and scores of big and small concert venues are still shut. Far from worship services being discriminated against, they were favored. Then, as the virus began to spread again in certain specific locations, the Governor reimposed additional restructions in targeted zip codes, including dialing back the allowable gathering limits in houses of worship. Keep in mind that everywhere throughout the city and state, large non-religious gatherings (more than 50) remain shut. Thousands of musicians, actors and others remain unemployed. Frankly, it's just despicable that religious leaders have objected to the state's obviously needed actions."
2020-11-26 19:02,"I think that the Court may be sending us down a pretty slippery slope concerning the legality of many other Coronavirus restrictions with this decision.  After all, the First Amendment doesn't just protect the free exercise of religion; it also protects the right to peaceful assembly, freedom of speech and other bedrock individual rights we hold dear.  Given the antipathy that so many Americans have towards any and all of our pandemic restrictions I wouldn't be surprised that  some individuals or groups would challenge these restrictions as a blanket violation of all these rights and hold up this decision as the precedent supporting their challenge.  And  I could see the possibility that the current Court  might be sympathetic to that argument."
2020-11-26 17:55,Religious freedom over the health and safety of others. Another reason why I am an atheist.
2020-11-26 17:45,"The Framers — with their deep knowledge of how infectious diseases spread — originally intended our local governments more carefully parse the risks of virus spread in synagogues and pet stores. That's in the Federalist Papers, I'm pretty sure. Or maybe it's in the plain text of the First Amendment. Either way, let's not let Judicial Activists and the Washington Elite dictate what's best for our local communities! Glad that's settled."
2020-11-26 19:07,"This is a disastrous verdict, not only  for the precedent it sets but, also, for the ones it neglects.  In actual fact, the Court has a long history of frowning on religious practices that broadly impact society.  The issue at stake here is not the freedom to practice one's religion but, rather, the impact of one's religious practice on the broader society.  It is easy to envision this decision being subsequently used to support arguments that will dismay those who are presently pleased with the Court's action.  The reasoning that it employs is sophomoric at best."
2020-11-26 18:17,Strange. The Pope recently urged people to care about others and follow Covid-19 related restrictions. He said not doing so is an act of selfishness. He also said the same type of people who take to the streets to protest restrictions are the same people who would never protest George Floyd's death.  New York's guidelines make a lot of sense. The Court's decision does not.
2020-11-26 17:22,"We're in a sorry state when our religious institutions will not prioritize people's lives.  

While the NY Archdiocese seems to have no problem killing its parishioners, the Archdiocese of Santa Fe has followed the edicts of New Mexico governor Michelle Lujan-Grisham and closed it's churches to protect the lives of it's followers, noting the higher mortality rates among people of color."
2020-11-26 18:07,"Safety and the sanctity of life supersedes piety. Orthodox Judaism practices observance of the Sabbath, in which Jews abstain from driving motor vehicles. However, if an observant Jew needed to be rushed to a hospital, Jewish law recognizes that such an urgency required the breaking of that Sabbath requirement."
2020-11-26 18:42,"It never ceases to shock me of the religious bias of the conservative judges on the supreme court.

Simply put, if any cases of COVID-19 related deaths are isolated and traced back to contacts from religious gatherings, those judges who voted in favor of it, despite sound medical advice to the contrary which is necessary to control the deadly pandemic, have BLOOD on their hand. 

Blame them for those deaths in future. Pure and simple."

2020-11-26 17:24,"People who do not believe a particular right is important are quite free to rationalize why it should be taken away.  Here, it’s pretty clear that liberal folks don’t place much importance on the rights to assembly if the purpose is religious.  Oddly, these are the same folks who find the 2nd amendment offensive and would be fine to eliminate that right, but paradoxically  find political assembly, looting, and protests fine (unless it is for Trump), arguing that shoulder to shoulder outdoors is “safer,” which is likely untrue.  And of course, these same folks think it’s dandy for our governors to attend group meals, have family over for Thanksgiving, and for Senators to prance about without masks.  Utter hypocrisy.  Laws are meant to apply a standard, which is exactly what SCOTUS has done."

When the population as a whole shops for groceries, gets medical or dental care, goes to the bank or to their jobs, they deserve to be protected from contagion -- for the public good.  This decision by the Supreme Court belies the public good, for the good of a few."

2020-11-26 18:48,"Why are Americans so keen on seeing things through the lens of infractions on their freedoms? Even in a pandemic a health measure to curb it becomes a question of religious freedom. 
If the diocese really cared for its members maybe it look for ways to uphold their freedom from coronavirus. 
This is yet another example of a selfish society where people only want rights and no obligations in return."
2020-11-26 18:55,I am OK with this. We have had to deal with restrictions since March - with no end in sight. To what extent are people responsible for their own safety? We can't continually prohibit freedoms; like assembling or running businesses. They disproportionally affect some. Not to mention the hypocrisy of justifying large protests as OK.
2020-11-26 19:06,Ironic how the conservative court justices religious views that affected their decision could ultimately put many congregants lives in danger.  Common sense doesn't appear to be at a premium with those justices.
2020-11-26 19:07,"Make no mistake, this had nothing to do with worship and everything to do with revenue.  That collection plate, passed through the congregants at every service is the life blood of these institutions.  No Sunday services, no collection plate and we can't have that, can we?  There's a reason, especially with pastors of mega-churches that they live in multi-million dollar homes and some even have their own jets.  The press for services is all about the money, not saving souls or providing real comfort.  These people will attend packed services, be exposed, go back into their communities and expose other, truly innocent, people.  Every service will now churn out a few bio-weapons after the homily.  

I have a great deal of difficulty seeing that expanded privilege as any sort of freedom but really just a new, and potentially deadly, form of tyranny."
2020-11-26 18:52,"Unfortunately some synagogues in NYC haven't practiced mask wearing, social distancing and other accepted public health measures that save lives. As a result, NYC has seen a rise in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths.

   Gov Cuomo was put in an impossible position. If he restricted attendance at the synagogues only, he would have been accused of prejudice against one religion. So he ordered restrictions at all houses of worship. The Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn rightly objected. They were complying with all the restrictions in all their churches. Why should they have more restrictions?

   So they sued, and won. 

   And now what will happen? All houses of worship will be allowed to go back to the same restrictions that were in place before this latest surge. And the Catholic Churches will continue to comply with the common sense mask wearing and social distance public health rules. And those synagogues that originally violated these rules? What will they do? And if they continue to flout the rules, all of us will suffer.

   I think our new President, Joe Biden, put it best. We are at war with a virus, not with each other."
2020-11-26 18:56,"""Where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst.""   Jesus said nothing about churches, cathedrals, choirs, praise bands,  or bishops.   All that got layered on long after he left this earth.

2020-11-26 19:01,"Seeing this decision by this Court, I'm afraid those judges may even agree with Trump if he files an appeal to overturn the election's results. I know it's unlikely and it would not make sense, but this decision does not make sense either.  This when you take into account their previous decision concerning California and Nevada went into the opposite direction. I also disagree when they said that Mr. Cuomo “singled out a particular religion for blame and retribution for an uptick in a societywide pandemic.” Those restrictions were equally applied to all religious congregations.  I'm sure Trump is now telling his lawyers to find something, some argument, that would make this past election unfair to him and the Republicans and invalidate that which made it ""unfair""."

With Barrett on the Court, Roberts is not in a position to be the decider any more. Thank goodness."
2020-11-26 19:09,"Honestly I think the liberal outrage is unwarranted. 
People have a right to congregate without state intervention. 
The state has no right to stop people from assembly whether it be religious, personal or political.  
Churches or temples can institute a mask wearing and glove policy on their own. They are private institutions and can refuse entry should they choose just like private businesses and people’s private homes. 
Everyone needs to calm down."

It may take a generation, but as and when the pendulum of power swings it will be up to a re-empowered citizenry to get the heel of the Supreme Court, already packed by a Republican Senate majority which is in turn in its very structure is anti-majoritarian, of our necks by reducing the term of Justices, increasing the number of Justices, and setting the courts in their rightful constitutional place."
2020-11-26 19:18,"Neil Gorsuch, concurring, wrote (discussing what kind of constitutional test to apply):

""Here, that means strict scrutiny:  The First Amendment traditionally requires a State to treat religious exercises at least as well as comparable secular activities unless it can meet the demands of strict scrutiny—showing it has employed  the  most  narrowly  tailored  means  available  to  satisfy a compelling state interest.""

Taking the good Justice at his word, what are ""comparable secular activities""? Concerts, cinema, and arena sports come to mind. Grocery shopping, medical services, and transportation (even bicycle transportation) do not seem to be comparable. Unless, of course, your mind is already made up and you're primary purpose is to shoehorn your idea into the Constitution's structure.

This does damage to the Constitution. Conflating religious gathering with secular activity is wrong. Everyone, religious, secular, or indifferent, engages in ""secular activity,"" while only a few engage in religious activity. They are the odd ones out (the religious). Gorsuch's admonition to treat ""comparable"" religious and secular activity similarly should be taken seriously, and narrowly."

Knowledge and reason are the best tools to apply in the present dangerous situation not the protection of dogmas born of self-induced ignorance."
2020-11-26 16:09,"Separation of church and state—is that one of the arguments? Well, it seems they didn’t consider the burden the church will now put on the state as covid cases increase.

Don’t even get me going on “right to life...”"
2020-11-26 16:54,"If g-d is everywhere, where does it matter where you worship?

2020-11-26 16:55,"Maybe the Supreme Court is correct, churches are little different from liquor stores, gun shops, etc.  They all just peddle different forms of inebriation.  In America, freedom is just a fancy word meaning instant self-gratification, despite the costs to one's own health and the health of others.  Public officials rightly try to curtail the self-destructive behavior.  The Supreme Court has basically decreed that that behavior should serve as its own lesson, and to heck with the collateral damage."

They are free to bring the virus into the church, spread it among the parishioners and take it back out into the public. They are free to risk the death of their fellow citizens where worship is concerned but not their fellow restaurant or bar patrons. We hope the intelligent ones continue to stay home despite Justice Barrett's and Justice Gorsuch's and Kavanaugh and Thomas's confounding disregard of fact."
2020-11-26 16:25,"Welcome to the new American theocracy.

What happened to the SCOTUS decision in Employment Decision v. Smith that ruled that just because a law by happenstance conflicts with a religious belief, in this case the general outlawing of peyote usage, does not mean it violates the 2nd Amendment. 

As SCALIA, the author of the opinion, wrote:

""The government's ability to enforce generally applicable prohibitions of socially harmful conduct, like its ability to carry out other aspects of public policy, ""cannot depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious objector's spiritual development."" Lyng, supra, 485 U.S., at 451, 108 S.Ct., at 1326. To make an individual's obligation to obey such a law contingent upon the law's coincidence with his religious beliefs, except where the State's interest is ""compelling""—permitting him, by virtue of his beliefs, ""to become a law unto himself,"" Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S., at 167—contradicts both constitutional tradition and common sense.....

Any society adopting such a system would be courting anarchy....The rule respondents favor would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind ranging from compulsory military service, to the payment of taxes, to HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATION...

This decision contradicts a long and consistent and constitutionally correct line of SCOTUS decisions (as Scalia pointed out).

Stare decisis anyone?"
2020-11-26 19:24,"Neither the nuns nor priest told me, when I attended Catholic school for many years, that god could not hear those who prayed at home. The free exercise of religion does not require that you occupy a closed space for one or two hours, or more, during a pandemic. The NYS rules limiting religious gatherings indoors were less stringent than those applied to sports arenas, movie theaters, and other indoor spaces where people gather.

This is a terrible ruling and will kill people. Shame on the SCOTUS majority for causing even more deaths than we are already at risk to incur."
2020-11-26 19:13,"Religious services are dangerous because people sit together for a relatively long period of time, and they sing (for some denominations/religions), which increases the virus load exhaled. In contrast, one can purchase liquor in just a few minutes. That is the common-sense logic for restricting religious services but not liquor stores. Religious people go overboard in seeing everything as a threat to their religion."
2020-11-26 19:23,"Well, if we find hospitals overtaxed and morgues having to get refrigerated trucks to hold some of the newly dead by Christmas, maybe the new conservative majority on the Court will revisit their thinking. What is being conserved here, anyway?  Certainly not our nation's ability to respond to the reality of a pandemic. Just wait till: our coasts are flooded by severe storms and by tidal flooding with the ocean's rise; till flood/drought/fires make our agriculture less productive; till minorities rebel against innocent family members being executed in our streets by law enforcement; till a pandemic emerges that no vaccine can stop;till the economy finally reflects the financial displacement wrought by Trump's denial and dithering about Covid. People are going to want a capable, funded, competent government to help with all the needs we will experience. And they won't be resorting to calling Democrats ""socialist"" when they are desperately needing help."

Let's see.  Will there be six foot ""X""s down the aisles?  Masks? What about limiting the number of congregants in each row?  Will the lip of the communal cup be optimally sanitized? 

5 minutes in a liquor store with mandated distancing, ditto bike shops -- both of which, in my opinion, contribute to the common good -- are not in any way comparable to extended hours of worship, singing, etc.  

If attendance in churches can be limited, really limited, as it is in are all other enterprises, then okay.  Otherwise, let another case testing this decision come before this court, on this subject, again and again."
2020-11-26 19:13,"I am surprised at the speciousness of Gorsuch's argument. It's not liquor versus religion; it's the character of the behavior in the venue which counts. People are in and out of a store in a relatively short time and speak little. People at religious services stay for an hour or more, reciting and singing, which spreads the virus through increased respiratory activity. This is merely reason and science, which appears to escape Gorsuch's righteous indignation."
2020-11-26 19:25,We have three conservative justices who were all selected and elected under shady political maneuvers by Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans. It is difficult for me to accept any opinion delivered by a Supreme Court when the very deliberate selection of three justices was made to perpetuate the bias of a Republican Senate in some cases in disregard of  the will  of the majority of  Americans.
2020-11-26 19:15,"Folks who defy public health recommendations and attend religious services indoors should keep away from the rest of us and forego health care services when they get sick.

Apparently the justices can’t tell the difference between religion and the buildings they erect. What religion can’t be practiced outside of buildings or in small groups?
Apparently the justices also missed the words of the Preamble indicating that among the PURPOSES of the Constitution is “to promote the general welfare.” Surely this was Governor Cuomo’s intent in trying to impose a temporary restriction on large gatherings that threaten to spread the pandemic, including those held in churches. Doesn’t this justify the order on Constitutional grounds?
I’m sorry to see there are church groups, mostly nominally “Christian,” that cannot see that large gatherings of their followers—especially within confined, though often large, spaces, while COVID 19 grows ever more rampant, is a threat to the health of their fellow citizens. These groups, if “loving thy neighbor” is a key tenet of their beliefs, should be out leading everyone in the country to engage in practices that can stem the spread of the virus—voluntarily. This might have pre-empted the need for the Governor’s order in the first place."

It's the cult aspect.  Laws are to protect all of us.  These churchgoers could easily become super spreaders.  This decision does not protect all Americans but panders to the over-emotional needs of a few who are egged on by religious leaders who need their money to support lavish life styles and puts many people in danger.  The bible says ""where two or three..."" not congregations.

People can be in and out of a store in a matter of minutes and are more able to mask and safely distance.  They don't sing, don't need to sit still inside for an hour or talk.  Comparing going into a store to a church service is nonsense."

The irony: That her presumptive religious leader, Pope Francis, would be the first to point out to her the lack of compassion, love, and charity in this ruling leave alone concern for social welfare. And how is she following Christ’s urging to Caesar what is Caesar’s, to God what is God’s? A more pragmatic statement about the separation of Church and State couldn’t be clearer and one that helped humanity to find its way out of pernicious and deadening theocracies.

From a legal perspective, this is yet another erroneous and, ironically, unconstitutional ruling by the hyper conservative SCOTUS that began with the Nixon administration and which has turned out to be so corrosive to US society. It has become an integral component of a ruling minority elite that has gerrymandered, voter suppressed, demagogued its way into power.

And to add insult to injury, it’s a Per Curiam opinion: I don’t know now, but in my time in law school and practicing law, per curiam opinions made our lips curl in disdain because their authorlessness allows justices to cower under its cover and eludes accountability for having lied under oath at appointment hearings."
2020-11-26 16:24,"Judging from Barrett's votes so far, she has proved me right:  She will always rule in favor of religion and its practices.

All religions should be treated alike, which, in this case, should mean they have to, at the very least, adhere to social distancing and wear masks.  Why should they be allowed total exception, with no restrictions, which, it seems, is what they're being permitted to do.

In the name of a god, they ask for privileges when, truthfully, other businesses besides religions lose money as well as camaraderie, during a very trying time in American and worldwide histories.

I hope they'll at least be cautious.  If the virus is spread because of this decision, then who will they blame -- God or themselves, and if it's their god, then will someone say it's God's way of punishing us instead of accepting the -- whoops, sorry -- scientific evidence?

Throughout history, we've seen the good and the awful from religions and science, and mistakes already have been noted from both during struggles to curb, and hopefully, end this virus.

For believers who want to congregate, please help keep all of us safe by at least practicing some physical distancing and wearing masks.  You can't leave ""curing"" only to God."

2020-11-26 15:09,"These religious exemptions, especially for the Roman Catholic Church are out of hand. Far too much leeway is being given for Organized Religions to skip basic, and decent behavior as Citizens of the US. 

If the RCC really cared about flock, their pew-sitters it would spend its time and energies and resources on helping their adherents grapple with the real world as believers, and not trying to alter, thru legal force, the real world to their religiously skewed tenets. 

But that's the SOP of all the Christian sects, esp. in the US in recent history Not working hard at being better practitioners of their faith in what they see as a sinful secular society, but try and force the World to adhere to their doctrines. To make the World less of a temptation to their adherents. ""We cant be better Christians unless we reshape the World to our, disparate, religious beliefs."" 

And the Repubs, sponsored by their (White) Christian Nationalist donors have been working towards jhat ends for many decades now. And with Barret, have reached an inflection point. The US Judicial system should be on the side of public safety and health, not on the side of what only appear to be powerful Christian Organizations, and very non-necessary, nuances of their practices. Being required to go to a Church is a RCC thing, not one mandated by Jesus. In fact, of the rare times he was specific it was on how to and where to worship. In private.

There is no requirement to worship in groups, its a tradition."
2020-11-26 19:27,"Gorsuch: ""..there is no world in which the Constitution tolerates color-coded executive edicts..""

Gorsuch aims his Righteous Indignation Theater upon a useful device.  A color code system (""orange to red"") quickly disseminates that BOTH - the threat/risk status and the public health authority's response HAVE GONE TO MAXIMUM.

So easy to prove the emptiness of Gorsuch's GRAND STAND on the useful device:

""..there is no world in which the Constitution tolerates numerically-coded executive edicts..""

""..there is no world in which the Constitution tolerates alphabetically-coded executive edicts..""

When Gorsuch mocks the device (color code), he is attempting to add another symbol that RAISES THE IRE of the He-Man-Mask-Haters Club.

Gorsuch's tawdry affair with Limbaugh-esque demonizing of executives of the Democratic persuation --- is what we can expect henceforth .

Getting public opinion to HATE the color code (Cuomo) is part of SELLING the identify of a RELIGIOUS Majority in the SC.  THAT is THE political strategy; and all of Trump's SC appointments will be grandstanding for Republican ownership of Christianity."
2020-11-26 19:30,"To all of you having Thanksgiving dinner, may the only turkey present be one on the table!

I don't know the precise details of Cuomo's order, but the statements by Gorsuch certainly leave room for  a reworded order that might well pass muster with the Court.

The Constitution's First Amendment statement on religion was meant to prohibit the Federal Government, and through the 14th Amendment the State governments, from preferencing one religion over another. It was not meant to preference any religion over secular authorities.

The Court has traditionally avoided overruling legislative and executive determinations of fact with their own. It seems in this case they have violated that principle but, again, I have not read the wording of Cuomo's order nor have most of the Justices explained their reasoning.

Perhaps what we need is a religious group, (Neo-Aztecs ?) to say they are going to sacrifice virgins as part of their religious traditions. Let's see how the Supreme Court deals with that."

This majority made of laypeople in the realm of infectious diseases and epidemiology has taken it upon itself in its ignorance to make a determination that will result in the loss of myriad lives, succumbing to petty personal biases at the expense of the welfare of our nation, willingly complicit with our equally benighted commander in chief to give no real consideration to what is in the best interest of the public at large.

I live in Washington, a relatively liberal state. Yet here, as in many places, if you travel outside of the limits of cities, you see few masks, scant social distancing, crowded stores. I'm exhausted by it. I believe it's time to start providing serious legal protections for our health care workers and system. Pass whatever emergency regulations are needed to prevent them from overworking themselves and working without proper PPE. Where hospitals are nearly overwhelmed, place guards around the parking lots if need be. Then launch some social messaging that people should stay home if they get sick. They can phone their local hospital and if a bed is available, fine, they can come to the ER. Meanwhile, put some mobile health resources out into the hot spots, by all means. But the bottom line should be that reckless or thoughtless people shouldn't be allowed to risk the lives of our nursers, doctors, and staff."

Among many remarks which seem almost eerily relevant to the decision, the Pope writes:

""It is all too easy for some to take an idea-in this case, for example personal freedom-and turn it into an ideology, creating a prism through which they judge everything.""  

Pope Francis also discusses ""tragedies that may seem distant from us"" but which ""affect the whole of humanity"" and that ""sadly, fail to move us to change our agendas and priorities.""

I'm an areligious person and a firm believer in separation of church and state.  Even so, the Pope's moving, empathic essay commanded my admiration and respect, while this grossly irrational, uninformed, hurtful Supreme Court decision left me shocked and  fearful."
2020-11-26 19:32,"Seems most of the commenters here have no idea what this decision holds. The Court did not rule that churches may now hold packed services, with everyone cheek to jowl. The religious organizations had limited their attendance to 25-33 percent of capacity, with social distancing, mask wearing and other precautions. Yet the Governor nevertheless said only 10-25 people could attend, even in a cathedral that holds hundreds, while hundred of people could mill about a department store. All this with no evidence that a religious service that observes the restrictions noted above has resulted in transmission of the virus.

Religious services were clearly being unfairly restricted, the decision was correct."
2020-11-26 19:40,"Religious freedom is in the Constitution.  So is the constitutional right to petition the courts for redress of grievances.  Does the Supreme Court open its doors and allow dozens of people to sit in its courtroom? No, of course not.

Courthouses around the country have adopted new rules and procedures on how to limit access to court buildings, delay trials, and conduct hearings via video.  I see no constitutional problem with placing similar limits on physical attendance at religious services."

In this case such decision without doubt must be to keep people alive so they can excesise their right to religious freedom. The ongoing Covid disaster in the Orthodox Church obviously was not warning enough.

The Court has already strongly signaled this proclivity in the decision that ironically ruled that government and private organizations cannot discriminate against employees on the basis of sex as well as race, color, national origin and religion (Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia). Gorsuch in that decision suggested that an exception would be carved out for religious groups using the First Amendment's free exercise of religion clause, allowing such groups to discriminate as they see fit. Alito's statements recently to the Federalist Society confirm this. This would run contrary to the values and principles we hold dear in this country. Perhaps it is time to consider adding seats to the SCOTUS. The judiciary has been strapped in its ability to handle the huge caseload that it faces, and it may be time to bring the Court into the modern era."

The right of public health officials to protect the public health has long been recognized as a legitimate exercise of authority.

Religious gatherings are proven super spreader events - witness the unforgivably reckless Satmer sect crowds in Brooklyn. 

Good faith attempts to protect the public from such events are not unconstitutional except in the minds of extremist ideologues like the five justices who now control the Court.

2020-11-26 18:47,"SCOTUS conservatives have effectively curtailed the ability of state governments to tailor public safety measures that best meet the needs of their citizens. Their argument in favor of injunction of restrictions on religious gatherings boils down to a notion of equivalence between religious gatherings and the myriad of services people need in their daily lives. They equate buying groceries with religious gathering. They equate a trip to the emergency room as equally necessary with attendance of religious service.

The supremes attempt to denigrate the distinction between religious gathering and the category of ""essential"" business activity by picking out liquor stores, campgrounds and acupuncture clinics. J Gorsuch in particular exhibits a breathtaking ignorance of non-traditional medical practice and its importance to minorities in this country.

Following the logic of this ruling, SCOTUS is prepared to force starvation on us all instead of allowing states to decide what activities threaten public health. Governors can't shut down churches without closing down grocery stores and hospitals. Ridiculous. I'm now of the opinion that the majority has had their mental health and powers of reason affected by over-soaking in the hot tub of religious excess."

Me First has always been wrapped in the flag and the Constitution, but the ideal which the flag and the Constitution, and, yes, Christ himself. stand for is ""You First."" This call for a Christian nation, as if becoming one will cure all of our ills, is a concept that is itself entirely ""Me First"" and is so anathematic to Christ's teaching that it doesn't warrant further discussion. This pandemic demands that we put Other above Self as if lives depended on it. Standing on ""rights"" is just one dog whistle to ""Me First."" We are finally beginning to hear voices calling out in the wilderness to rethink our motives and come together as a nation to defeat the spread of this virus and stop fighting each other. Christ  calls us to unity, still honoring our diversity. Lincoln did too. Both died for their stand. But if we don't risk what they risked to bring this nation  together, death is inevitable.

That freedom includes exposing themselves, their families and their friends, to the most deadly pandemic in a century. Nevertheless, their thoughts and prayers will be with those who fall ill and die.

It survives because e.g. it affects the vulnerable in greater numbers, because it affects the older in greater numbers, because most are asymptomatic. With these characteristics, the virus finds a way to exploit human greed and fear. Accordingly the virus assumes the mirage of a useful means by which the wealthy and advantaged can gain further advantage.

Thus the virus has found a way to utilize and exploit human greed and selfishness in order to facilitate its spread.

Steven Miller's ""imperfect instrument"", along with Mitch's decades crusade to impose his will on all of us have combined to bring us Amy Coney Barrett who, through her ideology has disabled our government's ability to resist the viral spread.

In order to write my opinion I consulted some preceptos or obligations of Catholics. One of them is the obligation of assist Mass on Sundays. These rules were made in the Middle Ages when people lived in rural areas, scarcely populated; today not even 20% of all the Catholics in a municipality can fit in a Church on Sunday. In New York where millions claim to be Catholic not even 1% can fit on the available churches on Sunday. 99% are committing a sin! Then there is the principle of the lesser of two evils. In Catholic morality you are supposed to choose the less harmful even if both are sins. Avoiding mass on Sunday is lesser evil than going to Church and causing harm including death to the general public. Most Catholics and even priests and Bishops ignore that conscience is the deciding factor to consider an action a sin, no absolute precepts of the Church, according to my textbook on Catholic Morality! I ask all the Bishops to obey the authorities in the rules they establish to control the pandemic that has caused 240,000 deaths. It is a sin otherwise."

The Supreme Court should not have taken up the issue; time will provide the solution.

Seriously, if you believe you can identify the source (spreader) of your Covid-19 illness trace their behavior and whereabouts during the 14 or more days before your encounter with them:  You may have both grounds and proof of reckless spreading of the disease and reckless endangerment.  
The Supreme Court opinion simply states the NY 10 people or less ban discriminated against places of worship.  It does not absolve anyone who attends worship services or related gatherings of fault if they willingly expose themselves to possible Covid-19 contamination and knowingly or accidentally expose others.  
In short, if anyone knowingly and willingly attends a crowded worship service, bar, family gathering, etc. amid all the pandemic safety warnings, they are open to liability, lawsuits, and the payment of damages to those they later infect and harm."

How is this different than defying a public health order concerning a deadly virus?

There's no restriction of free belief or free expression in a public health order. Free association is often limited for public safety reasons -- in this case a temporary one. 

This is a naked attack on the rights of the non-extremists and the ability of democratically elected governments to protect citizens from imminent threats.

The very first sentence in 1st Amendment says, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” Throughout this pandemic, I have been confounded by the idea that hundreds and thousands can gather in the streets and protest, hundreds can shop in Walmart and Lowe’s,  but people of faith would initially see their churches completely shut down and later have numerical and spatial limits on their exercise of religion. Lest anyone think Wednesday’s ruling was conservative, I would remind you that William O. Douglas understood the words, “no law” to mean no law.

2020-11-26 16:55,Restricting the number of congregants in a church does not impinge on religious freedom. Who decided that praising God must be done inside a church? Not Jesus.
2020-11-26 19:57,This court is a long haul symptom of Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS). Most other symptoms will be gone by January.
2020-11-26 19:57,Freedom of religion does not confer the right to spread a deadly virus during a pandemic. The restriction is not on the religion but on breathing on others in an enclosed space where individuals remain in static positions for extended periods of time enabling the virus to significantly saturate the air in the vicinity of an infected person thereby spreading to numerous other people in the surrounding area.
2020-11-26 19:57,"I don't believe that granting this injunction advanced religious freedom or set back the cause of public safety. Its only impact was to reassert the Court's readiness to rein in assertions of excessive government power when they intrude on fundamental rights, even in the face of a real emergency.         

In reality,  Cuomo should revise and re-issue his poorly-constructed color-coded formula for restrictions, and when faced with the inevitable new lawsuit,  should be prepared to demonstrate in court why it no longer treats religion  less favorably than other businesses."
2020-11-26 16:26,"The church saves “souls”, not lives. This ruling allows the church to expedite this process."
2020-11-26 15:48,"This ‘system’ of ours is laughable, outdated and irrelevant.  To compare a bike shop to a religious gathering is something that even SNL could not come up with.  In a pandemic there is but one amendment that applies and that it is to curb it."
2020-11-26 19:29,"Justice Sotomayor's dissent exposed the falsehood of the Gorsuch quote about bike shops and liquor stores. Basically, it contradicts the science and just makes stuff up: i.e. large numbers off people don't talk, sing and congregate closely for hours in those commercial places like they do in religious places of worship.

The dissent also exposed large mistakes in the citing of precedents by Kavanaugh.

And the story ignored the money quote from the dissent:

""Justices of this Court play a deadly game in second guessing the expert judgment of health officials about the environments in which a contagious virus, now infecting a million Ameri- cans each week, spreads most easily.""

The Supreme Court is now under the control of right wing activist religious zealots."
2020-11-26 15:42,Worshipers and parishioners  are left to make their own decisions and judgements to attend worship if they truly want to be safe from infection. The Supreme court failed and the religious institutions that brought suit should be ashamed.
2020-11-26 16:55,Something tells me the Supreme Court doesn't practice what it preaches. Why not open up all the hearings to all who want to attend?
2020-11-26 17:48,Is this really about money - that people will not make contributions to churches if they are worshipping safely from home and not seeing others contributing? Otherwise I cannot understand why any caring religion would not want its followers to be safe and not risk their lives. No wonder the US leads the world in deaths and infections.
2020-11-26 17:59,"The current majority of the Supreme Court will defend to the end a blastocyst in a Petrie dish yet when it comes to basic regulations for protecting the public health from the coronavirus they stretch the meaning of religious freedom to an absurd degree. We never saw reasoning like this from the courts during the polio epidemic in the 40’s and 50’s. 
I’d hate to see how they would rule on say a religious sect who engaged in FGM. “Of course it’s their right and those little girls, well tough”."
2020-11-26 18:10,Time to expand the court. This ruling is perverse and dangerous on many levels. This cannot be allowed to continue.
2020-11-26 19:12,"Sadly our highest court has five individuals who lack common sense, not to mention any basic understanding of rudimentary science.  It is pretty clear that America was never all that great as some like to espouse.  Self centered folks abound in our nation.  You can see this selfish behavior daily in our so called leaders."
2020-11-26 15:55,"So it starts. One rule for the church, another for the state. 
It is, of course, unsustainable in the long run and the Supreme Court has failed miserably in being supreme."
2020-11-26 16:11,"The color-coded restrictions, now deemed illegal, was a ridiculous concept in the first place.  The virus does not adhere to being restricted in some places and not others.  And the people living in red zones were allowed to travel freely to orange zones or any other zones.  And thousands did so.  It was never based on science.  It was based solely on an the knee-jerk reaction of an overly political figure, Andrew Cuomo.  His mismanagement of the pandemic is appalling."
2020-11-26 17:59,"the church by my house has a sign that says “you are safe here” - the people that go there are the people who’s kids still go to daycare and playdates unmasked, the people who gather with friends indoors, go to gyms with paper over the windows and don't care about social distancing. these people already have risky behavior. this is a tinder box."
2020-11-26 16:27,This is about freedom of fundamentalist religion. Other religious people are finding ways to practice their faiths without gathering indoors in large groups for about an hour.
2020-11-26 17:21,"Maybe those who are “protesting” churches being open go and actually see how these churches actually social distance during services. And see how everyone is wearing a mask.￼ Maybe they would not be so quick to judge those religious folks who attend.￼ Of course, I am sure that many of these people wouldn’t step foot in a church under any circumstances. Case closed.￼"
2020-11-26 16:00,"The failure to be able to distinguish between a small retail business and a mass gathering pace with close seating is appalling,  People don't normally blare out singing spreading their virus laden breaths in liquor stores or bike shops.

The leave your mind at the door crowd now sits in a majority position on the Supreme Court. I really don'r care if every single religious congregant drops dead of Covid-19. I care tremendously that these same people will shop at grocery stores and other public places before they do spreading their pestilence freely."

2020-11-26 17:04,"So, my Constitutional freedoms are secondary to which religion now?  Gee, I didn't know my association to God, or whatever divine being I choose to worship, required that I attend a crowded venue that endangers other worshippers, their families, friends, and other that may associated with them through my contact with a pestilence.

The utter selfishness is complete hypocrisy to the teachings of any religion.  It's tragic irony that secular types are respecting other human life by staying isolated and practicing physical distancing, mask wearing, and hand sanitization."
2020-11-26 17:59,"Freedom of religion does not cancel out my right to LIFE, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Why should millions of people’s health and lives be put in jeopardy to accommodate those who care so little for our lives? 
I am not the first person to point out the hypocrisy of the religious conservatives who worry more about the unborn fetus, than they worry about the people who are here now. 
Mile long lines of people waiting at food pantries and for Covid testing, should concern the “pious and the righteous” as much as they care about religious gathering super spreader events.
To those who say, God will take care of us, I say, God gave man a brain to think, reason and understand science and logic.
This court will usher in a second Dark Ages.  To borrow a line from their play book, God help us!!"
2020-11-26 18:30,What does it say about a faith that values worship attendance over the health of their followers and the community?
2020-11-26 15:59,"No one is restricting your right to pray. Ms Barrett brought her children to a super spreader event,and does not seem to understand basic epidemiology. Who will defend our overworked health care workers?"
2020-11-26 17:03,"Here's what I don't understand.  It's called hypocrisy.

The majority of the ""new"" US Supreme Court has decided that an individual's right to practice their religion in a large and potentially huge religious congregation during a deadly, deadly very contagious virus spread by viral droplets is just fine. 

So religion ""trumps"" life, that is, the life of others outside of and not participating in those events.  Because one sure thing we know is that such events are spreaders and often super-spreaders of the virus.

So, the right of a person who wants to pray in a group is given greater value than any one who doesn't?
Why not just give the religious weapons to use to kill those not there in their religious gathering?
Essentially, it is the same thing as the Covid-19 virus is an unseen weapon attacking people, and killing them and destroying the quality of  life of those who recover if they're lucky.

And, let's see:  When it comes to the right of a woman to choose what to do with her body, all of a sudden  protecting life is supreme. Hmmm....hypocrisy."
2020-11-26 15:29,"Neil Gorsuch is correct when he says, “It is time — past time — to make plain that"" the conservative wing of the Supreme Court should sit, shoulder-to-shoulder, with other congregants who believe in God and not the covid-19 virus.  Then the majority of citizens of this country won't be forced to pack the court in order to restore rational  thinking and common sense.  For some reason, the notion of ""separation of church and state"" doesn't seem to exist for conservatives.
However I did miss the moment when the world went back in time, ""past time,"" to the Dark Ages?  Obviously Gosuch and Barrett didn't."
2020-11-26 18:07,"Based on these comments, New York Times readers all have the same point of view. I find it sad that its partisan news coverage has resulted in driving off the views of half of the country. Also don’t recall much equality in application of “the science”. It doesn’t apply to protests or Biden celebrations, but does apply to motorcycle rallies. Doesn’t apply to Cuomo or Newsom (I mean, everyone knows Michelin three star restaurants can’t spread the virus.) Private schools are safe; other kids can fall behind. Mega stores are open; small businesses have to sacrifice their very existence. Hmm."

At least church members will be allowed to pack in for funerals."

2020-11-26 18:25,"There is only one appropriate way for healthcare workers to respond to this decision. Quit your jobs. Take a well deserved break. Stay at home till a vaccine is available and you have received it. In the meantime, let the Supreme Court and the churches/synagogues treat the sick and the dying."
2020-11-26 16:45,"So now public health laws mean nothing? The supreme court has overruled government supremacy, given in to organized idiocy and has trumped good sense for placating the most base among us. When the pandemic rages out of control there will be no tears shed for the victims and also no ventilators for the desperate among us who exercised their ""rights"" and ignored their responsibilities not to worsen a plague of biblical magnitude. Blessed are the meek, and the weak minded, but they have no business governing."

2020-11-26 16:46,"The Republicans were right all along to be shocked -shocked!- that we should in any way be concerned about the voices that Amy Barrett hears in her head. 

It is crystal clear that ABC's religious convictions had nothing to do with her decision in this case."
2020-11-26 17:09,"Well this is just silly.  ALL group events should be subject to the SAME public health restrictions.  It is perfectly reasonable for churches to complain if they are being treated differently.  At the same time, those who think their religious liberty is being infringed, might take an honest look at how much freedom we have to worship in this country."
2020-11-26 18:39,"Ridiculous absence of judicial wisdom. No religion is being threatened here by the state.  How does “free exercise of religion” include the right to disregard the life and safety of all other citizens.

So much for originalism as anything more than a phony cover story.  Maybe we need a constitutional amendment, then, to decide between the existence of religion vs the existence of public health.  I know who I’m rooting for."
2020-11-26 17:02,"We are heading toward theocracy, and I am terrified and outraged. Religious places of worship are places of elective entertainment and socializing -- it is irrelevant why people join these gatherings -- like movie theaters, playhouses, or sports venues. This decision leans toward is completely absurd, bizarre, and dangerous for our country. Amy Coney Barrett is a nightmare. Pack the courts."
2020-11-26 15:20,I say this as both a liberal and an atheist: the court made the correct decision.  I would suggest reading Justice Gorsuch’s concurrence—it’s both succinct and clearly stated for even those not used to reading SC opinions.
2020-11-26 17:19,"Our country certainly protects religious rights, but we just crossed the Rubicon by morphing those religious freedoms into the ""right"" to injure or kill other citizens via a virus.

That is what SCOTUS has just sanctioned.

We see this type of extremism all around the globe, and now it is hitting home."
2020-11-26 16:31,"I will feel no sympathy for those who get sick from the virus or those who bring the virus home and sicken others.

They would rather practice their Constitutional right of freedom of religion versus what their God would profess that protecting others from harm is more important.  They believe the possibility of harming others is their ""God-given right"".  They believe their ability to go into a house of God trumps (no pun intended) society's right to not get sick and die.

My guess is their God would feel otherwise."
2020-11-26 19:48,"One wonders how far the new Barrett court would go IF the issue was that you could hold all religious services consistent with federal government issued public health guidelines mandating wearing a face mask and social distancing by at least six feet. In other words, is the court really saying that freedom of religion is freedom to catch the Covid-19 virus?"

These so-called conservatives have every intention of turning the United States into a Christian theocracy, regardless of how antithetical to the secular Founders who created the Constitution and the explicit wording of the First Amendment.

Oh, during a once in a century event, will we let public health officials make some temporary distinctions and decisions?  People are dense, or worse, troublemakers, including Supreme Court justices."

And more than 60% of people supported this. I am sick and tired of religion."
2020-11-26 15:24,Churches pay no taxes.  Why should atheists have to carry the burden of the faithful?  I don't care if you're worshipping Baal.  Everyone should pay for the wear and tear on infrastructure.

2020-11-26 16:36,"Wheee!!! With this unhealthy 5/4 decision by our new conservative Supreme Court, we are on that slippery slope to even more extreme religious freedom decisions by these 5 originalist Federalist  Society justices. This is why they were placed there in the first place, to give the religious right special rights to discriminate against the rest of the citizens of the United States. Their phony religious freedom rights will now top our freedom from religion rights. This I'm afraid is just the beginning. We the people need to do some addition by adding more centrist jurists in order to counter this now McConnell rigged Federalist Society  Supreme Court."

Shame on these “learned” individuals who have such narrow minds.

And god forbid it takes a turn for the worse and you end up in the hospital where you’ll be in danger of infecting those who are caring for you.

2020-11-26 15:58,"It is apparent that the Supreme Court thinks highly of itself, but to assume that it knows more about the risk of viral diseases than the public health experts is ludicrous.  To equate the risk associated with going into a small store with the risk of a mass gathering in today's environment is just plain wrong.  Any educated person should be able to see this.  I guess the devout can't see it. These folks are truly made in the mold of the departing President.  Too bad we can't elect their replacements."
2020-11-26 16:31,"The sense of separation of church and state would
mean, in less bias-ey times, perhaps, that the

is our state religion. How would the SC rule on that?"

Too wordy?

There is no right to expose others to second hand smoke (detectable by sight and smell).  Likewise, there is no right to expose others to an invisible deadly virus.  

Pray safely for the health of our communities."
2020-11-26 17:33,"There is a big difference between attending a church service where many are gathered, and walking into a bike shop or liquor store where only one or two people are present. Of course Gorsuch wants to make a culture war out of this by making it seem that Cuomo thinks more highly of people who cycle and/or drink alcohol than those who worship. Baloney. Any gathering indoors with more than a few people should be restricted. Why should people claim their religious freedom is being impinged when their ""freedom"" risks the lives of others?"
2020-11-26 19:14,"This decision is a danger to all of us. Church and synagogue gatherings have a proven record as super spreader events. So, these congregants get COVID and bring it back to our neighborhoods. For shame on the 5 justices who voted to ban NY's order. Will they console us when our family member gets COVID? Will they even recognize the danger they have put us in? Will they even care.  A short term restriction on religious gatherings  does not violate the constituion. It does not prevent  members from worshipping. It only prevents them from being virus carriers and disseminating that virus amongst us. SHAME on the court for not recognizing that truth."
2020-11-26 16:38,"Are the justices still meeting remotely? If so why? In about three weeks time our hospitals will be over burdened again as those who ignore health guidelines that have kept NYC residents safe begin to show up in desperate need of medical care.

2020-11-26 17:52,If they get sick it is their problem. Please don't come to our hospitals if you put yourself in this situation. We need to reserve those spots for intelligent Americans. Remember when people didn't want to wear helmets or seatbelts? Is Amy going to take those rules away for religious reasons?

I pray that the church will not open its doors to create more havoc in this climate."
2020-11-26 17:21,"Now I know what's wrong with this country.  Many are trying to elimintate government's role in promoting the concept of ""The Greater Good"".  Government mandating the number of church attendees in an enclosed space was just deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.  What's next? the  military, publically funded schools, fire and police, all social programs.  The Greater Good is one of the founding concdepts of Democracy. Without it you have anarchy."
2020-11-26 17:36,"The preamble to the Constitution, which I take to be its statement of general purpose, includes ""insure domestic Tranquility"" and ""promote the general Welfare"".

I'm certain it's within the power for this government to declare Martial Law. If Martial Law applies to me it applies to everyone.  But we haven't gone as far as that. If it's so black and white why not? Is it really that complicated?

I won't whip myself up into a frenzy over it. If religious gatherings still exist during a pandemic aren't other uncompounded gatherings allowed. People aren't being prevented from flying, college kids are still hanging out together and people having Thanksgiving get to gathers. So you really can't blame religious gatherings as the super spreader can you? We're not China are we?

Many more are being tested than last May. The numbers are high but has the proportion to deaths to those testing positive changed. 

I have a dry cough on and off for a couple days. I blame it on the dry air from the heating system  turning on and off and the damp cool weather weather. I don't feel I should be tested. Don't think I should self isolate every time I cough or sneeze. Do you?"

2020-11-26 17:46,"Why would the Supreme Court vote to impede an important public health measure that intends to bring down the incidence of deaths from Covid which is now the third leading cause of death in the US? Does the Supreme court understand the meaning of incidence of deaths per 100,000 in the US population?  Do they know what the incidence of the top ten leading causes of death are?  1-10:  Heart Disease, Cancer, Accidents (auto, overdose..), Chronic Respiratory disease, cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimers, diabetes, flu, kidney disease, suicide. Right now, as of Nov 2020, deaths from Covid 19 have bumped accidents from 3rd place. At an incidence of 80/100,000 it is higher than incidence of accidents at 48/100k, and flu deaths at 15/100k, and lower only than cancer at 149/100k and heart disease at 163/100k. The numbers speak for themselves. This is a deadly and preventable, but barely treatable, disease."

In one of her first major opinions she duly sanctioned more super-spreader events. All the while disregarding The Ten Commandments rule “thou shall not kill”.

More importantly, the politicalization of “science” as well as “science’s” lack of consistency and certainty during this crisis have not inspired confidence in people who are not committed to confirmation bias.

As for the Constitution, secularists are inclined to forget, since it is politically convenient to do so, that the “establishment” and “free exercise” clauses protect their right to not believe as well as our right to believe.

Their protestations to the contrary, it is arguably apparent that several governors, including Cuomo, have restricted churches without the special consideration required by the First Amendment. Sorry, secularists, but it is the law and there are reasons why it is the First."

A definite over step by this constitutionalist court on religious freedom, especially where a physical house of worship is now known as ""freedom"".

Will the court keep the cops from interfering with my worship?  No, you can believe what you want to believe, and practice what you want to practice, as long as it doesn't damage other people.

When decisions rest on one's religious obligations as opposed to science (remember churches burned heretics which is where we are headed) then the safety of all Americans is endangered. Once again the present Senate has managed to send an un-American message to all Americans by appointing someone unqualified to be judicial when God is riding on her shoulder. A truly sad day for our country. As a Jew I watched in horror when 7000 Orthodox Jews attended a wedding last week. It was not a religious act, it was a barbaric act that is capable of killing people who had no idea what their fellow citizens had planned in secret. And the Supreme Court has now approved of such behavior. We do not need armies to attack our nation when a group of judges in black robes fail to raise their hands off the bible and confirm their oath to serve the Constitution and not some ancient text that was never intended to lead anyone to death in the name of religious obedience"

To be sure, the rot in the court emanates from its Republican judges, not its Democratic ones. We the people have to figure out a mechanism to derail the rightwing runaway train and put the judiciary back on track with judges who respect science and public health.

Which is unfortunate because as I said, the virus doesn’t care.  But this floodgate was opened back in May and I’m glad SCOTUS ruled the way it did just to expose the hypocrisy."
2020-11-26 18:52,"Very unwise. These judges are supposed to have the intelligence and sagacity to protect civilians. They have access to information not readily available to the populace.

2020-11-26 15:52,"If people wore signs around their necks stating that they attend long, indoor mass gatherings, I would maintain a wider-than-normal berth around those people.  Sorry, no offense, I would, and it wouldn’t matter why they attended the gathering, be it religious, an atheists’ convention, a huge book club.   I don’t care the reason because covid doesn’t care the reason.

People don’t wear such signs around their necks.  But there are other signs.  I walk through public life making countless quick assessments, in grocery stores, in subway cars, in ATM lobbies.  My eyes search for risk: masks below noses, drunk people, accidental clusters of people at a crosswalk, and yes, MAGA hats, among scores more.  The calculations are split-second, and my generalizations are blunt tools. But I have so few tools.

It’s horribly upsetting to have equality-for-all as my lodestar in life, and yet face these choices every time I step outside.   I hate hate HATE it, but I have a family to protect and science-based beliefs that are as unshakable as any beliefs held by anyone in this world. 

Must I pretend I don’t see those signs merely because I can’t equally spot and differentiate all the individuals who might be acting irresponsibly in my view?  Am I a bigot?  It feels like bigotry, and every ounce of my soul wants me to fight against it, but then I think of my family, and the cost of being wrong.  So I act on it — a quiet sidewalk drift, a change of seats, a different ATM. And my sadness mounts."
2020-11-26 16:59,"This totally misguided ruling says nothing about localities right to impose mask-wearing laws.  So Governor Cuomo should immediately sign an executive order requiring masks to be worn at any public gathering.  If the law is violated, the gathering (including religious) would be shut down.

I don't know the precise details of Cuomo's order, but the statements by Gorsuch certainly leave room for  a reworded order that might well pass muster with the Court.

The Constitution's First Amendment statement on religion was meant to prohibit the Federal Government, and through the 14th Amendment the State governments, from preferencing one religion over another. It was not meant to preference any religion over secular authorities.

The Court has traditionally avoided overruling legislative and executive determinations of fact with their own. It seems in this case they have violated that principle but, again, I have not read the wording of Cuomo's order nor have most of the Justices explained their reasoning.

Perhaps what we need is a religious group, (Neo-Aztecs ?) to say they are going to sacrifice virgins as part of their religious traditions. Let's see how the Supreme Court deals with that."
2020-11-26 20:21,"Attending church, going to services - is not required to practice the Christian faith. When it is, like with the RCC, its a doctrine of the Church, but not one deemed necessary by their founder. Jesus made no such demands. And in fact, of the few things he was clear on, it was on this subject. Practice and worship in private. Gathering for services is a tradition, and a man made demand on worshippers. Being restricted in this manner by civil authorities in a time of a grave health threat to the worshippers and then those they will come in casual contact and perhaps infect, doesnt feel like its a stretch to a faith that puts great emphasis on not doing intentional (even unintentional) harm to others. It feels like something Jesus would be in favor of. Give unto Ceasar kind of stuff."
2020-11-26 20:07,"Assuming that both were in restricted zones of the same color designation, the governor's orders would limit attendance at St. Patrick's Cathedral to 10 people but allow 500 at the massive COSTCO in Long Island City.  This is crazy.

2020-11-26 20:02,"I am a strong advocate for religious freedom. But I also reflect on what that really means.

Of course it means the freedom to practice one's religion, but Christianity also mandates love for one's neighbor. That might include the restriction of the numbers of people in a place of worship during a pandemic. The Supreme Court justices need to ask themselves what Jesus, or Buddha, or Mohammed might suggest, not what some legal eagle says is constitutional.

Frankly, I suggest that any place of worship that doesn't protect its parishioners from COVID is not serving them or God."
2020-11-26 20:27,"I know of a couple of Catholic pastors in the St. Louis area that tested positive for COVID.

My family and I attend religious services each week. Together with our community members and leaders, we wear masks, sit outside when required, are seated 6 feet from other groups, and take numerous other precautions that support and uphold local public health restrictions, of which we are thankful. 
With all respect, I ask that gatherings of thanksgiving, praise, reconciliation, service, and celebration of all humanity be properly respected. Religious gatherings should not be likened to consumer activities such as liquor store shopping, but rather, to peaceful protests of social injustice. 
Most religious gatherings are focused on kindness, justice, correction, and service to fellow man, not unlike peaceful secular protests. Most all religious organizations also carry out numerous ministries that meaningfully feed the hungry, care for the sick, shelter the homeless, and uplift those who have been marginalized by social injustices including racism, discrimination, and inequality. 
I believe most Readers desire to be part of the human mission to care for one another and destroy injustice. Whether we choose to serve humanity in a secular or religious capacity, let us proceed in the spirt of thanksgiving and respect for one another as we work toward our common goal."

It is no different."

Meanwhile, the debasement & delegitimization of the nation’s highest Court now clearly controlled by, and soon to be suffocated by, a “religious Taliban” is laid bare a mere month after “Justice” Coney was crammed down our throats by a political party that fails to understand the importance with authoritarian aspirations that increasingly views the Constitution’s separation of church from state, among other cherished values, as irrelevant.

And, of course, those that get hit go out and spread the infection to other family members, friends, co workers and the general public. I respect your right to worship whatever way you want, but you should respect my right to protect myself and my family from a debilitating and possibly fatal disease. That the SCOTUS would rule to “protect” religious freedom from common sense guidelines that would spare human lives, especially since they had ruled the opposite way before, is the height of hypocrisy."

You can erect an idol, burn incense, chant and sing as well as proposition the Lord with prayer in the comfort of your own home without endangering everyone else.  Of course it is not possible to pass the collection plate under these circumstances.  But generous congregants can always send a check to their favorite religious establishment.  If the consequences of these reckless actions were only visited upon those who made them I wouldn't mind.  If you act foolishly and it causes your demise you have no one to blame but yourself.  But infecting innocent strangers who have the good sense to stay away from Superspreader Sundays at the local church is a gross violation of their rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  This decision favors the rights of religious organizations over the public.  The founding fathers wanted to avoid the religious wars that had occurred in Europe and declared there would never be an official or state religion in America.  This is clearly in opposition to the beliefs the nation was founded upon.  So much for literalism."

Right alongside the new Crusades, this merciless virus will march, destroying lives and communities, with the graceless accord of the newest virus: the Covid-5 on the Supreme Court. Is this truly what Jesus would do, or Jacob or Mohammed or other oracles? I have enormous faith in true Faith, but those who would effect or celebrate this decision clearly do not. Exile, persecution, brutal violence and genocide did not destroy major religions, but denying them the right to gather indoors in large groups will? Revealing, is it not, how little faith some people have in the power, depth, cohesiveness and allure of their own Faith.  

Yes, it can be seen as goofy to keep liquor stores and gyms and such open, but that is not the point.  It is beyond harebrained – it is a form of domestic terrorism or abuse to encourage large indoor gatherings today.

Newsom was two faced when he imposed lock downs and then went to dinner unmasked at the French Laundry in violations of his own standards.

We now have a choice, we fought each other and earned a 2nd wave of COVID infections.  Have we learned enough to prevent a 3rd wave?  BTW, the 1918 Spanish Flu had 3 waves and last about a year and a half, it killed 675,000 people.  We are closing in on half way there (268,000 deaths).

If these religious folk only pray hard enough, none of them should get or transmit COVID to others.  But if that's not the case...if some of them Do get or transmit COVID to others, well then...it's not that prayer is hogwash...in that instance it was 'god's will'.  Course, when things go their way it's all due to the supposed power of prayer.  The opposite however, never seems to occur to these folks...that prayer is utter hogwash.

Here's why the democrats need to secure a majority in the US senate so that congress can make laws to protect public safety. The US supreme court interprets law, but in myseterious ways sometimes, while congress makes the laws. Congress could pass a clear law stating that states have a right to limit the size of religious congregations during a pandemic that overrides religious freedom.

Conservatives are dangerous.  They are a minority. This decision is a lesson to every school kid living in an urban and suburban area. They have become a threat to our lives and safety with their religious extremism and complete disregard for science and even common sense."

2020-11-26 20:33,"This is another example of the Supreme Court standing the concept of freedom of religion on its head by holding that one person or sect may practice their faith in a way that infringes upon other individuals or society as a whole. No one has said that a person of faith must stop praying or renounce their God due to COVID, only that the demonstrably dangerous activity of gathering in large numbers must be temporarily curtailed or suspended in areas of high infection. In essence, the Court is saying the Constitution gives an UNequal, superceding  right to members of a church congregation  regardless of how their activity may harm others. But this flies in the face of long established regulations governments put on religious activity to safeguard the common good. An obvious analogy is the fact that churches cannot dangerously cram in an unlimited number of congregants, but rather are limited and regulated by uniform building codes for occupancy and other life and building safety issues. Such regulations are made out of concern for the safety of first responders and neighboring people and property as well as the congregants themselves. If the Court cannot see that the Constitution allows for reasonable limitation on specific aspects of religious practice to address a public health emergency, then it is prepared to strike down laws and regulation from building codes to a ban on animal sacrifices to the prohibition on bigamy. This would make religion not free, but dictatorial."

There have already been many such opinions favorable to the right, such as Citizens United, that have overthrown long settled law in the area of limiting campaign contributions, or Hobby Lobby or Masterpiece Cakeshop that many see as fundamentally flawed.

I don't know the precise details of Cuomo's order, but the statements by Gorsuch certainly leave room for  a reworded order that might well pass muster with the Court.

The Constitution's First Amendment statement on religion was meant to prohibit the Federal Government, and through the 14th Amendment the State governments, from preferencing one religion over another. It was not meant to preference any religion over secular authorities.

The Court has traditionally avoided overruling legislative and executive determinations of fact with their own. It seems in this case they have violated that principle but, again, I have not read the wording of Cuomo's order nor have most of the Justices explained their reasoning.

Perhaps what we need is a religious group, (Neo-Aztecs ?) to say they are going to sacrifice virgins as part of their religious traditions. Let's see how the Supreme Court deals with that."

We can expect more of these sort of rulings in the future on all kinds of social issues as the court with its new membership exhalts the kind of right wing conservatism and hyper-partisan prejudice Justice Alioto blatantly revealed in his recent annual speech before the Federalist Society. And by the way – if you're agnostic or atheist, too bad! You get the short end of the stick. Your freedoms (and safety) just don't have equal footing with this court: a court that is quickly eroding separation of church and state by abusing first amendment arguments."
2020-11-26 15:30,I think a lot has to do with how people gather and for how long.

The crazies, yes they are crazies as they will not do anything to stop the spread of a once in a hundred years pandemic that as resulted already in 200,000 preventable deaths. We wake up on Thanksgiving to our Supreme Court is just another part of the crazy. They goal of the GOP is to take us back to the 1920's and to govern by the Hoover way. It is that we will do nothing even in a great depression or pandemic. Think how completely the American people rejected this view of Hoover. The post WW2 GOP had to be a party that rejected Hoover and accepted the need of governing for the public good. As horrible as this is, it is the near total embrace of Fascism as its path to getting and keeping power that is the nightmare scenario to our democracy.  They're never ending attacks on our norms and institutions. Their embrace of a coup. They're ever more violent rhetoric, calls for harm to people and the beginning calls for a armed gang of the party true believers to instill fear, to threaten violence or commit acts of violence.This is becoming the accepted way as the Kenosha murderer is being hailed as a hero."

Do those church-goers and synagoga-goers believe God or ceremony, or even their region leaders?

If church-goers and synagoga-goers do things not make any sense and so selfish and so self-righteousness, who will believe your God?

There is no vaccine available currently to protect people who may be infected by people who are exercising their first amendment rights and may be asymmetrically spreading the airbourne virus.

The best way to verify your opinion in this case is to be willing to attend one of these services. You would have to go in disguise, to not draw attention to yourself. If you were to fall ill, then you would have the privilege of better medical services.

2020-11-26 16:52,"One question often raised by those favoring a packed church in the midst of a pandemic is, ""If restaurants and bars can be open, why must churches be closed?"" Allow me to attempt an explanation. The reason restaurants/bars are open is not so the Joe Public has an opportunity to go and frolic. Rather, it is to enable the owners of these establishments and their employees to earn a living so that they can continue to keep the lights and heat in their homes on, the water running, put food on the table, etc. As for the church, among the many things I was taught as a kid in Catholic school was that (A) I have a one-to-one relationship with God and (B) God is omnipresent, i.e., everywhere. Thus, in order to go to God I do not need a middleperson--a priest--, nor do I have to be at a specific place, i.e., a church. I can go to God at any time and at any place, as long as I do so in honesty and honorably.

They have not been nuanced in reconciling their individual ideology with the very real dangers to public safety their decision will have.  All American citizens have the right to worship as they see fit, but today, who will cover the expenses of those who fall ill, require hospitalization, or die from gathering in a house of worship? By using a narrow interpretation of the Law to distance themselves from the inevitable spread of COVID-19 as a result of their majority decision, they are putting a huge burden on State Government and local health care systems.  Are the five members of the Court or the religious institutions related to their decision willing to take of any of that inevitable burden? Extraordinary circumstances require a subtle and nuanced application of the law.  It seems that this panel of five judges chose death for their fellow citizens.

State constitutions also left our emergencies so state legislatures generated laws to give the governor power to issue executive orders. Freedom of religion is not being attacked when the issue is a pandemic where a large gathering amasses not wearing face masks. The first churches to open created a wave of infections. God does not intervene nor does God interfere with stupidity. Each person is his or her own church or temple or mosque. Each person has a moral obligation to protect others. God is not going away if we don't go to a building and pay a fee. God is free to pray to. A new breed of virus is not free but costs lives,  too many.

How many more people will die or get deathly ill before society stops allowing theistic fundamentalists' individual-freedom fetishes to override concerns for larger society as a whole?

Regardless of one's particular beliefs, can't we all agree that religion, if it *must* exist, should be primarily about loving one's neighbor?  And can't we all agree that putting oneself in situations that increase the risk of spreading pathogens to others is *not* a loving (and therefore not a godly/religious) thing to do?"

It goes like this: what if a virus comes around in which 90% of the people die rather than 0.2% as with Covid and the same case is before SCOTUS - Would they really be able to rule the same way? If so, then their textualist-originalist bent is out of control, that they would be willing to sacrifice the entire country for a principle. But if they would not rule the same way, and decide that yes, public health prevails over freedom of religion, then apparently there is a bar for when it is acceptable to override the Constitution, but that 260,000 deaths does not reach that bar. If so, I wonder what their magic number is?"
2020-11-26 22:36,"Of course we can choose to attend or not attend a religious service.  However, if we become infected, we  stand a great chance of spreading that infection in our homes.

It is done under the guise of ""religious liberty,"" which in this context means extending the sway of religious dogma at the expense of the public right to health and safety. The founders intended to secure the rights of religious persons to practice their beliefs within the same lawful bounds as all other citizens, not to create a specially privileged class based on supernatural beliefs.

However, many only see the 'Freedom to do.' and not the 'Take Responsibility for' part of either Religion or Government.

We seem to have as hard a time being responsible to each other as we do following the God of our choosing.

And when the pew pishers start getting sick and the national wave of superspreaders explodes from church services, weddings, (10,000 in Brooklyn?), baptisms, and FUNERALS all over the country, none better dare show up at a hospital.

Supreme Court ruling doesn’t have 'any practical effect,' Cuomo says 
 By BILL MAHONEY 11/26/2020 11:42 AM EST 

ALBANY, N.Y. — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is downplaying the significance of a Supreme Court decision blocking him enforcing stringent attendance limits on religious institutions in Covid hot spots. 

“That Supreme Court ruling on the religious gatherings is more illustrative of the Supreme Court than anything else,” Cuomo said on a Thanksgiving morning briefing call. “It’s irrelevant from any practical impact.” 

The Wednesday night decision came after a challenge by Catholic and Jewish organizations in Brooklyn neighborhoods that the governor placed in a “red zone” earlier this fall.

I am a scientist, and I can tell you that we know very little about very basic things and most scientists have no clue abou how to fight this pandiemic. I wouldn't give any power to the scientists either.

This decision renders public health and science secondary to religious freedom and commerce and seems more inline with people's ""right to not wear a mask"" no matter how overtaxed our health care systems becomes, no matter how many die. Recently, the medical community has shared that 95% of COVID positive tests are asymptomatic - proving that people can still spread the virus even though the do not have symptoms.

There is also cases of infection at the school that Barrett's children attend. None of this seems to phase her. Is a person with such a mindset fit to sit on the Supreme Court?"

If avoiding this virus is more important than the constitution and the liberties that it protects then you don’t deserve America.

They abused their politically obtained position to rule on a grave matter of life and death at the worst time during a pandemic that already killed hundreds of thousands of people - in part because of the criminally politicized  administration's response to it. This will cost many lives in New York and beyond. These should be tallied - and measured  against the work of previous fanatics 19 years ago."
2020-11-26 18:20,"Despite a rapidly escalating death and case rate SCOTUS declares ""Let 'em die"". Apparently SCOTUS insists on an individual's right to spread Covid and cause countless problems in hospitals and countless deaths. SCOTUS' ignorance and ignoring of science is stunning."
2020-11-26 18:21,"I'm not particularly religious, but I am a spiritual person I think, so I'm not anti-religious either. But a group of right-wing radical religious nutcases taking over the Supreme Court will undoubtedly prejudice huge numbers of Americans by association against religion per se, and despite myself, I will probably be among them.

Does religion demand shutting off our rational abilities and causing the death of tens of thousands of others? It has in the past, and we in America certainly think that religion is doing this now in other nations. 

Trump finds the worst people among the choices he has, and then he brings out the worst in them. Would Gorsuch otherwise write something so clearly stupid as his bike shop/liquor store comparison to mosques/churches/synagogues? And Barrett was put on the court specifically for this and a other few antiquated and destructive decisions she's expected to make.

In not much time, Trump will be considered a freak occurrence, similar to freak occurances that other nations have suffered. How did we let this mini-monster take over we'll ask ourselves. But the enduring question is how will we fix the system that lasted for almost a quarter century, but which is now broken?"

This ruling evokes the South Korea (Spring 2020) covid-19 church spreading nightmare scenario, but on USA impractical, ineffective SCOTUS steroid terms.

Lets walk this decision through - Next year a new pandemic shows up (either naturally or unnaturally contrived) that appears to kill 50% of its victims randomly and indiscriminately (babies, kids, parents, teenagers - but in this version old people are immune - ha!). This new pandemic has the same spreading signature as covid-19 in that, indoor gatherings especially with singing/chanting/yaking/vocal-chord-ism seem to strongly increase its spreading ratio   - if the church/religion of ""we're all gonna die someday so lets get on with it now"" decides to use this as an opportunity to spread its ""message"" - no authority will be able to constrain them.

They should be called out if what they are doing could kill another human being.  It’s shameful that people of 
‘supposingly’ high character can’t do moral & honorable acts, unlike criminal trump, who we already know has no moral character.   As Justice Robert’s, it appears, a man of wisdom,  said in his previous ruling, quite clearly, that judges don’t have the knowledge & expertise to make those decisions. I bet all of the quarter of a million folks who have died & their families disagree with majority ruling. Now is the time to revisit the power a judge is given for life, especially after a decisions contrary to the opinions of all of the medical community & a decision that has the potential of killing or getting people sick, knowingly.  This decision is no different than criminal trump telling people to ‘gather’ this thanksgiving.

The exceptions have been some governments that shrugged off the painful evidence of mounting deaths, with inevitable, grievous consequences. But most governments acted responsibly, imposing strict measures to contain the outbreak.

Yet some groups protested, refusing to keep their distance, marching against travel restrictions — as if measures that governments must impose for the good of their people constitute some kind of political assault on autonomy or personal freedom! Looking to the common good is much more than the sum of what is good for individuals. It means having a regard for all citizens and seeking to respond effectively to the needs of the least fortunate.

It is all too easy for some to take an idea — in this case, for example, personal freedom — and turn it into an ideology, creating a prism through which they judge everything.""

It reminds me of the joke about the guy who often prayed to God for more money and never once had any of his prayers answered.  Finally in desperation ready to take his life, a guardian angel appeared and told him, ""God says you've really got to help him out, you've got to buy a lottery ticket""."

To my knowledge, the groups of non-aligned spirituality and atheism arw the fastest growing groups in America--and the idiocy of this Court  decision and the pursuit of this decision are good examples of why that has happened. I don't have any problem with worship, but I do have a problem with manslaughter. After having a documented service with THOUSANDS of attendees during a pandemic, and after initiating a measles epidemic even before Covid, the Jewish Hasidic community of New York deserves stronger limits than even Cuomo put into place. It appears the Hasidic community actions may precipitate a return to ancient leper treatment, and apparently the community is okay with that. And Christians who are pursuing decisions like these are far more offensive than gay couples who seek wedding cakes. Heaven help us !!"

Because if you were truly religious and loved your neighbors then you would stay at home to protect them, wouldn't you?  I would suggest it's more about getting the parishioners to come out to fill up the donation baskets and also a selfish desire by many worshipers to show off and prove to their neighbors that they are more devoted and godly than them.

2020-11-26 19:42,"This decision reveals the five ""pro-life"" / ""originalist"" Supreme Court Justices for whom they truly are. 

In an interview with journalist Margaret Ward, retired Associate Justice David Souter (certainly no flaming liberal) said that there are no absolute rights set forth in the Constitution.  Rather, many times one Constitutional right is in conflict with another.  Your right to swing your arm ends at my nose. Your freedom of speech in a crowded theater ends when you shout ""fire"" just for fun.  And so it goes with your right to gather in a church, synagogue, mosque, or anywhere else during a pandemic vs the public's right to safety.  

In the midst of a crisis where 1500 - 2000 Americans are dying each day, your right to gather anywhere that puts others at risk, is not without limitation.  

Yes, you can be required to wear a mask, because you have no right to infect others.  And, if you do get sick because of your own careless disregard for safety,  you should not expect that it's your right to show up at a hospital placing healthcare workers at risk. 

The Justices who voted in favor of this ruling are smart people -they know better.  Permitting unconstrained religious gatherings during a pandemic is just a cynical (red vs blue) political statement that puts thousands of Americans unnecessarily at risk.."

Protests happen on the streets, they are relatively spontaneous and they are by nature acts of defiance.  Churches, synagogues, temples, mosques, are indoors, planned, institutionalized and conformist in nature.  

One of the elements of good argument is logic, but people just want to rely on emotion.  Maybe that's something ""christians"" should be a little more grateful for:  God gave you logic and reasoning to set you above animals.  For God's sake, use it!"

We have nearly 270,000 Americans who have died, as of Thanksgiving, and most care providers understand this to be an under-count of those who actually died from from the Corona virus.
We also understand how so many 10's of thousands of those deaths could have been avoided, had we an actual Commander and Chief in the White House.
The GOP's blind support of Trump also makes many of them responsible for many deaths as well.

Amy Comey Barrett, the Justice that should have never been, has now added her name to those responsible for even more American Deaths!

How Dare the Supreme Court put the rights of a ""few"" over the rights of ALL Americans !

The ""Few""; Those religious groups who's self-centered egos would rather put innocent lives at risk, rather than get on board with what is right for our country.
Regardless of each individual religion involved with pushing this ridiculous law suit, at the core belief, I am sure there belief in no way allows them to put others at risk of harm.

And this is exactly what the Supreme Court has done.
By exempting religious groups from abiding by the State and Local Laws, put in place to protect all of us, this court has spit in the eye of common sense.

The FACTS are in - Social Distancing and the Wearing of Masks . . .

This idiotic ruling disempowers states governors and medical authorities from taking life saving actions. Meanwhile the religious
(who interpret mythology literally) now have been given carte blanch to continue spreading the pandemic. It's a life negating, pandemic promoting ruling.

A good example is where a Walmart could have 1100 people in it, while a house of worship that can seat 500 people is restricted to no more than 10. There's a clear bias there.

You're probably tired of hearing me keep whanging on this, aren't you? Geez, won't this guy just drop it; Biden's been elected, time to turn the page.

Well, unfortunately, consequences don't care whether you're tired of hearing about it. They just keep consequenting.

And I know that some of you are already starting to think that, now that Biden is going to be President, well, the crisis is over. You might not show up in 2022. It might be cold out that day, or you might feel like, ya know, they're all the same. (Worse, you might be upset that Joe hasn't been able to fix everything in two years and just stick it to him, like many of you did to Obama in 2010.)

2020-11-26 19:10,"There are two  fundamental principles of Jewish law that even I learned during my days as a yeshiva student.

The first is PIKUACH NEFESH DOCHEH SHABBAT, or “saving a life displaces (or pushes off) the Sabbath,” the holiest day of the week.  

The preservation of human life takes precedence over all the other commandments in Judaism. The Talmud emphasizes this principle by citing the verse from Leviticus [18:5]: “You shall therefore keep my statutes…which if a man do, he shall live by them.” The rabbis add: “That he shall live by them, and not that he shall die by them.” (Babylonian Talmud, Yoma 85b)
<a href=""https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/saving-a-life-pikuach-nefesh"" target=""_blank"">https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/saving-a-life-pikuach-nefesh</a>/

The second is DINA DE-MALKHUTA DINA, the halakhic rule that the law of the country is binding, and, in certain cases, is to be preferred to Jewish law. The problem of dina de-malkhuta dina is similar to – but not identical with – the problem of conflict of laws in other legal systems.
<a href=""https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/dina-de-malkhuta-dina"" target=""_blank"">https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/dina-de-malkhuta-dina</a>

Therefore, a Jew should understand that a valid non-discriminatory law or rule set by a local government with the intention of the saving or preservation of life is to be obeyed, and not questioned.

What is wrong with the religious “geniuses” of the far right of Judaism, who seem to have forgotten those simple and general principles?

What is wrong with the Supreme Court, including ACB, for ruling against the interests of life?"

Or, is this narrow Star Chamber court inexorably endorsing the faux Christian, ""My beliefs, just not yours?"" 

If that is the case, then we can expect the First Amendment establishment clause to be excised from the U.S. Constitution and fulfill the religious zealots' obsession to declare that the ""U.S. is a Christian nation."" 

Which of course comes with all the religionists' demands for punishments and incarcerations for those accused of committing heresy. 

Thanks to the inaptly named ""originalist"" Amy Barrett's interpretations which appear to be injecting their particular Judaeo-Christian beliefs into their rulings to the exclusion to all other deities. Just what the Founders intended when they penned our U.S. Constitution?

Be it Covid-19, Climate Change, the pending Civil War or killer asteroids hysteria is the advocated solution by the media. It accumulates until it gets to hard to take. It doesn't matter if it's fact or fiction. If you're hysterical, contrary to popular opinion, you can't make the right decision. If you're hysterical you'll be glad to make the experts do your thinking for you. Science and data can't be argued with if you're smart we're told. Your best resort is to obey. 

I'm no Cuomo, I don't need to go along with experts when they're proven liars. Going along doesn't make me smart. I need to question things as much as I need the press to do so. 

So I ask if a few churches and temples hold services how does it compare to all the other rules being broken under ""the  rules"". Is this decision something to get hysterical over?"

I don't know the precise details of Cuomo's order, but the statements by Gorsuch certainly leave room for  a reworded order that might well pass muster with the Court.

The Constitution's First Amendment statement on religion was meant to prohibit the Federal Government, and through the 14th Amendment the State governments, from preferencing one religion over another. It was not meant to preference any religion over secular authorities.

The Court has traditionally avoided overruling legislative and executive determinations of fact with their own. It seems in this case they have violated that principle but, again, I have not read the wording of Cuomo's order nor have most of the Justices explained their reasoning.

Some of the places of worship can hold 500, 750 or even 1,000 people. Clearly, the governor overstepped by changing the maximum numbers allowed from being based on a percentage of full occupancy to a fixed number no matter the venue size.  The media headlines across left leaning and right leaning news outlets make it seem like the Court disallowed all restrictions. Not true. The Court has merely says you can’t have one basis for regulation for secular activity and a more limiting one another for religious activity. 

Plus, the Catholic Churches are taking all the precautions recommended by the CDC (eg, cleaning, masks, socially distant).

The facts identified in the US Supreme Court decision involving New York, however, make clear that some secular businesses were treated more harshly, and others less harshly.  Although it may be too early to tell whether the NY opinion signals a radical departure from current First Amendment law, it certainly does signal the Supreme Court’s willingness to micromanage a once in a century pandemic."

Some of the infected congregants were interviewed by the media.  One announced that he would not allow covid-19 to affect his life-style.

The former head of the FDA today opined that the masks that most of us wear are about 30% effective.  There is no panacea here.

The realty is, must of us are trying to be cautious, and wearing masks while working and sending our kids to school and worried about elderly relatives who are deteriorating from loneliness that video doesn't solve  over something that  we find scary while recognizing that the math suggests isn't as deadly as it could be but is still risky for swaths of the population."

It's easy to wag fingers at small living room gatherings (remember back when it was beaches?).  It's harder to recognize the CDC's early incompetence, turf-protecting, lack of foresight around testing.  It's harder to recognize that state and local officials all over the country had, apparently, zero plan for a pandemic or for a surge in hospital need.  It's harder to recognize that the governors and mayors appearing on TV every day have no idea what they're talking about, and that their constant announcements of new rules are performative and light on science.  When the government has nothing left to do other than insist that everyone confine themselves to their homes indefinitely, we can conclude that our system has failed at all levels."

Nonetheless, it seems reasonable to assume that the more one is exposed to others, the higher the risk of infection.

- Both my friend and I work  in-person around 20 hours per week, in an environment with teachers, students, and staff.  A negative COVID-19 test was only required in August before school started.

What we can see so far is that *no one* has caught COVID-19 from school, which has classes of around 10 students with a teacher and assistant.  Our loved ones gave us COVID-19 from an office (in my case) or a plant (in my friend's case).

Everything points to lax mask-wearing and other hazards at essential workplaces.  If someone is vigilant about their visits, they will be safe.  When we visit my in-laws, they wear masks and the kids and my spouse and I wear masks.  We eat in separate rooms and talk during our meals through the open door, well more than 6' away (more like 10' away).

I think we can wait to have a real meal with our loved ones.  But if you do the math about what I noted above, it's the spouse who has to work in person bringing COVID home to the family, not more carefully planned small gatherings, that are the issue."
2020-11-23 19:41,"This story just adds to the confusion and teeters into the realm of irresponsible. There is an uptick in virus spread and social gatherings with people outside of our pods increases the risk of more spread. Separate from the fact that prisons, nursing homes, hospitals, and bars are super spreader environments."
2020-11-23 19:42,"This thesis isn't significantly more convincing than those that stress social gatherings as problematic. 
Rather, it seems the real issue is the fact that there has been no central national policy or plan, which leaves states and local officials twisting in the wind, trying to figure both what's causing increased spread and how to curb it."
2020-11-23 19:43,Thank you for this article. In Chicago we have seen the hypocrisy of Mayor Lightfoot's policies around COVID. She kept the beaches shut all summer even after evidence that outdoor spread was shown to be minimal– thus taking away people's go to refuge to cool down both literally and figuratively in the summer heat. Mayor Lightfoot has been more then willing to keep bars and restaurants open for indoor service (or outdoor service in tents where you are much more enclosed then at the beach) and then blaming the rise of COVID on individual behavior.  In Chicago the restaurant association has the clout and politicians are well trained at passing the buck of responsibility instead of acknowledging their own political failures. The COVID fatigue people are experiencing has to do with the dismal local and state management of the pandemic and being fed a stream of questionable data day after day by politicians.
2020-11-23 19:43,"In Massachusetts, the surge of cases has been among 20-30 year olds. 

This certainly squares with what I see frequently in my city: tables of 6 or 8 young adults sitting together closely at restaurant tables for a meal. Yes, the tables are outside, which should mitigate risk. But unmasked people facing each other having an animated conversation sounds like a bad idea."
2020-11-23 19:20,"The article says small gatherings aren't driving the virus surge so far. Then it goes on to say,""...it has become much harder to pinpoint any source of any outbreak, now that the virus is so widespread and Americans may be exposed in so many ways.""

So if you read only the headline, it's ""thumbs up, Thanksgiving!""
If you read further down, well, it's ""thumbs down everything until this is over.""

Pretty sure a lot of folks folks will find the headline very convenient to quote as they party on with friends and relatives.

2020-11-23 19:39,"That's a pretty misleading headline. A more accurate description would be that we just don't know. As cited in the article itself, a lot remains unknown, the data is not very good, and its becoming clearer that spikes in infection rates are driven by multiple factors.

To suggest that small at home gatherings are low-risk is dangerous. They are only low-risk if no one there is shedding virus."
2020-11-23 19:37,"As a public health professional, this article strikes me as dangerous and irresponsible reporting.

In placing this caption with this photo, the Times heavily implies that gathering in this enclosed tent space is safe simply because it is located outdoors - despite airflow and ventilation being almost nonexistent.

2020-11-23 19:47,"Small Social Gatherings ARE Driving the Virus Surge IN MY FAMILY.  
Some of my family members had a birthday party for my 87 year old mother.  No one in my family had been diagnosed with Covid prior to the party.
The party infected 5 out of 8 family members with two becoming very sick.  A member who has diabetes type 2 experienced havoc with his blood sugar and blood pressure among the general symptoms of Covid.
My 87 year old mother who was in good health was hospitalized after one week of trying to take care of herself in a senior condo complex.  She received Remdesivir and steroids.  She is slowing recovering at home and is very weak."
2020-11-23 19:48,"I really wish NYT would change this headline. The data have huge limitations when it comes to finding a source of infection, and it is dangerous to suggest that family gatherings are not a major threat. Most contact tracers are so overwhelmed that they might not be able to ascertain whether someone caught covid at a small gathering. Furthermore, people who have tested positive are probably more likely to lie to contact tracers about whether they have been socializing with people outside their household because they know they were acting against experts' recommendations.

In our county, 23% of people who tested positive in the last two weeks admitted to attending a party or gathering recently and 30% said they had close contact with another positive case outside of their household. Now, those categories are not mutually exclusive, and they may have caught covid somewhere other than a gathering (e.g. at work or a restaurant), but my guess is that data that don't attribute cases to gatherings (like Colorado) are simply incomplete/not being tracked rather than a true picture of what is going on."
2020-11-23 19:49,"""In most places, the virus is too widespread to claim with any confidence where someone became infected. Where once clusters were obvious — in nursing homes and meatpacking plants, for example — now there are thousands of small outbreaks in restaurants, bars, bowling alleys, colleges and gyms.""

Well, you just did say where the outbreaks are coming from. (Add non-protocol private gatherings and churches and T rallies to the mix)."
2020-11-23 19:50,"This is precisely why the virus is spreading so wildly in the US. I don't mean small gathering or large gathering, I meant your way of thinking and reasoning. I doubt you or anyone know(s) enough about the virus to draw the conclusion that you did. If you have studied how the virus spread in some of the countries such as UAE, you would have come to a different conclusion. Through small family gathering is precisely how the virus has spread. Something hasn't happened in the US doesn't mean it's not going to happen and writing an article like this is irresponsible to say the least. It's at the expense of those who are older and weaker."
2020-11-23 19:50,"Odd article.  
1. In US, we don't do good job of contact tracing, so small household encounters would be expected to be missed as a source, worsening the likely recall bias for more public exposures  (e.g. what are you more likely to remember as a possible exposure- your asymptomatic neighbor visiting 3 days ago or going shopping at Safeway or the fact that you are in jail?)
2. There's a difference between saying the science (as it is practiced in the US, though not perhaps as practiced in Australia, see other posts) is uncertain and saying that a public health recommendation is wrong.  Are household/private gatherings causing infection?  Just for example, the 3300 cases for which contract tracing is available in Lousiana are only about 1 in 100 of the total cases in Louisiana.  Hard to call that anything close to representative or useful.
3. States are trying to weigh the economic/social costs of distancing (e.g. restaurants going out of business, weddings not celebrated) against the risks of spreading COVID.  This is not easy in any setting, even one with good data and clear direction from national policymakers.  This article just seems to throw darts at the balloons without any grander point.  Do governments have to make decisions based on slim data?  Yes.  Is that wrong?  Well, depends, but probably not when you are dealing with a pandemic that has killed 250 000 Americans and adequate vaccination of population is another 6-9 months away.  
Snark ain't science, sorry."

The author acknowledges there isn't enough good evidence, and then turns around and says that lack of data about household transmission means that household spread isn't a significant factor. This is not only misleading, but dangerous being published right before holiday travel when people are likely making final decisions about whether to get together for Thanksgiving or not."
2020-11-23 19:51,"Ms Mandavilli,
You say outbreaks are more likely to be caused by jails and long term care facilities, but then give a countering example about a wedding in Maine that caused almost 180 cases. Did you not know that those cases were traced to a guest who worked at a rehab center and a guest who worked at a jail? Using that wedding as an example without tying it into the earlier paragraph about outbreaks primarily being at jails and long term care facilities (+ hospitals and dining venues) seems very myopic. I like your point about politicians blaming individuals instead of their own systemic failures, but still. I genuinely can't believe that you used the Maine wedding as one of your only examples of an outbreak that wasn't at a care facility/jail without connecting that the guests who worked at those locations were linked to causing a majority of the spread."
2020-11-23 19:51,"The shutdowns seemed to be driven by a combination of politics and hysteria. 

Gyms account for a tiny percent of covid cases; they're shut. Churches, which bring people together at close quarters with less regulation than gyms, are open. Clearly, that's political.

We hear that masks can prevent Covid with stories like the famous hairdresser story. Then they shut down hair salons. 

Nursing homes and prisons continue to be hotspots. Nothing is done.  

Wearing masks outside, when you can safely distance, makes no sense. Closing beaches made no sense. 
Our library is ""quarantining"" books even though surfaces do not transmit the disease. Airlines are spending millions to swab surfaces yet seating people closely together. 

We hear about gatherings of friends and family only when there's a big Covid outbreak. When people get together and they're fine, we never hear anything. 

Children don't get covid in school; they get the disease on play dates and informal playgrounds. 

Last summer's demonstrations didn't lead to a lot of cases. Nobody talks about that. 

And we wonder why nobody trusts the guidelines?"
2020-11-23 19:52,"This gibes with our experience during Victoria, Australia’s second wave of COVID-19 in July and August.  I was involved in contact tracing, and while we did find cases related to gatherings at home - including one episode where a couple hosted a dinner party while awaiting results from a COVID test one of the hosts had that same morning - a large majority of the cases we traced, were related to institutions such as abattoirs and nursing homes.  Most of the cases acquired at home reflected transmission between people who lived with one another, not between guests."
2020-11-23 19:52,"I feel for those who are forced to make decisions, both regarding public policy and family choice, without adequate information.  We are all muddling through this as best we can."
2020-11-23 19:53,"This review is useful in pointing out where the gaps lie in our knowledge about how the infection spreads.  One very basic consideration is that the size of the crowd (say, in the dining area of a restaurant, whether indoors or outdoors) must strongly affect the odds of transmission (the bigger the crowd, the more likely it is that at least one contagious person will be present).  Can this idea be translated into usable requirements?  Would it be acceptable to limit the total available seating for outdoor service in, say, sports bars?  I think there would be a lot of pushback on this idea, even if convincing evidence were available.  I begin to see how hard it will be to translate incomplete but suggestive evidence into requirements that will be seen as workable and even-handed.  The fallback position is just to ban everything, on the grounds that doing so is the safest course."
2020-11-23 19:54,"The virus surged after Memorial Day, July 4, and Labor Day. Common sense suggests this was likely because of small social gatherings. Just because you can’t find data to support what common sense tells you is obvious, doesn’t mean the obvious has been disproved. The effect from Thanksgiving is likely to be worse since gatherings won’t be outdoors. This article seems speculative and irresponsible. Why encourage people to let down their guard now, as the pandemic is reaching new heights?"
2020-11-23 19:54,"Ellie said it all:  “It’s a way of distracting from the harder public health work that we need to do,” she said — for example, by implementing mask mandates, addressing societal inequities and ensuring enough personal protective equipment for health care workers.”
As with many changes and challenges this country faces the government needs to address the issues and offer solutions.  However our countries attitude that government is too big, shouldn’t tell us what to do, etc. negates the governments ability to solve problems.  Government is suppose to provide for the well being of citizens among others important aspects that enable us to function.  So many citizens want the electricity to never turn off, all roads to be maintained, adequate food supply, clean water, etc. but do not want taxes that would enable society to function smoothly.  And some of these same citizens expect the “government “ to bail them out when they need help.  How sad and ironic that Red states need most federal money yet vote for lower taxes and less government."
2020-11-23 19:56,"I think simple combinatorics are at work here. At parties and family gatherings people mingle and usually before going home everybody speaks face face with everyone else. Other gatherings differ in that people sit or stand in fixed locations and not all pairs of people speak face to face (e.g., at the gym or at a restaurant). If you have 5, 10, 20 and 50 people, you have 10, 45, 190 and 1,225 unique pairs of people, respectively. Obviously, the risk of infection grows dramatically (nonlinearly)  as the size of the group expands."
2020-11-23 19:56,"Doctors take an oath to do no harm, and politicians are just afraid of being wrong, so I expect both to be cautious and recommend restrictions.

2020-11-23 19:46,"The fault does indeed lie with individuals. Just because the government hasn't shut something down doesn't mean it's advisable to go there. If you go to your gym and get Covid there, it's not your gym's fault or your governor's fault. You are responsible for your behavior."

Where is the virus hitting right now, both in Europe and America ? In the COLD places... This virus is simply seasonal, like the flu, and loves the cold. That's why China, India or Brazil don't have a second wave right now, there's no real winter there appart in a few key areas. Look at Europe : Austria is hit the hardest at the moment, because it's all mountains. Certainly not because people don't respect the rules there, they had one of the best balanced and efficient lockdowns back in the Spring. And in the US ? It's not Republican states, it's just cold states. Wyoming, Minnesotta, the Dakotas... And the cold states less hit like in the North East ? Part of it is immunity, because they were hit in the first wave. Same in Europe : Paris is twice to three times less hit than Lyon for example. The former was hit hard in the first wave, the second barely. On the French Atlantic coast ? A lot less cases than inland. Same in America : Florida seems less serious. As for the places spreading the virus ? Any long indoor gathering with no mask and poor ventilation. It's that simple. So yeah, friendly dinners, restaurants, bars, concerts, families, nursing homes, schools... Nothing complicated... The virus loves the cold, and with the cold, people get even more indoors, windows closed, so it gets passed on even more easily... Why aren't you seeing this ?"
2020-11-23 19:47,"I strongly suggest readers who are interested in this topic check out the decision-making by British Columbia Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, who was earlier profiled as one of the top leaders worldwide by the NYTimes. Here in BC, we are facing a difficult second wave, but the spread is controlled enough that contract tracing is still possible and meaningful (unlike most of the US). The data most definitely shows spread via social gatherings, which is why we are currently not permitted to socialize with other households right now, at all, period. (Walks outside are permitted as long as they don’t become a gathering.) Restaurants remain open because they have to follow safety guidelines or get shut down (no tables larger than 6, must wear mask when standing, must provide contact info, etc.) whereas private households have little incentive. There are also economic concerns. This article brings up a good point re: a lack of uniform definition of “social gathering” (e.g. # of people) but otherwise I fear this is yet another irresponsible article that can be used to justify indoor multi-family Thanksgiving meals. Contract tracing just simply isn’t possible anymore in the US. Large institutions (prisons, workplaces, etc.) have testing requirements in place that individuals do not. Look to jurisdictions like BC where we actually still have meaningful data. If you don’t think transmission is happening at small indoor social gatherings in the US, you’re kidding yourself."

2020-11-23 19:42,"I'm surprised that no one has mentioned or thought about whether Trump's many crowded, maskless shout/yell-filled rallies before the election, just a couple weeks ago, led to the massive increase in infections seen in mid-America, aka Trump country.

2020-11-23 20:00,"This phase of the Covid pandemic in the United States should be called Denial Fever. In the absence of rational  federal leadership on how to best respond to the outbreak, every state has had to respond individually. The ensuing chaos helped by political division and fake ""experts"" like Dr. Atlas has been deadly. When a large segment of the population believes the virus is not real and POTUS refuses to take it seriously, it is small wonder that confusion reigns. When you mix politics with public health, you get politics. Extreme measures such as shutdowns and avoiding even small family gatherings  are only necessary when people refuse to buy into less burdensome means of control such as wearing masks, social distancing, and avoiding larger indoor gatherings. The more we know about this virus, the better the advice on how to contain it will be. Dr. Fauci and his colleagues are in the best position to understand the virus make these recommendations. Once the basics are being observed, one can quibble about the details  such as how many people constitute an unsafe indoor gathering. In the meantime, better safe than dead."
2020-11-23 20:00,"The concept is simple. The more exposures you have to other people, the more likely you are to contract the disease if you are susceptible, and the more likely you are to spread it if you are infectious. Going to one 10 person party per month is less risk than having a daily one on one lunch with a different person every day for a month. It’s the cumulative exposure that matters.

Trouble is, it’s a hard math problem due to the ability to gauge the risk In each encounter. Four people having dinner is riskier than four people chatting with masks on. We tend to trust people we know more than people we don’t, not accurately assessing how risky their behavior is.

Given how the pandemic is spreading, cautioning people about all vectors of spread is important right now. Trying to assign a preponderance of risk is fine for statisticians and epidemiologists. But for most people the simple message is:

The virus is real.
Avoid close contact with others.
Wear a mask.
Wash your hands.
Ventilation lowers risk.
If your risk of exposure has gone up, drive down your risk of infecting others. 

All the restrictions and testing and curfews and rules are just trying to modify people’s behavior to support the above."
2020-11-23 20:01,"Given the myriad deficiencies with testing, contact tracing, and our knowledge of the virus, it makes one wonder why the NY Times would be so confident contradicting guidance about the role of social gatherings in the spread of the virus. 

The guidance might be wrong--and we should possibly be more emphatic in avoiding activities other than social gatherings. But as your own articles indicates, we don't know. And, frankly little harm could come from encouraging people to curtail most avenues of physical contact with other humans for a few more months. But much harm can come from folks running with your possibly incorrect conclusions. 

Furthermore, you must know that this article will be used by covid deniers and fatigués to justify their recklessness. I'm not sure why the NY Times would be so willing to further murky the waters and possibly inflict even more harm on an already beleaguered population."
2020-11-23 20:01,"This headline and article are misleading. The current evidence doesn't show that the surge is caused by household gatherings. But we're heading into the first major holiday of the season -- a holiday typically observed by extended family members staying in one home for a day for football, dinner, and games.  The implication of how this article is presenting information is that it's safe to observe a traditional Thanksgiving.  But there's no evidence to support that.  In fact, it seems that the Canadian Thanksgiving in October was a contributor to the spread of infection.  I don't find this article helpful.  Instead, it is another time media presents a mixed message on the pandemic which can lead to harm.  It's irresponsible."
2020-11-23 20:02,"We don't know anything for certain about what is driving the virus surge because our data is not very good, contact tracing has been iffy in that people don't want to respond to questions."
2020-11-23 20:03,"Here in the great state of New Jersey, common complaints revolve around not being able to hold religious services (in houses of worship), but grocery stores are open. Many cannot understand the difference between singing and spraying droplets in a crowded space for a couple of hours vs. being masked and passing by another person in the canned vegetables aisle. 

Unfortunately, there will always be a contingent that can’t follow the rules and/or understand the potential severity of this virus. Indeed, with so many notable figures (in Trump’s orbit) contracting the virus, yet having few to no symptoms and/or seemingly quickly recovering, the message can be interpreted that this is “no big deal.” Never mind that the average person doesn’t have the same access to care. As well, it’s pretty frustrating to be stuck alone inside all day, every day. 

I’m frustrated with those who don’t take this seriously. I’m most frustrated - and angry - with our country’s leadership for not addressing this head on when the facts became known. We could have shut the whole thing down in eight weeks (and you know who would have sailed easily to re-election, I have to admit) if a strong statement and action plan have emerged at the beginning. 

Instead, we’re faced with sheer fatigue coinciding with Thanksgiving. I shudder at the thought of the increased number of cases we will see in two weeks."
2020-11-23 20:04,"We live in an area with modest cases.  We have not had someone other than our household inside our home since March.  But we have entertained one family at a time on our patio which can be directly accessed from the street.  

We set up two table 12 feet apart.  Each table has its own drinks, utensils, condiments.  There is a third table away from the others on which the food is placed.  Each table individually goes to the food area to take food for themselves.  We eat, talk, enjoy the company.  With dinner over, second family leaves directly to the street.  We do all the cleanup and things go right to the dishwasher or sink.  Yes, there is some risk of fomite transmission through serving utensils and at cleanup, but it is pretty small.  We would not consider inviting someone into our house for a meal around a single table, or to sit together in a room."

The spike in Canadian cases after Thanksgiving in October

Are we destined to wander blindly until Covid 19 slowly
dwindles and will the prospect of a vaccine create a
false sense of security?"
2020-11-23 20:08,"Maybe the small gatherings didn't account for the majority of transmission, but it's fairly obvious that they aren't going to be helpful, nor will the traveling to get to/from these Thanksgiving gatherings, nor will people getting infected in these settings going out to bars and elsewhere to infect others.  It's a network, and with as many active infections as we have as a starting point right now make it very dangerous.

Perhaps the evidence isn’t conclusive but common sense dictates that all it takes is one positive person at a small gathering to infect everyone present. This seems to me highly irresponsible mixed-messaging going into a dangerous time. And, by the way, my state has had few enough cases to contact trace them, and our top doctor has made a direct link to social gatherings. Is he mistaken? You really need to be clearer. Meanwhile, we’ll keep to our own house with a lovely Thanksgiving dinner and Zoom with relatives."
2020-11-23 20:10,"Bottom line, we haven’t a clue. It doesn’t matter  if you follow science. There is no science except for the science that no one wants to believe. 

What we aren’t being told is that once the virus takes hold and starts to spread, absent perfect precautions, numerous studies indicate that it spreads in predictable patterns in predictable numbers until it is effectively blocked by the absence of subjects or extraordinary precautions that have only been imposed short term. 

The weight of science suggests that virus spread is mostly predictable and common precautions are generally outweighed by the virus’s capacity to reproduce.  Ordinary masks and social distancing do not stop the virus from finding its next target and its next target after that. There are no bad guys. The virus cares little if you take precautions. There is virtually always a path to the next subject and the virus will virtually always find it."

Outside in fresh air while wearing a mask and physically six feet apart is by far safer. Family members should open as many windows as possible. Six inches at least and use window guards if small children are around. This virus is invisible, swirls in the air and is deadly to all too many. With so many cases in the hospital, medical staffs will be overwhelmed. Even within one's immediate family, wearing a mask indoors and showering and changing into clean clothes after being out in the community is prudent. Do the best you can."

And the Feats of Strength?  Well, there's more room to to do that as well.  There's no excuse this holiday season can't be as wonderful as ever before."
2020-11-23 20:14,"In Ireland there is apparently enormous evidence that large outdoor gatherings out of doors without social distancing, primarily funerals, as well as meeting anyone outside your household indoors strongly contributed to the surge in cases this autumn.  Allowing NO ONE not from your own household inside your house has played a substantial role in controlling the virus's spread, which is why we now have the second fewest number of cases per capita in Europe."
2020-11-23 20:18,"This article is rather odd. If, as it seems, we have widespread difficult to trace community transmission going on, then yes, ""it's impossible to estimate how much social gatherings contribute to community transmission."" Such impossibility doesn't tell you that they aren't contributing or are not ""driving"" the pandemic. If we use Minnesota as an example, then more than half of cases do not have an obvious source like a mass gathering setting (which the article seems to still want to finger with the idea that government is ultimately responsible for not further addressing those hubs). So if the majority of cases are untraceable to large gatherings, then indoor gatherings of ANY sort and scale are clearly the most likely transmission places, in which case, yes, private gatherings should be discouraged. Can you get it at the supermarket rather than dinner with your friends? Well, sure, in theory, but you have to get food to eat. You do not have to have your friends over to consume that food with you or for game night. So public health officials are right in discouraging the public from doing things that people don't need to do. You should not be eating in restaurants. You should not be having friends over for dinner. You should be limiting sustained interactions with other people to only the necessary and unavoidable. It's sound advice, following what scientists say about how you most likely get the virus: close sustained (especially maskless) interactions with other people."
2020-11-23 20:19,"That may well be, but family gatherings are probably more likely to result in serious illnesses since they tend to mix asymptomatic younger people with their older vulnerable relatives.

Anyhow, regardless of which scenario contributes what percentage, we should avoid all the risky ones; or be very well-protected with masks whether outdoors or indoors (plus lots of ventilation)"
2020-11-23 20:20,"Thank you for this. There are a lot of irrational things being passed as rules from state to state. I understand officials are trying, but people know when it doesn’t make sense, as your article states. Even though it may take longer to explain, data should drive mitigation. In high school sports, banning everything again makes no sense. With mitigations in place, competitive swimming has not been a source of transmission, but in IL, it is banned just like wrestling is."
2020-11-23 20:20,"Infection rates are like budgets, if you spend on x then you can't spend on y.  As long as rate are high, we cannot take more risks.  Each encounter adds up.  When you have 1 million people as targets, the behavior of most will have very little affect.  But the chance encounter with an infected person so a time just long enough to get infected will occur.  The only safe thing is to reduce the number of different people you encounter, limit the time of exposure, and take preventative measures like wearing a mask.  The nature of the virus is exponential growth.  A few cases becomes a crowd within a few weeks."
2020-11-23 20:22,"In an essay whose chief target is the danger of mixed (and possibly ineffective) messaging -- we get -- another helping of fuzzy message.  The complaint lodged against pointing toward social gatherings is that ""we do not have that data.""  That's fine.  But then may we also point out that we did not have real solid data for masks and social distancing in the beginning -- other than what common sense and previous epidemiological experience informed us.  Should we have pushed back against that messaging too?  The argument that we ""do not have the data""  is revealed as an absurdity -- whenever lack of data (and reporting) is one of the glaring defects hamstringing our response to this point.

Statements such as the following: 
“More and more, our exposures are due to community spread and are not traceable to a single event,”  --  ""In most places, the virus is too widespread to claim with any confidence where someone became infected.""

Do NOT in fact point toward a conclusion that small social gatherings are not a significant or identifiable risk.  What they DO argue for, rather strongly, is that the public should continue (and should be ADVISED to continue) -- to avoid ""unnecessary"" contacts outside their household when possible.  Period.  And public figures (and health officers) are deserving of NO backlash or tut-tutting for strongly advocating (reoccurring) common sense public health measures as this pandemic continues to rocket up in severity.

Article was NOT helpful."

On one end, keep the government mandated off of my freedom loving face at all costs.  

On the other other, my neighbors who deem it necessary to sprint to the other side of the street as to avoid potentially coming remotely close to another human being, while meanwhile virtue-signaling the need for a mask while outdoors and not remotely close to anyone for no measurable period of time.  

Meanwhile the rest of us in the middle who take science and pandemic risks seriously, while also not being in one way completely neurotic in these ways, attempt to continue to bite our lips and tolerate those extremes we see around us."
2020-11-23 20:26,"To be intelligible, a piece on the origins of our current spike in covid cases needs to use percentages. If you report North Dakota has many covid cases in nursing homes, you need to say these cases represent x % of the cases in North Dakota. You probably didn't because that information is not known. So don't report tid bits that go nowhere.

The statement that health facilities are locations of spread is extremely general. Are you referring to the nursing homes, to covid units or a local primary clinics or what?. Are readers now supposed to stay away from all medical care as long as possible?

I believe this piece makes no sense because the data are not systematically collected. If this is the case, just report that. You don't have to prove to readers it's a confusing mess. We know."
2020-11-23 20:27,"I understand from an ER MD friend that the patients she's seeing now are from family passing it to each other, not from nursing homes or institutions as earlier. She says the virus is cunning, will find our weak points, and that family ties/obligations are a major weak point for many of us, getting us to let our guard down. 

Even worse, she says the virus has now mutated into something far more contagious than the Wuhan version, something I wish we'd hear more about, as it means that even masks don't provide the level of protection they once did, especially with interactions indoors, esp longer than a few minutes. I know of a few transmissions that have happened in this way.

Some good news tho, she's seeing fewer really awful cases and thinks the masks may be reducing the viral load people are exposed to. So pls don't take this as a reason not to wear masks.

Anyway, pls resist family pressures, pandemic fatigue and complacency, stay safe out there...and happy Thanksgiving..."
2020-11-23 20:28,"Not sure that writing thought pieces nitpicking public safety advice is a great use of time. Especially when in about 3 weeks cases will climb due to Thanksgiving. Whether that spike will be to this reporter's satisfaction, who knows."

I haven’t been home for 3 years.  My family is in the UK, and because I blew it and discovered that my passport was expired (long story) at the last minute, I had to cancel last year’s trip. This year, well, you know. Technically I COULD go home, but why would I endanger the people I love?

I have had two close friends die via FaceTime. I never want to experience that again. So, yeah, I’ll wait for this miracle of a vaccine before I go socialize."
2020-11-23 20:31,"In other words, no one really knows what is causing the surge in the number of infections, because nobody is keeping standardized records.  So, we are on our own.  Best not be in a nursing home, though."
2020-11-23 20:35,"Oh for Pete’s sake. In Chicago the fall spike was totally correlated with opening restaurants and bars for indoor dining. And the decline in recent weeks totally correlated with closing them again. Yet not a word said about them, it’s all apparently to be blamed on private gatherings (based on no evidence whatsoever). 

Restaurants and bars must have some lobby."
2020-11-23 20:36,"So, you can say what is not causing this surge, so you should be able to say what is, but you don't.  Color me skeptical.  Our family has been on very cautious lockdown since early March and we're going to stay that way until we get the all clear.  I like the comparisons to WWII.  Months or a year or two is nothing compared to that.  We are not going to begin getting a handle on this until Biden takes office.  An entire year lost.  And now that the well has been poisoned it will be like pulling teeth getting Team Red to comply.  Thank God a vaccine appears to work for this virus.  Citizens stepping up to do their part isn't in the cards on this one."
2020-11-23 20:43,"We have.been plagued (pun intended) by limited data and confusing messages. Some is inevitable but some is intentional. Initial messaging about masks confused preserving N95s for health care workers with recommendations against masking for the general public. And further there were data on surgical and cloth masks being poor at protecting the wearer, which remains somewhat true. But instead of a clear message airing all the contradictions and uncertainties, mask wearing was weaponized. Trump’s  using this against Fauci was typically despicable and irresponsible, and it continues. 

This article promotes similar confusion, confusing absence of evidence with evidence of absence. Many are trying to convey that with the degree of community spread we should be taking whatever precautions we can regarding household gatherings. Experts- epidemiologists and others- are naturally sticklers for data because it’s their currency, but they really need to convey full messages. I think Michael Osterholm’s shift in position on masking is a good example of a leading expert recognizing the practical impact of how he presented recommendations based on imperfect data. 

It’s wise to remember Nicholas Christakis’s (Apollo’s Arrow) observation that conspiracy, denial, and paranoia are historically almost as inherent to pandemics as the infectious agent itself. We are unfortunately witnessing it in real time."
2020-11-23 20:45,"Instead of trying to manipulate social interactions we should be focused on providing better physical framework for interactions.  For example, low densities, defined distances, masks, HVAC systems purging room air, etc."
2020-11-23 20:49,"After working in a retail store this year, my theory, based on observation, is that people are not wearing their masks correctly. A mask worn with nose exposed is practically worthless. Many people who contract the virus have no idea how they got it ,or passed it on, despite their ""efforts"". I bet there is a large overlap between those perplexed patients and the many people who leave their nose out or pull down their masks to speak.  The ""Wear masks"" message needs to include ""correctly""."
2020-11-23 20:51,"Up to this point in the pandemic youor thesis may be true, but the publication of articles like this may lead the public to assume a holiday meal with all the relatives is not a problem.  The problem is that you can't assume that will not change with many more indoor gatherings than we have had to this point. It is not the same experiment now as it has been."

2020-11-23 20:01,"It feels as if the science has become politicized.  Certain states locked down to flatten the curve in the early days of the pandemic, and once the BLM protests erupted, it was suddenly fine to gather in huge groups of slow moving people because racism is a pandemic, too.  The protests did not spread COVID-19, but COVID infections among cops who policed the protests skyrocketed.  San Francisco saw huge spikes in the wake of the protests, of course not caused by the protests.  I am in Newfoundland, Canada, which locked down early and stringently enforced social distancing, and mask wearing.  The small population is aligned with the public health messages and goals, which has been to protect vulnerable people in the province.  There was only one significant outbreak at a funeral in the beginning, which was quickly contained.  'Only' four people died. There have been 319 cases altogether.  After the initial outbreak, all new cases registered were from travelers.  I feel totally safe here."

He says he gets up every day, knowing he’s doing something immoral but he would lose his house if he had to shut down!

Another NYC Hasidic relative had a large wedding in Crown Heights about six weeks ago, where there was dancing, eating and drinking.  Two people are known to have contracted Covid-19 from that event.  Of course, not one guest wore a mask!

The handling of this pandemic has lacked competent leadership from day one.  Mask wearing was not modeled, in fact, our President demeaned it and equated it with weakness.  Depending on governors of particular states, rules are not enforced or clearly stated.  People have died who did not need to die.  First responders are working in war-like environments, with no respite.  It is all shameful.

To posit a dangerous theory (that small gatherings aren’t a risk) and back it up by having ‘experts’ say that “we don’t have the data” to disagree is preposterous.
Given the unmitigated disaster of a federal response to the pandemic, we can confidently say that “we don’t have the data” about absolutely ANY aspect of the virus, and its effects on the country.
Therefore, using the logic of this article, anything can be true.  QED.  Do what you want.

As the article itself states, the sheer magnitude of virus transmission in our country make exact attribution difficult if not impossible. Yet it stands to reason, from what is known (airborne virus that is highly contagious especially in closed environments with non-HEPA grade air filtration) that these gatherings may very well pose an issue. We are living in a pandemic with a novel virus and we will most certainly discover that our strategies were both inadequate and overly rigorous with the benefit of hind site after time as allowed data collection and interpretation. But we don’t have that luxury currently and have to use deductive reasoning in our efforts to stem the spread."

Science happens because investigators of all nations and backgrounds come together to dissect, support, and criticize one another's work before offering it to humanity as progress. 

For the science to be solid that 'coming together' happens in places of unquestionable, non-partisan authority like a conference, a scientific journal, or a government agency. 

The new GOP - who came to power thanks to a digital tool born of international scientific collaboration - proposes a silo approach to everything they do including research. They're cruelly happy to allow 50 states and 3000+ counties to figure it out on their own with little guidance and next to no financial support. 

This applies to all they do: They don't want diplomats or leaders to come together in places of unquestionable authority to co-create  solutions to global problems. Theirs is a very cynical, black-and-white world of givers and takers completely lacking any curiosity and creativity.

2020-11-23 19:57,"This seems more like an opinion piece than a solid scientifically informed article. Just because it is harder to trace infections back to small gatherings does not mean small gatherings are not a major source of spread in the community.

2020-11-23 20:06,"While this is certainly worth considering, I'm disappointed to see the author didn't consider the obvious selection bias going on here. We have a shortage of contact tracers, and the vast majority of cases are not traced, something the author acknowledged. Now imagine you're a contact tracer with limited resources, you're going to focus on big outbreaks where you get the most return on your time...prisons, nursing homes, meatpacking plants, not gatherings of 6 people. 

Of course the majority of cases *we were able to track* were traced to *the easiest places to track them*. Consider the author's own stats from Colorado. She cites around 10,000 cases that came from the easiest places to contact trace (jails, universities, nursing homes), but Colorado has had 200,000 confirmed cases of covid, and, based on estimates of actual infections by the Covid Tracking Project, around 800,000 actual cases. That means there are over 750,000 cases (94%) that weren't able to be traced and we have no idea what number of them are attributable to private social gatherings, but it's almost certainly more than the 4000 that were actually traced in prisons. 

Please, if you're reading this piece and weighing whether to have an indoor gathering with people you don't live with, know that the evidence provided does not support what the author claims it does. Public health experts like Fauci recommend against indoor gatherings, and a vaccine is coming soon. Stay strong and stay safe."

The current state of the world does not provide knowledge of who has the virus at any specific time other than for the instant when a sample for testing was taken.

Regarding indoor gatherings, both in restaurants or in private homes, of course the risk is real. It can be lessened through spacing and mask wearing but most people won't take these measures at a holiday meal.  Hugging, gathering at table, laughing, all these nice activities are highly risky indoors, especially when multiplied by 10 or more. Why do you need to sow doubt on the obvious?

That isn't to say that we can't all do all part, and limit our contacts as far as possible, and observe protocols.  But the fault lies with the lack of federal response (read, Trump's apathy about a quarter of a million lives los).  This shifting to individual responsibility is a way of shifting the blame.  It ebbs into all corners of our lives:   people struggling to educate their children while working under impossible circumstances are being held to task of they don't do it 'equitably', as if equal access to education was someone how their fault, not the city's, the state's, or the federal governments; we're urged to recycle (all fine) but it's a drop in the bucket when compared to the lack of response from fossil fuel companies, and then Trump administrations roll back of environmental regulations, trading poison for profit.

Health officials are trying to grasp at some reasonable guidelines. 
Let’s say, for example, family gatherings of no more than 10. 
But, will all ten people be in a 10x10 room for 4 hours? With no open windows?
With only one available bathroom?
No one wearing masks?

Or is your Thanksgiving location a 4000 square foot setting with opportunities to go inside and out, with windows that open. 
Place settings distanced, perhaps a chair between every setting.  And masks encouraged after eating? 

My home isn’t a 4000 sq ft abode so I wouldn’t host a party for 10-even if my area currently permits this.  We can all get together for a big party after there is a vaccine. 

Our family recently received a kids sleepover invitation.  Five kids invited to a small townhome and to crowdinto one bedroom at night. 
The mom was annoyed that we declined because her numbers were well within the rules!"
2020-11-23 21:10,"As an epidemiologist, I don’t think that article was great. It missed 2 big points: 

1) “outbreaks” (defined as >2 individuals sick from the same location) always dominate spread, because the entire population attending the outbreak location can become sick. They also provide the majority of the *mixing situations* -- the highest number of people coming into contact. So we should be looking at statistics on the number of transmission events per transmission-possible event, where there is much higher possibility for large events. 

2) It missed noting that part of the reason levels are low for small gatherings is because people have been doing a good job! Let’s keep it up!"
2020-11-23 21:14,"Here in Melbourne Australia where thanks to being more isolated we have had low case numbers. We’ve just come out of a hard lockdown after a second spike that at its peak saw daily infections rise to 700 a day. 

So with such small numbers and through contact tracing and more scientific testing they were able to trace a lot of the causes to the outbreak. It came from hotel quarantine staff who were looking after returned overseas travellers became infected and took it home and infected their families as at the the rules had been relaxed to allow a maximum of 20 people in a home. 

Now thanks to the 10 week lockdown we have had zero infections for nearly 4 weeks but the easing of restrictions has meant that only 10 people Max can visit a home as a lesson from previous outbreak. So completely disagree with this article"
2020-11-23 21:16,"This reporting strikes me as disconnected. As many parts of this article point out, we do not know where/how large percentage of people contract the virus, so downplaying small gatherings is sketchy journalism.

Veiled encouragement for small get-togethers is irresponsible. With Thanksgiving, people are packing in on planes then multiple households are congregated in grandma's living room with the heat blasting and windows shut. Good environment for a virus to thrive and spread.

The local morning news reported from the airport -- the very crowded airport. Interviewing travelers,  the prevailing opinion was ""no one's going to keep me away from my family on Thanksgiving"". 

You don't have to be a scientist to recognize we're looking at an increasing spike in cases, hospitalizations and deaths for the foreseeable future."
2020-11-23 21:23,"The holidays present a very specific kind of small gathering.  College students (as stated in the article) are a  known Covid vector.  What happens when they come home for Thanksgiving?  What happens when they fly home for the holidays or drive ... maybe stopping at a bar for a few drinks.  Or they have those few drinks with old friends before going over the Grandma's for Thanksgiving dinner.

It seems that T-day is a unique example of a small gathering that combines several risk factors.  Dr.  Fauci state that -- to paraphrase -- as goes Thanksgiving, so goes the winter.  Okay, some restrictions may seem absurd; but, consider the alternative at this critical holiday juncture."
2020-11-23 21:23,Massachusetts Governor Baker begs to differ.  He's done a good job but the longer it goes on the less credibility he has since he seems to make stuff up in order to keep younger kids in schools (which I support but let's be clear about the data).
2020-11-23 21:24,"Shouldn’t a primary goal of contact tracing programs be to produce data on where people are
getting infected? Even if someone says there are multiple possibilities (“I ate indoors once, gathered with friends at my house, went grocery shopping and some people didn’t have masks on at the store”) we could tag all categories and then see where there is high overlap across the hundreds of thousands of cases each week. It mystifies me that the thrust of this article is we have no idea what behavior is causing the surge.... points to lack of national plan for data capture, which is essential for making sound policy decisions."
2020-11-23 21:24,"Just yesterday, driving into the packed parking lot of Stew Leonard's in Westchester, I turned around.  The uptick in cases is possibly because retailers are packing 'em in while they can, and people think that if there is no strict regulation as to capacity, then ""it's all good.""  Well, it ain't."
2020-11-23 21:16,"A lot of people are going to read this headline on Facebook and Twitter, which definitively states that small gatherings are not causing the surge in coronavirus.

Fewer of them will actually read the article and see sentences like: ""In most places, the virus is too widespread to claim with any confidence where someone became infected."" Or: ""...all activities become riskier as local case levels rise.""

I'm surprised and disappointed the NYT chose to publish such a misleading headline the week of Thanksgiving. Personally I will listen to the CDC and stay home."
2020-11-23 21:17,Our 'recent' Thanksgiving was actually six weeks ago and did not contribute to the current rise in cases. #factsplease
2020-11-23 21:16,"You've presented skepticism, but no evidence. Of course large gatherings fuel larger spikes that small household gatherings.  That doesn't make smaller gatherings safe.  

Our community has a low enough rate for contact tracers to do keep up with new cases and they are reporting that small household gatherings are causing the spike in our community.  I have no reason not to trust them.  Some of the gatherings have been outdoors in fact.  

Pods make sense-- but hosting dinner parties for people who are not in your pod will increase the risks of exposure."
2020-11-23 21:01,Unhelpful to still say at this point that we don’t have much data.  Tell us what we do know and let’s get more data for goodness sake.
2020-11-23 21:11,"“A pandemic is more a failure of the system than the failure of individual choices.”

This is an absurd statement. Almost every situation, absent an out of the blue natural occurrences such as an an earthquake or a hurricane is nothing BUT individual choices. And when those choices add up to an undesirable whole, well, then, the choices are to blame. If we had made better ones, we would not be here right now and we would not be heading where we're heading.

It's also worth noting that in terms of the data, it is extremely likely that people are lying about their behavior when it comes to their own poor choices. People for the most part aren't going to hesitate to admit that they, for instance, went to a job they were required to go to, or went grocery shopping, because they had to do those things. But if they make what they know was a poor choice, to gather with people outside their household, they're much more likely to lie about it. 

None of that is to excuse for a single second the abysmal failings of the Trump administration and Republicans in general in responding to this pandemic, but this is hardly the dark ages. Even with the awful messaging and complete lack of national strategy, people have enough information available to understand what they should be doing. They're just choosing, individually, not to do it."
2020-11-23 21:20,"We just had our first 11,000+ case day in MI. So are we down to just wearing masks and staying six feet apart, and don’t live in a nursing home or jail?"
2020-11-23 21:28,"So now this appears? I am having a completely outdoors Thanksgiving with 15 relatives (all of whom have spent time with each over the past 6 months) spread out into small tables with immediate households and I have been raked over the holiday coals for daring to get together. 

And let me end with an argumentative statement -- many of those criticizing me in my circle do not like or want to spend time with their families and they are relieved to have a reason to get out of travel."
2020-11-23 21:29,I appreciate this article but some of the bizarreness in the recommendations comes from public officials trying balance keeping people alive versus keeping business alive (which keep people alive).  Worthwhile to know would be how many bars and restaurants could survive take-out only and if there is any wherewithall to subsidize them until they can safely open.
2020-11-23 21:29,"I work for a health department and as we've seen massive increases in cases we've also transitioned data systems so I can't say this for sure, but before the spike it was an obvious increase in cases due to smaller gatherings and no obvious change in other exposures. I think a lot of people saying it's not due to small gatherings understandably just want to see the raw data and see other data suggesting otherwise, but I've seen enough case investigations to know that the majority of the situation for us is people get together thinking it'll be fine and that person ends up testing positive from another event where they thought it would be fine. People just need to lock their social network up again and numbers will go back down, I think."
2020-11-23 21:37,"The NYTimes AND Ms. Mandavilli have DONE A DISSERVICE TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC by publishing this opinion piece. And,yes, it IS an opinion, piece -- not one based on scientific fact. I'm sitting next to a PhD in Microbiology, who is even working on Covid-related work, and both of us put our heads in our hands. Like Tommy, from Lincoln, a health department worker, we cannot believe -- in these times of Trump & literally millions of Americans, questioning reasonable thinking -- that Mandavilli would question whether small social gatherings are part of the problem in the spread of the pandemic. Here in Australia, our second home, the country wisely went through a lockdown -- no ""small"" social gatherings -- and just about every state has had zero cases for some time, now."
2020-11-23 21:39,"This article contradicts your very recent article surveying hundreds of epidemiologists, many of whom said they are NOT getting together with their families for the holidays. So what is the real answer for the spread? We don't know. But this kind of contradictory reporting is not helping the average lay person understand what they should be doing, and I fear that many will see the inconsistent messaging and just give up on taking precautions because ""who really knows what is driving the surge?"" I've been a medical writer for 36 years and even I am having trouble keeping up with the wave of inconsistent messages."
2020-11-23 21:46,"Rather than trying to determine where the highest and lowest risks in order to appease people’s obtuse understanding of “freedom,” our leaders should have locked everything down while doing comprehensive masking, testing and tracing. We could have flattened the curve. But without leadership from the top we are hamstrung. Now it seems too late."
2020-11-23 21:50,"""In this sort of conflagration, it’s impossible to estimate how much social gatherings contribute to community transmission.""

So the point of this article is what?  It tries to argue against transmission from gatherings but then says there is no clear evidence either way, and that's it's virtually impossible to ascertain.  All I know is that NYC in particular was locked down for an extra two months this summer so that the much anticipated contact tracing initiative could be set up.  Unfortunately, this contact tracing effort has been a colossal failure.  It has not kept a lid on things or helped pinpoint transmission.  Meanwhile, it does not take a genius to figure out that a lot of transmission is occurring at people's homes.  People have nowhere to go and have been told that their home is safest, so they are inviting close friends, neighbors family over.  People get a false sense of security there, so the coronavirus continues to get passed around like free cookies.  Bear in mind that office buildings are 90% empty, indoor dining is at a measly 25%, and gyms are severely restricted.  Significant transmission is not coming from those places, and nobody can prove that it is without citing transmission figures from the pandemic's onset when restaurant/bar patrons were packed like sardines and nobody wore masks."
2020-11-23 21:51,"What's going on is pretty obvious.   States desperately needed the revenue from restaurants, bars, and sports events, but get no little revenue from private gatherings.      They will resist closing businesses that pay taxes, and blame everything on individuals instead."
2020-11-23 21:52,"Both here and in recent pieces on school openings, the New York Times seems to have forgotten the old adage ""correlation is not causation.""  Perhaps this is due to the corrupting influence of economics, but that fact must be remembered.  

In science, one can't just look at data and expect their conclusions to hold water in the real world; scientific claims must be DEMONSTRABLE, not just plausible.  Extrapolations from data are just as driven by ""narratives"" as observations by people on the street, and until we move beyond just claims drawn from data (which, for example, patently showed for thousand of years that the earth was flat) and instead rely on real, demonstrable, experimental evidence to back up our claims, the narratives might as well be shouted to each other over a dinner table."
2020-11-23 21:53,"The big problem in the city where I live are the bars, particularly around the universities.  The restaurants should not be lumped in with the college bars.  Our sit-down, locally owned restaurants (no chains) have gone to great lengths to sanitize, and to create barriers to transmission and distances among customers.  It is the bars that are the problem. Young people don’t usually get the debilitating symptoms that older people do, so it is difficult for them to believe that they may infect others.  This virus is tricky in that way. The bars need to be shut down for at least a month and the owners should relief to carry them through and the staff should receive unemployment benefits until the bars can be safely reopened."
2020-11-23 21:54,"The problem with this article is that it feeds into the idea of exceptionalism. ""We won't get it if we're careful, there was a nyt article that said the risk is low'. There have been surges after every public holiday in our country and elsewhere.  We aren't all going to be the exception. If we are all gathering, cases will rise."
2020-11-23 21:54,"It is like heavy rain and a roof with multiple leaks and then wondering which leak to blame for getting wet until the roof caves in and then the only chance of staying dry is to move to a tent. To avoid getting Covid-19, one needs to stay away from other people other than one's own household until everyone is vaccinated. It is only a few more months to wait in exchange for years of life free from Covid-19 and its potential long term effects. I recognize many people have no choice to physically isolate, but those who have a choice should do so both for their own well being and the well being of the society."
2020-11-23 21:55,"Just because they aren't the main driver of infection doesn't make gatherings of multiple households under one roof a good idea. 

Meatpacking plants and jails and nursing homes all contain workers. Those workers go home to families and live in their communities. They may even go to bars or restaurants. 

Right? So if one of those workers in asymptomatic and invites friends/family over for Thanksgiving, can it not spread?

Kelly"
2020-11-23 21:55,"The current surge is most likely attributable to a general lack of compliance, especially among trump supporters, and the Sturgis motorcycle rally.  It's not hard to see on an infection map that Sturgis is a likely epicenter of infections.  

These kinds of events are especially problematic because they draw people from all over the US.  They go to the rally.  They rub shoulders in packed venues with their brethren and then go home to seed an outbreak of infection.  

Imagine a hundred thousand fire arrows arcing over a thousand mile swath from Sturgis.  As they fall on fresh tinder, they ignite tens of thousands of local infections.

Thanksgiving and Xmas will be even worse.  Even in the sheltered enclave of Los Alamos NM where we live, the infection rate is climbing at an alarming rate."
2020-11-23 21:56,"This article only serves to create confusion about something that shouldn’t be that complicated.  The virus spreads whenever the conditions are right, regardless of setting.  It’s only common sense that nursing homes, prisons, and the like are driving up the numbers, given that they are institutional settings with large numbers of people in close quarters.  If someone from the community brings in the virus it’s like lighting a match in a tinderbox.  If we all take the necessary precautions (masks, physical distancing, and avoiding gatherings with those outside our household) we will reduce the risk of acquiring the virus.  And we will furthermore reduce the chance that someone from the community will bring it into an institutional setting.  It’s not complicated!"
2020-11-23 21:56,"This is a very contradictory piece and uses unstandardized data to back up its claims. Likely data with known exposures are highly skewed towards institutions with closed campuses and are lacking for home gatherings. Just because fewer cases are recorded from small home parties doesn’t mean that’s where transmission can occur, seed new infections in communities, and subsequently explode in densely populated groups, like nursing homes and jails. This article does a disservice to public health."
2020-11-23 21:57,"It is unfortunate that so many commenters here focus on the notion that the editorial remarks upset their previously held conclusions. A lot of scientific knowledge is not predicated on certainty, rather on ignorance and (to some extents) failure.

Ms. Mandavilli stipulates that definitive evidence is lacking. That is true. This does not mean we should all start traveling through airports and buses and trains to family gatherings. Those travel hubs are more dangerous.

There are numerous problems with the reporting systems. People will forget or even lie about exposures--in big box stores and other crowded areas. There will always be some exceptions to perceived wisdoms, so the issues raised here should not be such a surprise. We have a lot to consider and are still learning.

The history of medical sciences is littered with inconsistencies. These do not imply fraud. Often it amounts to outdated information being improved. 

The search for certainty has its own problems, as we have all seen: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-prediction-future.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-prediction-future.html</a> (""No one knows what's going to happen,"" Mark Lila, 22 May 2020).

If you want no risk, don't gather with anyone, whatever the group size. If you want to get sick, go to a Trump rally. There is a good bit of room on either end of the scale. Stop thinking about and looking for absolutes."
2020-11-23 22:00,"The virus doesn't care if it's Thanksgiving or not.  Every time anyone gathers with any person with whom they are not already gathering (i.e., anyone from outside their household) they are increasing the risk to themselves and anyone with whom they subsequently interact.  I think there are times when, doing everything we can to minimize the risk, we should still allow people to gather, including end-of-life visits to loved ones in hospitals/hospices.  I do not think that holiday gatherings qualify for the increased public health risk imposed on us all.  This isn't going to go on forever.  Please just hang in there a little longer and keep the greater good in mind."
2020-11-23 22:00,"This article contradicts itself - or perhaps not quite, but starts off with a bold claim that it claims is based on ""data"", and then both provides no data (but plenty of ""we don't actually know where people are getting it""), and otherwise chips away at it until a very boring conclusion. I think the actual claim supported by the evidence presented is, ""small gatherings aren't as important for spread as riskier things like indoor churches and indoor dining"" - which seems self-evidently true. As does a statement like ""your restrictions should make sense or people will ignore them"". But locations that still have plenty of spread despite having reasonable and strong restrictions, yeah it probably is personal gatherings that fuel it and the interviewed experts say as much.

It's also worth noting that if you think 10-person gatherings are the problem, you wouldn't set a restriction at 10 people. You'd set a restriction at 10 if you thought 50-person gatherings were the problem."
2020-11-23 22:02,"The real problem with the stream of  irrational, unenforceable executive orders backed up by half truths and outright lies is that the public is becoming increasingly skeptical of anything the authorities have to say. This is particularly troublesome now that there is real hope with highly effective mRNA vaccines on the horizon.  If the public doesn't believe they're effective, because they have been continually lied to, this crisis will continue because people will refuse to take the vaccine."
2020-11-23 22:05,"Some people already ignore the guidelines. Articles like this will encourage even more to do that. It's NOT SAFE to get together and share air. Period. ""SAFER"" does not mean safe. The level of risk will not be low enough to be considered safe until effective vaccines are in widespread use. In the mean time, people should try to do only what is necessary in terms of gathering or being around people with whom they do not reside. THAT is the message people need to hear, because many think that as soon as something opens, it must be safe. Level of risk increases or decreases based on each gathering: how many people are present, how many people have they been in contact with prior to the gathering. For example, people who work with a lot of other people are at a higher risk of being exposed to the virus. And, if any infected persons are present at the gathering, how long were around everyone else there, what precautions were taken, in case any asymptomatic spreaders were present?  And then, if people ARE infected, how many people do THEY come into contact with after the gathering?  Considering that about half the country believes in ridiculous conspiracy theories, I find articles like to this to be irresponsible."
2020-11-23 22:05,"As one who has been keeping my doctor and dentist appointments I was alarmed to see you lump them in as major spreaders along with nursing homes, bars and meat-packing plants. If this is true, why not report exactly how much risk is involved in going to the doctor or having a procedure done at a hospital."
2020-11-23 22:06,"This sort of reminds me of how we deal with droughts in California. There's a huge pressure on individuals to take shorter showers, or water their lawns less. But the truth is that it's our agriculture and livestock industries that are taking up the vast majority of our water. We could all shower once a week, and cattle would still be drinking up the Colorado River to keep fast food products cheap. Putting the blame on individuals is a way to avoid the massive social and institutional change required to address these existential crises."
2020-11-23 22:08,"The problem here is the classic ""proximate cause"" conundrum. If a visitor or guard brings the virus into a prison after catching it at grandma's house, and then it whips through the prison and spreads from there, was it the ""family gathering"" that caused the spread, or the prison? What if it was a visitor who's a grocery cashier or subway attendant or medical worker, who got it from someone who got it from someone who got it at a backyard barbecue? What if that barbecue spreader got it from someone who ""doesn't believe in"" masks and social distancing? Or flip it around: Suppose someone picks up the virus at a bar, brings it home, and then their roommate spreads it to family at Thanksgiving?

The virus always has to come from somewhere, and each link in the chain of transmission bears some responsibility, even if it isn't itself a super-spreading event.

Of course we should be taking steps to make prisons and nursing homes safer (and should probably just be closing down bars and restaurants to all in-person consumption). But, unfortunately, part of those steps will have to be a reduction in other forms of contact, including gatherings at home."
2020-11-23 22:08,"The comment about care centers (nursing homes) being a focus of infection fails to understand that the exposure in such places is  coming from outside. Most of the residents are not out in the community, but the people (often young and/or lower income) are out in the community. And, since we know that there are a significant number of those individuals that are asymptomatic, they can bring in the virus without knowing it. In Minnesota there have been significant numbers in congregant care facilities that have been traced in such a manner. There have also been a large number of weddings and funerals that have been sources for the virus. The fact that they haven't specifically identified a backyard BBQ is only because the tracking and tracing lacks the number of tracers necessary to determine that."
2020-11-23 22:10,"It’s easy to put blame on family or friends gathering together instead of institutions or bars/restaurants.  Elected officials don’t want to make restaurants do take out only or shut down bars completely because they’re employment generators.  Now we all make choices for community spread...my neighbor has an out of state family visiting them for Thanksgiving...I chose to limit my Thanksgiving to family only.   Do I look negatively upon my neighbor for choosing to have a Friendsgiving? Yes, because my neighbor could have had a gathering without friends.  I also frown on individuals who patronize bars/restaurants, but if there was adequate stimulus for these mom n pop bar/restaurants, I would want them closed so the party crowd would have to stay away!"
2020-11-23 22:13,"What was the point of this article?? Even if these small gatherings do not contribute significantly to the surge of the covid infection, there is still a risk allowing the virus to persist in the community and making it that much harder to eradicate the virus. Yes, larger gatherings carry a higher risk of COVID infection but the situation is dire right now and we need to get rid of this virus in any way that we can."
2020-11-23 22:15,"This article paints a very misleading picture of the coronavirus-related restrictions in MN by interspersing partial information about the restrictions with generic quotes.  MN HAS closed all bars and restaurants to in person dining, but a reader could easily imply from this piece that only private social gatherings are affected by the order.  It fails to mention that the order also banned youth sport activities, which had been the source of a decent number of infections, and closed theaters and museums.  It left non-essential stores and salons open so long as they adhered to restrictions regarding capacity, masking, and distancing, because they didn't seem to be driving much transmission.  Starting in the spring, the state pursued an aggressive plan to limit COVID in congregate care facilities, which has been somewhat effective.  

Given that the front page of our Sunday paper was headlined ""No beds anywhere,"" we need to be taking significant measures to limit transmission.  The state rolled out a COVID tracking app today.  Maybe that will produce data that allows the state to modify the restrictions around social gatherings.  Until then, I'm satisfied the state's justification for the restrictions, and I'm adhering to them."
2020-11-23 22:17,"Too many examples of bad government policy here. People will start ignoring laws.
Here is an idea:
1. Everyone in the US is required to wear a mask when outside their home and in an enclosed structure. Period.
2. No more 6 foot distancing for anything.
3. Anywhere where people 60 and older gather are either closed down or in lockdown (like nursing homes).
4. Don't use the ICU beds for the very elderly who are most likely going to die anyway - as we do with a cancer patient. Use hospice."
2020-11-23 22:19,"I see two of the major problems with this article. One is that if you severely limit small gatherings, and people follow that advise, then there will be far fewer of them and far fewer cases will be attributed to them. What you don't know is how many MORE would there be if you did not limit them or people did not follow that advise. My guess is that we will be more able to tell after Thanksgiving. Also, areas that had huge numbers before such as the NE follow these guidelines better because they are more leery. 
The second is that outdoor living is just now going away. This is especially true where you didn't have high numbers before and smaller cities and towns. Once they start to go indoors for even smaller get togethers, I think you will see the numbers shoot up, especially where the numbers haven't been as bad. Those folks (and their elected officials) are not sacred or respectful enough because their experience has been better than the worst.
I'm from the NE and I'm not going to test it. I'll keep an eye on the mid west and other areas with not as much experience and fewer restrictions."
2020-11-23 22:20,"So, from a policy point of view, this is a valid question. From an impact to reader point of view, if a family gathering results in many in the family becoming infected, whole that number does not drive the greater surge, it certainly negatively impacts that family. It is not one or the other. Its all of the above."
2020-11-23 22:20,"I have family members who work in nursing homes and it is simply not true that little has been done since spring to reduce risk. They are regularly testing and have strict rules on visitors and deliveries (none allowed inside at this point), as an example.

Further, I have read numerous articles recently where Fauchi, epidemiologists, et al as well as local health departments specifically point out what people can do during the holidays to reduce risk.

This article adds nothing to the conversation."
2020-11-23 21:46,"The Times should pull this article immediately. It is a mass of confusing and contradictory factoids that people will interpret in the way that suits their agenda. The result will be sickness and death that could have been avoided.

From what I can make of it, the article implies that a small gathering in a public place is more dangerous than one in a private place. That makes no sense to me. But if that is what the reporter intended to say, the article gives tacit permission for dispersed families to gather at a single residence over the holidays. 

This is exactly what Dr. Fauci and other respected medical authorities are pleading for people to avoid at all costs.  Who knows how many lives will be lost because The Times said it was okay to visit home after all?"
2020-11-23 22:05,"Parties , weapons , and funerals thst do not have six feet distance can cause the spreading of the virus."
2020-11-23 21:52,"Very dangerous and misleading article. The author acknowledges that there is no concrete data to suggest household gatherings being responsible for the surge, yet we know for sure that exposure to covid is highest in indoor settings for long periods of time, and most contagious when the infected person is talking, laughing or singing in close proximity to others. Which is thanksgiving in a nutshell. 
In the absence of concrete data and with a deadly pandemic on our hands, the author should instead acknowledge that indeed there is a high risk that family gatherings contribute to a surge in cases. I mean come ON"
2020-11-23 22:15,Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
2020-11-23 21:35,"The source of infections is people being forced to go back to work. Apparently, even though they elected the ""science"" candidate, Democrats refuse to believe this simple point and instead reduce their arguments to mask shaming which is another thing Republicans and Democrats now share in common - blaming individuals for their problems instead of a system that forces them to make no good choices.

Nothing more smug than someone who gets their groceries delivered, has gotten to work from home since March, and owns a home, telling someone else the reason they might get sick is because they don't wear a mask - not that they are getting exposed because Democratic leaders and Republican leaders opened everything back up. The ""your personal choices led you to getting COVID"" sounds awfully like the GOP line ""if you are poor it is your fault.""

Close down everything and pay people to stay home. We won't do this (it would help poor people too much) and therefore will never control this pandemic. Instead we will get Republican governors ignoring reality, and Democratic leaders blaming people for their problems."
2020-11-23 21:43,"The peaks seem to be holiday related with peaks after July 4, start of school and Halloween.  Now we'll see the Thanksgiving day peak followed by the Christmas peak as everyone relaxes in social settings to celebrate and share the holidays and the air they breathe.
It's tough when there is no central pandemic authority that can assemble data and give us guidance.  maybe when the current ship of fools leaves the White House, we can get some thing done about the virus.

""Ellie Murray, an epidemiologist at Boston University said “A pandemic is more a failure of the system than the failure of individual choices.”"
2020-11-23 21:38,"Today I received a letter that indicated that anyone who attended Masses the weekend before last (Saturday, the 14th and Sunday, the 15th) should watch out for symptoms.  Fortunately I don't go to Mass any more.  Think of how scary that is?  7 Masses!  All I could figure is one or more of the priests are affected.  The fact that we are being contacted 8 days after possible transmission is weird since their ""outside"" date of transmission is the 30th.  But what about those who may have been infected who have not yet come down with the virus?  Kids are out of school.  People are traveling and meeting family in other states.  Why are people going to church anyway?  Church has always been a center of illness this time of year."
2020-11-23 21:29,"The ""pro-life"" Republican party values money over lives.  Fighting Covid restrictions is not about ""freedom,"" it's about the almighty buck.  The Republicans con the masses into fighting for ""freedom"" to go to stores, but it's really about prioritizing commerce of over lives."
2020-11-23 22:18,"I agree with the comments made so far.  The article contains contradictions, opinions trying to be made into fact just by repeating it over and over again.  Even the scientist cited for the article does the same.  How did the virus get into the various institutions?  People not practicing the guidelines that science says is mitigating the spread.
It is equally true that testing lags 7-14 days in some places in the country. Very disappointed that this article slipped by the editorialists and fact checkers."
2020-11-23 21:40,This article is confusing and contradictory. It says data doesn’t show spread by family get togethers and then don’t have data to say where spread is coming from
2020-11-23 22:19,"You do realize that this headline will contribute to many many people and households getting together because “the data shows” it’s safe. Misinformed headlines are literally killing us. People don’t read articles. They read, react to, share and are convinced by headlines."

2020-11-23 21:51,"My guess for months has been Trump’s various ""Rallies"" and the quarter million (later reported as a half million) motorcycle event in South Dakota. As noted by the Times and other news media these massive upticks occurred two weeks to a month or so after the rallies, afoot or on horseback. The last rally was about a week ago so there might be another rise in the virus about a week from now and then on the third Sunday in Advent will be the after effects of Thanksgiving just in time for the Xmas gatherings and the Twelfth Night pandemic uptick. 

With any luck the vaccines will be distributed by the Inauguration, and many of us, including the careless, will not get infected. For Lent the ""First Amendment no maskers"" will give up being bare faced for 40 days. Though all will have to continue to gather Easter eggs masked and at social distance from each other, by July 4th with enough of us vaccinated it might be a normal holiday without negative after effects. One can always hope."
2020-11-23 22:06,"This is an absurd opinion piece, and publishing it was quite irresponsible. In the guise of asking and answering the one big question (kind of), it leaves a lot of little questions running around unattended and unnoticed. Just imagine a fragile earthen dike with lots of little holes jetting out water. And yet, the focus is the one really big one! Can't worry about the many little ones leaking all of that water until we find the single really big one! There is no reason why we can't be fighting this virus on all fronts, not just one. And while I agree that a consistent national policy would have helped, along with having a president who is not himself a major and persistent source of virus misinformation (soon!), the point is we ARE here because of many irresponsible individuals making careless and thoughtless decisions regarding this virus! If not going to gatherings indoors would result in a slowing of rates of contagion or a reduction in the positivity rate, and I mean curtailing any gatherings indoors that mixes members of different households, why shouldn't we ALL be doing that?"
2020-11-23 21:52,"Oh, a pundit. Great. I’ll take your speculation over the public health system. This is just grist for the conspiracy theorists."

2020-11-23 22:15,"The more 'small social gatherings,' the more infections we will suffer.

This article will mislead many to think that since such gatherings are not THE LEADING factor of the surge, they are therefore not a risk.

The '(So Far)' portion of the article's title shows the author realizes the potential dangers of such gatherings.
The NYT needs to acknowledge and correct this information."
2020-11-23 21:35,People are having LARGE gatherings. There have been parties in my neighborhood nearly every weekend since March. It was quiet this past weekend. Perhaps Covid has caught up with them?
2020-11-23 22:23,"And yet the Times has an Opinion piece today (""Staying Safe This Thanksgiving"") in which 4 experts strongly argue that people should forgo the usual Thanksgiving gatherings.

This article reminds me of following ""EpiTwitter"" (epidemiologists on Twitter) in the early days of the pandemic, when there was lots of gatekeeping, shouting down and prevarication but precious little in the way of actionable advice."
2020-11-23 21:46,"This is one of the stupidest and most irresponsible articles I've ever read in the NYT. Since the virus is widespread and cannot be traced to the sources of outbreaks, we should individually take every precaution in every situation to reduce the chance of transmission regardless of what our leaders say or what policies have been enacted."
2020-11-23 21:56,This article is an irresponsible mess of thoughtlessness. The disease is way ahead of our analytics but this kind of thinking will kill us.
2020-11-23 22:35,"Here is what we know is not causing community spread: outdoor dining. Yet Los Angeles just banned it, putting thousands of people out of work during Christmas season. Thanks for the memories. Honestly, sometimes I think that the only people who should be allowed to determine what stays open and what stays shut are those of us who can *not* earn a living from the comfort of our bedrooms."
2020-11-23 22:39,"Yes, ""Personal responsibility"" is the mantra of those who   allow preventable harm to society out of a concern for private profit. Having said that, I do find the headline a reckless jump to conclusion (nothing new about media distorting research findings into mis-leading click-bait). 
""are dinners and backyard barbecues really the engine driving the current surge...? The available data do not support that contention, scientists say."" Read the question again. Now read the headline. Not having the data to support something doesn't mean its not true. Being ""far less certain"" and having ""little evidence"" in this case, is simply a matter of not being able to collect data effectively enough to conclude something.  ""It is nearly impossible to compare the relative contribution of social gatherings to the number of cases in different states...."" Then why are you pretending to?  ""In Louisiana, social events account for just 1.7 percent of the 3,300 cases for which the state has clear exposure information."" There have been over 220,000 cases in Louisiana! Just because its easier to contract trace back to facilities in which people are confined all day, doesn't mean private social gatherings aren't contributing in large measure.  And even if they aren't ""driving a surge"", yet, what I'm personally concerned about is one person - my 87 year old mom. So surge or no surge, here come the holidays, and it only takes one exposure to end up in the ICU.  And with headlines like this one...."
2020-11-23 22:43,"While I'm sure the credentials of the author and her sources are excellent I prefer to listen to the guidance of the decision makers in the State I live in. which happens to be Vermont. Govenor Scott and his team have first hand knowledge of the infection and contact tracing data here. They say that increasing number of cases in this state stem not from outbreaks in nursing homes, universities, or prisons - indeed those have been the focus of surveillance testing for months with great success- but from social gatherings related to very specific sports leagues and to large Halloween parties and my understanding is that the initial index case has been traced. The goal in this state is to keep schools open for in-person learning, to keep businesses, including hospitality and ski area, open to as great an extent as possible. and to keep medical resources from being overwhelmed. Their track record so far is excellent."
2020-11-23 22:44,"Knowing what causes the majority of infections is not going to help if I get infected in a way that causes a smaller number of infections. This is just playing a numbers gain. I'd rather protect myself, and my family, by doing EVERYTHING that I can to reduce our risk of catching this virus."
2020-11-23 22:53,"It is quite obvious to me that the election accelerated the spread.  Hundreds of people lined up for early voting and waited inside interior spaces.  The peak was reached about 5 days after election, and has flattened, and now we are seeing it decline.  No doubt Thanksgiving will create a second peak, as every single holiday event has."
2020-11-23 22:56,Thanks for telling us three days before Thanksgiving - after Governor Lamont has basically canceled the holiday here in CT.
2020-11-23 22:58,"The story puts misplaced emphasis on the lack of contact tracing to supposedly ""small"" social gatherings.

Supposedly, this somehow proves that supposedly ""small"" social gatherings are not a problem.

Lost of problems with that analysis.

Contact tracing will never document any significant share
of transmission from small social gatherings
simply because there are literally millions of small social gatherings every day.

Most people do not even remember all the small gatherings they participated in.
Many more might remember but are less than fully forthcoming about reporting contacts.
Even when people do remember are willing to co-operate,
tracing contacts at millions of events and adding them all up is a lot more work, and takes a lot more at least minimally trained people to do it,
as compared with high profile large gatherings.

Sure, large gatherings are a problem.
But so are small ones.

Of course, large gatherings attract more attention,
and make for more media readership and viewership,
and are far easer targets for criticism.

But the media really do need to constantly remind ordinary folk that the ordinary folk need to be careful -- all the time."
2020-11-23 23:00,"What is the difference between people getting together for ""dinners"" and people getting together ""too closely in kitchens and living rooms""? This distinction is meaningless.

The problem lies when people from different households meet and talk indoors without masks. Whether informally in living rooms, for dinner, for lunch in a restaurant, the data is clear: do not meet people outside your household indoors without masks and, if you have to, make sure that the density is low and people from different households maintain some distance from one another."
2020-11-23 23:00,Trump had his hand in this confusion about sources when he started his no lockdowns ever again and liberate Tweets.  That has to be recognized.
2020-11-23 23:02,"I think this article highlights the limits of both the ""data"" that everyone keeps quoting, and the problem equating logic with proof.  Reading through it a few times highlights the one thing no one wants to hear -- the data is limited, and there is uncertainty on the specifics of transmission, and whether the spike is due to gatherings inside or outside.   Public health officials, from my read, don't have accurate tracing, and no one ""knows"" the absolute truth here.

With that, I think people are confusing logic and proof.  It's logical to say we should avoid each other to minimize the possibility of transmission, and that is supported by data.  It's logical to say that this decreases the odds of infection, which is also supported by data.  It is not logical, however, to say outdoor transmission is causing this v. indoor, at churches/synagogues v. bars, right now, because we don't have the data.  It's also not logical to disregard the data we do have and, for example, close the schools, if they are the lowest form of transmission based on data in a jurisdiction.

This article highlights the contradictory (and probably unhelpful) approaches taken by various commentators/government officials, and the confusion when we equate logic with proof.  The fact that people are upset with this article, to me, highlights our collective need to be certain here."

2020-11-23 23:04,Thank you for reporting on a Covid narrative that is data based. Americans are trolling Covid doom every day and it's affecting our mental well being as well as peoples jobs and businesses. I take Covid very seriously and believe that Trump's incompetence has led to the economic and public health disaster we are living through right now but the reporting on Covid is woefully lacking in context.
2020-11-23 22:24,"I’m all for political accountability. Really I am.

But that doesn’t mean our government should be run in such a way that I can read an executive order without being told who wrote it and tell you whether it was written by a Democratic or a Republican Governor. Governors of each party should be letting the epidemiologists take the lead in designing these executive orders. 

Political accountability then comes from listening to feedback from your state’s citizens as to how the orders are affecting them, not just taking cues from your base.

Both parties are getting this wrong. Don’t tell me false equivalence. Just do it the right way."
2020-11-23 23:05,"Remember early-on, when we learned of one NJ family that enjoyed a lively family dinner and ended up losing 4-5 family members?  So tragic. Someone from that family should share what happened. That anecdote should scare a lot of us much more than just another CDC warning."
2020-11-23 23:12,"The spread has a seasonal component to it. Temperatures have dropped, along with humidity in many of the areas facing outbreaks. As the temperature dropped people adjusted their behavior from mixed outdoor gatherings to indoor gatherings."
2020-11-23 23:13,"It’s interesting to see readers reject science when it runs counter to the conclusions they have already come to about what is or isn’t the case.  The media’s and government’s regular insistence on a particular set of facts framed to affirm a certain narrative has led to intransigent ossification of perception, leading to stasis in thinking.  Confirmation bias is found on all sides."
2020-11-23 23:04,"I am sorry but the point is how you get to those “so called” small gatherings.  Crowded airports, buses, trains where half of the people have no mask or masks that have not been recommended to wear. 

And if one person has Corona in a group, that is it.  I find you sending out misinformation; perhaps as a paid ad for the airlines?"
2020-11-23 22:37,Very confusing article. Started getting whip lash trying to get through it. My take away is we need coordinated National messaging and safety effort to minimize Covid 19’s impact on our lives.

2020-11-23 22:44,"Q says its a hoax and hoaxes spread very quickly, are highly contagious and don't really need any physical contact as the entire thing is virtual anyway. I wonder if Q thinks it spreads over the internet. Maybe we could ask Trumps crack lawyers, especially the Sidney one. Or the Rudy one."
2020-11-23 22:58,"There are three constant reasons for this surge: it has traceable to Trump’s rallies, it’s also due to the Midwest inconsistent mask mandate, and there are too many overweight/obese Americans. These three factors have been proven causes. Even if you only have one or two of these three factors, please get tested. You may be asymptotic. That’s one of the biggest concern about superspreader events. Just because you don’t experience symptoms does not mean you aren’t sharing your infection."
2020-11-23 22:36,"Ok, so people are not being honest about their exposure.  The retired lady who cleans my house got it.  So did her husband.  The retired lady who loves next door is ill now.  These people are not going to gyms or bars.  They are doing something though!"
2020-11-23 23:04,"This feels like such an irresponsible article. Anyone looking for an excuse to ignore COVID precautions will surely find it here. Yet the actual moral of this story is really: we don’t know. We don’t know what the risk is from small indoor gatherings. But we DO know that indoor gatherings are riskier than outdoors, and that people are far less likely to wear masks if they’re with family and close friends. We DO know that people aren’t straightforward with contact travers, and are more likely not to mention gathering indoors with family and friends. We DO know that the virus continues to spread rapidly. We DO know that only countries which enacted very strict measures—whether complete lockdowns as in NZ and Australia, or border shutdowns as in parts of Canada—have fully contained the virus. This article feels like it’s seeding uncertainty and thus giving those who want to ignore public health directives the green light. Shameful, especially on the eve of Thanksgiving, which everyone knows is going to lead to a new massive spike in infections and deaths."
2020-11-23 23:20,"I was exposed and got the virus. No one ever asked how I was exposed. I suspect most states do not contact trace, either. So, where does the data come from?"
2020-11-23 23:21,"I get the point that there isn’t data that points to small gatherings in homes as causal for this surge. However, it does seem prudent to avoid small gatherings in homes. Doesn’t it? Just because we don’t have data to pinpoint a source doesn’t mean that in-home gatherings are safe, when community spread is what is happening. And that community spread happens in small gatherings in homes also, right?￼"
2020-11-23 22:34,"Funny, I haven't read an article or seen anyone on TV mention the Trump maskless rallies (indoors or out), and the motorcycle rallies in the Dakotas in the fall as possible causes for the second wave."
2020-11-23 22:52,"If there is a point here other than we have lost the battle of contact tracing, I don’t know what it is.  Wear a mask, stay at home when you can."
2020-11-23 22:47,"Our governor in Vermont recently clarified that people can indeed meet for walks with others outside, properly masked. I don't understand the nitpicking of social distancing guidelines by the NYT. For one year can't we just wear masks and stay six feet apart. If this isn't possible don't gather...
simple."
2020-11-23 23:06,"Of course groups getting together and continued contact with strangers while traveling is going to cause spikes!  This article is a disservice to all the people trying to contain the virus by doing what's right and staying home.  Much like March and April when the CDC said masks were not necessary, anyone with a basic level of common sense knew limiting the amount of particles going in and out of your nose/mouth would make a considerable difference in transmission."
2020-11-23 23:24,"The virus is now spreading uncontrolled in every state (except Hawaii) and there is a much higher chance that a family member will bring it to Thanksgiving into a home for hours at a time with no one wearing masks and older high risk family members present.

Is it really that hard for people to figure this out?"
2020-11-23 23:03,"a family gathering of 8 people who have interacted carefully for a while seems ok

2020-11-23 22:27,"Is this an attempt at reporting on “both sides of the aisle”? Every article about small, family gatherings being a source of the spread has at least one denier (usually conservative/right-wing) saying something along the lines of “it only affects old people in nursing homes so there’s no reason to lock the rest of us up”. 

Actually, it doesn’t matter what is contributing to community spread. The truth is that we should all just continue to wear masks in all public and work situations and do whatever we can to reduce or stop having social gatherings (especially indoors) with anyone not in our immediate households for the next few weeks, at least."
2020-11-23 23:08,"I know this is purely anecdotal, but nearly all the people I know who have contracted covid have traced it to small gatherings - an outdoor birthday party of about 5, a card party, a small Halloween gathering, a neighborhood gathering. It goes on.

This article is all over the place: It's impossible at this point to know exactly where people got infected, but scientists say it isn't at small gatherings.  Uh?"
2020-11-23 22:35,"Irresponsible! Millions of households going to mix indoors during Thanksgiving and NYT message is no evidence this will be a major cause of spread.  Long hours indoors for hours or days with folks outside your house and then returning to school, work, pods, etc.  An untrackable ultra-super-spreader.  You only need to now the mode of transmission.  You can’t trace this like a Tyson plant.  All your article demonstrated was events that cause 100 or 1000 cases get noticed.  1,000,000 events that each spread 1 or 2 cases not readily quantified.

2020-11-23 19:32,"Granted that the data have uncertainties, and that there are a wide variety of requirements in different states, when the virus is this widespread throughout the country, any indoor gathering has an increasing probability of spreading the virus.  This is especially true if infected but asymptomatic people meet with uninfected others for, say, a Thanksgiving dinner full of eating, drinking, talking and laughing in an enclosed space for 2-3 hours or more.  

To suggest, even indirectly, that such gatherings are safe --or at least not proved unsafe by data -- is wrong and dangerous, especially as the holidays approach."
2020-11-23 19:16,"Our experience differs with your conclusion. I am an American living in Melbourne, Australia. We have recently emerged from a strict 112 day lockdown due in no small part to a second wave driven by family gatherings.  The state's contact tracing, genetic analysis all point to significant household spread, especially in immigrant communities where family densities tend to be higher than non-immigrant families. (Note it is the density and not the visa status which matters!). Melbourne reached a peak of 732 active cases a day in early August, and after the strict lockdown and gradual easing of rules, we are now at 24 days of zero cases and counting. The state's health authorities held back on allowing larger numbers of household visits based on its experience and modelling. I suggest you look up Department of Health and Human services (Victoria) for a real-life case study which may alter your views."
2020-11-23 19:44,"I work in a hospital and this is a dangerous opinion to put out right before people are chomping at the bit to get together for the holidays. Just because epidemiologists lack the data points they need to be certain that larger gatherings are the impetus for this third surge, does not mean it isn't true. Hospitals and health care workers are being impacted, some to extreme degrees, and it's only going to get worse in the winter months. That's all the data we need to know that people are NOT taking appropriate precautions. What is different now than in the summer? The weather is colder, people are gathering indoors, in private homes and in many states, public spaces, restaurants, etc. This headline alone= gives people who are planning to gather for Thanksgiving the excuse they need to buck the public health restrictions."
2020-11-23 20:08,"To echo the sentiment of several other comments: the absence of a proof is not the proof of an absence, yet this article clearly conflates the two. 

The real point that should be made--in stark contrast to the title, especially--is that we don't know how important small social gatherings are. 

Certainly, we know that the virus spreads especially well in conditions that are nearly universal in household get togethers. And we know that the same logic of ""this doesn't matter because we don't have evidence saying it does"" is exactly what was being published about mask wearing in March. Those two facts alone suggest the framing of this article may be (dangerously) off base."
2020-11-23 20:37,"While this article aims to be a voice of reason the chances that it will be taken as a free pass to get together for the holidays is far too high.   

We know indoor gatherings without masks are problematic. 
Full Stop."
2020-11-23 21:19,"As someone who has been traveling for work throughout this entire pandemic (while distancing, wearing a mask, handwashing, avoiding indoor events), I have observed a lot of our country.

I agree with this article.  However, it omits this part:

I would estimate that a quarter of our citizens are ignoring virus precautions entirely.  ENTIRELY.  A lot of people feel the restrictions, loss of jobs, and business closures are greater than the threat of illness.  Many feel visceral anger when leaders order that they must abandon their weddings, funerals, and religious events.

It is sometimes political, but often it’s just a different cost-benefit analysis coupled with an independent worldview and a high risk tolerance.

Largely educated, white collar, and urban, NYT readers are not representative of the country.  A good part of the country are ignoring precautions entirely."
2020-11-23 23:31,"Is the word “school” even in this article? It may be a hugely unpopular answer but the uncomfortable answer may be right under our noses. Let’s not blind ourselves just because we don’t want it to be true. While a lot of leaders say schools aren’t a big spreader they either don’t identify the study confirming this or it doesn’t say exactly what they say it does. And even if it’s not as ready a vector as some of the others the sheer numbers of children bringing it home, even in small percentiles, is going to drive huge numbers. 
Irresponsible reporting to not even mention one of the clear vectors. And yes, I personally know families infected from their school age children."
2020-11-23 23:34,"The first wave subsided when the schools closed. This second, much bigger wave started and then exploded only when schools re-opened again. 

It really isn't complicated. When school is in session, bus drivers, lunch ladies, teachers, custodians, etc., are in close and frequent contact with virus-ridden kids. Parents leave the house every day to drop the kids off at the bus stop or to drive them to school; the parents (like the hundreds of thousands of school employees) then may stop at a gas station or coffee shop on their way home. Truck drivers interact with school staff in order to stock the schools. And so on endlessly.

We know that people can carry and transmit the virus with no symptoms whatsoever. Massive levels of virus transmission could be happening as a result of the schools being open--not just because of what happens within the school buildings but because of all the thousands upon thousands of activities associated with running a school system. Close the schools, and millions of people of all ages, child and adult, would mostly stay home--and we would then see the virus levels drop again.

The right answer is almost always the most obvious one. The daily mass movement of people that picked up again when the schools reopened in September is the most obvious one--however much the nation's harried parents and politicians worried about the economy (and thus reelection) might not want to believe it."
2020-11-23 23:37,"Frankly I trust the word of Mark Levine from the Vermont Department of Health, that the data in VT does not support spread in restaurants, but does support spread via small social events, more than I trust some far away expert who may or may not have examined VT's data. While there have been recent flare-ups VT continues to have low rates compared to the rest of the nation: I don't know that it makes sense to talk about broad community spread in our context."
2020-11-23 23:38,"Just because researchers don't yet have completely detailed data on behaviors linked with COVID cases--such data will take more time--doesn't mean that we should be skeptical of reasonably sensible advice.

The virus *is* spreading like wildfire!  The scientists will figure out exactly what ignited what later when all the data has been wrought.  For now, let's breathe the same air as our housemates,but AVOID BREATHING THE SAME AIR AS NON-HOUSEMATES!  And don't strike matches carelessly in the forest."
2020-11-23 23:39,"I find many of the facts presented in this article suspect. Although perhaps (just perhaps) technically factual, one specific statement is decidedly misleading. The article states
that churches in Minnesota are permitted 250 worshipers. As a trustee at my church we understand the rule to be 25 percent of capacity. In our sanctuary that limit is 50. since the beginning of November we are once again worshipping strictly virtually."
2020-11-23 23:42,"This is among the most depressing comment sections I've yet seen on the Times' website. The article is irresponsible, says everyone, it should be pulled, say many, it will 'literally' kill people, say a few. The views expressed in the reporting are views held by a substantial portion of even 'right-thinking' people-- it is news, and this is a newspaper. Some scientists et al, those we've been told to listen all along, are gently trying to tell us something, but if the commenters here are any indication we are too lost in fear and groupthink to hear them."
2020-11-23 23:51,"About 1% of the total population of North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Iowa  and most counties in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois for example, have tested positive in just the last seven days.  A gathering of 10 people has a good chance of having an  asymptomatic untested person in attendance since actual infection rates far exceed test rates.

So in places where the virus is running rampant, an indoor gathering is Russian roulette.  You feeling lucky?"
2020-11-23 23:52,"If someone is infected with Covid-19 and attends an unmasked indoor gathering, others will likely be infected. To me, that means they are contributing to the spread. I don't really care if other situations contribute more or less to the spread. Everyone needs to do what they can to slow the spread."
2020-11-23 23:48,"The reality is this article cites experts we have been told to put our faith in. These experts are simply making the argument that the general public has a right to sound data and decision making. And without our government giving people financial help, just shutting things down again is fundamentally wrong and disrespectful to those-mostly BIPOC/low income citizens-having to depend on a system that isn't giving them jack for unemployment (think cost of living in California) and may even try to take that money back from them (as NPR has talked about happening in some states).

Frankly, the politics of this on both sides by ""leaders"" and their followers is sickening. No mentions of capacity building, no mention of mass breakouts in spaces usually filled with the most disenfranchised in our country, no discussion about the poor state of our health care system. We are always talking about being the greatest in the world; yet, our main talking point is the fear our health care systems will collapse...Dr. Fauci said this isn't the plague...God help us as a nation if such a virus like that or biowarfare actually happens because we have allowed leaders on both sides to not do the basic things needed to avoid such mass calamity. 

Wear a mask and stay home if you can but be mindful not to descend into the same negativity and curses-filled rhetoric as those you claim aren't taking this seriously. And also remember there are people literally facing financial ruin from these shutdowns."
2020-11-24 0:00,"This is classic click-bait for an anxious and tired populous.  It's dangerous to be sharing this notion during the week of Thanksgiving when we are all wishing to be indoors with family.  We have literally been asked to stay home to prevent the spread of the virus. Why open the door for people to disregard the recommendation?
If the virus spreads through aerosols and droplets and we have community spread, it is inevitable that gathering with people outside one's household increases the likelihood of transmission. Many health officials cannot keep up with contact tracing and admit to ""widespread community transmission,"" does it not stand to reason that this widespread transmission is happening EVERYWHERE including in homes?"
2020-11-23 23:49,"How much are small gatherings contributing to a virus surge? In the absence of good contact tracing, we just don’t know. That seems to be what the experts quoted in this article are saying. There is no solid evidence that small gatherings are a major driver of the surge. And there is also no solid evidence that they are not.

The original title of this article was “Small Social Gatherings Aren’t Driving the Virus Surge (So Far)”. That was an irresponsible misrepresentation of the current state of knowledge (or lack there of), and I’m glad the New York Times changed it.

But I am still left concerned that the article may mislead some people into believing it is safe to invite the whole family over for Thanksgiving.

I for one will not take that risk. We will be making turkey and stuffing and cranberries and sweet potatoes and brussell sprouts for just the two of us this year."

I think journalists have a major responsibility not to contribute to the confusing plethora of opinions regarding effective Covid-19 public health guidelines, especially immediately preceding a holiday.  It seems important for NYT not to deliberately muddle an urgent CDC health advisory.

It seems possible to argue that we need more effective guidelines for restaurants/bars/gyms/weddings/prisons/nursing homes, without going on to undermine CDC guidelines for safe gatherings for families just before the Thanksgiving holiday.

Family gatherings for Thanksgiving bring multi-generational groups together, often folks traveling from all across the country, often including young people coming home from college, all sitting around a table indoors, in a home typically with poor ventilation, for a long period of time, all eating together (and therefore all maskless).  I think scientists ALL would agree that those are the characteristics of super-spreader events.

To be seeming to suggest otherwise seems VERY irresponsible."
2020-11-24 0:14,"My county authorities have focused their efforts on shutting down social gatherings and shaming people for masked outdoor socializing - while the article shows that institutional and congregate care facilities, as well as public accommodations, are responsible for the vast majority of spread in my state of Colorado. This is maddening- the places that are actually spreading the virus are also the most regulated locations most susceptible to tailored rulemaking. Yet political leadership and public health authorities put most of their energy into scolding people for their personal choices."

Often those people are in positions of power and influence.

Further we live in an utterly narcissistic society. Rather than forego a restaurant meal or haircut or parent their kids as they learn online, they just want it now. 

So we have the mealy-mouthed, half measure approach, reflecting a completely dysfunctional government structure unsuited to this situation, aided by an equally balkanized academic scene where everyone is out for their own careers.

It disheartens me to hear people like Marcus quoted over again about how “realistic” we need to be, when it isn’t about that at all. It’s about moral cohesion, or lack thereof. Little brings us together as a society.

So we have the worst pandemic situation on the planet."

2020-11-24 0:16,"This article tracks well with something I’ve been noticing for awhile - that actual social distancing practices are not correlated with virus surges. If you check out the U Washington website, they track how far and how often people venture out from their homes based on cell phone data. This has remained fairly consistent between June and now, following a big reduction in the spring. There has been no decrease in social distancing in the past month that accounts for the surge. There have also been no noted decreases in response to weather events that made socializing outdoors difficult (like the fires in California) which hypothetically drove private gatherings indoors. Cooler weather also doesn’t account for the surge in Southern California - it was in the 80s til last week. The question then is what IS driving the surge - but the data suggests that private gatherings are not it."
2020-11-24 0:00,"Just because your government says it’s okay doesn’t mean you should do it. I am allowed to drive 60 miles an hour in a snowstorm but I don’t because it’s too dangerous. By now anyone who has been paying attention should know that it’s NOT OKAY to dine indoors at a restaurant with 10 friends. Bars? Are you kidding me? It’s time for us to take responsibility for our own well-being and go farther, much farther, than the politicians say is safe. They’ve done a lousy job so far."

Meanwhile, I take the low risk road and avoid those ""common sense"" vectors. When scientific proof comes in that they are safe or not significant vectors, I'll participate in them again. I'd rather wait for the data, and for the vaccine."
2020-11-24 0:17,"“It really feels like there’s just little fires all over the place,” said Dr. K.J. Seung, chief of strategy and policy for Covid-19 response in Massachusetts.

The virus is mindless and will ‘do’ what it can wherever it is. It’s mostly airborne and a decent inoculum is needed to infect the next person. Peak infectivity occurs a day or so before and after symptom onset, and 40% have been estimated to be asymptomatic throughout their infections. 

It's likely that what was known about transmission earlier in the pandemic may change as the population changes its behavior around 're-openings,' the holidays, and seasonality. Also, past behaviors in many communities where viral prevalence was low have probably given some a false sense of security even as cases explode. 

Absent a cure or substantial numbers vaccinated, the same preventive measures still apply. These include social distancing, scrupulous mask wearing in public, and contact tracing with appropriate isolation or quarantining. Hopefully we've learned about improving ventilation and PPE for workers outside hospitals, although investments lag. 

Germany and the formerly Great Britain have also used viral genetic fingerprinting to reduce uncertainty around chains of transmission. This allowed them to quickly and reliably identify infection sources. It could do the same for our public health experts, allowing them to put out fires nearly as soon as they see smoke."
2020-11-24 0:21,"""Household get-togethers undoubtedly do contribute to community transmission of the virus.""

Isn't that all we need to know? Why does it matter that nursing homes contribute more?

And why can't we embrace reasonable recommendations before they are scientifically proven? Why can't we not simply stay on the safe side till the scientists have figured out what is true? I did not need them to prove that trans fats were wrong; I just stopped consuming them. I did not need them to prove that vaping was bad; I just did not do it. And I don't need to sacrifice any more people before I believe that schools can spread the virus, or that multi-household Thanksgiving gatherings can cause death."

At the same time these grocery stores won’t force customers or even employees to wear masks because that’s “hard”. Limiting hours and thus labor costs; that’s easy and good for profit.

For the record, I am a mask wearer, a constant hand washer, user of hand sanitizer. My family will not be gathering this Thanksgiving but not because they fear the virus but because they are worried about getting caught up in the restrictions and being forced to quarantine from jobs that cannot be done remotely."
2020-11-24 0:45,"The reason for small gatherings not being huge vectors in transmission might be because of the vast majority of people  holding off so far. Thanksgiving is about all Americans gathering.
Off course, what could go wrong?"
2020-11-24 0:46,"Here it may be helpful to imagine new cases as proportional to the number of pairwise contacts between people, a quantity we can compute under the assumption each attendee has contact with everyone else who’s present. We might expect an assembly of 200 to generate the same number of cases as 20 gatherings of 10 persons each, but that’s not so if they’re mixing round-robin. For the 20 gatherings,

20 x (10 x 9/2) = 900

pairwise contacts occur. For the event with 200 present, this number becomes

200 x 199/2 = 19,900

Now it seems the large event is much more dangerous, especially if aerosol “superspreading” at high attack rates by lone carriers is a frequent hazard. Yet the problem’s hardly trivial. Think of a stadium where spectators remain in their own seats throughout. A given person is no longer exposed to everyone else; just to a few in the nearby seats. 200 people in the stadium might be safer than at 20 dinners of 10. Other things such as duration matter; an all-day meeting risks more than 10 minutes.

I don’t wish to substitute my opinion for that of experts. Epidemiology in specific venues has helped us learn which places are liable to major outbreaks that spill over to the community. But I see a lot of rationalization and blame games in connection. Public choice around Covid will never be an easy matter, and staying home without visitors is always the best option if possible."
2020-11-24 0:48,"When I look at my state's Dept. of Health COVID dashboard, by far the largest source of exposure is ""community: unknown"".

It might be irrelevant what is ""the preponderance of the source of spread"" or the ""engine driving"" it.  If the virus is transmitted mostly in nursing homes or meatpacking plants, but a public message is not going to make much difference what happens there, then the message should be tailored to what can be controlled and where it can make a difference at the margins.

If I can make myself and my family safer by not meeting with them, then I would like to know that, and it is irrelevant if meatpacking plants have a larger impact on the spread than such gatherings do.  Of course, a targeted message should be sent to meatpacking plants too, if there is advice that they should hear."

Just because other places have so many contacts you can't tell where it's coming from DOESN'T mean that it ISN'T happening in small gatherings as claimed.

One of those sources is private gatherings with family and friends both indoors and outdoors (people that are not masking outside and within 6 feet). While the Governor restricted indoor and outdoor gatherings, it’s may be due in part that very few Minnesotans are going to get together outdoors for Thanksgiving for any extended period of time before getting too cold and going inside. Of course I’m biased but I’m proud of the decisions our Governor has made as he’s been transparent and focused on what the data has suggested through contact tracing and relying on his public health experts."

Our Federal research capability has been trying to stay out of trouble with our President, and is in no position to take decisive leadership.  

Local and state decisions are influenced by pressure by businesses that have been recently given no other way to survive other than continuing to stay open.  This assures that we will have mainly a market-driven response to the pandemic, and a pandemic is one of the situations that is least likely to be handled well by the market.  This is because the pandemic opens too many ways to make a fortune by spreading false or misleading information, hoarding, or peddling quack cures.

Minnesota's Senate Republicans want Walz to end the state of emergency so the they can vote on public health measures. That may sound good - but Republicans don't want any public health measures. They want a free-for-all like in our neighbor South Dakota - a disaster that speaks for itself. 

To express their displeasure, the Senate Republicans have denied confirmation of two of Walz's state commissioners. Not because they were bad nominees but because confirmations are one of the few tools Republicans have to retaliate against the governor's public health orders. 

Walz has additional nominees awaiting confirmation. I guarantee you if Walz had shut down churches Senate Republicans would metaphorically shoot another one of the commissioners they have held hostage. They probably will anyway."

The point that is entirely too buried in this piece is that all activities that involve proximity to other peoples’ respiratory droplets become riskier as community spread increases. The author doesn’t seem to have done her homework on campus spread - almost all of it has been traced to social gatherings, so separating “college” cases from cases related to social gatherings seems fairly misleading. This is again evident with the suggestion of cities paying for “domes,” which are not proven to be any safer than being indoors. As an exhausted ICU nurse scared for those who are most vulnerable in my community, I’m very sad to see any message to the public to not worry about their individual role in spreading covid when maximum public participation in stopping the current surge is desperately needed."

My social contacts will now happen during walks in the park. However, I have college aged kids living at home and as much as they try to be responsible they do go out and interact with their peers. I cannot blame them and they do their best to be responsible, such as getting tested frequently, using their own bathroom, but still. It’s a risk and who knows what is going to happen.

2020-11-24 2:21,"It's pretty irresponsible to muddy the waters just as people are deciding to whether to cancel their risky Thanksgiving gatherings. One thing is clear in California: Surges were tied to Memorial Day, July 4, Labor Day and Halloween and contact tracers noted a number of extra cases tied to social gatherings. I don't know why we'd expect Thanksgiving to be any different. And the data here is really weak --  transmission tied to restaurants, bars, casinos and bowling alleys, for instance, could be between people who are gathering there, not just strangers. It's pretty irresponsible to take this angle without stronger data to back it up."
2020-11-24 2:22,"Is this helping? Some of those examples were ridiculous, like walking outside. But I think it is irresponsible to discourage self responsibility and limiting gatherings--small or large--indoors."
2020-11-24 2:25,"The virus loves to concentrate and spread in any space that is poorly ventilated with people breathing, talking, singing, shouting, etc. such as restaurants, bars, churches, gyms, barber shops and homes. So if one family member picks up the virus in a public space he/she will bring it home and infect his/her housemates and visitors even though these people may have otherwise protected themselves outside of the home. No different from assisted living super spreader environments where outsiders bring the virus to the residents. If you understand the virus then you understand that you must assume that all of your contacts are potential spreaders in all locations that are poorly ventilated, and that physical distancing and mask wearing will reduce but not eliminate the risk."
2020-11-24 2:32,"I am relieved to read that the scare tactics about holiday gatherings is really just politicians trying to cover their incompetence and a general lack of data.  I assume, based on this article, that having  a small gathering with the kids and grand kids (7 people total) it is a very reasonable decision.  My problem is, if by some chance I get Covd19, will my righteous indignation do any good?  I am 82 and have a chronic lung condition.  I doubt that I would have lasted this long if I trusted this article made any sense."
2020-11-24 2:33,"I think this article didn’t help at all, given there is evidence of transmission from family events. Equally the manner of transmission suggests it would be easily spread by close personal contact.
We did the hard yards with over 100 days of lockdown and no visitors or events here in Melbourne Australia. 
We now have not one active case in a state of over 5 million people now for 23 days.  We acted when it got to 800 deaths. Not 8000. We are taking off masks and reopening and holding  family events because we did it tough for a few months. And the evidence shows it worked. That is incontrovertible. We don’t understand the divided, partisan nonsense going on over covid19 in your country."
2020-11-24 2:34,"Aerosols and droplets spread the virus.  Knowing that: a) how much more obvious could it be that 25 people at a bar or restaurant present more opportunity for spreading the virus than 4 people sitting in their backyard; b) Equally obvious, 12 people sitting around at a Thanksgiving dinner is not a good idea; and c) as Covid shows up in more places the likelihood of infection in small indoor gatherings increases so avoid them too.

Close bars, close restaurants, close houses of worship etc. This is only temporary and we will all survive.  Business that are forced to close for the benefit of all, must be compensated."
2020-11-24 2:39,"I believe we should listen to science, But I do not think CDC holiday recommendations are based in science.  There are university studies showing being in a restaurant is more dangerous than flying, staying in a hotel or shopping in a supermarket.  I think CDC's recommendations aimed at stopping people from seeing family over Thanksgiving is likely to cause more death from suicide and heartbreak than COVID.  And the recommendations are unlikely to stop the spread of COVID in the community.  I would say to those at CDC who say not seeing family at Thanksgiving is an effective COVID containment protocol - SHOW US THE PROOF!"
2020-11-24 2:40,"This is a very confusing article. The virus is airborne and easily spread. What is so hard to comprehend about that? Anyone who hosts people in their homes is inviting Coronavirus in. I miss family dinners and evenings inside with friends, but none of those are happening in my world right now.  I fear this article will encourage people to take unwise risks."
2020-11-24 2:42,"""Most states don’t collect or report detailed information about the exposure that led to a new infection.""

Naw, we wouldn't want to do that."
2020-11-24 2:54,"“A pandemic is more a failure of the system than the failure of individual choices.”  YES!  and we voted them out.  

However, there is not enough time to rely on the system to stem the infection.  All we have left is individual choices, which can make a huge difference.  So why demean the effort to convince individuals of their role in contagion?  I find that an unfortunate slant in your article.  This is not an Abrahamic sacrifice, it's one holiday in a lifetime."
2020-11-24 3:06,"Interesting how we humans struggle to comprehend complex systems. Biology (epidemics included) doesn't follow laws like physics. There's no clear cause followed by effect. No post hoc ergo propter hoc. Epidemiology cannot be reduced through reductionism to simple principles. It defies them. 

We see that from the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic. Even now we don't know where that epidemic started and how it spread, or why it faded after three waves and disappeared. And that's after 100 years of study. 

How then can scientists, and politicians relying on them, ever hope to understand what is happening now when we are caught in pandemic panic?"
2020-11-24 3:31,One word:  Sturgis. I’m sure studies about COVID years from now will attribute a large portion of this current surge to the hundreds of thousands of attendees and the millions they were collectively in contact with throughout the US after it was over.
2020-11-24 3:47,"It sounds like we no longer know where infection is occuring, because it is too prevalent to trace. 

A city or state that prohibits friends meeting up without prohibiting indoor dining is absurd, as is one that prohibits small groups but not large weddings. But at some point, it comes down to what you can control.

You cannot close long-term care facilities, food processing plants, prisons (although I hope the number of inmates has been lowered as much as possible across the country) or health care settings. You list these as the top four causes of spread. My city has already closed the fifth, by prohibiting indoor dining at restaurants and bars. And our numbers still rise. So what then?

Making care facilities, plants and prisons as safe as possible should be every government's first priority. But people with no connection to these places keep getting sick."
2020-11-24 3:50,"The general thrust of this article is highly misleading, and its conclusion is, I think, wrong. The reason that so many governors and public health secretaries are pointing to private gatherings as a major source of virus spread is because that's what the evidence from contact tracing is showing them. But it's much more difficult to aggregate this sort of data since it's not associated with one particular institution. The note about Colorado having 3,300 cases ""from colleges and universities,"" for example, fails to appreciate that those cases likely came from small social gatherings of people *associated* with those institutions. (This is what the contact tracing at universities has shown: that spread happens through congregate living environments and small gatherings, and *not* through classrooms.) That number gets aggregated and associated with an institution, because those individuals are associated with the institution, but what doesn't get aggregated are the thousands of other cases that aren't associated with an institution: these are the small gatherings that are driving the spread under the radar.

My hunch is that we have been very, very wrong in focusing on the *size* of gatherings as the key factor in terms of virus spread, when in fact it's the *conditions* of a gathering that matter. After all, virus transmission can happen between a meeting of only *two* people -- now, multiply these contacts times thousands and millions, and you can see how the virus spreads..."
2020-11-24 3:52,"Since we don't know exactly how the virus is spreading, let me propose:
(1) Sick People.
When almost all workplaces are shut down, almost everyone stays home.  When workplaces are open, people go to work, even when they are not feeling well.  For many hourly workers, if they do not work, they do not get paid.
(2) Schools.
It's pretty obvious that opening many universities was a colossal failure.  I doubt that it is safe to open high schools as well.  Small kids may be OK, but we don't really know that for sure.  The timing of the surge in cases has to raise some suspicions about schools.
(3) Risky Business.
I'm pretty sure college football is a bad idea.  Any activity where more than 100 people meet every day (frequently without masks) is a bad idea.  It is difficult to believe that the well-documented football COVID cases haven't spread to the broader community."
2020-11-24 3:53,"I am over it. We are all over it. But we are clearly not out of it.

Though it seems impossible, I’ve been shocked by the number of friends who explain their backbending twisting gymnastic logic to how they will “safely” travel and “safely” spend 4  Thanksgiving days with family and friends. 

I wish you the best of luck but feel better about being able to ID my contacts on one hand and the fortitude to wait out a frustrating but ultimately short-term barrier to family and friend get-togethers. 

The life I was enjoying 8 months or a year ago is not more important than the life of the one parent and one in-law I have left."
2020-11-24 2:11,"Restaurants, stores, gyms and bars stay open and lives are lost. Subsidize them till opening is safe, It isn't safe now and wasn't ever safe but Trump forced businesses to open and people to die. 
Now we can do the sane thing, not the insane thing. Subsidize the businesses that need it and take care of people's health."
2020-11-24 2:54,The one challenge to this theory is the number of elderly who have developed COVID and died even from limited social gatherings
2020-11-24 3:46,"This article does nothing to contribute to reducing the COVID fires raging in this country. The reporter sound a bit like Trump with mixed messages about what is spreading the virus and what isn't. Use common sense -  we've got a light at the end of the tunnel with a vaccine. Why encourage people to get together when you don't really know the risks? It's not just about the gathering, it's also about the travel to get there (airports, buses). Have patience everyone! Stay home, use video conferencing, and be thankful for what you have, not what is missing."
2020-11-24 3:13,"Schools are petri dishes of unreported, untraceable super-spreaders;  however, it is not in the country’s economic interest,nor many parents’ personal interests, to speak honestly to that point."
2020-11-24 3:30,"Huh. My takeaway from this is that we celebrated my mother’s 80th birthday remotely  (with no small amount of heartache) needlessly, and that traveling and getting together with friends and family is not going to transmit covid. We just need to steer clear of jails, factories and nursing homes. Thanks for the tips, cant wait to celebrate the holidays in person and re-learn how to socialize."
2020-11-24 2:47,"this article seems to be gaslighting a bit. The bottom line seems to be that because there essentially are no serious restrictions everywhere, people's movements are all over the place and one can't trace a particular exposure to the illness. ok, so....does this mean go ahead and go to an indoor Thanksgiving? NO. No. To me it doesn't change anything. It reminds me of those mask articles being like, well, since we don't actually have evidence this could help...but we think it could based on, oh, common sense and other viruses, well...it might do more harm than good. That just created a lot of confusion, as does an article like this."

2020-11-24 2:47,"What exactly constitutes a small social gathering? And how many of those small social gatherings happening at the same time in the same high density areas (perhaps Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah and New Year celebrations in a city like NY) will be enough to cause a huge rise in Covid-19 cases? 

I find it incredibly irresponsible to publish an article like this at this time of year when the medical profession, Fauci and the CDC, are all telling us to just stay home."
2020-11-24 2:20,Governor Phil Scott of Vermont has clarified that taking a masked and distanced walk outdoors is permissible and safe.
2020-11-24 2:37,Why isn’t the Times reporting what the states say is the logic of the restrictions? The leaders need to be held accountable for demonstrating logical decision making.
2020-11-24 2:08,"I love how so many commentators here suggest that even discussing this issue is wrong and dangerous.   The article might be wrong, and people might listen to it, and then people might get infected, and those people might get sick, and that is dangerous! 

Of course all those thing might be true.  Or they might not.  After 8 months of this I just cannot believe that many would still have us not question or discuss any of our responses to this pandemic."
2020-11-24 4:00,"This very newspaper had an article about the NY police shutting down a sex club where 80 people were partying without masks this past Saturday, and many of them were having sex in communal rooms with multiple beds!

My carefully distanced, outdoor Thanksgiving with two other couples is not going to be a super-spreader event.  There is a spectrum of risky activities, but that is not one of them."
2020-11-24 4:00,"It’s pretty clear that the “experts” don’t really know much so, I would say, why don’t we all just default to common sense?  If you are in a high risk category and are scared, stay home and wear your mask, if you aren’t, then get on with your life. Our response to this flu has been destructive beyond imagination, time for some common sense."
2020-11-24 4:18,"Living in Australia experience has shown when the case level gets too high you cannot effectively do contact tracing.  Without effective contact tracing and testing the virus runs out of control. After testing you need to quarantine until you get your results,any symptoms require testing, financial support is needed to ensure that people quarantine and get tested. Mask up reduce widespread travel and large gatherings.  I hope I’m wrong but you have left it too late unless you seriously do the above country wide. Good luck"
2020-11-24 2:29,"One omission here is the reality that people lie to contact tracers and authorities generally when they feel they’ve done something irresponsible or socially unacceptable. It’s easier to admit you went to the grocery store and a restaurant than your best friend’s 10 person bbq. We should be careful not to assume anything people tell a contact tracer is the absolute truth and full story. The LA times is running stories counter to this article. Now that Los Angeles has closed both indoor and outdoor dining, experts there are saying that people will now go into their own homes, leading to worse outcomes overall because homes are the biggest source of transmission, not restaurants. Bottom line- we know the disease spreads in close and not so close contact. Best thing is to  be rational and reasonable. Meet up for a masked walk with a friend, don’t have a 15 person birthday. Support local restaurants via takeout or dine outdoors with one or two others, not your entire extended family."
2020-11-24 3:59,"@Christie from New Haven made many valuable points and I think it is a shame he was not given a Times Pick but I do understand it.

Considering the possible bad outcomes of holiday visits, is it really too much to toe the line for this one season with all its dangerous possibilities? Is it too much for teams that feed the economic engines of the nation, like the Times, to broadly just go with great safety this one time?

Families, please make the sacrifice, Zoom your relatives this year and maybe, just maybe, you will have done the thing to help them see next year. If you don't know how to Zoom, now may be a good time to learn.

Wishing a safe & Happy Thanksgiving, Xmas (other religious and symbolic days) and New Year to all."

2020-11-24 4:39,"When you put politicians in charge you get decisions based on politics instead of science.  

The political reality is that people who die of  the virus aren’t going to vote in the next election, but people who lose their jobs will. 

The political reality is that educators get paid (and continue to work) if schools are closed, but resturant staff does not. 

The political reality is that we rather have sickness at meat packaging plants than a lack of meat on the shelves.

If all the politicians took a six week vacation and left the scientists in charge, the pandemic would be over in two months."

2020-11-24 4:45,"Who is going to police the number of people that can gather in a private home?  

A mask mandate plays well politically.  Who is going to police it?

I live in central Texas.  Most public spaces, i.e. grocery stores, Walmart, Home Depot, etc. require masks.  Many times people enter these stores with a mask on; then take it off or at least pull it down below their nose once inside the store.  I have yet to encounter a store clerk willing to confront a 6'6"" bruiser to comply with the mask requirement or leave the store.

Those who would turn the U.S. into a police state may rue the day with the police come for them on future threats, real or imagined."
2020-11-24 4:50,"Here in Wisconsin, our government has simply abandoned us. I've described it so many times as the Wild West. The government (or more accurately, the legislature which has spent more time suing Governor Evers over his orders than actually coming up with a strategic plan) is not supporting businesses, essential workers, and working families. So we have a patchwork of businesses that have closed or limited operations to prevent the spread for no other reason but that it's the right thing to do. There is no incentive to close (in the form of government relief). So this article really hit at something I've been feeling as my partner and I self-isolate: no matter what we personally do, we cannot stop this spread. 
But yet the problem remains that our Legislature is not working. And we won't have a plan or relief. So we SHOULD discourage gatherings for the time being. This article says that the data doesn't support that small gatherings spread the virus at higher rates. It also says that if people gather, they may or may not have gotten it from that gathering. The possibility of exposing my family members because I ""didn't know I had it"" has been enough for me to alter my Holiday plans, and I hope others do too."
2020-11-24 5:21,"The point of the article is the inconsistencies of public health guidance. Small gatherings might be bad. We don’t know. But we do know that large gatherings are bad, yet as long as those gatherings are tied to businesses, our governments are allowing them. The onus is always placed on the individual in our country, whether the issue is the pandemic, racism, inequality, even climate change. We are told to change our lightbulbs and buy hybrids but we don’t regulate trucks or big businesses at all. We treat every racist cop as a bad apple rather than address the systemic problem of racism in law enforcement over all. Etc, etc. No thinking person reads this article as a hall pass to get together with friends and family indoors. But everyone who has been paying attention has been frustrated by the illogical application of shame and blame, and how often it has been directed toward individuals rather than institutions and systems."

2020-11-24 5:37,"In NJ, less than 50% of the people contacted by the tracers provide any useful info on how they might have got infected or wit whom they'd been in contact within the critical timeframe. And if they say anything it more likely ill be about a store or work then about their friends and family members. Family gatherings are absolutely critical  for the disease spread; moreover, they are the principal way the old people (not those in LTC but living alone) who are the most vulnerable among us, get infected. Those folks don't go to the restaurants or gyms..."
2020-11-24 4:31,"Contact tracing may not be able to make a firm cause and effect between small gatherings and the surge, but when they talk about community spread, they are talking about the millions of folks who refuse to mask and refuse to understand asymptomatic spread.  I agree with other commenters that this article is misleading and may be misused to support gathering with others who are outside your bubble, who feel fine, but are infected and spreading COVID like Typhoid Mary."
2020-11-24 5:49,"Given the fact that we've the worst Covid19 outbreak in the world with current uncontrolled exponential growth, I'd say gathering, period is the problem. Inside, outside, upside down. We've got to mask, distance and stay home for awhile or keep doing this morbid dance for months to come."
2020-11-24 5:50,"I’m surprised that no one has linked the surge in coronavirus cases to the election. For days long lines of people stood near one another for hours in order to cast their vote. You’ve got to wonder if it has hit Republicans especially hard,  since they were far more likely to go to the polls in person. We might never know the political breakdown of the afflicted, but it makes sense that those who eschewed masks, gathered by the thousands at rallies, and ignored CDC guidelines would be at greater risk to catch and spread this deadly disease."
2020-11-24 6:04,"It sounds like a majority of cases have unknown origins. We do know that the virus spreads easily in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation, particularly if people aren't wearing masks. This article falsely gives the impression that gathering indoors in small groups is safe when it isn't."
2020-11-24 5:26,How do we know that the number of people attending larger gatherings isn’t much higher than admitted? You are asking people to admit something taboo.  I would be reluctant to rely on self reporting.
2020-11-24 4:56,"I appreciate trying to find where the virus is coming from, but we lost control of contact tracing thousands of cases ago.  While Australia can narrow spread to a single elevator button, the U.S. can begin to figure out what community it might have come from.  The options for spread are too many and too many cases.  Mathematically it's just too big a number to track.  I watch my neighbors, many wear masks that are so below par as to be mostly useless.  They don't use the provided wipes.  They pickup everything and then put it down to infect the next shopper.

In addition to Trump supporters, I have a number of neighbors and family members who are using the God response.  They believe the Pandemic is God's will.  God will protect them if the pray.  If they get sick or die, it's God's will.  They have put it in God's hands so they don't have to wash theirs.  

They are also more likely to be Trump supporters for the same reason.  But Biden isn't God's will, at least not yet.  We will see where they end up in January.
They will wear masks if the Government requires it.  But it has to be an order under law, a ""to Caesar that which is Caesers and to God that which is God's"" principle.  So, the Governor's orders work for this population.  

All those who claim grown ups can be trusted to do the right thing haven't been paying attention.  Orders that are clear and based on the best science we have work."

2020-11-24 4:48,"The math of a pandemic has been largely unknown or forgotten.  A pandemic accelerates by a geometric progression,,, NOT and arithmetic progression.  One person infects 2,, 2 infect 4 infect 8, infect 16, 32,62, 124, etc., etc.

When the Covid-19 began in February and March, the hands off, no prevention,, the doubling time was just 3 days.  Every 3rd day the number of infected was doubled.  Then we began prevention, March 28th,, the doubling time stretched to 7 days, then 19 days, then 40 days,, We did a better and better job and the last full doubling require 11 weeks,  We have been doing very well,,, but the total numbers are becoming stunning,,, because,, we have not done anything to cure the disease, we have only stretched out the doubling time,,, until,,, a whole bunch of block heads decided it was their 'freedom,, to go to Sturgis, Florida, to crowded rallies... We are paying the price for that today with a shortened doubling period,, and also,,,, kids coming home from college.  There will be another large spike in mid to late December, courtesy of Thanksgiving.

Doubling.  Geometrical progression.   We have very much been doing a good job,,,, but to get to the vaccine,, we must do better.   Wash your hands.  Wear your mask.  Limit all contact,, INCLUDING  family.  Stay home.   No public indoor buildings. 
5 million mid August, 10 m mid Nov. 20 m mid to late Dec.. 40 m and one million dead  mid Mar.  Then vaccine will slow it.  Math."
2020-11-24 6:45,"11 months into this and you still have people with very big microphones denying that there is a pandemic.  You have people who still believe that face masks cause more damage than good.  You have a large number of people who are incapable of acknowledging that the first reason for wearing a facemark is to protect others--they still believe they are brave cowboys bucking an evil world of conformists by refusing to wear a mask.

And now the number of infections has grown to the point where it is mathematically impossible to sort out who got infected from where.

The problem is not an overabundance of caution."
2020-11-24 6:51,"I have a suggestion, just until things get under control.  In the same way that masks aren't perfect but they might slow things down as a contribution to getting to r0 < 1, while not perfect and certainly not doctrinaire, the public could begin a version of informal contact tracing which would not be as good as the real thing but might contribute to decreasing the spread:

If each member of the public, when and if they tested positive, got a pad of paper and wrote down the people they had been in contact with for the last 5 days, and then called each on the phone to tell them they had tested positive, and to wait to 5 days since they'd seen each other and get tested, but generally stay home during that time, wouldn't it be enough similar to real contact tracing to help curb the spread?"
2020-11-24 8:00,"I thought by going grocery shopping at 3PM today I could avoid the holiday crowds. But the store was packed, and I knew I had no choice but to get my groceries, or I wouldn’t have any until the holiday was over.￼

This is the type of environment in which the virus is spreading. Overcrowded indoor places, like the gyms down the block, where people are working out without masks on, and the construction sites all around, where workers don’t wear masks or social distance."
2020-11-24 9:39,"This article illustrates something I have noticed and found somewhat troubling:  the media has no idea how to report on this virus.  It is like all the articles about how critical it is to keep schools and universities open while failing to place these sorts of decisions in a larger context of a raging virus.  Yes, well, interesting points here about possible sources of virus transmission, but what could possibly be the point of running this story right now."
2020-11-24 6:54,"Even a tiny risk, when multiplied several million-fold, becomes a huge problem. People aren’t thinking nearly enough about the healthcare workers, which are not an infinite resource. Once they are saturated, the COVID-19 case fatality rate will increase significantly... and many of the healthcare workers will be more psychologically scarred (PTSD) than they already are and quit than already have. People are also largely unaware of the acute and chronic conditions—often silent conditions—suffered by the millions of survivors. Covid clots can damage multiple organs, including the heart and brain. We will all be paying for their treatment for years to come. It is such a small thing to wear a mask. Don’t be selfish—just stay home one holiday season and there will be nothing to worry about."
2020-11-24 6:52,"I have three grown up kids in the area that won't be coming over for Thanksgiving this year.  It's just too dangerous.  Dad has COPD, grandma is 85.  Anything less than 8 feels weird and this year it will be 4.  
Vaccine is coming.  This won't last forever.  It isn't the time to slack off now that it's the worst time.
We're going to try to do some cross country skiing or a nice big burn pile out in the forest for Christmas.  Something outside if weather permits."
2020-11-24 4:08,"Hmm. Our smallish county in California reports 72+% transmission in ""Person to Person Household."" Only 9% for ""Community Acquired."" Perhaps your best point is the lack of standardized reporting for transmission."
2020-11-24 10:49,"I would like to point out that your supporting data regarding Colorado is problematic. You argue that only 81 cases are secondary to social outings while 3300 are at universities; therefore, social gatherings are not an issue. However, we know at CU Boulder a lot of those “university cases” are actually stemming from the large parties at frats/sororities, which I would argue are essentially the same thing as a social gathering."
2020-11-24 10:59,"As a physician, I would add two points.   Yes, wearing a mask, socially distancing, washing hands and staying home if you are sick all work, and very well, and as other readers have pointed out, in some parts of the country this is being completely ignored.  I cannot recall a single case in the last 9 months where someone followed the above mentioned advice and still became ill. That doesn’t mean it never happens, but it’s uncommon.

The corollary to all of this is that it is also an issue of testing.   As The Times has pointed out, universities like Cornell and Duke have set the model for how to manage through a pandemic - pooled testing of everyone twice weekly ( or even weekly) and any positives are quarantined separately.  This is how China also controlled spread of the virus. I recognize how Herculean  this task seems but we have people who have done it!  Our government has put absolutely no resources behind helping towns and cities establish protocols for widespread testing.  My experience is that for the vast majority of us, as cases rise, testing slots becomes scarce and  lab turnaround times also rise to 3-4 days, rendering  widespread testing of asymptomatic individuals and contacts useless.  In that regard it really is not much better than it was in the spring.  As a result we have no idea where the virus really is and so are flying blind. If we want the economy “open” again then we need to be testing much much more than we are."
2020-11-24 11:04,"Well, I'm pretty sure what's causing the spread where I live. It's bad policies in our local schools.

My nephew and niece go to the same high school. My nephew and sister caught Covid, three weeks after the school started hybrid learning. The school told them that both my niece and nephew needed to quarantine for 10 days.

But that was it. They didn't contact trace who they'd been around, they didn't send their teachers and classmates home, they didn't close the school. And I'm assuming they didn't do this because it's impossible...

They're going to school with about 1000 other students each day. It's impossible to track down who they'd been around. and parents would be in an uproar if they closed the school.

That was the compromise. Send half the students two days per week, the other half another two days. Everyone wear masks. Shields up in the cafeteria.

But no distancing in the hallways. My niece said they're supposed to but they don't. There's less kids in classrooms but they aren't 6 feet apart.

And our surge coincided with schools here partially reopening - two weeks after October 15th.

I get why school districts are in a hard place - parents need to work somehow and we don't have any leadership on that front. And kids absolutely need to be social for their well-being.

But poor policies and lack of vigilance in schools seems to me to be a driving force in this surge."
2020-11-24 11:25,I am an emergency physician suffering from pandemic fatigue and moral injury.  I am tired.  The panic I feel when I hear friends and acquaintances explain how their Thanksgiving gathering will be the safe exception is overwhelming.  I was horrified to read this speculative free pass to gather.  As I walk into another shift this morning I think of all the times  I’ll plead with my patients to please stay home on Thursday. It’s not safe. If I hear this article thrown back at me I may just scream.
2020-11-24 11:55,"My church has been gathering online by ZOOM since March. We miss being together terribly, and all of us would prefer worshipping in our sanctuary.  But no one wants to risk infecting other people, especially our elders, when there is a safe way to worship together -- online.  Similarly, four families in my neighborhood had a distanced potluck supper last Saturday. Each household made one course: salad or bread or soup or dessert. At 5:00 there were a flurry of distanced deliveries. At 6:00, we opened the Zoom and we broke bread together. We had a lovely conversation and meal together for an hour and a half. Yes, it was different -- and shorter and less noisy than if we had all been in the same room, but we were together, sharing stories and food.
I order take out from our local restaurants. I order books from the local bookstore and pick them up curbside. I am only shopping local, and with income loss, shopping a whole lot less. Balancing economic needs with health needs isn't that tricky -- corpses are not consumers, so why hold onto a system that creates them? We need another relief blll to hold us distanced, shut down and safe till the vaccine is distributed, and that light is just visible at the end of the tunnel. Our current leaders are paying attention to... self interest and politics, not the American people. Time for some common sense and decency. I believe in science -- but this is not rocket science!"
2020-11-24 12:58,"Here in Vermont, the new cases were traced to small gatherings. It was data, not opinion."
2020-11-24 13:50,"Since this article references the new restrictions in Vermont, let me just say that these restrictions are data-based.  Since the level of infection in Vermont has not been as widespread as in other states, Vermont was able to contact trace the recent surge.  The result, 71% of the new cases were traced back to small social gatherings.  Halloween parties were a big one as were hockey and broomball leagues."
2020-11-24 14:10,"The article neglected to mention the restrictions on social gatherings outside of your household is in addition to wider restrictions, including closure of all restaurants (except carry out), bars, youth and adult recreational sports. Additionally the largest school districts in the state have been on remote learning for the academic year. The writer makes it sound like the household small gathering restrictions are the sole restrictions here and it couldn’t be further from the actual measures in place."
2020-11-24 14:13,"The article mentions that Canada's recent Thanksgiving added to its rising cases. That may be correct, but the sentence says ""added to its rising cases"". That's key. The cases were already rising. Back in August some thought Canada had nearly extinguished COVID-19. So as controls loosened, Canada's case load started growing exponentially. Public health policy is determined at the local and provincial levels, and policy failure can be read with a lag of several weeks directly from the numbers. Adjusting for population, Canada's cases are growing at about one-quarter the US rate. That is still far too many relative to hospital capacity. Public policy is flying blind, especially in Ontario where contact tracing was all but abandoned, while the authorities are making closure regulations without a satisfactory set of facts for intelligently targeting these measures. The economic costs of this mismanagement are monumental. 

In both the US and much of Canada, there has not been developed the kind of smart control mechanisms that would allow business to continue, but only with masks and distancing and effective enforcement. Several other countries have shown this can be done, but on this continent we have yet to learn how, or to make the resource commitment to smart pandemic management. The resulting cost is far too high in lives and in income."
2020-11-24 14:24,"It is a very interesting discussion involving epidemiology, public policy, social sciences, public health, etc.

I live in Kansas where there is almost always a breeze--can that possibly blow a load of virus downwind, or does it dilute and disperse to insignificance?
There's plenty of information/speculation about indoor exposure and that seems to terrify most folks against the outdoors."
2020-11-24 15:28,"This article and these comments expose an example of an information problem that is serious in this country right now: people pick and choose information and data that appear to support their opinion or ‘needs’ and then amplify those data or facts.

2020-11-24 15:39,"In El Paso, now a hotspot, our numbers were relatively low. Bars were closed for awhile and restaurants were limited to a small percentage of capacity. 
Then in October we opened up bars and restaurants, and the numbers went through the roof. We had been having small family gatherings for months, so obviously they were not the source of the outbreak. 
For me there is no question that large inside crowds of strangers are the problem, but people cannot and will not stay home."
2020-11-24 14:20,"The elephant in the room here in West Michigan (FYI not “western Michigan” for you in the media) is gatherings in churches.  I’m a church-goer too. It’s a huge part of the culture here. And I’m positive it’s partially driving our outbreak, which is also huge.  Many, but not all, churches, finally switched back to livestream-only services in the last week, after all the hospitals in Michigan pleaded with the public to take action.  It’s a disgrace and I’m ashamed."

We are going on a year into this epidemic and even basic health information is not getting out to the public. And no, I didn’t correct my friend. I just stood there 12 feet away with my mask on and said, “Keep your circle small. Stay outdoors.”

I am terrified about what’s going to happen after Thanksgiving gatherings."

The dead may be over represented in nursing homes, but not the cases. It is hard to escape the conclusion that young people socializing--as they have a wont to do--was the pivot of the epidemic. Consider the bars and churches: Close contact, indoors, voluble talking/laughing/singing. Why churches should be exempt is sheer nuttiness. Corona virus is agnostic.
If you drive at 100 mph, it is not up to the government to save you from your folly. The government can design safe road and post speed limits, but if you ignore the rules that's not a failure of an overwhelmed government. That's on you."

One million may have become infected. For example the orthodox just had a wedding with thousands attending  
and they were supporters of Trump. If we have large groups not following health mandates it is clear how it is spreading. The orthodox backed Trump and may have been influenced by him. In addition , other groups got together to hsve parties as though the virus would not spread. No wonder NYC is in crisis."

In Asia, people are used to following science based social measures and trust their governments.
In the West, people value their ""rights"" and ""freedoms"" (since they have little else) and generally see political leaders as the craven fools that they are.

The result?
Asia is containing the virus and in the West it is uncontrolled.
This is not bad, you just

Important to take personal responsibility for your own health.
It does not bother me that others do not wear masks or eat in restaurants,
I simply choose to protect myself by masking and eating at home.
Easy!

2020-11-24 11:18,"“It seems like they’re passing off the responsibility for controlling the outbreak to individuals and individual choices,” said Ellie Murray, an epidemiologist at Boston University. “A pandemic is more a failure of the system than the failure of individual choices.”  Excuse me?

Since we are all part of the system, each of us as individuals bears the responsibility of doing our part to help PREVENT the spread of the virus: wear a mask, social distance, do not gather/congregate especially in an enclosed space. This “epidemiologist” apparently fails to understand how this virus is transmitted from one individual to another."

Our health officers do contact tracing and have said that most of the Vermont Covid cases can be traced to small gatherings.  Dining in restaurants is permitted but only with members of your same household.  Restaurant dining is permitted due to the constraints of tables being apart, while when being outside there may be less compliance with masks and distancing.  Maybe this seems excessive but maybe this will enable Vermont to keep the schools open, which is more important than being outside."

2020-11-24 16:34,"This election was a referendum on Trump’s miserable mishandling of the COVID pandemic, and Trump lost, but he should have lost in a landslide.

The problem is that Trump voters believe all of Trump’s lies that COVID is no more serious than the flu, and that a vaccine will be available to save us any day now.  As the Woodward tapes prove, Trump has lied from the beginning, and he just doesn’t care how many people die or suffer long-lasting injuries.

Trump may leave the White House in January, but he is still the cult leader of the GOP, and McConnell and the other GOP leaders are still afraid of Trump.

Leadership matters.  Starting on Jan. 20th, President Biden will show that real men DO wear masks.

President Biden will also help convince Americans that the upcoming COVID vaccines are safe and effective, and that they are being distributed equitably to all states, to old and young, to rich and poor, and to all races and ethnic groups."

2020-11-24 16:55,"The most important line of this article:
""Indeed, it has become much harder to pinpoint any source of any outbreak, now that the virus is so widespread and Americans may be exposed in so many ways.""

The virus is everywhere.   The more people with whom you interact, the greater your chance of getting Covid.  Gatherings of ten people are spreading the virus more slowly than gatherings of one hundred people at a bar or at a religious service.  But even small gatherings increase the population-wide rate of person to person contact."
2020-11-24 17:09,"In my career as an engineering psychologist, I participated in research, and consulted, on the design of complex systems to induce safe behavior from operators and users. It seems clear to me that we need much more research on first, the relative safety vs. risk of various daily activities in pandemic conditions, and second, how best to encourage safe behaviors and discourage risky ones. Current research is deficient in several areas. Most studies to date either assume that behavior conforms to recommendations and/or restrictions (for example, mask-wearing), or relies on self-reports, which are not reliable for behaviors associated with strong social approval/disapproval. Also lacking are population studies which could supplement contact tracing to identify risky behaviors. Data on daily activities sampled randomly over time and region will be noisy, so a ‘big data’ approach would be needed, with statistical techniques to estimate the risks of dining out, gym visits, shopping, etc. Behavior-focused research can play an important role in controlling the spread of infection."
2020-11-24 17:25,"The sad thing is that we have not had and still do not have even a rudimentary effort to get ahead of the virus and find out where it is among the population.  Any half way rational approach would have been to launch major, randomly sampled, tests of the population.  Now, of course, Republicans, all of whom seem to believe that the moon is made of green cheese, wouldn't participate out of loyalty to their Trump cult.  But, still, there is stratified random sampling, and some could be persuaded.  Another problem is the statistics of rare events are complicated, but if America really believed in the ""sanctity of life,"" (which apparently really means the ""sanctity of human life,"" or, rather, the ""sanctity of the fetus,"") we would long ago have paid attention to getting ahead and finding out where the virus is, so as to, at the least, protect the most vulnerable."

2020-11-24 17:47,"I got COVID about 2 months ago, and spent literally hours on the phone with the health department answering questions about my contacts. I answered their many calls out of a sense of duty, but came away deeply disappointed in the quality of their research. For one thing, they first contacted me 9 days after my positive test. By then, how well did I remember whom I had been in contact with before my test?  They found out that daughter got it too - but they hadn't managed to connect the dots with her positive test until I told them about it. (Are they now counting her twice?) They wanted to know about the stores I had visited within the 2 weeks before my test (i.e., more than 3 weeks before the call!) but didn't pursue information about my son, who first exhibited symptoms 2 days before me, had a known exposure to a positive case, and is much more likely to be the source of my infection. I shudder to think that epidemiological conclusions reached, and recommendations made, based on this research.
Their advice was equally intelligent. For example,  they helpfully offered me resources to support my isolation - which was ending the next day. They told me to quarantine my daughter for 14 days after my 10 days ended, because of her exposure to me - although she had tested positive herself and was past her 10 days and asymptomatic (This was part of their third call, about 15 days after my test.) 
I now understand why people do not want to spend hours speaking to contact tracers."
2020-11-24 18:35,"This article makes a significant logical fallacy that pushes the reader to draw an erroneous conclusion, namely that private gatherings are relatively safe.  What is the fallacy?  Difficulty in definitively attributing a case to a source is not the same as concluding the source did not cause the case.

Epidemiologists are cautious by nature, and attribute a source to a case only when they have a high degree of confidence that the case should not be attributed to a different source.  This understandable caution tends to underestimate the number of cases attributable to a particular source.  It is made worse when community prevalence is higher, as a higher percentage of those contact traced report contacts with multiple known sources of contagion.  

A better question is whether strict measures to reduce private gatherings during the holiday season, such as those recently implemented by the Minnesota governor, succeed at  curbing viral spread.  This is a testable hypothesis, and as other states have not yet followed suit, we should be able to evaluate it after a month or two."
2020-11-24 18:36,"I agree with this assessment.  When governors or mayors come out with guidelines or mandates that contradict common sense, people will start to ignore all the rules, including common sense rules that most were following - no large in home parties, wear masks in stores, wash hands.  It's human nature to suspect and ignore rules that cannot be justified with data.

I'm thinking that this surge is partly due to seasonal weather changes, but don't believe that's all of it.  We just don't know.  Scientists don't know.  Sometimes it's better to say we don't know or are not sure vs. mandates that never were justified with data.  For all the spouting of a love for Science, some governors appear clueless."

Whether or not it's the engine...BE SAFE. 

With respect, this is a really dumb article. Household gatherings are not all the same--it's not that we don't know whether they're causing the surge, it's that gathering in certain ways (indoors, unmasked) is dangerous. We know that. Should the government do other things too? Obviously."

The article claims there is little clear and consistent guidance from above, but then seems to suggest that everyone is consistently blaming individuals for gathering. The main premise is that claims are bing made that the current outbreak can be blamed on gatherings, but no quote or reference is provided. Saying that businesses should be regulated so people dont feel guilty about celebrating a holiday is a matter of priorities, an argument you could make to your local government. I just dont get what this article is really trying to say other than cast doubt on something that you can pretty much say is risky behavior based on at least a few outbreaks from weddings and churches,"

Airports are wide open, for domestic and international travel.   Whenever there is a political, election, or social justice thing happening, multitudes of people gather in the streets.  Our state and local officials are instructing us to follow the rules, while they dine out and get on planes.  I am all for following the rules, and have been, but the relentless onslaught of half-measures, loosely enforced mandates and confusing information from all sectors is a problem.

The Gates efforts in aiding other countries efforts to distribute the vaccines are very commendable . Waking up this morning with a sense of dread .
I would like to hear how the Gates Foundation might be assisting our struggling healthcare system and our own financially challenged struggling citizens."
2020-11-23 11:48,"Bill and Melinda Gates are national treasures at a time when we are desperate for good will and mutual support. Most of their work is done in the Third world but, we need their example here and now."
2020-11-23 12:04,"Thank you NYT for such a detailed well-researched (I’ll assume) reporting on Bill Gates’  longstanding continuing efforts to change the world in the right way. We are lucky to have Bill and Melinda, acting with true compassion, superior operational skills and zero self-interest, all capabilities in stark contrast to the exiting occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."
2020-11-23 11:34,"Fourty-four percent of Republicans believe the Bill Gates Microchip conspiracy theory? What has happened to the Republican party? It is time for more level headed Republicans to take back control of the party and begin a strong reeducation campaign before the party is completely lost. first and foremost trey must embrace truth and science and dispell this dangerous thinking. Why are they all so afraid if Trump? Or is he simply creating the scared, uneducated easily controllable masses the party is looking for?"
2020-11-23 11:56,"Thank goodness Bill Gates and his foundation are working to ensure the poor nations get their share of the vaccine. Lord knows there’re no other likely candidate in the offing to do this work. It’s unfortunate that an inequitable capitalist system produces individuals with such vastly disproportionate wealth, but this being the case, the silver lining is Bill and Melinda Gates are pouring their heart, soul and wealth into doing good for the poorest and most vulnerable people on the planet."
2020-11-23 12:04,"One question: With the wealth of power, money and resources at their disposal, why has Bill and Melinda Gates not confronted WHO and its leader, Dr. Tedros, about his and the WHO's complicity with XI and China in covering up this virus? 
I think The Gates are true World leaders. They concern themselves with dire situations throughout the World, with no hidden agenda. Their concern is making the World safer.  Yet, they allow the WHO and China to dictate the narrative, even when deceitful and life threatening to the entire planet."
2020-11-23 12:09,"Of course,saying anything against Bill Gates is well, almost heretical.

While I appreciate his work and that of his Foundation - I wish you had also emphasized role of ""public money.""

While Mr. Gates contributes 10 cents on a dollar - 90 cents come from us, the taxpayers of the world.

Even Mr. Gates could not afford the costs of ""warp speed"" project that has almost brought to the world - a number of vaccines - unimagined just 8 months ago.  Yet, there is no mention here of POTUS, his team and dedicated scientists of America.

I think Mr. Gates - and I use his products - is doing what Rockefeller did with his philanthropy.

From Standard Oil baron or a robber or a monopolist image - he became overnight - a philanthropist.

Something same with Mr. Gates.

No one remembers how much the world hated Microsoft, its monopolistic business models or even Mr. Gates testimony during government trial to break up Microsoft - now, he has become a world savior.

While I admire his efforts, my intention is to not go unchallenged his past behavior and why he is where he is today.

And also, to laud our own government and Americans who pay taxes who have made a critical difference in battling Wuhan."
2020-11-23 12:06,"It feels good to remember what and who make America great, again."
2020-11-23 11:39,You would certainly never see anyone in the Trump family doing anything like this for anyone else. We are lucky to have Bill Gates and his wife. There's a big difference in people in this shows one of the biggest ones in the world. Now we have voted by millions for Joe Biden. Trump is not a dictator nor is he a king he doesn't get to decide who is president that's not the way it works. It's time for him to go away
2020-11-23 12:25,"The Gates Foundation is doing hard and amazing work and I thank and applaud them.

Now how to get my friends (held at a distance because seriously, crazy-talk isn’t fun to be around) who think Bill Gates is growing wealthy from this work. They also believe vaccines are the scourge of the world. (And they’re not even Republicans.)"
2020-11-23 13:04,"The net benefit is that Bill and Melinda Gates have saved millions of lives. That being said, there are important conversations happening right now on the role of government and tax payers vs private philanthropy. 

As of 2020 I can’t think of many government initiatives that aren’t hampered by the dysfunctional forces reigning between the two parties. Given the level of conspiratorial thinking in the populace on one side, and the lack of perspective taking and nuance on the other, we’re lucky to have individuals who still manage to get things done. 

There are also valid opinions on work done abroad vs domestically. It’s worth keeping in mind that infectious disease does not care about borders."
2020-11-23 13:33,An excellent piece. Kudos to the journalists for this expansive look at the complex machinations behind The Gates Foundation’s work in global vaccine development and distribution.
2020-11-23 13:55,"I am wondering what happened to the seven factories that Gates was going to build (in the news in April).  This article doesn't mention them.  They were to each be specialized for a particular type of vaccine,and assuming that all types wouldn't work out, the ones that didn't work would be a write off. Was this all under the non - profit umbrella? I am assuming that Gates, now that he has more money than God, would giving away whatever vaccines he produced.  The question might be to whom is he giving the vaccines to: Americans, the poor in the poorest countries, or to those who bought Microsoft products.  It's not easy being rich.  I wonder what the Queen is doing to help."
2020-11-23 13:31,"It makes me wonder why there is never such urgency to overcome all the obstacles that prevent the people of poor countries from having reliable sources of clean water, adequate food, and basic sanitation,  along with decent education and prospects for employment and future well-being. While Gates made his fortune through rapacious capitalism, at least now he's using that fortune properly. Compare that to Bezos and Musk, who want to use their money to escape our ruined planet rather than fix it."
2020-11-23 13:29,"Of course philanthropy like this is commendable, but it's a shame it was even possible in the first place for private individuals to amass such eye-watering amounts of wealth."
2020-11-23 13:37,"@Tj I hope Bill and Melinda Gates’ philanthropic work is appreciated in most of the world.  Your comment shows it’s not only the US that has crazy conspiracy theories.

Bill Gates trying to get rich?  His investments probably provide him with hundreds of millions of dollars income per year, even if he stays home in bed for that year.  It’s amazing what people will believe and what conspiracy theories are made available by the mainstream media for us all to consider."
2020-11-23 13:47,"Let this sink in: nearly half of Republicans truly believe Bill Gates is trying to put microchips in vaccines.

These are the same 70  million that looked at Trump and said “Yes! Four more please!”.

This article (and the commentariat in general) don’t go far enough in facing what happens when such a large percentage of a society is willfully, almost gleefully, descending into madness."
2020-11-23 13:29,"Having a multi billionaire, extra governmentally, be our ""savior"" no matter how good the possible action is anti democratic and just plain lucky.  For every American Gates, you have an American Koch brother, at best. There shouldn't be multi-billionaires, period - yet the US is filled with people who, effectively, have captured huge social resources and we stupidly cheer as the US fails as a democracy.  To be clear, unless there is a national and international governmental effort, much like a world War to manufacture and distribute the vaccines, getting to herd immunity will take much longer, again, no matter how many billionaires are involved."
2020-11-23 14:19,"I have a good friend who vehemently believes that vaccines contain microchips. I asked him some simple questions, such as what are ""they"" trying to get me to do now that I allegedly have these microchips inside me (I routinely have flu vaccine administered)? All he could muster was that they would always know where I am and they can control me. I explained my cellphone does a good job of knowing where I am, and since we've known each other since childhood, do I appear different or controlled? He just mumbled that someday if see the truth about this evil. To me, he looks controlled by crazy conspiracy thoughts."
2020-11-23 14:26,"Property rights; poor country's copays; these are concepts which fit right in with the American for profit health system. But they seem ancient and outdated in the middle of this pandemic, and of course India will ignore property rights, to our benefit."
2020-11-23 14:33,"I am a limited income single parent who thankfully is employed. I would gladly pay up to $100 for an effective vaccine dose if it would cover my costs, the cost of someone who couldn't pay in the US and dozens from developing countries (not further enrich Pharma). Please provide an option to charge me and stop wasting your precious time and energies negotiating loans for countries who are already precarious and focus on distribution strategies."
2020-11-23 14:28,"I am shocked and distressed at the number of people that believe the vaccines are made from aborted tissue, that they alter DNA and that it's all a giant conspiracy by Bill Gates to implant microchips in the entire population and gain control of the world. To nobody's surprise, certainly not mine, the charge of crazy conspiracy theories is most prevalent in the Republican Party. The reasons are the lack of morality and decency amongst Republicans, the decades of misinformation and manipulation and, of course, the lack of knowledge and education amongst the rank and file. 

Republicans, sadly, despite their pride in ignorance are good at one thing and that is voting in lockstep and taking whatever action necessary to secure power regardless of what damage it does to people's lives and democratic government. 

It is dismaying at best and horrifying at worst. Lets hope things are about to change though the current Democratic leadership does not seem to have the fight it is going to take to undue much of the harm. Certainly not to wrest control of the narrative so that we can beat the pandemic. 

It's time for Democrats to start putting some muscle into their step and stop trying to play patty cake with radical right wing insanity."
2020-11-23 14:49,"As someone who is in a masters program for public health, what I took from the article is the importance of bringing everyone to the table, especially the target population.  The article mentions many issues that may inhibit global heard immunity from a vaccine, but none more avoidable than simply having the target countries involved in the process. These governments were not aware of how much they would have to pay for the subsidized vaccine and therefore may not be able to receive the vaccine in a timely manner.  The way the Gates foundation went about this is quite paternalistic—assuming they know about how a vaccine will be distributed in all developing countries without consulting the developing countries.  There is no way they can know everything. I’m sure many other issues that will slow the process down will come up if they don’t start involving the target countries ASAP."
2020-11-23 14:35,"The Times has an endless obsession with Bill Gates. Bill Gates took advantage of the capitalist system to make billions of dollars. There's nothing wrong with that. However, Bill Gates has never been in the trenches. The people in the trenches -- the social workers, the child care workers, the mental health workers, the public interest lawyers, the nurses aides -- struggle every day with low salaries and little appreciation. Can Bill Gates influence other powerful people to raise wages for these workers and others? Why is this not discussed?"
2020-11-23 14:52,"News in UK is that Astra will produce the vaccine at a no profit cost of £3 a dose, against Moderna / £25 a dose. No doubt you could get it in the USA for much more, but then that what happens with a private health care system. In needing only  a normal fridge to store makes it todays chioce for the wider world, which I think kis what the Gates would prefer.  Not so reported is the influence from Bill Gates so glad to see his foundations recognition here.  

I stopped loathing Microsoft so much when Apple became, well, so Apple."
2020-11-23 14:33,"Bill Gates is obsessed with technocracy, that a synthetic, artificial approach to problems ranging from health to agriculture will solve everything. This approach, bankrolled by his foundation, has failed again and again. Check out the track record of oral (not hypodermic) polio vaccines for children in Africa, which because of poor hygiene resulted in polio being passed to previously healthy children yet still continues. Check out the failure of the so-called Green Revolution in India, which he still supports. Check out his support of Monsanto/Bayer, despite the damage glyphosate has done. Learn about the level of investment he has in all leading vaccine companies racing to combat Covid-19. Not to mention his plan for synthetic human breast milk! His messianic belief in technocracy to the dismissal of what the human body and nature can do trumps reason and common sense. Buyer beware."
2020-11-23 14:39,Gates is genius and knows how to make money. What’s disturbing is no National Strategy was even attempted. How hard to say “America Wear a Mask”. No option. Mandate. But somehow to vaccinate everyone seems preferable? I have huge suspicions with Big Pharma
2020-11-23 15:01,"The key points of this story aren’t about Bill Gates; they’re about how complicated the process is of getting private for profit companies and governments to cooperate with each other for would should be one united worldwide effort.  The governments can never fully rid themselves of the distraction of their own politics, and the companies never forget about their bottom line and competition.  The message is clear - it’s still going to be a long hard road for poor countries to get vaccinated."
2020-11-23 15:01,"Private money can do things public money cannot. Public money is subject to politics, and that leads to good outcomes and bad. Sometimes it leads to shortsightedness or craziness. In the United States, for example, Donald Trump has withdrawn the country from the World Health Organization and refused to participate in funding Covid vaccinations for the developing world. But the Gates Foundation remains active in those efforts. Trump has muzzled and distorted the CDC, but the Gates Foundation is free to continue its good work--and does."
2020-11-23 15:01,"From the latest articles that I have read, Bill, Warren and most of the other billionaires who have publicly promised to give away the vast majority of their wealth have actually created a system where by in the process of giving away a small portion and gaining the tax advantages, their wealth has actually increases significantly. So, I listen and process what these folks tell me with great skepticism."
2020-11-23 15:00,"Kudos to Mr. Gates for his work on vaccinations - even before Covid. And for standing up to trump on His Covid response, WHO etc. And for standing up to 40pct of Republicans who think he is inserting a chip to control them (which is quite ironic when you can see that these people can be easily influenced by nutjob conspiracy theories that don’t require complex chips!). 

There is one thing more serious than Covid and it’s the anti-science misinformation that is prevalent in the US.  


We deny climate science even as hurricanes and wildfires are destroying us. We have far more Covid cases and deaths than Taiwan or S. Korea.  Perhaps Mr. Gates can tackle the information crisis next."
2020-11-23 15:09,"Kudos, Mr. Gates!  But I have a question:

Where are all the world's other multi-billionaires?

Imagine what you and few hundred of your brothers and sisters in great wealth could accomplish if you throw your skills, experience and money at such problems as:  proper public education in the third world, climate change, or infrastructure projects?

Perhaps your foundation might lead an effort to recruit other billionaires, then expand your work to include other urgent matters that rich governments and certain political parties neglect out of greed and perceived self-interest."
2020-11-23 15:10,"And how much has Trump, who told his cult rally audiences that he was ""really, really rich, folks,"" contributed to any of these causes?

2020-11-23 15:00,"Things I would trust more than a Bill Gates sponsored vaccine from India:

-an email from a Nigerian Prince seeking my credit card number
-Donald Trump’s insistence that he would love to furnish his tax returns if only they weren’t under audit
-gas station sushI 
 

My family will be first in line when well vetted vaccinations are available. But right now I’m wary of the QC standards of products manufactured abroad. The track record of “generics” from India is abysmal. If you want more information read Katherine Eban’s book “Bottle of Lies” which delves into the generic drug business."

2020-11-23 16:05,"What this article describes is what has been an operational focus in Bill Gates’s Global Health initiative. An ongoing humanitarian project that long pre-dates the arrival of the COVID pandemic. Concentrated in regions such as Africa, countries like India, where a country’s economic condition plays a significant determinant factor as it concerns its labor force tied to corporate interests. Sick workers can’t work. A diminished, diminishing labor force is of particular consequence for multi-national corporate interests as it threatens to effect their profit margins. Bill Gates has addressed this corporate concern through instituting mass vaccination efforts in areas throughout the world through his Global Health initiative. Question to ask. Will a COVID vaccine be prioritized in the same way other vaccination programs have been administered? The interests of big business considered a top priority."

Erica Ollmann Saphire, Ph.D., who runs her own lab at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, in California, is one of the major behind-the-scenes American partners in this collaborative effort, assessing candidate vaccines and helping coordinate the response.

Then we as a people could have decided what to do with it. Ever since the Civil War, the history has been to give more and more power to corporatiions. That is what Bill Gates represents to me..the gross accumulation of wealth by a few and the masses of people with nothing. Monopolies abound and little of the law about this is being enforced. It's no wonder people are believing conspiracy theories, which is by the way, what powerful people say when their shenanigans are outed. The huge distribution of wealth to a tiny minority is the root of nearly all our troubles, not only in America but around the world. Bill Gates is no saint. Why should we be grateful he is sharing his loot when it should've been taxed?When someone has that much money, that is power. No one person should have that much power. We are a democracy or at least a democratic republic, last I heard. Thomas Pikkety has it right. Read him."

Also important is to note that this effort becomes the first model for a world deployment of a medical intervention.  Should someone finally develop a vaccine for TB or malaria, we will have the same challenges.

Now in many, if not most of those poor countries the incidence of Tetanus is rare, on par the US, nearly eradicated."
2020-11-23 16:59,Thank you for this piece.  I've been wanting to hear what Bill Gates is doing/saying about vaccines.
2020-11-23 17:35,"What an admirable human.
Gates is aware that this is an enormously complex problem. Governments and poor nations and the WHO are not capable of rapidly developing a vaccine. Select few universities have the knowledge and experience to develop potential vaccines. They may have the money to do some of the research but certainly don’t have the large financial resources to run the large and detailed studies.
Large pharmaceutical manufacturers have all of these and can work fast without getting mired in politics. So, Mr Gates, very wisely, and in numerous ways, helps support those who can most effectively get the job done.
I read in this article that there are some who complain about the Gates Foundation. I don’t read many specifics of the complaints nor details of better alternatives.
Bill and Melinda Gates have put themselves out there time and again - for many years. Mr Gates is uniquely qualified due to his decades of broad experience, genius for problem solving, gathering prodigious amounts of information, and apparent lack of ego in asking for help from experts.
Though the tone of this article is generally laudatory it suggest there may be valid issues with Gates’ approach. What are the issues and what alternatives might be better?"
2020-11-23 17:53,"The respect I have for Bill and Melinda Gates and the work of their Foundation is immeasurable.  They have repeatedly shown their commitment and compassion to helping solve some of the world's most serious and intractable health challenges.

We must all realize that until all are safe and healthy, none are safe or assured health.  This is not only a moral issue, it is quite simply a fundamental understanding of public health.

The U.S. decisions to withdraw from the W.H.O. and not to participate in Covax are among the worst of the Trump administration and there are so many of those to chose amongst.  Every American should be outraged about those.  Bill and Melinda Gates are not only outraged but are doing something about it, as should we all."

Shameful to read that the US is not contributing to this effort to help the poorer nations because the misanthrope Trump has never thought of anyone but himself and grabbing other peoples' money.   
Gates is truly a great and good man who could have walked away from the world with his billions and do nothing but luxuriate in whatever splendor he desires but instead he tackles difficult issues in some of the most difficult nations on the planet.  Humanitarian."

How quaint... reminds me of the British aristocracy."
2020-11-23 17:36,Let's give some credit to the reporting. This is Pulitzer-level work.
2020-11-23 16:53,"The Gates Foundation's goals are to enhance healthcare and reduce extreme poverty across the globe, and to expand educational opportunities and access to information technology in the U.S. Kudos to Bill for creating such a Foundation whose goals benefit the entire world. 

A key Gates Foundation principle is to “take risks, make big bets, and move with urgency.” Its grants enable scientists to test new ideas under a faster approval process than a traditional NIH grant, which fosters innovation in global health research.

A key Gates Foundation principle is to “take risks, make big bets, and move with urgency.” Its grants enable scientists to test new ideas under a faster approval process than a traditional NIH grant, which fosters innovation in global health research. The Foundation has provided billions of dollars over the past several years to increase the push for global health and research on diseases affecting developing countries, with a particular focus on high-risk, high-impact infectious disease projects. 

It's uncertain whether the Foundation's five year grant duration is sufficient to produce long term results in the infectious disease research projects that have been funded. But the Foundation's foresight and focus on prioritized funded research on infectious disease eradication has significantly moved the bar in helping the world more quickly solve the pandemic health problems that currently affect everyone on our planet. 

Thanks Bill and Melinda....Thanks."
2020-11-23 17:43,"Probably the most important part of the article, unfortunately appears midway and then at the end.
""India and South Africa, in asking the World Trade Organization not to enforce coronavirus-related intellectual property rights, were seeking a way to wrest control of vaccines from big companies and ramp up local manufacturing. Kenya, Mozambique, Pakistan and Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) recently signed on as co-sponsors to the request, with dozens of other countries expressing support.""
These private companies have received billions in public dollars to develop these vaccines, this is not money from their investors, and nor borrowed against company assets. I am a huge fan of Bill Gates, he has stepped up at a time when the US government is absent.
But, public money should mean, free, or deeply discounted prices. and saying ""Gee isn't it great one company won't take a profit on this part"" is laughable.
This should be a given, especially considering the history of Pharma and anti-virals against HIV. They literally funded none of the research on using antivirals as prevention against AIDS. Zero. But they insisted on keep supposed patents they have on the drugs, and have delayed saving millions of lives. (Yes they are being sued by governments who are angry that their research is being used for private profits)"
2020-11-23 17:26,"Ironic that NYT includes a photo of Bill Gates giving a child the polio vaccine whose creator, Pasteur, did not patent or get rich from because he believed it was a public health need, in the same article that states today's pharmaceutical companies aren't in the business of making vaccines because they aren't profitable. And the companies that are making vaccines have been incentivized with our tax dollars. So we pay on both ends to allow big pharma to make huge profits off a public health crises. Meanwhile some poor countries will only be able to afford vaccinating 20% of their people. Making those countries dependent upon the 'goodness' of a single man, Bill Gates. And we are dependent on him too because, guess what? viruses spread beyond borders. Yet the article never states that public health does not need to rely on capitalists. We, a self governed nation can choose to invest in public nonprofits for our pubic health needs -- including yes, nationalized health care. We die sooner and are sick more than people in every other developed country with a national health system. The evidence is irrefutable yet we rely on the whims of billionaire ""do gooders"" (what if Gates was interested in something else?) who happen to own lots of stock in big pharma. And we have been forced to rely on big pharma's insatiable desire for blockbuster profits to determine the health of our people."
2020-11-23 17:36,Thank you Bill Gates and his Foundation!! It is important to all of us that this vaccine can be delivered to all of our worldwide citizens. England has begun make statements about how they are planning to share what they can with other nations.

2020-11-23 18:09,"I am concerned that the world will not be able to repeat this all-out effort.
Looking at the recent virus history, often resulting from human interaction/interference with formerly wild nature, I assume new epidemics can resurface in the coming years.

How often can we put our economies on hold, invest heavily into research + then distribute vaccines?

I see 2020 as a serious warning sign and opportunity to work on the underlying reasons for epidemics: overpopulation, over-extraction, deforestation are just some of our human 'overreach' into nature.
We need systemic change - and that is neither easy nor quick. 
Unless we see each other as a global humanity (and Gates sets a good example here - minus his belief in our current type of capitalism).  
Our other choice: stay on our self-destructive and short-sighted path and we may just need to watch nature do its job and 'self-regulate' an invasive species."
2020-11-23 18:14,"Good on Bill Gates, but it’s important to note that developing nations have been fairly lightly affected by COVID-19. The death and infection rates in the US and western Europe dwarf anything seen in sub-Saharan Africa. Could Bill could spare a few of his millions educating Americans on the importance of vaccinations?"
2020-11-23 19:02,"It should be explained that the foundation is not all the work of Bill Gates, the foundation was co founded and equally run by Melinda Gates but I don’t see her mentioned."
2020-11-23 19:12,"Dr. Berkley, the Gavi director, acknowledged the frustration. “Did we communicate with everybody as well as we should? Absolutely not,” he said. “Were we able to convene everybody as often as we could? Absolutely not. ""At the same time, Dr. Berkley said: “Have we brought together the entire world to discuss equitable access to vaccines? Have we raised substantial amounts of funds? All of that is true.”

This is what's important. There's been good progress made, and there are still big chunks of the issue to be worked out.
And that's OK. What's important is that everybody stays on it to develop and fairly and  equitably apply effective vaccines worldwide.

I remember feeling disheartened when reading the Trump administration shut down the Gates Foundation's work to bring an easy at-home test for the virus early this spring.
Hopefully a Biden Administration will do an about-face and start working together with the Gates Foundation.

Maybe Gates doesn't have all the answers. He will probably be the first to admit he doesn't. But to act as an effective catalyst to get public/private co-operation at an international scale moving forward against the virus is certainly a laudable achievement."
2020-11-23 19:25,"I want to express my appreciation for this excellent, informative article. It is so well researched and includes both the negatives and positives about Gates and his foundation. I had heard about Gates' efforts at the beginning of the Pandemic, and was duly impressed.  However, could find no further information, while it was one avenue that had given me hope.  Now, I KNOW what's been going on, and am so very grateful to have this update.  Having someone like Gates so involved in finding solutions is a great relief."

But vaccines are just part of the solution.The fact that the wearing of face masks was made partisan, and where those non-republican folks were shamed by wearing them has been an utter disaster, and a malevolent ignorance by design... by a most corrupt bully in-chief (where 'bully'  means 'coward in disguise')."

Everyone has a agenda and you can make any story sound good. Stay safe all.
2020-11-23 18:39,"I've never been a fan of Bill Gates. At least since he stripped an entire hillside on the east side of Lake Washington and trashed my view as I commuted to work at the Bellevue Library.
Then he introduced ""Auto-correct"", which can't spell and just yesterday had me telling my granddaughter that a ""bench scraper"" is ""a hacker's utensil""!
And he's often accused of being ""arrogant"", when what he really is, as are so many really smart people,is just ""autistic"" or ""oblivious"" or both.
And then, along came Melinda.
The entire world should stand up and applaud! 
The world's richest man met one of the world's kindest women, and this is just one of things the world has received from this union.
Today, I am thrilled and inspired by those young, rich athletes, musicians and entrepreneurs who turn so much of their excess wealth around to help. It reminds me that, even if I can only give a dollar, that dollar means far more to someone than it does to me."

2020-11-23 19:04,"Happy to see Bill and Melinda stepping up - I've always been proud that they committed to combating a very solvable and deadly issue.

I am a little surprised I have not heard more from the Gates Foundation throughout the whole run of COVID up to this point though - considering their outsize role in this sector it was confusing to me why they weren't helping to combat the misinformation about the virus and the race to the cures - surely money could have helped. 

Hopefully they will continue to be as generous at home as they are abroad with their donations and lobbying efforts - the world needs you guys, but right now America needs you too."

Sometimes the foundation is heavy-handed with getting its own way but it does get results. The foundation has supported worldwide vaccine initiatives for years. Polio is a thing of the past in all but two countries. The foundation keeps adding money to the covid vaccine research where it is needed. 

Trump wants to take credit for the vaccine but he never gave any money to the effort. Dolly Parton, who is a lot less wealthy than Trump claims to be, stepped in with a big donation to vaccine research. It's easy to criticize someone else's efforts when it doesn't cost you anything."

It would be good for him and his afterlife if there are millions of people praying for him and mercy for him in the hereafter.

When you read through the article, his philanthropic activities are mostly paid for with public funds, which means the he uses taxpayer funds to pay for his priorities while hanging on to his foundation money which he uses primarily to lobby various governments and the UN and the WHO.

And yet, he has the chutzpah to ask the US taxpayer, who he has stiffed for decades to pony up $8 billion.  Wouldn't it make more sense for him to contribute $8 billion from his foundation rather than expecting the US taxpayer to borrow an extra $8 billion?"

As to golf, give him a break -  think what the docs are always saying ""if you keep good health, Wuhan will probably not bother you.""

So, if playing golf helps his health - he is keeping one ventilator for someone else.

As to the last quote ""wear a mask"" - should also have this addition ""avoid any circumstances where you may get infected even if you are wearing a mask.""

Physicians themselves seldom or ever touch the actual ventilator. Neither do nurses, except to where it interferes with the care they give. Respiratory therapists do that work. When the plug is pulled, it’s a Registered Respiratory Therapist who physically pulls the plug. 

To the respiratory therapists putting your life on the line daily... thank you. The leadership of the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) has failed you since the 1990’s. Instead of advancing the profession through ever higher education, that leadership kept Respiratory Care in the learning backwaters for so long. The educational entry level is still an Associates degree. Natural selection favors the prepared. The AARC leadership kept you at a technician status when the pandemic horror could be thrusting the profession to greater centrality in critical care.

As it turns out, hospitals now run by corporate America run on tight fiscal margins with typically just a few weeks of cash on hand. Without revenue from elective procedures, many had difficulty making payroll. It's not clear as the third wave matures that hospital will have the staff and will be able to pay staff to take care of critically ill patients. This could have been avoided in so many ways but non-intensivist doctors and nurses could have been retrained over the summer and in the early fall to prepare for a third wave.

As a retired RN I am unwilling to return to risk my life and that of my family to return to  work to care for people who are unwilling to social distance and wear masks.

In contrast, the US graduates far fewer per capita medical professionals, burdening them with debt that forces most to seek higher paying jobs with larger corporate healthcare organizations in our larger metropolitan areas. Hence, we have medical staff shortages almost everywhere. 

Though we have equipment, Cuba still has a better reputation for providing great healthcare across their nation and among Latin American nations because their ample supply of well trained doctors, nurses and technicians can do more with less equipment, than US equipment can do with less medical staff."

Since February, I've begged people to study early use of oxygen  at home. It could be lifesaving.  It isn't for everyone, but might help many. Could it delay or abort the need for admission? Could it improve outcomes? I know it helps air hunger.

They look at me like I am peddling hydroxychloroquine with a side of oleander. Why? 

First, I'm a geezer, and what could I possibly know?!?!? Secondly, they think O2 is a frill, an adjunct. Third? They know ordering it for home use is a pain as it has its own bureaucracy. Without established 'protocols,' the 'system' would shut them down. 

Deliver me from modern healthcare. Return me to a time when Yankee ingenuity was the engine of medical progress."
2020-11-23 13:28,"Let's not forget also, that if we ever had enough PPE, there would be far fewer health care workers quarantining, sick or dying themselves of Covid 19, which has further reduced the staffing levels.

Other articles have been written about this but it cannot be minimized.  These people should all be able to work with full suits and a high tech respirator on.  Some I see in the news are wearing  the substandard N95's that are selling at my local hardware store!  Recall in the beginning, people were wearing plastic bags.  Trump and team completely and totally dropped the ball on PPE and we can never forget.  When we needed them, they didn't produce, and despite what Trump says now, there is still a lack of PPE and that affects how many people are available to care for the patients."
2020-11-23 14:05,"Darn, you mean that health care requires trained and dedicated people, not just machines? Ha! Next we might have to treat those people decently, instead of considering them mere Covid fodder and applauding them from our balconies once in a while (not now, it’s too cold). Hmmm."

2020-11-23 16:10,"It's appalling that Trump chose to willfully ignore the menace of Covid-19 when he was first informed about it. His pronouncements that it was not a problem, that very few people would be infected by the virus and that it would miraculously disappear have caused the deaths of over a quarter of a million Americans. The current death rate of 2,000 people a day is double what it was not long ago. 

We are doomed to suffer and die from a disease whose spread can be limited by the wearing of masks and the practice of social distancing because Trump refuses to set a good example and continues to refuse to follow both simple practices. Most of his family members as well as he himself and many around have him been infected by Covid-19. Of course the idiot was given the best possible treatment and the taxpayers had to pay for it.

The outgoing president has no idea how it feels to be uninsured or underinsured, to have the feelings of helplessness and hopelessness caused by job losses or the stress brought on by the specter of becoming homeless hanging over his family. He has always been wealthy and is completely out of touch with reality. 

One can only hope that he soon has to deal with his crimes and that his fortune, if he even has one, goes to pay his enormous debts and his fines and costs when he is found guilty of the charges that will soon enough be filed against him. I seriously doubt that President Biden will pardon him!"

2020-11-23 15:17,"I would point out the egregious error of not valuing trained health professionals over the salary compensation and inordinate power of a two year MBA hospital administrator.  This erosion of medical professional labor pool is the product of keeping medical expenses under control.  Physicians are only responsible for 7 cents on the dollar in our budgets.  The liars of Capitalism and the lies they tell!  Why do you think there are not enough Family Docotrs, Nurses( those persons skilled to do all the work of caretaking) and other providers of infrastructure.  Because some nitwit thought the desk job was more important.  How is it going right now?

There is also no expansion room of the labor pool to fit the cataclysmic and tragic occurrence of mass casualty in the world.

So, administrators, manage and meet....and try to bear some integrity and admit you were greedy and wrong.

I was one of the first respiratory therapists in the US.  I went on to become a solo, Primary Care, Board certified Geriatrician at great expense to myself.  Not only could I not get paid from the private insurance industry...but, the Gov't would not pay me either.  In Virginia, I PAID to take care of the Medicaid population at the former reimbursement schedule.  I had to move to Canada to make enough to survive the cost of being a practicing physician.  

I would help you all with the coverage but I am just too sick....and without benefits to support me.

Good Luck"

Also, complete failure to mention that as doctors learned more about the disease, they realized that for most, putting patients on ventilators killed them.  They now use a less invasive technique called proning, and they no longer sent patients home to 'return when they couldn't breath' to keep beds open for the onslaught that didn't occur in most counties across the nation.  

The NYTimes prefers a narrative of blame the right, castigate Trump, regardless of facts.  Wonder what this paper will look like when Biden is President.

2020-11-23 18:53,"CRNAs (Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists) are advanced practice nurses with at least one year (most of the time more) of experience working at the bedside in ICUs before gaining extensive knowledge and training in airway and ventilator management during a graduate anesthesia program. We are uniquely qualified to use our skills to assist in the pandemic, especially when elective surgical cases decrease, but are often limited by state laws and facility regulations limiting our scope of practice. I’m not saying we are as good as intensivists, but we are certainly a very capable group, who is already highly adept at managing ventilators, intubation, placing lines and titrating vasoactive medications."

He did so even though the November 2015 Ventilator Allocation Guidelines published by his own task force and the NYS DOH specifically pointed out the shortage of competent operators for the ventilators then estimated to be needed (approx. 16,000) under a ""worst case scenario"".   News reports are that Cuomo now has unsued ventilators on hand, which will likely remain that way because of the said shortage and regardless of a future ""worst case scenario"".

His performance nevertheless  helped win him an Emmy.  Go figure."

2020-11-23 20:14,"I saw a lot of mention of doctors/specialists in this article. It isn't that they aren't an essential member of the healthcare team, because they are. 

What I didn't see a lot of was the mention of the critical role that critical care nurses play in the care of critically ill coronavirus patients. I saw the word ""nurses"" spelled out specifically once. Nor did I see ""respiratory therapist"" more than a few times. 

Critical care nurses are absolutely necessary to provide bedside physical care and patient therapeutic management, 24 hours a day, around the clock ""eyes on"" observation and intervention in response to patient needs. Physicians and mid level providers do the medical management and ordering the specific therapies for the patient, but are not the ones at the bedside giving the medications, observing the response to the treatments, watching the monitors that measure the vital signs of the patient, and intervening immediately to changes in condition. Nurses do this. Nurses are the eyes and ears of the doctors. Trained and experienced critical care nurses at the bedside are absolutely vital for the care of the very, very ill coronavirus patients that have complex therapies and can deteriorate in a very short time. 

Critical care nurses, and respiratory therapists that manage the ventilators breathing for the coronavirus patient, are absolutely essential in the pandemic, and deserve more than a cursory mention."

Contrary to the intentional false impression conjured up by many on these pages, the lack of Congressional action has not been exclusively the actions of McConnell and Senate Republicans.  There have been 2 parties doing this dance of doing nothing.

Both the Republicans and the Democrats have been intractable and uncompromising.  McConnell has refused to agree to more than his X amount of money give-aways.  Simultaneously, Pelosi and Schumer have refused to agree to less than their much, much larger Y amount of money give-aways.  

BOTH parties made the choice to do nothing rather than give way substantially in compromise.  Whatever harm that occurs as a result of the inaction will be due to the choice of both parties to be stubborn and uncompromising.

Trump inherited a strong and growing economy, so what did the Republicans do?  Institute a large, deficit-inducing tax cut, aimed mainly at the wealthy.  No wailing about the deficit, only crickets.
And here we are again - looming economic catastrophe, and Republicans wailing about the deficit again.

That shows you the rich GOP politicians don’t care about the 99 percent of Americans.  Make Trump the rich GOP supporters 71 million pay for this mess Trump got us into.

I’ve got US District Judges to confirm.” One recently confirmed Judge in Florida brings 8 whole years of experience to the Federal bench which makes her still eligible for a young lawyer’s discount on continuing education classes. Note: in the last 123 years the Senate had always ceased confirmation of judicial nominees of a defeated president with one exception - Stephen Breyer was confirmed after President Carter lost to Reagan. Breyer was chief counsel to the senate judiciary committee. McConnell and company (including all the so called moderates) have now confirmed numerous judges since November 3rd and are continuing to do so. My guess is they’ll keep voting until Biden’s hand hits that Bible. Then they’ll focus on denying Biden’s cabinet nominees a vote, shutting down the federal government and investigating Hunter."

2020-11-23 3:46,"The pandemic cuts two ways.

First cut was across trump’s bow of reelection and his bumbling response to the virus; he never stood a chance of resurrecting his reelection from the depths of pandemic mismanagement. 

The second cut will impact the democrats and now forces them to compromise and lower their expectations for economic relief and a more robust economy on 1/20/21. 

As has been said many times, the casualties of this pandemic are often more than the infection and death rates, but also include societal norms, wealth and standard of living.

This second cut though is also a consequence of Mitch McConnell’s efforts to undermine the new administration and flex his legislative muscles. Actions that should be remembered well by Biden and allowed to influence and be determinate of his next steps and actions."
2020-11-23 3:43,"Putting additional trillion dollars in circulation without equal value of products and services produced will cause additional debt, rise in interest rates and devaluation of currency.   While short term benefit is likely to occur, the only sure way to improve economic activity is to remove restrictions in place that are suffocating our economy.   Open up offices, restaurants, schools and places of entertainment and economic activity will  go up off the charts.

Trump and GOP will live in INFAMY for their SHAMEFUL behavior towards Americans during our times of need. 

Godspeed to the Biden-Harris team to help our nation"
2020-11-23 3:59,"Obviously forget the fantasy (which Biden surely never believed, but some of the masses wanted to hear) of working with Mitch. He’ll do all in his power to wreck Biden’s economy, so the Republicans in ‘22 and ‘24 can contrast worker poverty under Biden with “the greatest economy in world history under Trump.” Hard to see how the Republicans can lose with this plot, or how the Dems can avoid checkmate."

2020-11-23 4:08,"The Republican Party today has only one objective and that is to help white people hold onto political power despite the changing demographics in this country.

Like the Russians retreating from the Germans in WW2, the Republicans have adopted a Scorched Earth policy.

Republicans are willing to destroy our Constitutional Democracy before they are willing to see white people lose power.

Mitch McConnell’s only objective during Obama’s first term was to stop him from being re-elected.

And he considers the greatest moment in his political career to be when he told Obama that Obama was not going to name a justice to the SC to replace Scalia.

McConnell was fine with deficit spending as long as government was helping a Republican president like Trump.

Now that a Democrat will be president McConnell will suddenly become a deficit hawk and smugly lecture everyone on the dangers of government spending.

The only thing that will hold McConnell back from destroying the economy is if his corporate overlord on Wall Street start to lose money.

There is little reason to believe that Republicans will not take the same Scorched Earth approach to the economy under Biden as they took to our Constitutional system under Trump."
2020-11-23 4:09,"A deal just over 1.5 trillion was possible in October, Pelosi for political reasons decided that it would be over 2 trillions or nothing. If something had been agreed a month ago , money would already be flowing into state and struggling family bank accounts. I can’t believe Pelosi and Mitch are still going to be leaders of both parties in congress. Their incompetence is the reason nothing has been done to avoid a nightmare scenario for millions of families during the holidays"
2020-11-23 4:14,"We need a stimulus bill that reflects the items included in the $1.8 billion compromise proposal recommended by a bi-partisan center left and center right coalition in the House of Representatives.   It would include enhanced federal unemployment augmentation payments, a PPP program that only covers legitimate small business, funds to enhance school safety to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, money for state and local government first responders, public health systems and critical public infrastructure.  Those should be the current priorities and should exclude any changes to the tax system for now and funds to bail out state and local government pension plans which have heretofore been mismanaged and or underfunded."
2020-11-23 4:27,"I never agree with McConnell, but he is correct inasmuch as Pelosi's ""my way or the highway"" style of negotiating doomed a new stimulus package. For those of us that study and teach negotiation, her error is clear. It is called positional negotiating, deadlocking on price. She should have put the interests of needy families first, quickly doing a deal for unemployment and stimulus checks. Instead she proclaimed herself a masterful negotiator, while delivering nothing."
2020-11-23 4:32,"We can draw only one conclusion from Trump's and McConnell's dealings in the matter of a new stimulus package: they wish to leave the incoming administration with a deep recession on its hands and an economy that will take longer to recover. The distribution of new vaccines may hurry recovery, but we have no idea plans to distribute that vaccine (they're being kept secret from the incoming administration). I would guess equitable distribution is about as likely as equitable distribution of wealth (we will have a ""K-shaped"" recovery as well). With McConnell in charge, the Senate won't change the tax code, which guarantees deficits as far as the eye can see, quite aside from COVID-19 poverty."
2020-11-23 4:47,"When they fail to reach an agreement, and nothing happens again, because the parties never agree to anything, Americans will suffer more, and we will enter a full blown economic depression.This is what happens when a huge country has no social support network for its workers."

And the rich bigwigs keep denying a stimulus package for those in need.  The Republican Party is running true to form and we shouldn't be surprised, just disgusted."
2020-11-23 5:10,"It's likely Pelosi should have made a deal even at the risk of letting employer covid liability be minimized to get the deal. Now it would be in character for McConnell to whine about deficits, drag his feet, send the country into a depression, and blame it on Biden just as Trump warned, setting up the 2022 election for the Republican ""heros"" to comre in and save our future grandchildren from excess federal debt. The more things change the more they stay the same. Obama administration redux."
2020-11-23 5:15,"Both sides were awful for negotiating and play politics at the expense of the American people.

The Republicans, with their classically archaic approach to welfare, were strictly against most measures to assist the unemployed and working class but perfectly fine with more pro-corporate measures and increases to moral hazard.

Democrats, trying to force in tax cuts for wealthy zip codes and an elimination of deduction caps for well off and barely scratched citizens were engaging in their own blue-dyed version of trickle down economics. These would have done nothing for the average workers, who could not benefit from deduction cap removals. Additionally, Pelosi was obviously against stimulus checks to Americans as it would have granted a political favor to Trump. 

The time for political games is over. Sign something bi partisan, sign something for the people, and somebody tell both sides that trickle down economics do little than boost the asset prices for the already well-off."
2020-11-23 5:22,"Come on man. Get it together Biden. Dont listen to these hacks at Moody’s, the Hudson Institute, the Aspen Institute. Talk about republicanism and conservative remedies under the guise of Centrism and the cries of fanatical no name economist. These are the same Tools who got the economy all wrong and led us to the so-called Great Recession of 2008. We are in a Depression. This economy is wacked. We need heavy lifting FDR style. We need six trillion dollars to aid this economy and then another nine trillion over the next eighteen months. 

As of this day Biden should tell all states to spend what they have or borrow to give aid to individuals and small business until March 2021 when Biden and the congress can make the states whole again.The latest foot dragging by the GOP and Trump is to make the rest of us take our eye off the prize: control of the US Senate. The Georgia Senate races are the most important races to revive the  economy, defeat this Pandemic and rebuild this country. We Democrats must control the senate in order to carry this out. At this time agreeing to a lame bill will only help the GOP run the government.

Biden needs to think way outside the box. He has already selected his foreign policy team of neo-liberals that brought us horrible out comes in Egypt, Libya, Honduras, Turkey, and even Syria. Thats no surprise.We progressives gave Biden the landslide win and a domestic mandate to make real and courageous changes. Biden must be transitional."
2020-11-23 5:23,"It does not matter what or whether they agree to something, assuming Senator Yertle doesn’t snatch the football away at the last moment. Trump will never sign it. If the Dems agree to something lesser for now, and the Republicans break it, then the Republicans own it. If they do go through with it, needy people get something. I think there might be a poison pill in McConnell’s version, in which case they are right to steer clear."
2020-11-23 5:27,"A recession should be avoided at all costs. 

So the emergency bill to be passed during the lame-duck session should include a relief package that will keep private and public sector enterprises funded and the jobs that go with them until normal pre-pandemic activity can be restored. 

Of particular interest, infrastructure investments that have already been authorized but not funded should also be included to more broadly increase the nation's efficiency and capability to manufacture and distribute essential goods like food, household supplies, materials to continue home construction, and also include an extension of broadband communications so that we can have broader participation in the economy.  

Infrastructure investment should be an easy bi-partisan sell.

The global market has been slowed by this pandemic but the comparative advantage of the U.S. in agriculture, food processing plants, Interstate Highways, air cargo, and port terminals should be invested in. Logistics is the secret of a competitive economy and should be at full tilt to contribute to holding a good share of the global market.

I propose we invest one Billion dollars to begin immediate route planning in all States for an all-electric 300 mph, magnetically levitated guideway network that will carry both passengers and freight trucks that will save Americans about $1,000 annually per capita in reduced cost of goods sold and travel.  This will be a job creator in both construction and manufacturing."

That may seem like an exorbitant amount of money, but with companies at and approaching a valuation of one trillion dollars it's really just drops in a bucket.

Our country desperately needs another boost to avoid the hardships waiting to engulf our economy and ultimately everyone."

2020-11-23 6:37,"Everybody should know the main barrier to agreement on the stimulus bill.  The bought and paid for Republicans demand the bill should retain, in its entirety, the hold harmless provision which exempts employers from liability for damages due to unsafe working conditions during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. If the Democrats negotiate away the liability part, their bill’s provisions which fund local and state governments, and the foreclosure and eviction provisions, there will be nothing standing in the way of a massive recession.  And the virus will continue to rage against the American people.  This is a fine mess that we are in, and nobody holding office seems to care."
2020-11-23 6:39,"The surging Covid cases will force GOP-governed states to pressure the Senate for a deal. I am more hopeful now despite the duplicitous deficit diehards.

Before the elections, Democrats had little incentive as any deal would have inevitably allowed tRump to take credit. Given the small margins in several swing states, I'm glad Nancy Pelosi did not bend."
2020-11-23 7:28,"I voted for Biden Harris all the way. That being said, I saw what was going on; Pelosi was not going to hand Trump a win in any way shape or form before the election with that stimulus deal. Turns out it was a shrewd maneuver because the election in the electoral college was not that far apart when it came to the critical states.

I also suspect that Pelosi was hoping for at least a 50/50 Senate so that the lame duck would produce something close to what she wanted, with the some of the wind out of McConnell's sails. Worse came to worse, they could fix it after inauguration. 

But Mitch still has the Senate and I doubt the relief bill will  even be a trillion.

Like a lot of commentators here have already said McConnell and his wealthy fellow Republicans buddies could care less about people left out in the cold. And a Republican Senate will undermine Biden in the coming months just like they did Obama, setting the stage for 2022 and retaking the House.

However if you live in Georgia and are concerned about these developments, get out there and help organize the upcoming vote. If you live outside of Georgia, make a donation to the Democratic candidates (like I did). 

There's nothing more we can do now that the Pelosi gambit was played and the Senate part of it failed. The Dems will have to make a deal and hope that they can win Georgia and revisit it...  or it is going to be a long two years of Republican orchestrated chaos."

2020-11-23 8:40,The GOP's long-game effort to dismantle FDR's New Deal is not over. By withholding Covid financial aid to states and forcing them into bankruptcy courts (chock full of right-wing judges) state debt would be restructured to favor bondholders and wealthy creditors.  States would then be forced to gut public pensions and slash social services to repay that debt.

2020-11-23 10:18,"Pelosi played hardball and while Biden won, she failed to read the tea leaves and understand it was not a landslide.  As a result, she lost seats in the house and failed to pick up a majority in the senate.  She failed to cut a deal while she had leverage in order to inflict max damage on Trump and now she is more concerned with saving face then helping struggling Americans.  She can try to shift it, but the blame is on her for not taking the smaller deal earlier, especially when republicans blinked and came significantly higher.  Something was better than nothing."
2020-11-23 4:01,"I wrote this back in August and the two parties are still playing games with the American people’s lives. “ As the White House Democrats and Senate Republicans play their game of “chicken” on the streets of their egos, the American people laid off due to no fault of their own, are in turmoil, worried about eviction or paying their mortgage. What about food? Remember we were employed and not eligible for food stamps. We paid our utilities from our paycheck which we no longer receive due to no fault of our own. Meanwhile, back at the “bipartisan” circus, each party is waiting for the other party to swerve in their ongoing game of “chicken.”"
2020-11-23 4:29,"Obviously a much larger stimulus bill would be much better, but it is clear that McConnell and his caucus will never allow that during the lame duck session. Before the election Trump had trumpeted that he wanted an amount multiple times larger than McConnell's ""skinny bill"". But he never made the slightest attempt to twist any Republican arms then and now his time is devoted to being the self-pitying conspiracy-monger-in-chief when he's not playing golf. So Biden is right--half a loaf is better than none, especially when so many are starving."
2020-11-23 7:17,"This terrible situation was predictable, since the best opportunity to pass a decent aid package was just before the election, when Donald Trump was desperate to be seen taking action, and McConnell promised to bring anything the president supported to the Senate floor.

I wouldn't hold my breath for Trump and McConnell now."

But as Senate leader, he is in control of the legislation and Dems have no leverage to force him towards compromise. There's only one person who McConnell fears and that's Trump, with his army of radicals who can wreck havoc on any Republican Senator's popularity and chances for reelection. So, the way for Schumer and Pelosi to get a deal done is to eat crow and play nice with the outgoing president. There's a realistic chance for a compromise, if all the praise for it goes go the narcissist in the oval office, who must be desperate for some good news to deliver now. It would be annoying to hand him that PR success and endure his bragging, sure, but it can't hurt the election outcome anymore, and dozens of millions of Americans, who face a cold and worrysome holiday season, can't wait 'til next year.

Pelosi was working her political strategy while the citizens are still waiting are hurting even more going into far greater spikes of the virus.

    The guys running the computer algorithms are the only ones who know for sure, but I'd bet a big package of toilet paper that Biden didn't even get close to 60 million actual votes, and I'd believe something in the area of 48 million if the weather was good in Democrat-heavy states. 

    He never gave anyone an actual reason to vote FOR him.
However, Biden did a public service by NOT having a hundred thousand people at a time share each other's exhalations like the winner Trump did, and like Dem groups have done since. So that part made Biden look good. 

Hey, didn't you love the unauthorized questioner getting hustled out of the room at that recent Biden appearance?"
2020-11-23 10:43,Are we going to have another recession? Of course we are. Even without Covid-19 we were heading that way. Reagan passed a tax cut and we got the Reagan recovery followed by the Reagan recession. G.H.W. Bush signed a tax increase and the recession was mitigated and was followed by the Clinton years of a solid economy. G.W. Bush passed a tax cut and issued in the Great Recession. Obama mitigated the recession and brought about a slow recovery. Does anyone really think that Trump's tax cut was not going to create another recession?

There are other carrots that Biden can use loosen money from the grip of Trump and the wealthy republicans who diverted money set aside for times of economic hardship like every American is experiencing now.

The way to avoid it is to allow as many people the freedom to work as efficiently as possible. We do not need any more stimulus. There is too much money floating around and capacity constraints at businesses. What we need is the end of extended unemployment benefits, etc. so that the economy can readjust and people have an incentive to take on new jobs.

It is quite obvious that biz does not need immediate help since this administration is sending money back to congress that was designed to help biz. Let Mitch look like the Scrooge that he is.

I suspect Trump will want a full fiscal years worth of his priorities to be funded like more money for his border wall and ICE. Items that Pelosi and House Democrats won’t agree too. The impasse is likely to result in Trump refusing to sign stopgap measures to get passed January 20. I suspect this is more the reason why McConnell won’t even broach the subject of covid relief to the temper tantrum in chief for fear his wrath will wreak more havoc on the fragile majority in the Senate and a looming catastrophes government shutdown could mean over the Christmas holidays given all else that is going on.

Under Trump, McConnell and the GOP Senators had no concerns about deficits.  But under President Biden, McConnell will suddenly insist that deficit spending is evil.  Of course, he will also block any tax increases on the wealthy or large corporations.

This will make defeating COVID difficult, and will make any economic recovery very slow.

But to McConnnell, ensuring the failure of President Biden is the main point.  He did it before with President Obama.

This is like taking out a payday loan, which you have to pay back.  

In reality, the best place to put pressure for a deal is in Georgia.  The Democratic Senate candidates must pound on McConnell for his games, and they must tar the GOP senate candidates with the same brush.  It's not hard to paint them as patricians getting more than their fair share, profiting on the backs of workers, and kicking people to the curb.

Millions of people going without food or without a home during the winter probably isn't going to cut it.  More recent history, the first CARES Act, would indicate bipartisan action if and only if there is a stock market plunge.

Authoritarianism is not in Joe's or his probable-appointees' natures, but they may need to shift to what may be the new paradigm."

You're going to see a wave of bankruptcies and homelessness that is both harmful and preventable.  The Democrats have passed bills at $3.4 and $2.2 trillion.  The Republicans are offering $500 billion that can probably be gotten up to $1 trillion.  Pass what the Republicans will allow and then blame them when it proves inadequate, such as government workers getting laid off and government services being curtailed.

Most of the 2.2 trillion wouldn't go to citizens out of work, or businesses on the brink, but instead to local and state governments for decades of over-spending without accountability or outcomes.  

No doubt that both parties play politics, but the Republican offer went to the people, while the Democrat offer went to government.  Sounds like the Stimulus plan Obama approved; went to government administrators pension and benefit plans.  Are liberals and progressives so uninformed as to not even read the Pelosi 'plan?'

That would have cost what... 3/4 trillion. But the dems wanted ot make excuses; mainly that they want to bail out their area's which were indeed near bankruptcy before covid and make them whole usign covid as a means to rip off the american taxpayers (our children's debt). But that aside... they could care less about you 1200 dollar check; until biden comes into office; which they own thru slight of hand. If Trump where smarter and he send out a paper vote to every swinging person in the USA and said send it in; he might have won.  What the dems did is legal.

Like pelosi entering office by getting a dying patient to run and then when she died two months  after re-eleciton; enter pelosi.

2020-11-22 2:28,"The notion of a ""race"" for a vaccine raises serious questions when a brand-new technology, never tested before in humans, is fast-tracked for injection into potentially billions of healthy people without the rigorous trials of prior vaccines. The COVID-19 crisis is urgent, but it would be wiser to use a vaccine based on boring but tried-and-true technology--like inactivated virus--than pushing what amounts to a dangerous mass experiment without long-term safety and efficacy testing, and less than a year of human data in general.

To be clear, none among my family and friends are anti-vaxxer, most of us have doctorates and all of us and our kids and grandkids get our DTaP or Tdap. MMR, IPV, RV, HepB, Hib and other shots, but that's because the gauntlet of testing for these vaccines--most with a decade or more--has clearly established their safety and efficacy, across demographics and other variables, using well-established technology. None of us will be getting a rushed COVID vaccine esp. based on minimally tested mRNA delivery. Aside from the oft-stated ""unknown-unknowns"", there are too many unanswered questions about persistence of protein expression and potential for autoimmunity, interferon activation, recombination with viral nucleic acids, mutations and lack of tissue specificity.

""Moderna got nearly $2.5 billion to develop, manufacture and sell its vaccine to the federal government and teamed up with the National Institutes of Health on the scientific work, a highly successful partnership

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (government) told Moderna:

“Go for it. Whatever it costs, don’t worry about it.”

""Operation Warp Speed (government)- a collaboration between the Pentagon and the Department of Health and Human Services - is the brainchild of Dr. Peter Marks, the top (government) vaccine regulator for the Food and Drug Administration. 

Pfizer signed a $1.95 billion agreement in July to sell the federal government 100 million doses of its vaccine if it was successful, guaranteeing it a buyer, no small incentive.

 It also called on the Trump administration a few times to get access to manufacturing supplies.""

The pharmaceutical companies are important, of course, but it is the partnership between the government and the 'free-market' that helped developed a vaccine.

Just as is the case with the internet and many other things that the government helps develop but eventually winds up in the pockets of corporate shareholders.

This deep background of knowledge and technique made it possible to go from first detection of the SARS-Cov-2 virus to identification of the best targets for vaccines in a matter of weeks vs. months or years, and has guided and expedited development all along the way.  What's especially to be noted is that the accumulation of this knowledge depended on the sustained, healthy funding of *basic* scientific research -- into two viruses that had already been contained, and into new general molecular technologies -- that would have been deemed unneeded if funding were dictated entirely by practical needs and applications.  The success we are seeing with these SARS-Cov-2 vaccines is testimony to the huge value of basic, abstract, undirected scientific research.   Large cuts to such basic research have been proposed in recent years, but no better example exists to show that enacting these would be at our own peril."

Do you not see it?  It is a money grab marketing tool feeding off of the tax grabs handed the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries by Trump to establish what already exists - an Oligarchy. 

Trump revealed the true nature of a Capitalist system and in that we can take comfort for we, at least, have one minuscule chance to turn it around."
2020-11-22 7:25,"The vaccines from both companies have proven efficacious.

Trump's claims of credit are tenuous in both cases.    

But the Pfizer vaccine has less propinquity to Trump, and therefore I would prefer it."
2020-11-22 12:40,This is excellent however it definitely has a strong negative tone toward Trump. I prefer a bit less bias in a news story (even though I agree 100% with the remarks).
2020-11-22 7:54,I volunteered in a homeless shelter in my early twenties over Thanksgiving in Atlanta. I talked to a man asking why he was homeless and he showed me a dollar bill. I forget his story but his message was basically that the almighty dollar destroys. The predominantly men mentioned in this article are motivated by wealth. Sure there’s an undercurrent of science and altruism but the impetus to find a fast result here is to get rich or die trying. It’s an interesting paradox the role money plays for a man in a homeless shelter versus the head of a pharmaceutical company. I believe the industry is rushing to write the narrative. That Trump’s administration is the background should make everyone weary. I’m not planning to get a vaccine and usher caution with the race to the false finish line described in this article. Listen to the experts who are calling for more thorough testing.
2020-11-22 12:51,"While BioNTech was not part of Operation Warpspeed (the production line of Pfizer was, though, afaik) they did get a subsidy of 375 million EUR from the German government to enable them to concentrate on research. Other companys got similar grants.

Its really absurd how Trump claims this as a success for his policy."
2020-11-22 11:21,"It is comforting to know, in the midst of political madness and disinformation, that there were scientists dedicated to protecting the American people and the world. Scientific truth is a beautiful thing to behold. Bravo and thank you to all the scientists involved."
2020-11-22 10:52,It is important that the writers learn the difference between Efficacy and Effectiveness. The vaccines have shown to have about 95% efficacy and not 95% effectiveness.
2020-11-22 12:37,"“Pfizer decided it should drop that first benchmark and asked the F.D.A. to approve a new protocol on Oct. 29, effectively dashing Mr. Trump’s hopes of an announcement before Election Day”
If this hadn’t happened Trump would have surely won the election - through the electoral college - not the popular vote. We were so lucky!"
2020-11-22 12:18,Let’s hope it actually works . I predict it will only work in 55% to 68% of patients not 95% as stated.
2020-11-22 2:03,"This was a well-written, compelling narrative. My takeaway is that whatever the financial motives of these large companies, the partnership between the FDA, HHS and NIH, among others, and industry scientists has been incredibly conscientious  and focused. I applaud all of these private sector and government scientists for working so hard for the benefit of humanity. Outside of being a self-serving prod to get a vaccine before the election, Trump, it seems, deserves little credit for this achievement. I’m so grateful that dedicated science-first researchers remain in the US government, despite Trump’s efforts to purge them. I sincerely hope that the efficacy of these trials continues to be so high when these vaccines are widely deployed."
2020-11-22 14:19,"Thank you, NYT, for this excellent piece. The narrative quality made it a joy to read and I will use this article with my students and mentees to illustrate the power of science and the human good that comes from scientists working together."
2020-11-22 2:15,"Without science, there is no vaccine.  Without experts, no cure can exist.  I hope the 45% of Americans who demonize science and deride its practitioners will understand that you can't pick and choose ""which"" science you believe in, and which you don't.  Science either works as a method, or it doesn't.  Just like a vaccine, it has the power to save and transform lives and economies.  Like mathematics, it exists whether you're good at it or not.  Like physics, you can't evade its laws.

The stakes of this vaccine development are incredibly high; the stakes for the acknowledgement of objective reality, evidence supported by observation and data, and acceptance of expertise are just as high.  We may be vaccinated against Covid and survive, but if it's only a one-time encounter against the constant drumbeat of ""doubt"" or ""disbelief"" in science we will surely perish in the long run.  Indeed, there will be no ""long"" run for our species if we continue to live in alternate universes, welcome conspiracy theories into our lives, and legitimize ""alternative facts.""  Let's hope a successful Covid vaccination might not just save lives, but save our shared concept of reality too."
2020-11-22 0:35,"This is riveting. Having worked in vaccines for many years, this is one of the great achievements of modern science. What a fantastic
 Collaboration of scientists, the military, regulators and altruistic volunteers. Thank you all. Perhaps there is hope for mankind."
2020-11-22 2:50,"Moderna is a small company that has never manufactured or marketed anything.  Pfizer is a major multinational pharmaceutical company.

The Pfizer and Modern vaccines seem to be functionally identical, except that Moderna has developed a trick (patent pending) that permits greater stability without extreme cooling.  The extreme cooling for the Pfizer vaccine will make vaccine distribution very difficult.

The obvious solution is for Moderna to license its process to Pfizer, which will focus on manufacturing and marketing.  This will save thousands of lives in the US and abroad.
If this licensing and technology transfer is not done by January, it should be on the top of the agenda of the COVID taskforce under President Biden."
2020-11-22 7:41,Framing it as a for-profit race against each other rather than the virus makes me nervous. Maybe I’m reading this wrong but count me as a person who trusts science but is very worried about speed over accuracy. Especially when the Trump administration is behind it.
2020-11-22 14:39,"Great article and i noted in particular two things: first how Tony Fauci quietly helped and secondly how thin the data was. 

So out of 40,000 folks in each of the trials at both companies, about 100 got infected at each trial . That is 1/4 of 1 %. We are seeing 3-10% around the country. NYC closed schools at above 3%. I worked over 20 years in insurance and sat thru many actuarial meetings. The word noise was often used to describe any result less than 1-2%. Perhaps biostatistics is different but it is still statistics. If they got a thousand cases and only 50 were from the non placebo group i would be much more comfortable. Back in my insurance  days it was only my job, now it is my life and I am over 70 and plan on another 1/4 century of living."
2020-11-22 3:51,"What if the Virus Mutates?
Going into the fall, when our country had about 40,000 cases a day, I recall Dr.Fauci suggesting that we really needed to get our baseline down to 10,000 cases a day. Since then our cases have skyrocketed to 200,000 cases a day.

It occurs to me that this massive increase in spread drastically increases the chances that the virus could mutate. Is it possible that a mutation could make the vaccines ineffective or even useless?
If yes, shouldn't we be taking drastic action to reduce spread right now, not just to reduce the massive number of people getting sick and dying every day but also to make sure that the virus has less chance of changing before its confronted with the vaccines?"
2020-11-22 14:45,"We can thank Trump's mismanagement for accelerating the completion of the clinical trials. The clinical trials have to accrue enough cases of disease and the current third wave of COVID infections has provided those cases.
Now, we have to decide how to start vaccinating."
2020-11-22 15:04,"Someone, help me with this math.  Out of 40,000 people, do half get the vaccine and half the placebo? Then, wouldn’t the ratio be that 4 or 5 people out of 20,000 who received the vaccine contracted Covid -19. The ratio is not 4 out of 94 or 5 out of 95. The 90 who caught Covid taking a placebo, was out of 20,000 also. How exactly do they figure it is 95% effective? Isn’t it more like 99.975 effective?"
2020-11-22 13:44,"It is way too soon to determine if any allegedly safe and effective COVID-19 aka novel coronavirus-19 aka SARS-2 aka COV-SARS-2  vaccines involves any ' David' or ' 'Goliath.' 

COVID-19 presently clearly RNA knows far more about our DNA African primate ape host cells than we do about it.

 COVID-19 is neither benign nor malign in it's evolutionary fit be fruitful and multiply quest. COVID-19 is merely acting according to it's nature.

There is no science in economics nor politics.There are too many variables and unknowns to craft the double-blind and/or randomized controlled experimental tests that provide predictable and repeatable results that are the essence of science."
2020-11-22 14:55,"What were the participants in the vaccine trial told to do in their daily lives? Yes, these numbers are impressive, but what were the people doing in between getting injections? We all know by now that lifestyle choices are a huge factor in avoiding covid. My husband thinks they are told to follow CDC guidelines. Anyone in the know reading this?"
2020-11-22 13:36,Scientists that are immigrants or first generation citizens: part of the treatment against apathy and decadence. What a win for science.
2020-11-22 13:11,"All Trump had to do to stay in power, win re-election, was embrace the pandemic as his war to fight.  He could have made it into the “battle of our time”.  He could have gotten his supporters to embrace masks as the best way to prevent lockdowns and economic collapse.  He didn’t need the vaccine to help his re-election, he had plenty of tools under his control."
2020-11-22 14:14,"Forgive the cynic in me but the poster who wrote ""writers brought the correct tone to this drama"" has hit the nail on the head here. I can see the Netflix film in development : uniformed officers, federal agents on a train searching for vital piece of equipment (finding a bicycle pump) before it derails, others escorting a shipment cross country amid the threat of blockades by Deep State deviants... are those the only concrete examples of what $2.5 billion in support can buy? Eyes rolling. 
Only in America..."
2020-11-22 15:07,"Oh, God, I needed this story.  The unrelenting bad news about Trump and his deplorable followers trying to steal the election from Biden have made me depressed about the election results and fearful for the future when I should be happy and relieved.  This piece raised my spirits. There are good smart people in the world in competition to win the race for a Covid vaccine.  Despite the pressure, they did their jobs ethically and fast, with help from dedicated scientists in our government. At the end I was crying with Mr Bacal and his family.  Thank you , NYTimes."
2020-11-22 15:07,"By any reading of this narrative, the government was a big factor in the development of this vaccine. And at the top of that government, pushing for quick results, was Donald Trump. Give credit where it’s due."
2020-11-22 13:06,"This article makes the mistake of assuming that these two announcements indicate “winning a race”. This is wrong on two levels. 

Firstly the most important part is the vaccination, not the vaccine, and these two will have difficulties in this area. The extra cold refrigeration requirement for the Pfizer vaccine is a particular problem. The Oxford vaccine will be much cheaper and will be easier to store. The Chinese and Russian vaccines are essentially already in use. These two “hares” could easily be overtaken by “tortoises” in the next few months.

Secondly, there is room for more than two vaccines. We have a whole world to vaccinate. And I can even see a case where these two are applied in towns which have the refrigeration facilities and have people who are rich enough to pay for them. Other vaccines may be used in the countryside and in other countries.

So, not a great headline, and a terrible attitude."
2020-11-22 13:11,"As to the development of a vaccine so quickly, well done. But, what strikes me personally is that Pfizer had 52 Billion in profits so they didn't need  the 2 billion in gov't money as it "" wouldn't break them."" I pay over $100 per month for diabetes medicine and wonder how much of that is profit for the drug producer. That cost is after my insurance pays what it pays. I wonder if, like many drugs, it would be cheaper to get it from Canada."
2020-11-22 15:03,"A remarkable story. Would love to see a follow up including what happened at Oxford and JnJ and the others. 

If the world could do this with a hostile, anti-science president - imaging what we could do if we really worked together to solve climate change- a looming catastrophe that will make the pandemic look like a bad movie."
2020-11-22 7:33,"Such a massive win for medical science! Thank you for this insightful article, and especially thank you for the human element. It's one thing to read about raw numbers and facts, but another to understand the human ingenuity and emotion behind them. 

I foresee a movie in the future about the race for the coronavirus vaccine."
2020-11-22 15:30,"This breakthrough has as its antecedents basic work with mRNA decades ago.  It illustrates how much work needs to be done from discoveries in the lab to creating a medicine. It is unfortunate that these accomplishments, and possibly vaccine availability, are tainted by politics.  By example, with respect to slowing the trials, what are the data that certain minority groups have distinct  biology with respect to immune function, versus conditions where immunity is known to be impacted such as age, diabetes or lupus?"
2020-11-22 12:15,"In a year when bad news has happened at a numbing pace, and good news has seemed out of reach--we get this! What an inspiring human triumph. And, let it be noted, the writing team of Sharon LaFraniere, Katie Thomas, Noah Weiland, David Gelles, Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Denise Grady has turned out a well-paced factual account of this epic event that reads like a top novel."
2020-11-22 12:55,Thank you for this great reporting
2020-11-22 13:24,"Well, seemingly every country sees it different. The US, with an article on ""their"" company, hardly anything on the other startup, Biontech, located in Mainz, Germany and collaborating with Pfizer. In Germany most reports are about Biontech, founded and run by a couple of Turkish immigrants, he, son of a worker, she, daughter of a physician. And obviously à large part of Germans are happy as it shows the value of immigration, not so obvious after all the upheaval over immigrants in Germany after 2015."
2020-11-22 7:50,"Without the efforts of a husband and wife team of German-Turkish descent who live in a country that has torn down its walls and allows its scientists to share their achievements with the rest of the world, this ""American"" success story would not have been possible."
2020-11-22 16:26,BioNtech wasn’t sponsored by the Trump administration but by the German government. They supported the research with 375 Million €.
2020-11-22 14:25,"Until now, the only thing I knew about the vaccine was why Trump pushed it. He hates science. He couldn’t care less about the death and dying due to the coronavirus. All he wanted was winning the election and if he could announce there was a vaccine, that would make it happen. I vowed if the vaccine was deemed successful before Nov 3, I would not take the vaccine. Ah! Now I have hope again."
2020-11-22 15:21,How much of a cut is Trump getting? There's always an angle for him to get a piece of the action. It's not about saving lives with him. It's always been and always will be about $. Period.
2020-11-22 16:33,"Operation warp speed was brought to life by Trump and relentlessly promoted ever since implementation. When announced on May 15 when Trump announced there would be a vaccine by the end of the year, Trump was widely discredited. This paper avoids as much as possible to give Trump credit, but they can't deny it. When the vaccine is distributed he should be praised for saving millions of lives! I doubt this paper will do it!"
2020-11-22 15:26,"Feel good story that minimizes all vaccine efforts outside the borders of the US. Americans are good at story telling, and pretty cheap at $2.5 billion. Peanuts compared to the corporate welfare stimulus measures, for sure.
We'll see who ""won the race"" when my turn to get the vaccine,cand yours, comes up."
2020-11-22 16:30,"No thanks 'spin doctors'. 

The American people will wait for the official version of timing events and key timing decisions regarding vaccine development, releases and disclosures from a real investigation. This includes too much anti-Trump nonsense by way of omission - anything good has nothing to do with Trump, everything bad has everything to do with Trump. (Oh, by the way, the economy in January 2020 was actually the result of the Obama administration!)

The timing of the initial news, Nov. 9th, just 6 days after the election, and all decisions leading to that point, merits a real investigation - for documentation at minimum.

In any case, congratulations to vaccine makers and everyone involved for historic, outstanding accomplishments."
2020-11-22 15:32,"We all hope that Moderna's claimed achievements in the U.S. are real.

However, given the continuous mendacity of the Trump administration and its collaborators, I am much, much more inclined to trust Prizer,  BionTech and its German government sponsor."

Thank you for providing the world with quality, important journalism 👏"

2020-11-22 16:20,Is anyone else concerned about the possibility that these vaccines could have a grave affect on our DNA? Someone please let me know of the data that supports the safety of these. I want to be excited about them but I’m terrified!
2020-11-22 16:28,"It is heartwarming to realize that all the billions and billions of tax payer dollars that went into the initial and foundational research, that private industry would never touch because it was not immediately profitable, now come into play to help our country deal with this devastating pandemic.

It also is a stark reminder that every element in SpaceX’s recent launch, which will help develop our scientific research, and every single element of our smart phones, which also contribute to healthcare and research, were also completed funded by tax payers.

The incredible importance of tax payer funded (necessary because private business needs profits to function, whereas as a democratic government is there to provide services to the benefit of the American community) foundational research in every single American private business.

What is absolutely unconscionable is the con that big business spews that they alone innovate, while our government is clueless.  This thankless farce is killing our democracy and, ironically, our capitalism, because without decades and decades of our tax contributions to foundational research, private industry innovation would be impossible.

We paid for the research in the 1970s, ‘80s, ‘90s and before and after those decades that made these vaccines possible.  We need to be aware of that and own that, because these companies will, however they can, try to profit from this."
2020-11-22 10:02,"Why would they hold back the testing of this life saving vaccine based on the lack of certain minorities in  the test groups?  We are not talking about sickle cell anemia here or other racial idiosyncratic characteristics. We are talking about a group of human beings like all human beings.  If the vaccine worked for Moderna's test group it should work on everyone.   Do the pharmaceutical companies test their antibiotics or anti-depressants on all races and genders? 

Playing politics and political correctness could result in losing valuable time for everyone.  

Now, say what you want about Trump, he had the guts to go full tilt on Operation Warp Speed and not spare any expense whatsoever.   It's too bad that he didn't attack the suffering that the American people were going through with the same intensity.  He could have mandated national mask use.  He could have bought up all the food that the farmers were dumping and given it to the poor.  And, he could have encouraged the Republican Senators to work out a compromise with the Democrats on the pandemic unemployment.  That pandemic unemployment let people pay their rent or mortgages, pay their car payments, buy food and medicine and shelter in place safely.  It also let people shelter in place. 
It's too bad that Trump did so many great things for our country yet flushed his entire presidency down the drain over wearing a $2.49 mask.  Had he learned to work with the Democrats he could have easily avoided a lot of problems."

2020-11-22 16:36,"""Trump, it seems, deserves little credit for this achievement."" And just where were the Democrats? ""Trump, it seems, deserves little credit for this achievement."" And just where were the Democrats?"
2020-11-22 8:55,"This is what happens when science is allowed to direct the active seeking of remedies for disease. 
 All the protocols for pandemic response that had been thrown out could have been reproduced and used again if Trump had allowed his experts to do their jobs, instead of the whole process being soiled by the ignorant incompetence of the actions undertaken by Jared Kushner and his band of tyros.
 Donald Trump still does not understand that he could have been the hero of the whole story if he simply had followed the advice of the same people who enabled such a huge success in vaccine creation to direct his first actions fighting the pandemic in February, then stayed out of the way. He even could have been his usual lazy self and played golf.
 It still amazes me to see that Trump convinced so many that he was competent at running anything at all based on the fictional business setting he was merely acting a part in while appearing on The Apprentice.
 What an abject failure he's shown himself to be."
2020-11-22 14:27,"What I don't understand is how they know that the vaccine will be effective for at least a year.  Now we get flu shots once a year for the annual flu season.  If this was tested for less than a year, is there any surety that it will protect us for 12 months?  And is there a ""flu-season"" for COVID?  While there are spikes, it seems to be killing people year round."
2020-11-22 13:06,"This story confirms Dr. Fauci’s importance toward developing an effective vaccine.

Yet at campaign rallies Trump bathed in the adulation of supporters chanting “Fire Fauci”!

And Trump replied to the crowds that he just might do that after November 3rd.

A new science (technology if you want) has created a new method of neutralizing viruses. The private sector from ""Goliaths to Davids"" in concert with the vast resources and neutrality of governments, including the USA's, has done a marvelous job in creating what looks like an exit from the Covid pandemic.  And Trump is incapable of taking credit for a job well done and saying to Biden: ""Joe, we did the heavy lifting and  created a way out of the pandemic.  It is now time for you to mop it up."""

2020-11-22 10:12,"My state Victoria,a state in a capitalistic democratic free nation of Australia which is the size of the England and Scotland or the state of California, was the epicentre of Australia's second wave, accounting for more than 90% of its 905 deaths. The state capital, Melbourne, went into lockdown for 111 days - enforcing home confinement, travel and international travel restrictions and and closing stores, bars, restaurants, sporting venues, schools and some business. We have also by law required to wear masks for 126 days.  Now from Midnight tonight the state government is lifting the wearing of masks by law as it has done the job it was intended to do. This is what the health scientist experts told us we would have to do and it worked. Corona virus is a war, a social war and a scientific disease war that must be fought and a vaccine on its own is no magic bullet without a whole armory of measures to assist it and depending on a vaccine to cure all only dooms you to failure. Sure, you need your freedom, but from our experience it took only four months of determined discipline to over come the virus, without a vaccine.  Did you stop to think of not fighting when pearly harbor was attacked. No, you immediately went into action. The corona virus is the same, you all have to work to a plan to defeat it. Time to take the bitter pill as we did and adhere to the austeric measures and in time it will reap dividends for you. Then you can show how strong you can all be in adversity."

2020-11-22 15:55,"Our scientists have worked hard to develop a vaccine while Trump and friends continued to promote its spread with super-spreader events and misinformation.

Our physicians and hospitals work overtime to save lives. Meanwhile, Trump tells his base that doctors make lots of money by inflating the number of deaths. Doctors are part of a money making scheme.

Dr.Fauci and family receive threats due to the smear campaign started by the Trump administration.

On Nov 20, Senator Ron Johnson, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, held a Senate hearing to promote the benefits of hydroxychloroquine as a cure for COVID-19. Even though when Trump became ill with COVID he was treated with an experimental antibody therapy. If hydroxychloroquine was so ‘effective’ why didn’t Walter Reed doctors choose it instead of an experimental therapy ?

It is interesting that they want to promote disinformation even at this late stage. While others are hard at work ,actually trying to do something about this viral epidemic and save lives ,this administration still continues to deride the science by promoting disinformation and sow chaos.

But when ‘they’ get sick with COVID-19 .......they turn to the doctors they are so fond of ridiculing.

They don’t even believe what they have been promoting over the past 10 months ,why would anyone else? 

Trumps legacy: He did absolutely nothing to help win this war against COVID-19 and let history reflect that fact."

And what is it that the global pharma industry spends on R&D annually...

The question is rhetorical – it's well North of $100B...

And the annual NIH budget – just over $40B…

2020-11-22 16:47,"Thank you, this is incisive reporting and a great science story.

However, I would have hoped for more than a passing reference to the corruption - both real and intellectual - that big financial rewards may have damaged trust in these vaccines.

I smell lab rats dubious of the touted safety, especially after hundreds of millions of people are vaccinated.  2 trials in quick succession claiming 90 and 95 percent efficacy - by firms whose CEOs and executives quickly reaped valuation gains or sold stock, this should smell.  Borla, the CEO of Pfizer, immediately reaped his stock gains following his firm’s announcement and took the standard defensive of automatic stock sell orders.  Moncef Slaoui, on the board of Moderna till he was selected by Trump to lead the nation’s covid vaccine development effort, provided a $2.5 billion taxpayer investment for Moderna and saw its value soar to over $35 billion, making his options worth a king’s ransom.

Recall the casino scene from the movie, Casablanca, where a Nazi-sympathizing French captain expresses, “Shock! Shock!”, that there’s gambling going on in the premises. In the same breath while announcing Moderna’s success one should imagine Slaoui being handed his stock gains with the news, “Sir, your winnings.” 

Almost everything is political now thanks to Trump, his acolytes, and both sides of the political spectrum. Not shocked that I smell lab rats in the corridors of Trump’s kleptocratic vaccine initiative."

2020-11-22 2:20,"All this is wonderful and amazing. This being said, we also need to look at why the polio vaccine, which has proved to be effective for me (yes, that's a sample of one), has not hit radars.

Unfortunately, it's because the pharma industry so controls the narrative and the narrative that this old vaccine that is already readily available, just doesn't count. Which seems odd considering the polio vaccine scientists have been saying all summer that this vaccine will reduce covid or prevent it (and they talked all about that RNA, did they not?). 

So see what I'm saying here? Pharma is the lord of medical, over government, CDC, hospitals, doctors, etc. Government needs to take the reigns with strict, generous but fair, regulations pertaining to every patent issued. Like a yearly review/audit of the profit. This is how we will reign in pharma."
2020-11-22 13:44,"I do not trust the FDA and I am grateful Health Canada will determine the efficacy and safety of our vaccine and await my place in line. Like everything else in neoliberal America corruption seems to me the adjective to describe America from its tip to its toe.  It seems to me the FDA serves the Pharmaceutical industry not the people.
I suffer  from occasional muscle cramps and always had Quinine Sulphate at the ready. Quinine is one of the world's oldest and safest drugs and was sold over the counter for much of my life, the last time I purchased it it cost $10 for a thousand. It was available as a cramp reliever under the name Q'vel.
Suddenly I could no longer purchase it and my pharmacist and family physician explained to me that Quinine was no longer safe and Chloroquine was the drug for treating malaria and it was neither cheap nor a treatment for muscle cramps.
The stories of reactions to Quinine were bizarre and I was adamant to verify that people had their skin fall off and die in so many excruciating ways on a drug considered safer than aspirin over the centuries.
I could not find a single verifiable source that explained why I couldn't get Quinine or Q'vel except in my tonic water.
I let it ride until suddenly Chloroquine started every news cast several months and Chloroquine was the miracle cure for Covid and Q'vel disappeared from our collective history.
It is all anecdotal including my contacting Health Canada but everybody trusts the FDA except me."
2020-11-22 17:17,"It needs to be pointed out that much of the basic research that was needed to accomplish this task that will save millions of lives was done with US taxpayer dollars through basic science research encouraged by government agencies.  The US government will get NO financial reward for doing this.  

The same can be said for MANY other accomplishments that are products of modern science.  Yet, the profit-over-lives Republican Party and companies do NOT give credit to the government for this.  There needs to be systemic changes in how we run our society and it is not the Republican way.

2020-11-22 18:50,"Thanks for this inside look, reporters.

Couple of things bear emphasis: 
First, nearly every scientist in this story is an immigrant, excepting Dr. Türeci, who is the daughter of an immigrant. People opposed to immigration in any country should think long and hard about that.
Second, and relatedly, science is international; there is no American science, German science, Chinese science, etc., just science. Scientists move around the world fairly frequently, I myself worked for 5 years as a staff scientist in Germany before returning to the US. So there being so many immigrants in the story is not surprising. Few stories could better illustrate the benefit to everyone of the international nature of science than this one."
2020-11-22 18:56,"Where's the science here? What I read about is engineering, not science. Science would in a disinterested fashion explain everything about the coronavirus in a theory, that is an explanation of how the bug came to be and how it functions that would make precise predictions about the virus that could be used to falsify the theory. That is science. It does not make things, only theories. It is a form of philosophy. Engineering does not do that but instead tries to make products that function based usually on trial and error sometimes led by partial knowledge of how the organisms or other material objects or processes (electrons, planets, gyroscopes, circuits, gravity, human primates etc) function. Medicine is engineering and not science; there is no such thing as medical science. Degrees in medicine (including PhDs in medicine such as held by Dr. Ugur Sahin) are engineering degrees and the MD is an engineering technician. That is not to put down such degrees; the PhD in Electrical Engineering is as difficult as any degree in science (which does not include mathematics, either). The goals are different. If medicine were totally science-based it is unlikely there would be so many harmful drugs that were approved early, such as Nexium or Celebrex for two of the more  famous examples. It is also unlikely that we would have so many effective drugs that work well but that we do not completely understand physiologically."
2020-11-22 19:18,"The real story is in these two sentences. 

“ Mr. Bancel said Moderna then plugged that data into its computers and came up with the design for an mRNA vaccine. The entire process took two days. “

Creating a COVID vaccine is obviously a very big deal. Creating a tool for designing vaccines in two days is world changing.

I predict that mRNA technology will be as big a turning point in human history as the discovery of antibiotics.

The logistics are very impressive as well, and there are plenty of heroes but the success of mRNA technology overshadows everything.

I am looking forward to the book length version of this literally wonderful article."
2020-11-22 19:44,"I just had to comment on this story, a fantastic very personal story about American ingenuity and persistence at work. It thrilled me."
2020-11-22 17:14,"Still not clear, after reading the article:

Did the US government tell Moderna it had to delay its Phase III trial for three weeks, OR did it tell Moderna (correctly) that its Phase III trial results wouldn't be accepted in the US if Moderna didn't have more Black and Hispanic participants?

Big difference. 

If #2 (as it appears), the US government was simply facing reality: the US public won't accept a vaccine that hasn't been widely tested on people of color. Moderna's Phase III trial results might be impressive but Americans won't accept them if Moderna hasn't tested its vaccine on a large number of people of color. 

From the article, it sounds like Moderna agreed. It added many people of color as participants in its Phase III trials, and I'm glad it did. As it turned out, the Moderna vaccine works well on people of color, on old people, on men, on women, on every group. I for one wouldn't find Moderna's Phase III trial results all that impressive if, say, its vaccine were only 40% effective on people of color. But Moderna heeded the advice of the US government, added many people of color as participants, and was able to say that its vaccine works on people of color. Adding people of color as participants happened to take Moderna about 3 weeks, but nothing in the article suggests that the US government advised Moderna to shut down its  Phase III trial for 3 weeks (or at all) if Moderna could achieve that result in less time. 

Is the NYT misleading on this?"
2020-11-22 19:40,"This was a sensational article. It was riveting from beginning to end.

2020-11-22 19:59,"Anyone view the 60 Minutes 2 weeks ago with the US Military major displaying how they are up and running the moment the vaccine becomes available. They run daily worst case scenario‘s and then come up with resolutions. It’s very impressive. You can trust the US military to distribute the vaccine to every nook and cranny in the United States and US territories was the main point of the 60 minutes piece.  They even had the vaccine kits which includes the alcohol swab, the syringe, and the vial of the vaccine.￼￼. No excuse of missing parts etc. What to do if a big protest demonstration of anti vaxxers. The US MILITARY has employed professional hostage negotiators! No forcing ppl to take vaccine. Just info of why you should kind of thing. A Q&A session to anti vaxxers ( which was started by a scottish scientist who wanted to profit from his own making of a better child immunity vaccine- so he started defaming current vaccines cause autism...)"

2020-11-22 18:15,"Pfizer and Moderna need to write an outline guidebook￼￼ for all American public servants in the USA government.

The main thing is, keep focused on helping the American people. Throw your ego and personal ambitions out the window. It was refreshing to hear Pfizer wasn’t even focused on making profits, they were even ready to lose $2 billion!

But be concerned, Pfizer and Moderna only have released press releases about their vaccine. Not peer review submissions. No other scientific review panels. Just a press release about their product! That is very concerning. 

And also, Pfizer has several class action lawsuits about medical devices and therapies that they have released on the public the past 5 to 10 years. Now we  find has harmed or killed American people.￼￼￼ Eye fluid injections. Heart medications."

2020-11-22 18:32,"Love the mRNA technology.  Nothing from the virus itself is used other than a genome from its spike protein.  This is huge for today and whatever we face in the future.   

Since you can’t get the virus from the vaccine, I’m ready as soon as I can get it."
2020-11-22 17:41,"Dr. Slaoui was on Jake Tapper's show this morning, bemoaning the politicization which has led to many doubting whether to take the vaccine. But, Dr. Slaoui is part of the politicization, using the royal ""we"" to mean not just  Operation Warp Speed, but Pfizer, Moderna, BioNTech, and the entire scientific community. 

Slaoui inadvertently admitted that within the first ""two months,"" the basic vaccine had been developed - in other words, before Operation Warp Speed was started, the vaccine prototypes were finished. An Oxford University (not mentioned in the NYT article) scientist showed in a new Richard Engel documentary the sample of the vaccine developed in January.  And other published articles state that BioNTech had a prototype done in January within two weeks after China published the DNA of the virus (a fact omitted from the NYT article).

So basically, Slaoui (and Trump and many commentators) give credit to a vaccine developed before War Speed started, and mostly in Europe.
Indeed, the NYT article leaves out facts such as:

Germany provided a grant of ~ $500 million to BioNTech.

Sahin and Tureci are Turkish immigrants to Germany and indeed are Muslim (pointing out how Trump wanted to take credit of the work of Muslim scientists.)

No information as to the actual numbers of doses currently produced, purchased, and  ready to ship via UPS /FedEx. Sounds a lot like the numbers of test that would be ""available"" in the ""next two weeks."" 

Thank you non-US scientists."
2020-11-22 17:51,"Great reporting, NYT.  Thank you!"
2020-11-22 17:29,No amount of scientific verification will work.  Trumpites will be willing to get the vaccine only if Trump is credited with its development.  Anti-Trumpers will not take a vaccine rushed through by Trump for political and narcissistic reasons.
2020-11-22 19:04,"Thank you BioNTech, Pfizer and Moderna! I hope many people will be vaxxed quickly, and other vaccines developed on more mature and cheap technologies become widely available soon to eradicate this virus.."
2020-11-22 19:56,"Overall this is a great story. I'm even OK with Pfizer stock vesting schedules that Bourla had set up; if he had been allowed to modify the Put option he is put in a moral dilemma (i.e., what if the data had turned out badly and PFE had to write off billions? I'd rather Bourla not be able to modify his Put option at all at its pre-determined trigger than be tempted to lower the price trigger later). 
On the other hand, details regarding Moderna just seems rife with lack of corporate discipline. The chairman of MRNA should have recused himself or appointed a stand-in while such major conflict of interest existed with Op Warp Speed. Bancel's fragrant disregard for confidential data - the highest of sensitivity given the current situation and the potential effect on MRNA stock price - by immediately revealing the results to his wife is extremely unethical and unbecoming of a moral, disciplined CEO of a public company. 
I'm sorry - I don't trust any of the stability data or release criteria that Moderna has set up and will not be taking Moderna's vaccine. Definitely would take Pfizer's though once FDA deems the risk-benefit is sufficient for an emergency authorization."

2020-11-22 20:01,"Neither the Pfizer nor the Moderna vaccine will likely be either the best or the most effective one. We know very little about either vaccine. Both companies have engaged in headline science. The logistics required for the Pfizer vaccine (-70 deg.  storage temperature makes it very unlikely to have more than a small % of the world market and even a small% of the US market. The Moderna vaccine will have a very high cost of at least $30/shot. It also has low-temperature storage problems although not as severe as the Pfizer vaccine. Neither company has had a peer-review article on their vaccine published. Moderna has never brought a product to market and has never manufactured or published trial results or an article on any vaccine. We know little about the durability of their vaccines, i.e., how long do they remain effective and whether they provide sterilizing immunity, i.e, whether immunized individuals can get infected and pass COVID onto others while experiencing no COVID symptoms
themselves. We also know little about any possible long-term adverse effects of either vaccine While both companies may well provide a useful product neither is likely to supply either the United States or the rest of the world with the number of vaccines necessary to eradicate the COVID scourge. I recognize the need to provide hope in these dark times, but I, for one will wait to see peer-reviewed data and N.I.H. review before I roll up my shirt sleeve and get jabbed."

However unlike  technological products that successfully disrupted so many industries, the real success  for this one can only be claimed when the vaccine effectively works for the population. There is a time dimension to this, probably stemming from the logistics involved in trials, how much of this can be really time warped ....."

When the public interest is the primary motivation and not petty politics, America can be truly great."
2020-11-22 16:47,"Now the big challenge is before us: can millions of suspicious Americans be persuaded to get the vaccine? I can already hear the doubts: how come the vaccines are only 95% effective? What about the 5%? It's just too risky.

Let's hope the Biden Administration will recruit the nation's best marketing and PR minds to develop an extensive public service campaign across all media platforms explaining the vaccines and why everyone should get them as soon as they are available.

In fact, perhaps Joe Biden will channel FDR and conduct some broadcast fireside chats in which he talks directly to all of us to underscore the precious opportunity these vaccines offer us for a badly needed emotional restoration."

It’s common for different companies to have sales rights in different places.  What I don’t see much is where the vaccine will actually be made and how it will be divided around the world.
2020-11-22 18:41,"I was impressed with the resumes of both Dr. Slaoui and General Perna when I read about their appointments to run Operation Warp Speed previously. They both serve as great examples of government employees acting to solve a problem in an apolitical manner. This was one of the few initiatives by this administration that was able to avoid incompetent leadership. I’m also very excited that this new vaccine technology has emerged. Too bad the barriers of capitalism prevented it from being developed earlier, as Zika and the other diseases mentioned were not seen as enough of a threat to justify the expenditure."

Our ultra-expensive healthcare is ranked 27th in the world.  Their avoidable mistakes kill another 440,000 every year - they kill far more than they help and they charge for that.  

How well have they done on this Virus?  That's right, we have just about the worst deaths per million of any country.  

They've also been entirely incompetent with the fifty-year epidemic of chronic disease.

The media programs us to believe Pharma are heroes trying to save us, but the media is the propaganda arm of the status quo - remember weapons of mass destruction. 
Pharma is the actual WMD.

Did you know the top ten Pharmas have ""Marketing Expense"" as the top line-item expense?  Not R&D like they say.

So what about this Vaccine?  Has anyone looked at the actual FDA criteria for their amazing 95% success rate? 

The only non-binding criteria is to mitigate 11 mild cold-like symptoms — Not infection or serious symptoms.  Thus this so-called vaccine only mitigates mild symptoms after you get infected. 

It will not end the pandemic.

BioNTech, the German company that developed the mRNA bio-technology, has been supported from the start by the German Federal Government, most recently receiving nearly half a billion dollars for the Covid-19 vaccine. 

BioNTech shared half of a $745 billion grant with another leading edge German biotech company, CureVac. 

In addition German and European researchers are educated in government subsidized institutions, using computer technology developed with government funding, just like how all US post-graduate medical researchers are supported by NIH grants to institutions and individuals. 

Further, the financial risk of private companies such as Pfizer, Moderna, etc., is minimal as the US and other governments guarantee a market with a profit margin set by each company. 
Public funding and approval also limits any legal liability for the drug companies.

Also, the medical infrastructure in Germany is public, with a universal healthcare system, which is a direct subsidy of all German companies and part of the medical research infrastructure.

In 2004, Dr. Karikó and her long-time collaborator Dr. Drew Weissman (both faculties of Univ. Penn medical school) found a way to incorporate modified nucleosides into mRNA, so that it could be injected into the human body without being rejected by one’s own immune system.

Let's be clear: this isn't some line in the sand last stand for freedom and liberty.  It's a cynical and selfish indulgence in magical thinking by some at a cost of illness and death paid by others.  This is drunk driving at 75 mph down main street while swigging from a bottle of whisky.

There should be consequences such as being the lowest priority state for the limited supply of vaccines when it becomes available; no federal bailout dollars; no travel by South Dakotans to other states without testing and 10 day quarantines; no federal subsidization of hospitals or clinics.

New Mexico actually has more of a frontier philosophy, the belief that you work hard, but that when your hard-working neighbor needs a hand, you show up to lend it.

With Kristi Noem in South Dakota and Michelle Lujan Grisham in New Mexico you have a bit of a chicken-and-the-egg situation: is it more that the governors represent the fundamental beliefs of their constituents or is it their leadership (or lack thereof) that primarily creates the beliefs of their people?

I have no problem with those who want to go about business as usual, as long as they do it completely in their own space. However, we are one country, and unless Noem (and Trump) build a wall around South Dakota keeping all South Dakotans inside the state, what she is doing is arrogantly telling other people, those who will be infected by travelling South Dakotans, that their freedom, the freedom she loudly claims for her constituents, doesn't apply to them. Is Noem willing to defend the right of a Minnesotan to shoot an approaching South Dakotan who believes she or he is being assaulted with the virus, a deadly weapon?

Lujan Grisham has worked to unite the peoples and elements of one of the most diverse states into a coherent approach that serves the interests of all. Viral bleed over from lax Texas and Arizona makes her job that much harder."

New Mexico, with restrictions, has one-third the death rate, at .9 per 100K, and less than 73% of cases per 100K, at 102.9 per 100K.  These are the CDC's numbers.  Seems to me that restrictions work - and save lives.  Not sure why South Dakotans don't value that. You can define freedom in a lot of different ways.  South Dakota's idea about freedom seems self-defeating."
2020-11-21 21:16,"An astonishing contrast. I find myself furious and oddly envious that people can be so selfish. 

I’ve been quarantining for 9 months. Haven’t dined at a restaurant, haven’t seen my parents, visited friends, or gone on crucial work trips. My partner’s job as a bus driver requires them to come into contact with hundreds of people daily, many of whom refuse to wear masks in the small space. I don’t see others because it’s just a matter of time until they (and then I) to become infected. Every week we hold our breath for the test to come back negative.

It’s never been a question of what I feel safe doing and the risks I’m willing to take, but rather what I’m willing to do to endanger others. These people don’t seem to understand this, or care. I and so many others have put our lives on an excruciating hold, for months, only to watch helplessly as countless others enjoy dining out, attending parties, hugging, socializing. They think they’re only affecting themselves by taking the risks, but they only prolong the purgatory of those attempting to keep their families, friends- even strangers at the grocery store- safe, at great personal cost.

I am stuck staring at them as they enjoy the life I desperately wish we could all go back to SAFELY, as they nonchalantly accept the suffering and death they will cause. A part of me wishes I could bring myself to be so selfish and enjoy what they are that I miss so much. It is so painful knowing my efforts are undone by the selfish masses."
2020-11-21 21:19,"A comparison like this calls for some statistics to give an idea what difference it might make.

In both NM and SD, covid cases started spiking at the end of September, then started going vertical the second week of November (worldometer). So much for NM having an early warning of trouble.

You do find more cases if you test more. But to correct Trump, not testing doesn't mean there are no cases; it just means you don't know. So I looked at deaths from covid, which are less likely to be underestimated. NM covid deaths/100K pop is 61.6, SD is 76.4/100K pop. 

Ca started masking, social distancing in early March. The cases peaked in July and, as the rest of the country, is currently going vertical. Still, covid deaths here are 46.6/100K pop. Ca has a lot of commerce with Asia and Europe and there are densely packed urban areas. So it's likely that we have saved lives with our precautions.

It's tiresome being so careful, but the masking and social distancing is now second nature to me. I've figured out a work out routine outdoors or in my house to replace the gym. I still keep up with friends by email and phone. On Thanksgiving, my daughter will come for a big meat at noon outside on my deck. The temperature forecast is max 63' (it's Ca), so with warm clothes, a noon meal is possible. Then we'll be off for a long walk in the park. It's really not the end of the world to be careful. But, I just tell myself it could be the end of my world if I'm careless."

Stuck with a President, who plays golf rather than leads during this crisis and a GOP who does not govern,  we do not have a  national heath plan with long term economic help for business's like La Posta de Mesilla and others who must suffer the consequences.

We should ask the FBI and CIA to investigate. Meanwhile, wear a mask to save a job!!!"
2020-11-22 0:06,"What this seems to show is that it is almost impossible to contain the virus with district by district measures. It needs a national effort because the virus isn't aware of state or district boundaries. 

Of course until at least January 20 the only national message will be to ignore the risk."
2020-11-21 23:00,"Do those who worry that abiding by public health precautions follow laws? Do they have driver’s licenses? What’s their problem with trying to save their own and others’ lives?

Those who cherish their freedom to the point of ignoring public health precautions may find they have the freedom to die."
2020-11-21 22:42,"Is it time for South Dakota to make seat belts and motorcycle helmets voluntary in the interest of freedom? We need to ask that question directly to Kristi Noem at a press conference where she cannot dodge the question. I do not believe that South Dakota voters will miss the similarity of both seat belts and masks being necessary safety devices. If everyone in South Dakota wore a mask, then I bet that more businesses could stay open at larger capacities which save jobs. What is more important, actual jobs or symbolic acts of defiance?"
2020-11-21 23:56,"For those that do not believe in the virus and wearing masks to keep the level of infection low in a community, well, without mandates and penalties what can be done?
But the level of vitriol that is aimed at those that do wear masks, that I don't understand. Surely if they feel it's their Constitutional right not to wear a mask, why would they want to step on someone elses right to wear a mask? And be so angry at them for doing so.
There does not appear to be a lot of empathy exhibited currently."
2020-11-21 22:43,"Groupthink has taken over Trump’s Republican Party. Nixon extended the Vietnam War to gain re-election, a treasonous act, but how different is that to Trump downplaying COVID-19 and causing many more deaths than the Vietnam War? The real news isn’t about differing perspectives, the real news is how Trump’s COVID-19 [unnecessary] death toll compares to other countries with competent and coherent strategies. I wonder how many know how the US compares to countries such as Germany, Japan, Taiwan, etc. Certainly anyone in Trump’s groupthink is unaware."

2020-11-21 23:07,"I live in rural Washington state where masks are a continuing battle but most wear them.Many are not happy though. A friend went to Idaho hunting. No masks. Another to Arizona, no masks. The politics of the issue is killing many that didn't need to die. Thanks donald."
2020-11-21 23:04,"About 20 residents of South Dakota are dying of covid per day.  That's many times higher than the state's combat death rate during WW2, and it's almost certain to double, in entirely predictable ways, over the next few weeks.

The general insensibility of so many South Dakotans (not coincidentally overwhelmingly Republican voters) to the death and suffering of others is appalling.  But not surprising.  Its great-grandaddy, ideologically speaking, is the attitude of white supremacists to their black slaves.  Its cousin is the indifference to the mass deaths of foreign others in American wars, Vietnam, Iraq, as a consequence of ""tough"" American foreign policy.  It's also not coincidental that deaths in South Dakota now are disproportionately among the state's native Americans and people of color.  Perhaps it was inevitable that the day would come when Americans read of the needless, senseless deaths of thousands of their fellow Americans, in their own town and the next city over, and shrugged and went shopping."
2020-11-21 22:41,"Any Governor, Mayor, or person who refuses to wear a mask in public, is despicable.  The reason for that statement is the fact that this virus is killing mostly older people over the age of 60, of which many of us are.  My mother is almost 100, and between my sister, and I, we have been taking care of her in our two homes.  There is no vaccine, and most people of a very old age, also have some dementia, and wouldn't understand what was happening to them if they got the virus in a nursing home, died there, and couldn't have any visitors.   If you don't care about others, in my opinion, you don't care, period.  My elderly mother comes from a Swiss Anabaptist Mennonite background, where the people were known for their character, humility, and simplicity, etc., something that is sorely lacking in too many people in this country, and its politicians."
2020-11-21 23:06,Did you ever notice that the people saying that being told to wear a mask is comforming are the same ones who want NFL players to conform to a flag? False patriots want only to conform their beliefs.
2020-11-22 0:37,"Please don’t make generalizations about South Dakotans.  There are some of us who are trying our best to use our independence in responsible, unselfish ways.  I mask EVERY TIME I go to the store.  I’ve eaten at one restaurant since March and won’t be going back to that restaurant after the pandemic is over due to their careless approach.  Spiritually is very important to me.  I don’t go to church on Sunday...too many people...not enough masks.  I work at a residential mental health facility.  I wear a mask for my clients, their families, my 90  year old mother, my kids, my grandkids, my neighbors, my friends & their families and people I don’t know.  My sister is a teacher, wears a mask, and had such a reaction from constantly disinfecting items in her classroom she required steroids to get it under control.  My nieces are home-schooling their children because of the lack of precautions in place in the schools.  We’re not all selfish and ignorant out here.  Some of us are swimming against the current and will continue to do so.  I’d appreciate your support and you can count on mine!"
2020-11-22 0:36,"I live in South Korea and what they do here makes sense. If you're out in public you have to wear a mask, it is mandatory, and if you don't you get fined. There are no social distancing rules, and businesses are not closed. If you choose to ride the metro its going to get crowded, but that's life in Korea. You can eat in a restaurant if you choose, you just have to sign in for virus tracing. You can go shopping to your favorite market, kids are going to school, families visit each other. People go about their daily lives without any guilt or defiance. The other day I visited a museum and it was full of couples holding hands, kids running around, older people admiring the displays. It was nice. 
When I read how people are handling the virus in the states it's shocking and senseless."

2020-11-22 0:31,"The mean behaviour staggers me from people who profess Christianity.

The question for all of us is that when it is all over, whether the lives are worth the jobs. 

I wish this article had touched more on the experience of death from those in Dakota. Have relatives died and they still think their freedom was worth the price? Or is the death rate too low for that question to come up. What is their calculus of deaths vs jobs, and what would it take for them to change their minds?"
2020-11-22 0:34,"Let's allocate the vaccines as an inverse to the requirement to wear a mask.  Let South Dakota be last on the list to get vaccines.

Apparently there is no problem with Covid in South Dakota so they will not need the vaccine."
2020-11-21 23:39,"The Trump virus probably has about another 9 months or so to run it's course. Unless you refuse to get the vaccine. Then, good luck with that. For the rest of us there is lot's of light at the end of the tunnel. I just hope all the small businesses can ride it out. Support them when you can. Most of all, support the food banks. Too many adults and children are going to bed hungry. I think you can get about 20 small turkeys for 200 bucks and you can have them delivered straight to the food banks."
2020-11-22 0:06,According to IMHE projections by February S. Dakota and New Mexico will be in parity with respect to total deaths/100000.  After February New Mexico is projected to have more deaths per capita than S. Dakota.   So y'all tell me is the destruction of New Mexico's economy with all the associated misery worth it?  If I'm the Governor of S. Dakota I don't change a thing based on these projections.
2020-11-21 22:38,"There are NOT two realities.  It is just a disease,, it is not political.  Do you hear me Noem?.  If you wish to exercise your personal freedom,, I agree,, no doctors or nurses will wear a mask in your operating room. Good luck with that.  They do not even have to scrub in. Those who make it political are just plain not dealing with a full deck of cards.  It is a disease.   Masks work.  The debate is simple,, your mask protects me, and my mask protects you.  My mask slightly protects me,, the real benefit is, my mask protects you. It is a matter of mutual respect.  If you enter a restaurant and want to spit in my soup,,, I'll show you how to paint a wall.  You hold the brush like this,,,

The difference in how the pandemic is approached is perfectly clear.  Per population North Dakota and South Dakota have THREE times more cases to deal with.    30,000 cases per million in Michigan,, and 90,000 cases per million in the Dakotas.  That is exactly the difference between masks and no masks. Three times as many infections, three times as many deaths."
2020-11-21 22:58,"“Some people just don’t care,” said 8-year-old Nolan.  Pretty much sums up the mind set of those who refuse to wear a mask.  Compare the astute observation of an 8 year old vs the ignorance of an evangelical Bible studying adult.  Ms Howe refuses to wear a mask and sees wearing one as selling ones soul. I have only one question.  Just what is in that book you are studying?"
2020-11-21 22:58,"Governor Lujan Grisham was on top of things in New Mexico when the Covid-19 virus spread began. She communicated clearly to New Mexicans that we all needed to wear masks, keep the 6-foot distance between us and held regular press conferences featuring our state health officials. Testing availability has been good but personal protective equipment (true of all states) was hard to get early on but improved in time--a fault I blame on lack of federal coordination and response.

However, by early summer, businesses were really suffering here in New Mexico; with that Gov. Lujan Grisham seemingly gave in to business interests in several areas of our economy and opened things up again.

 By July 30th the governor's official order mandated that ""...all New Mexicans should be staying in their homes for all but the most essential activities and services"". However, I was appalled to read that ""essential"" still allowed travel into (with a self-regulated 14-day mandated quarantine) and out of New Mexico to appease our huge tourist industry; you could have your dog groomed, your hair cut, go on a rafting trip, along with other ""essential"" activities which I felt were not in keeping with the order to remain home. I wrote to her to say I disagreed with this leniency. I never heard back.

Since October, New Mexico has had a horrific increase in Covid-19 cases & deaths and now the governor has again imposed restrictive measures--too late in my opinion. 
And she's not alone. 

Get tough!"

2020-11-22 1:18,"“You wouldn’t even know there’s a pandemic going on,” said Heidi Haugan, a mother of four young children in Sioux Falls, South Dakota’s biggest city.""

That is until a family member or friend or neighbor falls ill, goes to the ICU, dies. Apparently that's what it will take for Heidi to care. Maybe.

I grew up in South Dakota. I don't know what to make of the trance so many of its residents are under now. I hope they come to their senses soon."
2020-11-21 22:54,"I guess South Dakota is what's wrong with Kansas, as it is in rural Maine (previous week's story about voting for Susan Collins) and all the other red states..."
2020-11-21 22:51,"""Dinking the Kool-Aid"" is understatement, in the present context. Jonestown was not this bad. Jones didn't deep-six democracy, or sadistically refuse to help others. The members of his cult didn't get other people sick or dead. Didn't fill up all of their own hospital beds. Didn't fill up the hospital beds in other states that are behaving responsibly. Didn't get doctors and nurses sick or dead. Didn't let their neighbors, family members and friends needlessly get sick or die."
2020-11-21 23:54,I am glad so many in these red states value personal freedom. Strange though that this apparently does not cover the right not to be infected and killed by others.
2020-11-22 0:04,"The willful fools who refuse to wear masks and keep a safe distance from others because it's their ""right"" and no government is gonna' tell them what to do are endangering everyone else -- mask wearers and anti-maskers alike.

I'll admit to thinking uncharitable thoughts about whether thy live or die -- I don't care. 
That's what we've come to: They don't care about me and now I don't care about them.

America the beautiful in the age of Trump/Republicanism.
Oh, what we once were. 
Oh, what we have become."
2020-11-21 23:24,South Dakota’s 7 day per capita death rate is 3 tikes that of New Mexico.  Seems a relevant comparison between right wing lunacy and science based public policy.
2020-11-21 23:30,"Here in KY we are taking a middle of the road approach and I’m of the opinion that it’s the right way to go about it. We wear masks, have social distancing, and capacity limits, but other than that life has been pretty normal. We eat inside restaurants a couple of times a week as we always have. 

Do I want to be like Florida where there are no masks or capacity limits? Heck no. But at the same time I’m not going to hide in my house like the rest of you. I will accept reasonable restrictions and continue on with my life."
2020-11-21 23:54,"There are those who believe in science and there are those who believe in Trump and Fox News.

Charles Darwin was right.  This is survival of the fittest.  In the case of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is the survival of those who are the most mentally fit versus those who let others think for them, the ""mega dittos"" portion of our society.

It is the mentally unfit who will continue to allow this virus to propagate long after vaccines and therapeutics are developed.  In their minds, why get vaccinated for a hoax?  Their ""dear leader"" told them it has gone away."
2020-11-22 0:04,"What happened to caring for fellow Americans?

Governor Newsom and a bunch of politicians ( Democrats) from California and Washington state are either here now or will be here soon on a junket staying at the Fremont in Wailea Maui Hawaii,

About a hundred are already protecting on the beach .

Hawaii with the highest unemployment for the last two months in the country ,full blown pandemic and this is how they act? 

Where is their self respect? ICongress is on vacation again will be back December 1st for 15 days till Christmas Vacation."
2020-11-21 23:38,"""Some people just don't care.""

When an 8 year-old can call out your entire philosophy that completely in just 5 words, it shows how morally bankrupt and selfish the conservative people in places like SD truly are."
2020-11-21 23:29,"Anti-maskers are also probably anti-vaxxers, or at least they most likely make up a sizable portion. However, if you are an anti-masker but plan to get the vaccine, I think you should automatically have to go to the back of the line and wait until every last mask-wearing person gets it first. I don’t want to have to wait while these degenerates get first dibs when they can’t be bothered to wear a freaking mask right now. 

Each day my filter wears down a little bit more such that I have zero patience or sympathy for Trumpers, anti-maskers and the rest of the moronic cult members. I think it shows a startling lack of character or morals if you follow that charlatan. And I have no problem cutting off anyone who does, family or not."
2020-11-21 23:22,"If you read the blurb under the photo you would know that the Haugan family is taking the pandemic seriously, unlike most of the rest of that deluded state. That is what she was saying. 

Also, this is what you get when you elect a beauty queen (Noem) instead of a competent individual."
2020-11-22 1:53,"The authors write, ""Hospitalization rates in South Dakota have been the highest in the nation, but a conservative frontier philosophy dominates the state’s approach.""

New Mexico actually has more of a frontier philosophy, the belief that you work hard, but that when your hard-working neighbor needs a hand, you show up to lend it.

With Kristi Noem in South Dakota and Michelle Lujan Grisham in New Mexico you have a chicken-and-the-egg situation: is it more that the governors represent the fundamental beliefs of their constituents or is it their leadership (or lack thereof) that creates the beliefs of their people?

I have no problem with those who want to go about business as usual, if they do it in their own space. However, we are one country, and unless Noem builds a wall around her state keeping all South Dakotans within, what she is doing is arrogantly telling other people, those who will be infected by travelling South Dakotans, that their freedom, the freedom she loudly claims for her constituents, doesn't apply to them. Is Noem willing to defend the right of a Minnesotan to shoot an approaching South Dakotan who believes she or he is being assaulted with a deadly weapon, the virus?

Lujan Grisham has worked to unite the peoples and elements of one of our most diverse states into a coherent approach that serves the interests of all. Viral spillover from a very lax Texas, especially El Paso, and Arizona makes her job much harder. To her credit, she takes responsibility."
2020-11-22 1:51,"New Mexico's COVID-19 cases have changed their dynamics greatly over time. Originally, much of it was in the northwest counties heavily populated by First Nations (Navajo, Pueblo, and Apache peoples primarily), whose cultures often keep multiple generations living together and who  --  especially the Navajo  --  often have limited, if any, access to running water and easily accessible food supplies.

More recently, the totally out-of-control situation in El Paso, Texas, has spawned many cases in New Mexico's adjacent south-east counties. Also, given that Texas' Governor Abbott is essentially Noem-lite when it comes to responsibility to lead in fighting the pandemic, New Mexico is now also picking up lots of cases from the fact that the bi-state Permian Basin oil workers have no effective border.

I will leave it to others to describe how things have played out in South Dakota."
2020-11-22 1:49,"Allison Byington chose Trump and mask defiance over her own mother - such is the callousness of those who believe that refusing to take simple measures to protect others, even your own family, is somehow patriotic. Never mind that ""her decision"" could lead to the death of her mother or sister. She has set her priorities: choice over mom? Choice wins."
2020-11-22 2:51,"If some good souls could e-mail this article to every church in South Dakota and to every hotel and motel front desk, and to every restaurant, we might get somewhere!"
2020-11-21 22:46,"Really, a woman who won't even don a mask when visiting her mom? She wouldn't honor such a simple request for her own mother? Jeez. 

Some South Dakotans -- those who deny Covid is real even as it sends them to their graves -- prove in large numbers that denial/defiance = death. Yet many of their neighbors STILL refuse to modify their behavior, as if they want a Darwin Award of their own.
Well, you know what they say -- adapt or die.

I have endless sympathy for people who accept science and take all precautions, only to have their burden multiplied by idiots who put themselves and others at risk, and add insult to injury by acting as if they deserve a badge of honor for their stupidity and selfishness.  

America really is two countries. One of them looks to be engaged in its own suicide pact."
2020-11-22 3:42,"I live in Las Cruces and while this lockdown is hard on everyone, I appreciate that the governor cares about the lives of all New Mexicans. Some might argue that lockdowns hurt the economy, and they'd be right, but what's an economy when its workers die, when its consumers die, when it's business owners die? 

One thing this article did not explain is that Las Cruces is just 45 fast freeway miles from El Paso. Because TX, and particularly El Paso, has been inconsistent in attacking Covid we, their close neighbors, are also paying the price. It does not take long for Covid to drive north on I-25 to Albuquerque, Sanda Fe, and Taos, or west on I-10 to Deming, Lordsburg, and Tucson, AZ."
2020-11-22 13:20,"This article tells leaves the most important data out.

While the rate of infection in South Dakota is mentioned even though no numbers were given, the case fatality rate is not. Nor is that data point mentioned for New Mexico.

This is critical because it would tell us whether extreme shut down measures were effective in saving lives.

We know that at a national level 98.5% of those infected recover. We also know that the most vulnerable are the elderly with low functioning immune systems and comorbidity factors like heart disease.

Recently the CDC advised that schools should be kept open. The data also tells us that wearing masks is at best marginally effective in preventing the spread of the virus.

Yet, despite this data our political leaders have only come up with an either, or approach to public health policy. We are open with few restrictions or closed and our economy collapses.

An in between policy seems the most rational. Protect the elderly, especially those in institutional care but allow the average healthy worker to return to work with reasonable social distance rules.

Schools can and should be open. Most work places can easily function with modest social distancing. Closed ventilation systems can be retrofitted to allow for more fresh air, and we should note that effective treatment protocols have improved considerably since the virus started.

Is it too much to ask that political leaders exercise common sense rational leadership?"
2020-11-22 12:58,"As a critical care registered nurse who has cared directly for patients with covid 19, I find this tale of two cities so frustrating.  What hurts so badly is not the ignorance and selfishness of the people who don't want to wear masks, nor the fact that even with the spike in hospitalizations South Dakota doesn't want to do a thing to slow the spread of the virus.  What drains me most is the lack of a national response.  This article demonstrates perfectly the hodge podged response we have taken as a nation, with little direction and incredible anti-science rhetoric  from the top.  The absolute stupidity with how this has been handled will be the legacy of the outgoing administration, and in my opinion it can't get out soon enough."
2020-11-22 12:30,"Your freedom to let yourself get sick or sicken others should not be more important than my freedom to stay well by doing the things proven to increase my chances of that. My problem is that there are no constraints on your ability to sicken me short of an acknowledgement of the common good and a willingness for both of us to participate in it.   This is a situation where we all must participate in order to end it. E pluribus unum, my fellow citizens!"
2020-11-22 13:30,"I can understand  the need to  demonize the South Dakota response to COVID but the reality is that the  number of new cases peaked 10 days ago  and has been decline since. Some of the spike in new cases was from visitors from Minnesota, escaping the draconian measures of Governor Walz. As South Dakota is next to  the hotspot Minnesota ( still with over 6,000 new cases yesterday)  it is logical to assume that South Dakota’s recent spike in cases has little to do with the current open economy and everything to do with close proximity to the ongoing disaster of Minnesota COVID management.
 It now appears that the South Dakota nurse  whose story of COVID denying patients going to their deaths may not have attended to any patient dying from COVID; even her possible exposure to COVID patients  would have been on part time shifts with little is any COVID patient contact."
2020-11-22 5:54,"There is a false dichotomy around health vs the economy. If we had had any semblance of an adult in charge in the White House, a coherent national plan, and mature responsible role models, we could have unified for the good of the country, largely beat this AND bounced back economically (and rinse and repeat for the second wave as Europe is doing now). Instead, the Biden team is essentially starting over, 250,000 lives later. And we all will have to spend much more $$$ to fix this utter train wreck!"
2020-11-22 13:20,"I own land in South Dakota, the homestead of my pioneer heritage.  The capital city, Pierre, is 13,000 people.  Most are farmers. They are on their own farm interacting only with their own families and a few neighbors.  They see more people on Sunday at church.  Yes, there's a bit of tourism over in the Black Hills area.  Sometimes rich hunters fly in to shoot grouse."
2020-11-22 13:10,So what the rule is in South Dakota is that harming another is not any reason to curb what one feels is freedom. No reason to mind speed limits or seat belt laws or whether you should drink or drive or use drugs or sell them to others. If any of these laws or precautions make sense then precautions to stem the spread of this virus make sense. Seems that there is not much common sense in South Dakota starting with its leadership. The rest of the country is suffering for it.
2020-11-22 10:26,"Well, this entire pandemic has been marked by the lack of critical thinking about the problem and the kind of political action required.

Political leaders have the mistaken idea that they must  do something, anything, with respect to every situation that grabs the public’s eye. Here, an early on Oval Office address to the country to inform the public of the virus and its effects and a clear statement of the implications of adopting shut downs that could cause unemployment, massive economic loss in order to possibly and immediately save the most vulnerable would have been helpful. With a statement also of the things the government will do to meet the challenge.

Unfortunately, by allowing political non-leaders like Tony Fauci, to weave excessively outside his epidemiologist lane, in my view, led to mob-invented panicked decision making as one new statement caught the public eye after another without regard to critically analyzing the effect.

In hindsight, it seems clear to me that no lockdowns should have ever been imposed on the American people, rather, we should have been informed of the problem, given the best information available on how to slow the spread of the virus and allowed, as adults, to conduct ourselves accordingly. 

We are capable Americans, not hopelessly incapable citizens of a dictatorial country. Witness the failures in California and New York; dictatorial decision making and of course, the hypocrisy of leaders who don’t follow their own dictates."

2020-11-22 6:40,"This is an interesting comparison, but it's hampered by the failure to recognize the ""two New Mexicos"" in which we live. Areas dependent on oil and gas, cattle ranching, and private and public prisons for their economic well-being are very different from those relying on tourism, technology transfer from national labs, and scientific research.

Doña Ana, Luna, Otero, Sierra, and other counties in southern New Mexico are politically conservative and have actively resisted the governor's actions to ""flatten the curve"" to prevent community spread of Covid-19. The northern part of the state, politically ""blue"", has been more supportive of the governor's policies 

Covid-19 hit the Navajo reservation in New Mexico early and very hard. The hardest hit areas now are those that resisted the mask mandate -- and calls for social distancing -- largely along political lines. Once community spread began, though, it took off exponentially and overwhelmed throughout the state - a picture of epidemiological reality with a very contagious pathogen. 

More could have been done here in explaining the nature of New Mexico's population and politics. Governor Michelle Lujan-Grisham has done a tremendous job of managing the pandemic, and the current ""shutdown"" is not resented or protested by much of the state. To feature the one area that really doesn't support her policies seems to leave an inaccurate picture of the whole."

Originally, much of it was in the northwest counties heavily populated by First Nations peoples (Navajo, Pueblo, and Apache primarily), whose culture values multiple generations living together and who  --  especially the Navajo  --  often have limited, if any, access to running water and easily accessible food supplies.

More recently, the totally out-of-control situation in El Paso, Texas, has spawned many cases in New Mexico's adjacent southeat counties. Reliable statistics are clearly hard to come by, but El Paso's problem and, consequently, that of the Las Cruces is undoubtedly exacerbated by the many people traveling daily back and forth to and from Juarez. 

I wonder if that contributed to the unfortunate loss of Torres Small.

Also, inasmuch as there is no effective dividing line in the Permian Basin, Texas' irresponsibility spills over to the New Mexico side of the oil patch which, I expect, is why Carlsbad, Hobbs, and Roswell are suffering.

The initial and current outbreaks are disproportionately focused in opposite corners of the state.

I will leave it to other to describe how things have played out in South Dakota."

If they’re smart, maybe they learn something."
2020-11-22 14:52,"There is a fascinating natural experiment going on here, which no internal review board ever would have approved. I am interested to see matched case studies between blue and red areas of similar population density over the next 5-10 years, which will allow us to assess how effective pandemic mitigation policies were, and what they cost. 
Some things to consider will be: direct virus deaths, deaths of despair (overdose, suicide, etc.), employment by group (education, skill, gender, age, field), small business loss and growth, educational outcomes by group (age, race, SES), many more."
2020-11-22 14:38,"As an American living abroad and over age 50, I have spent much of the time since last March quarantining. I have watched, in horror, at how so many in my home country behave.
My grandmother grew up near Valentine, Nebraska, just south of the SD border. I grew up hearing her stories of being a child during the 1918 pandemic on a Homestead Act ranch and her and my grandfather's lives, sacrifices and efforts supporting the country during WWII while raising a child in New England. Until her death in 2003 she, by simply living her deep and decent convictions, modeled to me a lifetime of how to support the common good of one's community with kindness, safety and care for one another and yet be fully independent and self-sufficient. I can't stop thinking how disappointed and dismayed she would be to see how many citizens behave the US in 2020. My constant worry for our loved ones and friends in the US is increasing to off-the-chart levels and I am preparing myself for immeasurable loss and unimaginable change the next time we return to our country."
2020-11-21 20:56,"It seems too obvious to mention, but Trump never sought to instill a sense of common purpose early on in the fight against the coronavirus, and that was the initial cause of our abject failure as a nation to deal with the pandemic. 

   Imagine an FDR or a Winston Churchill? Or even imagine Reagan or Bush or Clinton or Obama? Any leader would've marshaled the decency and can do spirit of America and set us on a consistent, coordinated course. Any other President would have instituted a national policy, would have encouraged our patriotism and good will, would have been honest and straight forward, calling for individual sacrifice for the benefit of the many.

   History will not judge us kindly. We have been tested, along with the rest of the world, and we have done far worse against the pandemic than any other wealthy democracy. We know that Trump is to blame. But history will point out the fact that we elected him. So we also are to blame.

   Now we just have to hang on two more months. Help is on the horizon. President Joe Biden will set the ship of state back on course. Unfortunately, a lot of unnecessary illness and death and economic pain will occur before Trump is done,"
2020-11-21 21:22,"I have lived in NM for over 30 years. I live in a neighborhood where after online school the kids play together in the street, masked, until it gets dark. Small get  togethers were distanced and outside. In grocery stores and parks, people have been masked, inside and outside because of our governor’s appropriately stricken mandates. But we have heard the loud music from large parties, seen the spring graduates crammed into their trucks careening around, and know extended families who are in and out of each other’s homes. Until a month ago, very few of us knew any one local who had Covid-19. Covid is rising geometrically here. Now everyone knows someone infected. We are in shock. So many of us have been so careful."
2020-11-22 15:16,"How wild that I sit in New York -- reading about the impact of the pandemic -- and see a photo of my New Mexican family's most beloved holiday destination: La Posta in Mesilla.

I implore all in my home state -- and everywhere -- to talk precautions and wear masks, stay distant, and care for each other."
2020-11-22 15:55,"These two models question what data they are based on?

For example, last week we had a record number of cases, 180,000 in a single day. Here in New York, that was reflected in a 3.1% rate of infection, or a 2.5% rate depending on whether you use city or state data.

But they both agree that there are now 8,000 Covid related hospitalizations in New York state. However, that only represents 15% of hospital beds in New York.

Is 15% really a critical surge? What has happened to all the other cases which have not required hospitalization?

Are they serious? Or relatively minor? How many are asymptomatic? What does the distribution look like?

More importantly, how are the non-hospitalized cases being treated?

Is it at least possible that the majority of serious cases are from the most vulnerable population, i.e. the elderly and those with other serious diseases?

And if this is accurate, wouldn't it make more sense to protect the most vulnerable with various restrictions but to allow others to return to work and school?

The real difference between South Dakota and New Mexico seems to be economic, not health-based or case fatality rates.

Shouldn't we at least be having this debate? And shouldn't we have this missing data as part of our public conversation?

The main way to enlist the public in whatever direction we are taking is through full disclosure, transparency, and open public debate.

This isn't just good public health policy, it's good democracy."
2020-11-22 16:59,"Why are there are no statistics other than economic ones to help us judge the differences?  What are the actual case numbers, positivity rates, hospitalizations and deaths?

2020-11-22 17:39,"The libertarian view of life, every person for themself,  is alive and well in the reactionary/republican crowd.  I'm sure there are situations where an independent, solo effort is appropriate, perhaps innovative.  The feature that sets us humans a part from most creatures is our ability to come together in large groups and cooperate to solve big, complicated problems.  Especially when we have  an emergency (wars, famines, pandemics) we humans come together, coordinate and show a disciplined response to solve the problem.  Our caring for the least among us (our famous altruism) is what has made us such a success story. Ayn Rand's extreme elevation of the individual belongs in fiction and shown not be a blueprint for governing our large country."
2020-11-22 8:19,"Kind of ironic that the majority of South Dakotans think the same way as a majority of South Carolinians, in that they reject the right of a woman to have a choice over her reproductive rights but consider it their right to ignore the threat to the lives of others by not wearing masks or physically distancing.

Pro Life indeed.

I guess that should be expected in the two States that rank in the top ten for being the most religious in America. Here in South Carolina (#9) most churches are within walking distance, that is if you happen to be a Southern Baptist. Like in South Dakota (#5) the churches are packed with blissfully (intentionally) ignorant worshipers, where the practice of hypocrisy is required, and taught to fertile young minds in Sunday school.

2020-11-22 15:33,"In another article, people in the Dakotas who are dying of Covid scream at the RN treating them, denying the reality of Covid. When one of those patients dies, they are replaced by another one with the same belief system. The Enlightenment was a time when objective views of reality trumped religious beliefs. Trump's cult believe his lies, which lead to death. If you do not believe that Covid is real and dangerous, then not wearing a mask is understandable. That the trumpettes don't realize that trump's continuing tale of lies, e.g. 'a democratic hoax' ; it will magically disappear around Easter; it is no worse than the flu; etc. were all designed to cover up his failure to deal with the suffering of others. Perhaps, and yes, this could well be a conspiracy theory, that perhaps trump NEVER had covid. His time in the hospital was way too short. Where are the lung scans, the blood samples, or any other objective evidence? All of the doctors treating him signed NDAs, and even without that, are prevented (HIPAA) from relating trump's treatment and other details. Give me the proof, or else, I cannot be sure. He lies about so much, his word is useless."
2020-11-22 12:08,"This shows the failure of the two major concepts the old, white, slaved owning Founders advocated, federalism and individual freedom.  Federalism allows right wing extremist to have crazy policies at their state and local level governments, and goes against the principle of a centrally planned scientifically sound policy expert team establishing norms for all the aspects of peoples lives, social and economic.  The results in South Dakota highlight the folly of such an approach.  And individual freedom, with concepts like freedom to insult other people and hurt their feelings, or freedom to carry a gun, which scares other people, is also  a foolish principle on which to establish policies to run a society.  Since the beginning of time, the collective has always been more important than the individual, to fight this is to fight nature itself.  Again, the actions of individuals in South Dakota who are more concerned about their rights and freedoms rather than the common good shed light on this somewhat uniquely American policy failure that started with the Declaration of Independence."

But in terms of resourcefulness, adaptability, attentiveness?  The strawberry-glazed dessert, football-game partying, get every convenience at the dollar store denizens of this hardcore ""frontier"" state wouldn't last a day on a real frontier or wilderness.

Whining because something like a mask might be slightly uncomfortable or because you are obsessed with what others might think of you does not make you a tough ""frontier"" person."
2020-11-22 16:21,"During World War II Americans were issued ration cards which controlled their purchases for gas, flour, and sugar. Business had price controls or rent controls placed on them. To this day September 11th changed the way we travel.  It’s disgraceful that some Americans refuse to fight for their country by wearing a mask. Some enemies you can’t see and that is what makes them more dangerous. A healthy economy will follow healthy citizens. Wear your masks."
2020-11-22 16:45,"The authors write, ""Hospitalization rates in South Dakota have been the highest in the nation, but a conservative frontier philosophy dominates the state’s approach.""

New Mexico actually has more of a frontier philosophy, the belief that you work hard, but that when your hard-working neighbor needs a hand, you show up to lend it.

With Kristi Noem in South Dakota and Michelle Lujan Grisham in New Mexico you have a chicken-and-the-egg situation: is it more that the governors represent the fundamental beliefs of their constituents or is it their leadership (or lack thereof) that creates the beliefs of their people?

I have no problem with those who want to go about business as usual, if they do it in their own space. However, we are one country, and unless Noem builds a wall around her state keeping all South Dakotans within, what she is doing is arrogantly telling other people, those who will be infected by travelling South Dakotans, that their freedom, the freedom she loudly claims for her constituents, doesn't apply to them. Is Noem willing to defend the right of a Minnesotan to shoot an approaching South Dakotan who believes she or he is being assaulted with a deadly weapon, the virus?

Lujan Grisham has worked to unite the peoples and elements of one of our most diverse states into a coherent approach that serves the interests of all. Viral spillover from a very lax Texas, especially El Paso, and Arizona makes her job much harder. To her credit, she takes responsibility."

2020-11-22 10:40,"This article ignores the simple fact, also, that most infections are health nothing-burgers.  

Just because infections are increasing doesn’t mean it’s the end of the world. It’s a virus, we will all be exposed and most will get it sooner or later. With therapeutics now here, in daily increasing numbers and initial vaccinations for the most vulnerable literally weeks away, we have rounded the corner on this thing.

About the time old sleepy Joe takes office and seeks without authority to order a national mask program, we will already be well on our way to elimination of the risk."
2020-11-22 15:15,"The NYT Covid map for North Carolina, where we live, shows the truths and untruths about the virus. Deaths per 100,000, the statistic that really matters, is highest in a few rural counties, many of which have prisons, all of which have high numbers of people with poor prior health status, higher poverty and limited access to care. The coastal resort counties, where we live, which also have plenty of poor people, were inundated by theoretically contagious tourists and second home owners from the northeast as soon as the lockdowns and paranoia began. The tourists were the last to wear masks and still don’t. Restaurants were packed throughout the summer. Gyms and hair care are open. Yet there have been no outbreaks here, except in nursing homes and prisons. Repeat that. None. And our death rate is at the bottom for the state and country. It’s not about shutdowns and masks. It’s about extreme crowding, poor prior health status, and occasionally bad luck, like when a tractor trailer jackknifes into oncoming traffic. Kristi Noem of SD is correct, as were the Swedish, the doctors who wrote the Great Barrington Declaration, and yes, even Trump. Stay open but be prudent, not paranoid. The media should stop feeding paranoia, but that does not sell papers or subscriptions. Nor does real common sense help the media’s handlers, the Democratic Party."

People can do what they want but they should not expect others to be sacrificed as a result. It is the height of selfishness and irresponsibility.

2020-11-22 16:34,"I live in southeastern New Mexico, and have been keeping some records of national and NM COVID data. NM had an early spike in the northwest Navajo Res corner of the state, otherwise North and South Dakota usually lagged slightly behind but the numbers among the 3 states have generally been similar and close to each other except for various spikes. New Mexico's early spike catapulted us above the Dakotas in cases and deaths. The other states did not catch up until their own spikes. Last week NM had the biggest spike by far that it has seen yet.
New Mexico, my area, has absolutely no lack of frontier attitude. It is the reddest part of the state; my friends are ranchers, dairy, oil field people. They generally are Trumpists. Torres-Small came to my town last January. I wanted to thank her in person for (finally) voting to impeach. Told her I considered Trump an arsonist - it seemed to take her by surprise. Not what she had been hearing in that room. A month later I came down with the flu - I thought. Very sick - more sick than I had been in 30 years. I got over it - joked about it being COVID. Later I realized I'd had every symptom of COVID but there were no tests around here. My rancher cowboy type friends still rail against masks etc. I have worn mine since February. 250,000 dead is reason enough for me to try to help. The number is only that high because of human attitude. It should be far less. The only thing keeping it out of the millions are the vaccines."

I felt like Nebraska's lickspittle governor Pete Ricketts was deliberating trying to kill his citizens. Now I know he is. So is Noem. For what? Crumbs from a deposed president, and what else?

2020-11-22 12:28,"A recent study on surgical mask-wearing found no significant difference in Covid-19 infections between those who wore a mask and those who didn’t. The study, which was carried out in Denmark and published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, involved more than 6,000 participants.

The Danish study is the first randomized controlled trial to address if masks protect the wearer from being infected with the novel coronavirus in a community setting. Previous randomized controlled studies for influenza or influenza-like illness also found that masks have little to no effect on whether a person becomes infected. A review of those studies was published in the CDC’s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal in May. Covid-19 is similar to influenza with regard to virus particle size and transmission characteristics.

After the Spanish flu, the surgeon general of the U.S. Navy wrote in an annual report in 1919 that ""little or no good was accomplished by the use of masks."" He further continued: “The mask is designed only to afford protection against a direct spray from the mouth of a carrier of pathogenic microorganisms.” Those who wore a mask had a slightly higher incidence of influenza than those who didn’t wear a mask while caring for the sick during the epidemic.

Wearing a mask has become more of a political statement than an effective prophylactic measure. Science doesn't support the practice, but anyone who dissents will be mercilessly maligned by leftist mobs."

Don’t go without a mask to display the macho attitude that you are not afraid.  Wear it to protect others from yourself, to stop the spread from the healthy and asymptomatic to the vulnerable, the people that die from your lack of compassion.

I am right now listening to a press conference with our current leader. I wish that our own government cared about its own people as Korea apparently cares about us. They could teach us something about politeness.
2020-11-20 20:17,"This story fills me with such warmth. My mom was born and raised in the Chuncheon area around the time mentioned in this article. Though I was born in the US, I have travelled to visit my family in my mom's hometown, and this connection somewhat  carves a deep well of emotion. Thank you for your sacrifice and compassion."
2020-11-20 20:17,"This story reminds me that there is goodness in our oftentimes crazy world. I'm a retired teacher. Education is always one of humanity's greatest gifts, as Ms. Nathan proves."
2020-11-20 20:33,The eggs did in fact bring me to tears. This is a beautiful human story of giving and gratitude.
2020-11-20 20:45,"I was in the US Army in South Korea at the same time as Ms. Nathan, 1965-66, serving as a medical officer (doctor) for Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG) in the Southern town of Kwang-Ju. I served with the Korean Army. Everything Ms Nathan has noted I also did. They were dirt poor. They were always very polite to me. Gifts were exchanged frequently. The outstanding recollections of the Korean people I met were their grit and determination,  their ability to absorb great difficulties without complaints, as well as true devotion to family. To this day, I believe that their rise from the country I lived in then to the country it is now is the fastest ascent of any country in human history. A remarkable people have produced a remarkable country."
2020-11-20 20:47,Such a lovely gift and such genuine sentiments.  Although in a very different capacity my family and I had the privilege of living in Seoul from 1999-2002.  No country is without flaws but what post war South Korea has accomplished and against such odds is admirable as has been the South Korean response to the pandemic.  We could learn from that.
2020-11-20 21:05,What a great example to follow in this season for giving thanks.
2020-11-20 21:06,"I remember the formation of the Peace Corps, and the pride I felt as an American. How times have changed."
2020-11-20 21:09,"This heart-warming story written by a peace corps volunteer proves that the U.S., despite low-points in it's history, has also been benevolent, generous, and well-meaning.  It's hard conceive of this now, in a period of such national division and widespread selfishness."
2020-11-20 21:10,"Very beautiful article. It reminds me of the Jesuit missions to China that sailed out of California in the early 20th century. What with China cast in menacing light in today's news, it's hard to keep in mind that the country was once a failed state. As with the teachers in the Peace Corps in this article, the Jesuit missionaries aimed to bring a much needed helping hand, as well as to be witnesses to the Gospel truths. When the Communists took over China,  they closed the Jesuit missions. Many then relocated to South East Asia, following the refugees who resettled there. In the succeeding years, they continued to minister to the spiritual needs of Chinese Catholics and to foster the character formation of their children. Many of us whose lives they touched feel a great debt of honor not just to the Jesuit missionaries but towards America in general as well."
2020-11-20 21:17,Wonderful story. Hooray for the Peace Corps!
2020-11-20 21:25,"Such a heart opening story about a culture that values gratitude. Considering all the scientific studies out now on the beneficial effects of gratitude, the genuine thankfulness conveyed in these gestures is, in itself, also a part of Covid survival."
2020-11-20 21:30,"Beautiful story and shows the grace of the Korean people.  I am forwarding to a friend who served in the Peace Corp around the same time in the Philippines.
Let us hope our new President is able to mend our relationships worldwide.  He has a mighty task ahead!  This gives us hope."
2020-11-20 21:34,"Light years away from ""America First"". There were many problems afflicting our country back then, but the trajectory was mostly in the right direction. The polar opposite of Trump's doctrine - and it shows in the sad state of the US now."
2020-11-20 21:56,"Ms. Nathan represented the best of America and the best of America is highlighted with the soft power of people-to-people contact. The Peace Corps has done more to protect American freedoms than all of the wars of the last several generations. Such contacts breaks down barriers, gives a helping hand, helps people to be the best that they can be and leaves lasting good feelings. The benefits are felt both ways.

Wouldst that a young American who wishes to see the world think of the Peace Corps more often than they think about joining the military. While our service people provide a great service at great personal sacrifice, Peace Corps volunteers through their works greatly reduce the risks for our troops."
2020-11-20 22:01,"As far as I know, South Korea is the only country whose government  has thanked the Peace Corps volunteers who served by funding ""Revisit Trips"".  I was a recipient of that generosity in 2012 and enjoyed a week of activities, tours, and a visit to the city where I lived and to the boy's middle school where I taught from 1974-1976.  
It would be wonderful if the NY Times did a story about the Revisit Trips."
2020-11-20 22:20,One of my students took a teaching job in Seoul and has been there for going on 28 years. He married a Korean National and now has a family. I hear from him occasionally and a common theme centers around the Korean’s almost unnatural respect for education and those who provide it. The kindness and warmth of the Korean people also come through in his letters. He was one of my favorites and I’m happy that he’s teaching in a place that values his service.
2020-11-20 22:45,"As a friend and fellow Peace Corps Volunteer with Sandy Nathan in Korea, I share her feelings of warmth and deep gratitude for this beautiful gesture of friendship and love from the people of South Korea. So often during my Peace Corps years I was struck by the thought of how lucky I was to be an American, privileged almost beyond compare, never having to worry where my next meal was coming from or how to keep myself warm on a winter's night, or whether I would be putting myself or my friends at risk by daring to criticize the government in power. How the world has changed since then! How much there is that we can now learn from the people of Korea! We Americans would all do well to listen with open ears."
2020-11-20 22:51,"Thank you Choe Sang-Hun for telling us about Ms. Nathan and the Covid-19 survival boxes. This wonderful story is full of decency and grace, generosity and curiosity, dignity and gratefulness. These are the values that we must rediscover here. Our souls depend on it. MAGA and America First are a fast road to nowhere good."
2020-11-20 23:19,"We need to bring back the Peace Corps, in a big way.

I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Niger, West Africa from 1965-68.  Stationed in the small, isolated village of Souloulou 10 miles from the nearest dirt road.

The Peace Corps had been operating in Niger for 3 years before my arrival -- and word had spread among local people.  

Soon after arrival, I was invited into a grass hut -- and surprised to see a photo of John F. Kennedy perched against the wall.  I asked the hut owner if he knew who the man was in the photo.  He said 'no', but had heard the man had created the Peace Corps and therefore was a great man he wanted to honor.

I helped teach students at the local primary school, introducing critical thinking and problem solving exercises into what till then was entirely a rote learning memorization curriculum. 

One of our students, Ibrahim, rose to become Minister of Health for the entire country.  70 miles away, in the small town of Madaoua, another Peace Corps Volunteer, Mary Ann, was teaching middle school -- and also introduced out-of-the-box thinking and problem solving to her class.  One of her students, Mahamadou, is now President of Niger -- and credits Mary Ann with giving him skills to help lead that country in a more positive direction.

We Peace Corps Volunteers worked hard, in often very challenging circumstances, learned the local language, respected people -- and were highly appreciated in return.

That is America being truly 'great'."
2020-11-20 23:52,"What a beautiful story. I served in the Peace Corps the exact same years as you Sandra, 1966-1968; not in Korea but in Costa Rica.  I had just graduated Law school and half our group was attorneys. We were supposed to set up a Legal Aid system but upon arrival, we were informed at a meeting with the President of the country, that it fell through. So we were asked to go out to our towns and do ""Community Development"" (whatever that meant). Anyway my wife and I lived in this small village about 6000 feet up a mountain where it really got cold in the winter. I don't want to go into too much detail about our experience but I'm so glad to hear of yours. I live in Manhattan so if by chance you should ever visit, I would love to meet you and share our memories. Take care. Howard"
2020-11-20 19:47,Chuncheon! I had the pleasure of staying at the university there  for several weeks.
2020-11-20 23:03,South Koreans are grateful for their success because the current living generation remembers the hardships. No living person born in this country remembers anything like that. Once in a while every country should experience similar miserable existence to make them appreciate what they have.
2020-11-20 19:44,"Such a beautiful story! Despite all the horrible news in the world, this story gives us hope to be positive in humanity. Comments also bring me to tears."
2020-11-20 21:20,"Gifts of love and concern, reciprocated.  This is what social capital looks like."
2020-11-20 23:12,"There is definitely an attention to detail and tradition of expression of gratitude in small but thoughtful gifts in Asia. As I have built a family and career in South Korea, I have a newfound appreciation of the efforts of those like Sandra Nathan and others I have met as well as the multinational veterans of the Korean War. What a difference now! It is not just the covid response, but the infrastructure here, seamless no touch card pay taxi-bus-subway in Seoul, clean, safe and efficient. High speed internet access almost everywhere, and the education level of of the general population is amazing. Almost no anti-mask nonsense."
2020-11-20 21:30,"Respect for Ms. Nathan.  Respect for South Korea.  Respect for the Peace Corp.

We need this story so much right now.  

Thanks NYT."
2020-11-20 22:32,"I'm a 61-year old American living in South Korea, moved by the article and by the responses from the readers in the US. I love the generosity of the Korean people and feel it every day, though casual visitors here might find the people initially cool and distant. I also appreciate Korean society's appreciation of expertise and quality. As the head of an international NGO I'm a frequent speaker and like to ask Korean audiences if they know the English word ""diligence"", which is a setup because they always know the word because it applies so strongly to them. I'm also liking the social intelligence and non-ideological brand of collectivism to support universal facemask wearing since January, such that now new cases of covid-19 run 126 higher per capita in the US than here in Korea. They pay and respect teachers and education, and follow advice from educated experts. From here, the US suddenly and surprisingly looks backwards and in many ways silly....considering the pandemic, gun worship, conspiracy theories, racism, warped political ideology and complete political gridlock...."
2020-11-20 20:13,"Ah .... this made me cry ... 

What a beautiful story !!"
2020-11-20 22:14,"This is how the US used to behave in the world. I remember it clearly, “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country”. We must become that country again. Thank you JFK and the Peace Corps who so personified those thoughts."

2020-11-20 22:07,"I am very proud of being a Korean. My mom worked for Peace Corps Korea as a staff from 1968 to 1981. Since I was born in 1971, I have met many PC volunteers who loved me. I have a lot of unforgettable memories with them. Thank you !! We Koreans will never forget you !"
2020-11-20 20:59,"Received my package a few weeks ago. Was delighted on a cold morning. Served 1977-79. My life was changed forever by my service in the Republic.  I enjoyed a career that allowed me continued engagement with Korea and even today I am able to maintain a commitment to the Republic as an Honorary Consul.  Korea is a special place and everyday I pray that the people can one day have the entire peninsula free from the vestiges
of the machinations of big powers."
2020-11-21 0:37,"What a wonderful example of the lifelong gifts of Peace Corps service!  I was a PC volunteer in Turkey at the same time as Ms. Nathan was in South Korea.  In fact, my first choice was to go to South Korea but I was already designated for assignment to Turkey (which worked out very well).  It's hard to convey how much we volunteers gained by volunteering in such countries and I hope that young people especially will continue to be drawn to such service."
2020-11-20 23:11,"A nice story, nicely told."
2020-11-20 19:41,"A lovely story.  I congratulate and wish the Koreans the best.

As to the cold 8n the North - i wad in South Korea for the winter Olympics.  Even though, I have lived in Siberia - the cold in that part of Korea is probably still as bad as when this lady lived there.

It literally bites into the bone.

As a man born in India -  I am especially proud of being an Asian with this story.

In an otherwise ungratefulworld of the Middle East,  where America has spent its treasure, blood among other hardships, the Arabs throw shoes, bombs etc.

Of course, Afghans are in a class by themselves.

May be, someone ought to translate this story in Arabic and Pashthun or other languages - so, perhaps they can learn a thing ir two about being civil and grateful."
2020-11-20 21:12,"“It was as if this box had been traveling to me since 1968,”

2020-11-20 19:48,"Thank you, Ms. Nathan!  It's because of you and people like you make this world a place that we can hope for future of our children."
2020-11-20 19:25,"See, that America? 

If you are just a basic, run-of-the-mill selfish country, you just fade into the noise of it all. Just another naked power, grabbing for whatever it can in a grabby world.

But if you are Sandra Nathan's America, other nations send you gifts if you are feeling a bit blue at the start of Winter.

Choose wisely!"
2020-11-20 19:01,"The people of South Korea are grateful for our support of their freedom.  For our men and women who died to help them become free and those who helped build a modern, democratic nation. 

South Korea is free of COVID due to the leadership of their country and the willingness to follow simple directions.

The United States is today led by a filthy coward.  And almost every Republican leader is just as much a coward as trump.  The spinelessness of Republicans is unbelievable.  

God save these United States."

2020-11-20 23:21,"What a beautiful story.

Gamsahmnida."
2020-11-20 20:34,There could be a box. A covid stories box. To be given to those who suffer from all the loss and heartbreak this dual pandemic has brought upon our nation. The scourge of the virus and scourge of the president who was a viral pandemic of incompetence and hatred.
2020-11-20 21:45,"There are far too many people in the US who, with teeth bared, consider the Peace Corps a socialist relic of liberal hippie dippy policies. What a shame that our current leaders, and some 72M people who voted for them, have nothing but contempt for values we once championed. Kindness and generosity are far more potent than guns and conspiracy theories. I doubt anyone from Afghanistan, Iraq or Syria will be sending boxes of gratitude our way 50 years from now."
2020-11-20 21:23,"This is a wonderful story, only diminished by not expanding it to stories of the other 2000 who served alongside Ms. Nathan, including many men. Why is it that the NYT seems resistant to telling warm and uplifting stories like this about men?"
2020-11-20 22:13,"In 60 years, we gone from asking our youths to bring peace to war-torn lands in the Peace Corps to asking them to help militarize a peaceful galaxy with Space Force. Wrong direction"

2020-11-21 2:38,My dad received one too. He was so happy. Delightful story.
2020-11-21 3:14,"Thank you, Ms. Nathan! It is the work of individuals that make small, but important changes in this world. I lived in and taught English in South Korea for a brief time, but it is much different than the Korea Ms. Nathan lived in. I will forever be grateful for the kindness and generosity the Korean people showed me. South Korea always has a place in my heart."
2020-11-21 4:16,"Thank you, Ms. Nathan and the volunteers. I was born in Chunchon in 1971. Maybe my parents met you. We went through difficult times, but thanks to the courage that you  planted, we were able to get through. Thank you again."
2020-11-21 5:31,"When I applied to join the Peace Corps, my parents (originally from South Korea) informed me that when they were growing up, Peace Corps volunteers came to their school and taught them English.  It left significant impressions on them to see Americans coming to their country willingly to share their culture and language, especially after so much wartime destruction and despair they faced as children.

I was fortunate and further compelled to serve in the Peace Corps (’03-’05) as an American of Korean immigrant parents, to give back to the country and program that helped my parents.  I hope I was able to in part, repay the debt of gratitude to those volunteers like Ms. Nathan who served when Korea was in the midst of such calamity.  

Also, I want to express my appreciation for the NY Times for publishing this story.  When I read this article, I realized the importance of reading news that illustrates our broader connection as humans.  I truly hope that this type of positivity and fundamental decency, can help us to rebuild the mistrust that festers in society today."
2020-11-21 4:12,"I am Korean American and one common expression that Koreans like to use is, “I feel sorry but also very grateful/thankful at the same time”. I think it says so much about Koreans that they express their gratitude in this way some 40+ years later. That makes it so much sweeter, like a fine wine. Thanks for sharing. Also, lol, Koreans prioritizing good food, coffee, sweet treats and good health. So very Korean!!!  Enjoy!"

2020-11-21 6:16,"I very much enjoyed Ms. Nathan's story. I'm an American living and working in South Korea at a Korean university. We can be very thankful for what Ms. Nathan and other Peace Corps workers did. I have also met many young Americans who've recently served as PVC's at my former grad school in the states. That spirit of service and generosity has not died. South Korea has come such a long way. Now it is trying to help many thousands of foreign university students here learn about how South Korea developed, to help their countries as well. If you have faith, pray that the tragic division of the Koreas ends. There are good people all over Korea, and they don't deserve another horrific war."
2020-11-21 6:42,"Thank you so much for the writer in bringing this story to us NY Times readers. What a privilege for us to be able to read this beautiful article! During this time of division and demonization, I can’t think of a better time for a feel good story like this. As I am wiping away tears because it’s so touching, at the same time I smile because of the kindness and goodness of Korea and its citizenry. Proud to be Korean!"

2020-11-21 8:02,"I remember arriving in Seoul in January 1979, expecting to see horse and buggies on the roads.  But I was shocked to see instead, big traffic jams of automobiles clogging the roads.  The drivers in the capital city were inexperienced and daring.  And the standard of living throughout the country, especially in Seoul, was much higher than I expected, though no where near as high as in the USA.  However, it was obvious that the Korean economy was surging then.  The nation was proud of that, and the people were enthusiastically nationalistic.    A year later, my army tour was finished, and I returned home.  The SK economy took off in the late 1970’s at breakneck speed and didn’t begin to slow down until after the Seoul Summer Olympics in 1988."

2020-11-21 12:19,"When I first began to travel to Asia, two and a half decades ago, nobody would have thought to send 'care packages' to the USA. Of course even then Asia had at least one very wealthy country - Japan - but throughout this part of the world the USA was respected and admired for our accomplishments. As an American, I could travel without worry into areas that were considered dangerous. As taxi drivers then told me, the bad guys feared the long arm of America and the good guys respected us. Flash forward to 2003. We had America lashing out like a wounded beast at friends and foes alike because of the actions of a few individuals. Many saw this as a sign of weakness and many began to suspect the USA was a diminished power. Later in that same administration the Great Recession emanated from the USA, accompanied by what overseas investors viewed as breaches of trust by once respected American financial institutions. Forward again to another Republican administration. We now have the spectacle of a US minimum wage lower than the lowest wage in South Korea, and near complete reliance on imports of vital supplies from Asia during an out of control pandemic. Certainly we feel gratitude for the thoughts of South Koreans, but should we not also feel a sense of shame for how far America has descended in just two decades?"
2020-11-21 12:58,"Wonderful story.....and wonderful comments from former Peace Corps Volunteers who served in many different places.  I think someone should write a book to include experiences and stories of Peace Corps Volunteers and the positive impact of their selfless service.  I don't know if one is out there already, but if not....we sure could use such an uplifting reminder of America's greatness and generosity and our connection as fellow citizens of this world."
2020-11-21 13:10,Thank you very much Ms. Nathan for your heartfelt dedication  and volunteering. Stay healthy and safe always.
2020-11-21 13:30,We have much to learn from South Korea's examples of gratitude. They have displayed a long memory for the help they received during hard times and a present day gratitude in times of prosperity. Beautiful story. Thank you for sharing it
2020-11-21 14:14,"As a DOI scientist, I was an invited lecturer in Daejeon, South Korea, more than a decade ago. The US isolation from other countries is not just at the executive level, it extends throughout government. Conference attendance and publication of research is more difficult than a few years ago. South Korea is a lovely country with dedicated and very gracious scientists. It was a great cooperative sharing of science, and the students were curious and very interested in learning. I also have fond memories of the barbecued eel (tasted like chicken, of course)."

2020-11-21 12:01,"This story is SO beautiful. This is what America should be about...helping other countries, respecting other cultures and learning from them. 
Since President John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps in 1961, more than 235,000 Americans of all ages have served in 141 countries worldwide.

Unfortunately because of COVID-19 around 7,000 active Peace Corps people had to leave their countries. Peace Corps will determine country-by-country when it’s safe for volunteers to return. The Peace Corps announced it would provide volunteers with a one-time $1,500 stipend to cover costs associated with the evacuations. [This is not nearly enough. Jobs are scarce and rentals, food & living are expensive.]

I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Sarawak, East Malaysia on the island of Borneo from 1967-68 and taught elementary school."
2020-11-21 7:31,"I am a Korean-American living in the US.
I want to say thank you to Ms. Nathan and the 2000 Peace Corps Volunteers who helped South Korea.
Also, kudos to all the PCVs served in the past and those serving presently around the world. Those PCVs
have been planting the seed of hope and love in the people of impoverished nations around the world.
Many Koreans will always be grateful to those volunteers and remember them.
A story like this is a reminder that the world is not such a terrible place, after all."
2020-11-21 10:50,"There are times when we know what we do is not only right, it is good and someone thanks you for the deed.

Then, we finally recognize it and can say ""Hey, I did good."" and we feel the gesture's intention. Rarely -- yet amazingly -- someone else reminds you of the deed, and reminds us its culmination.

Thank you Ms. Nathan, and thank Mr. Sang-Hun for telling us the tale."
2020-11-20 19:13,"I, too, received a COVID-19 Survival Box from South Korea with gratitude and humility. I taught English there from 1977-1979. I’m proud of what South Korea has become. We are the ones learning lessons from them now."
2020-11-20 20:28,I am 46 years old born in South Korea and raised in NYC. My father and mother were born in 1939 and 1948 respectively and growing up with my two sisters not a day would go by without hearing how grateful we should be for warm rice. During the impoverished years of the Korean War my parents considered themselves lucky to have one fistful of frozen rice a day. Only the richest kids could afford to eat eggs.  And so I read a story like this and all the memories of the hardship my parents faced come rushing through.  We are so incredibly grateful to all the selfless Peace Corps volunteers who gave our country something to feel hopeful for.  It reminds me that despite the deep mess we are in we must find small ways to be kind and give back.  Thank you for sharing this truly heartwarming story.
2020-11-20 19:46,"Thank you for sharing your story, Ms Nathan!  I'm a 70 year old Korean living in US and reading the article brought tears in my eyes.  I've lived through those hard times.  It's been a very long, difficult years to recovery.  I'm grateful to all American people, military service men, peace corps, and the US government who helped us along the way to stand on our own feet .  Thank you!"
2020-11-20 18:55,How is it we have so lost our way?
2020-11-20 18:51,"It’s wonderful to see that appreciation and gratitude can transcend cultural and physical barriers even at times like these. The world needs a few feel-good stories, and this story is a welcome reminder that we get what we give. Karma exists, and what we do for/to others catches up to us eventually."
2020-11-20 20:37,"This story gives full explanation to the name ""Peace Corps"".  The 1961 idealism - that young Americans could go and increase the possibility for peace in the world through selfless acts - is one of the significant achievements of America. The term ""butterfly effect"" is appropriate here - the activities of this group may have profound effects, both in the past, now, and in the future."
2020-11-21 15:06,Back then I never appreciated how brave and generous these young volunteers were. How did the Peace Corps shape them. What careers did they then choose? My friend went to Sierra Leone. She was my hero. Still is. Now there’s Ameri Corps and FEMA Corps.  Is there still a Peace Corps?
2020-11-21 16:31,"I remember my now 76 year old mother telling me about Peace Corps volunteers teaching English at her high school in Busan. My mother was also a Girl Scout and has fond memories of that American institution, too. Thank you to Ms. Nathan and all others who served so selflessly. Thanks also to the Korea Foundation for this gracious project."
2020-11-21 17:07,"Thank you Ms. Nathan for sharing your story and for Mr. Choe for describing it beautifully.  Also, sincerest appreciation to the Korea Foundation, Mr. Lee and many who worked behind the scenes to make this happen.  As one of the RPCVs who received a box, I think all of us share Ms. Nathan's sentiments.  Magic was in the box.  And for those who doubt the value of the investment of public funding for service organizations such as Peace Corps, just check out Friends of Korea, originally an organization of Returned Volunteers from Korea that has grown to include others and which continues to give back to the communities in the U.S.  The third goal of PC continues 50 years after we left Korea -- an investment that still continues to pay social dividends to America.  And of course, none of this happens without the graciousness from and the ""jeong"" with the Korean people that we we share and all the lessons we learned from them during our formative years there!"
2020-11-21 17:27,"We need more stories like this to remind us (o, how easily we forget!) how connected we really are with those around us.
Thank you!"
2020-11-21 17:35,"I have been teaching ESL to college students here in the US for the last 15 years. At the beginning of my career, the preponderance of my students hailed from South Korea. I was immediately struck by their kindness, humility, work ethic, humor and love of life. Ms. Nathan's experience reinforces my very positive impression of the Korean people. Thanks to the NYT for sharing her story."
2020-11-21 18:30,"It seems Ms. Nathan was in K-I, the first group.  I was in K-III and was there from 1967-1970.  I had a wonderful return visit to Korea in 2010, sponsored by the Korean government, and was able to visit my old school and meet the principal.

I also received a box of supplies.  Thank you, Korea!"
2020-11-21 18:46,"This is  a remarkable story one exceptional Peace Corp volunteer. Most of the Peace Corp volunteer were  really good people who wanted to make a difference in the lives of others.  I personally knew some who  did their best in the fields that they thought in  a third world country.  What was curious is that  some did not like their US Govt .'s policies towards this particular country,.
I recall asking them on a field trip with teachers and students : Why the US Govt does not send books and laboratory science equipment for the schools instead of weapons to the  Country's Govt.? The Peace Corp Volunteer said, the arms lobby is vey powerful!  The educational lobby is non-existent
It was hard for us locals to understand what  he really meant.
We felt the US was losing opportunities to  to build  with the youths.  (The JFK library was a valuable resource for students.)"
2020-11-21 20:34,"I was in Ecuador in the 1960s when the first Peace Corps volunteers arrived.  I saw the expansion of problem solving in small communities and in the volunteers themselves who benefited in their own growth as they dealt with situations never met before.  In due course my daughter became a Peace Corps volunteer and now has a tremendous network of friends in both the host country and among returned Peace Corps volunteers from all over the world.  I recommend the Peace Corps to everyone, parents, students, young people, as a route to personal growth and self-sufficiency (and finding out what they don’t like, equally as important as finding their “passion”) while under the general supervision and protection of the US government agency."
2020-11-21 21:22,"Charming example of gratitude and amity.  Thanks for this.

The Peace Corps had really good results in some places, but in some others - in Bolivia, for example, where my son went - its efforts were somewhat misguided and inconsistent with what the local people really needed.

It might be worth doing again, but with more care given to conditions and needs of the populace."
2020-11-21 21:45,"I too was a Peace Corps volunteer in Korea, 1967 - 1968. My experiences were very similar to Sandra Nathan's. I was not on the mainland but on the Island of Chejudo. The conditions there were a bit more challenging...open sewers, unheated classrooms and millions of rats. However, the people were unbelievably warm and supportive. The experience was a gift to this naïve volunteer, something I will always cherish. The Korean Foundation Covid-19 Gift Survival Box brought me to tears."
2020-11-21 22:39,"Having grown up in the Bronx, I also was fortunate to have the greatest experience of my life as a Peace Corps volunteer in a rural area of Korea from 1974-‘76 serving as a Hansen’s disease (leprosy) control worker and received my Covid-19 Survival Box this week. Moreover; I subsequently graduated from the illustrious Yonsei University Medical College and retired last year as a Family Physician in Lancaster County,PA. So I am a personal witness to the incredible economic miracle of Korea and the ironic role reversal in medical response to the pandemic from what existed 45 years ago.
From a historical perspective, Korea is the only country in the world that received Peace Corps assistance (until 1980) and now provides similar assistance to developing countries throughout the world through the Korea Foundation’s KOICA program!
Surely; this story demonstrates the human similarities, compassion, and empathy that the world needs more of."
2020-11-21 19:39,"We give tribute to Veterans... maybe we should give equal tribute to Peace Corp volunteers.

In my 20's I had excuses, family, school, then career for not joining the Peace Corp... now I just have regrets at the changes I could have made.

Maybe in 2021, our new President can re-establish something similar and show the world that we aren't the selfish isolationists Trump made us appear to be."
2020-11-21 15:58,"That South Korea has been able to transform itself from an impoverished dictatorship to a rich democracy within one to two generations should inspire us and teach us a lesson. The reversal in fortune for America is particularly ironic. There is no born greatness, nor destined failures. “The fault is not in our stars. But in ourselves."""
2020-11-21 17:06,"Thank you New York Times for covering this story.  While Peace Corps volunteers are no longer servicing around the globe due to the pandemic and politics, let all readers learn the 3rd mission statement of the organization : To help promote a better understanding of other peoples on the part of Americans."
2020-11-21 15:48,"It is good deeds by idealistic Americans like Sandra Nathan that has kept a reservoir of good will among people in Asia. People are not dumb. They know when America is helping them and when America is harming them. And they remember. Wherever we walk, we leave our footprints."
2020-11-21 19:07,A lovely gesture from S. Korea.  Now if only our own government would be as kind to us.
2020-11-21 14:44,The Republic of Korea is one of our country’s closest friends.  May it’s people find peace.
2020-11-21 21:23,Great story!
2020-11-21 14:40,Recall that the idea of the Peace Corps was that of our beloved President Kennedy.  Have times changed!
2020-11-21 18:26,"In only a short 3-week visit last year I have experienced the  goodness and utter dependability of Korean people in small and  large ways. Let me tell you this most impressive example: 

I mailed paper conference materials home to the US before visiting the countryside. But back in the US the post office erroneously did not deliver the package (long story). Despite many tracking calls nobody felt responsible, and the USPS sent it back to Korea.
On a whim, I called the small post office in Gwangju and indeed the package was there. The officer who had helped me send it had been fined about $30 since it was assumed SHE made a mistake (she didn't). On the phone, she repackaged + re-addressed the package with me, and even paid for it because I could only pay her privately by credit card (including her fine of course.) Yes, the package arrived. I was amazed at how honest and committed she was to get the package to me. I kept the box with the Korean stamps and tape for a year - and smiled every time I looked at it."
2020-11-21 15:51,"Quote from the article: “An ongoing debate among volunteers was whether Time or Newsweek was more absorbent,” Ms. Nathan said​ in an email interview. “Toilet paper was unavailable.”​"
2020-11-22 0:17,"Although we look around and question who we are and what we stand for, American exceptionalism is a reality that exists in the memories of folks around the world.  Honorable post-war occupations and restorations of civilian economies and governments in Germany, Japan, and South Korea are remembered and honored by recipients.  I remember working in Germany on September 12, 2001, everyone standing together for minutes of silence organized by German colleagues."
2020-11-22 1:35,I served as a Peace Corps volunteer from 1967-69 in Costa Rica and my one big takeaway was that I learned as much and even more from my experience from the Costa Rican community where I served than what I was able to give. it turned into a mutual love affair.
2020-11-22 2:47,"50+ years ago, along with Sandy and scores of like-minded young men and women, I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in South Korea teaching English in a girls middle & high school in a rural town not far from the DMZ.  That experience left upon me an indelibly positive mark that has influenced my life to this day.  The Koreans are a warm and generous people that never forget.  Yesterday I, along with hundreds of other Returned Volunteers, received an unexpected gift from the government of South Korea.  The large box on my doorstep was labeled Covid 19 Survival Box and contained 100 medical grade face masks, face creams, protective gloves, and a wide selection of gifts and remembrances personalized specifically for us.  This gift exemplifies their ongoing gratitude for the sacrifices so many Volunteers and staff made to serve in their country during its recovery from the Korean War.  Now, during our shared battle with the Corona Virus, Koreans have reached out to reciprocate and  lend us a hand. Today South Korea is a robust, booming democratic nation, a model of transformation.  Like myself, many others treasure and have never forgotten our Korean experience and how it changed so many of our lives.  The Koreans, too, have never forgotten.  It is a great gift we have given  each other."
2020-11-22 2:56,Thanks to US. Great article. Hope all US to get through pandemic soon.

This is the American Spirit, many Koreans including myself, remember what America has done for South Korea.

The appreciation of such dedication, and sacrifices by many Americans that saved South Korea from tryanny, and extreme poverty never departed from my heart and soul. Serving in the armed forces was a way of returning a partial debt to America and what it means to be an American!

I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco during the 1990s, and it was truly one of the most enriching experiences of my life, one I think about daily, and which I believe has contributed to one of my core values as I grew into adulthood: hospitality, and the mandate to welcome the stranger, just as I was welcomed so warmly."
2020-11-22 19:56,"Thank you, Mr. Choe, for this wonderful article. I was a Peace Corps volunteer who taught at Kyungnam University and also received a covid-19 survival box from the Korea Foundation. I have many precious memories of my time in Korea and agree with the sentiment of other RPCVs that we gained more than we gave. Since receiving the box, I have given masks to family, friends and coworkers, each time telling the story of Korea, its people, and my service, and especially praising the largesse of the Korea Foundation."
2020-11-22 4:03,"It's nonsense, why Korea didn't give veterans of Korean War in USA and also their family?

It is just kidding."
2020-11-22 0:52,"This beautifully written article brought me to tears; for the goodness that transpired on so many levels, that still resonates. But also for that same goodness which seems out of our grasp at the moment in our country. It is part of my identity as an American; it’s missing now. and makes me profoundly sad. I don’t know when it might be restored. But I do know that it is the millions of who we call “ordinary” citizens that are doing their jobs with integrity, without the respect and acknowledgement they deserve, who are keeping this country afloat, albeit listing badly. I am in awe of you all."
2020-11-22 4:08,"The Army sent me to the 2D Inf Division on the DMZ immediately following the capture of the Pueblo and crew in 1968. The Korean people were poor, but proud, and the most industrious I have ever seen. It was typical to drive by little shops at dusk seeing workmen still busy at their tasks, the little shops illuminated by bare light bulbs hanging from the ceilings. The people were universally friendly and grateful for American support. The success of the country and people has been the result of their their intelligence, hard work, and effort. We Americans should take pride in the success we have helped a deserving people achieve."
2020-11-22 0:52,"Great article, the U.S. did so many good things around the world that people from other nations remember. This is an example and so was the one about the American pilot from the Berlin airlift who handed out chocolates to children. Another must watch is a video of foreigners reacting to American deaths due to the pandemic, surreal. A Korean girl cried when she heard of the number. I believe it was in this paper, worth searching for.

Then we look, at least in the last year, what our own Government ""did"" in the criminal mishandling of the pandemic. 

Do we have people like Ms. Nathan anymore? we need more of them in Government and in politics."
2020-11-24 1:06,"This story gives hope that somehow not everyone in the world hates us.    Trump never defined America.   MAGA was a stunt to sell hats.     America first meant Trump first.

2020-11-20 15:24,"In the last 10 or so years China has become a very different country.  It is the largest economy in terms of GDP ppp, is a top leader in combating climate change, is a top leader in AI and other advance technologies, has built the longest high speed rail network in the world, has made so many countries much better off through its Belt and Road Initiative and has reduced its poverty level to close to zero.  Anti-China people probably have no idea that China has accomplished all of his, as they only want to know what they want to hear."
2020-11-20 15:44,"""Chinese Diaspora"" is not a cohesive unit.

This article refers to a very specific subset of emigrants from the post-Deng People's Republic of China who actively oppose the Chinese Communist Party.  They are not representative of ""Chinese Diaspora"".

The vast majority of ""Chinese Diaspora"" reside in Asia outside China.  Southeast Asia in particular has many ethnic-Chinese of non-Chinese nationality.  They may retain some customs that originated from China, but they hardly care about Chinese politics other than how it impacts their country.

The ""Chinese Diaspora"" here in the states originated before the creation of the PRC.  Others like myself never even set foot in the PRC before emigrating.  Southeast Asia, Taiwan, Hong Kong (till 1997), and Macau (till 1999) were never ruled by the PRC or the CCP.

So let's not think all ""Chinese Diaspora"" are the same."
2020-11-20 16:11,"@Justin sure, it’s understandable to have reservations or suspicions about the ccp. Some genuine dissidents need their voices heard. That doesn’t mean having to automatically believe word by word whatever said by its self-proclaimed “dissidents”. I think this is what the article is trying to say.

As this article shows, Dr. Yan did not have the credentials and experience to be an authoritative voice on the Coronavirus, and her “findings” were not accepted by the scientific community. But she can gain so much by proposing her “lab manufactured” theory. This well caters to the anti-Chinese and anti-ccp sentiment and makes her popular, although she hasn’t been involved in pro-democracy movements before. Perhaps this activity gains her the residence in NYC. She seemed clearly manipulated, or perhaps had ulterior motives.

Great article, only thing I want to add is Dr. Yan or this right-wing “dissident” group is not representative of the Chinese diaspora. There are lots of cool-headed ethnically Chinese people accessing credible information, not necessarily less so than other ethnic groups. There are lots accessing misinformation for sure, but since there are lots of them on both sides, neither can be said to be representative of this ethnicity."

New York's Chinese language newspapers, World Journal and Ming Pao have all bent the knee to self-censorship. Hong Kong, where its Press Freedom Index once rivaled first world countries, is now in the gutter. Hong Kong/Tibetan human rights advocates are threatened and harassed by pro-beijing goons in democratic countries; this was unheard of years ago. Millions of Uighurs remain in concentration camps and are regularly subjected to oppression the UN defines as genocide. They care more about human rights on the other side of the world because they've experienced its violations first hand. I believe it's the same mentality some hardcore Christians  have when it comes to overlooking Trump's anti-Christian tactics, whatever gets them across the goal line."

The virus first appeared in China, but how many have  died from this pandemic in China compared with the U.S.? If Covid19 did anything it showed us the failure of the American government to protect its citizens compared with the success of the Chinese Communist Party. This of course is all due to the incompetence of Donald Trump and those he had put in charge."

Instead of kicking them off social media platforms, perhaps these social media platforms can hire legal professionals, journalists, instead of moderators.  For example:  a journalist could inform the audience with a post that there is no proof by a US agency that the virus was concocted in a Chinese lab, but that domestic flights had been grounded while international ones out of Wuhan hadn't (if true....that would mean that China--like US leadership--is interested in it's own economy more so than intentionally causing harm re:  lockdowns).

But social media and the internet are perfect vehicles for delivery of conspiratorial nonsense. What it all is, is ""fake news"" unless legitimately substantiated."

2020-11-20 18:05,"It amazes me that the CCP still has its defenders in the comments section. 

For all the bleating about ""Trump the fascist!"" the CCP regime is literally fascist: language about class struggle was excised from the party constitution and replaced with language promoting Chinese nationalism. The government promotes and tolerates capitalists whilst insisting on allowing the state a guiding hand in the economy, including shares in the major corporations, otherwise known as fascist economics. There are still plenty of state-owned enterprises that coexist alongside private sector ones, particularly in those sectors deemed important to the nation. There are concentration camps for ethnic minorities and a labor camp system for political dissidents. Propaganda is pervasive. Xi Jinping has dictatorial powers and has been declared President for Life. 

Get your heads out of the sand, people."
2020-11-20 15:53,"Bannon is a proponent of objectivism - basically the individual right to become wealthy regardless of methods to do so and the (false) belief that all formal government is preventing the individual from doing so.

Dr Yan is clearly strongly opposed to Xi and her emotion has blinded her rational thought process.    Her approach is Trumpian -  say anything to gain support.    Such persons are fanatics and easily step back and forth from fascism to ultra-liberalism depending upon their personal financial needs."

2020-11-20 16:12,"I think Guo, Bannon, and probably Wang are playing a double game here, for a hoped for eventual PR coup on the part of the CCP. 

They’re creating an outlandish but, to the grifting US rightwing media constellation, irresistible narrative that will be debunked when China does release their “data.”

That’s why Bannon and Guo are using equivocating language."
2020-11-20 17:02,"Wealthy right-wing Chinese have promoted Hong Kong and Taiwan against China and churned out endless propaganda attacking the Chinese government for decades. The so-called ""democracy movement"" continues to manipulate foreign media today. The US has been complicit all along because of its engagement back in WW2 backing the warlord Chiang Kai Shek and then setting him up as the ""real Chinese"" government in the armed  secessionist Taiwan, before launching a proxy war in Korea against China. American efforts to control China and the Pacific persist to this day. Likewise, monied supporters of the Dali Lama persist in stirring up trouble, again with the eager support of right-wing US interests. These people are dangerous, like the Cubans and Venezuelans who fled to the US to make trouble for their governments back home, they subvert US domestic politics and foreign relations in the process, and spread lies and political propaganda. Their loyalty is definitely not to the US and their interests definitely do not align with most Americans. Bannon hooking up with Chinese, Cuban and Venezuelan malcontents comes as no surprise. The path was well worn by Reagan and the Bushes."

Well, that's good to know. I was born on the same day as Scott Turow. Since both my parents are now deceased, I never got to ask them about all the careful coordination they arranged with Scott Turow's parents to make that happen. But now I know they must have been master planners."

Where is the logic in this Mr. Bannon and Mr. Guo. Mr Guo, you should understand that white supremacists would send you back to Chine if they had the power.  Has the Arab Spring crossed the Atlantic?

2020-11-20 16:31,"The fascinating thing about this story is how it reveals the similarities between communist propaganda and conservative propaganda. Both parties rely on a patina of pseudo-science to lend authority to the party line. Both apply secretive pressure on their mouthpieces to speak in the manner they are expected to speak. Both rely on widespread amplification and repetition to convey a sense of ""truthiness"" to whatever is being conveyed."
2020-11-20 14:26,"Certainly not a highly respected dissident voice on China, but at least it’s a voice. There will never be even a partial accounting for what happened in China. 

By the way, before giving too much credit to China for releasing the virus’s genome, check out the South China Morning Post article about how the same lab at Fudan university was shut down by the government the next day, for “rectification”."
2020-11-20 15:27,"Now that the enemy of mankind Donald Trump has been defeated, let's hope that reporting with respect to China can at the very least be neutral. We all get that the worse the impact of the virus in America, the worse Trump looks. A big challenge for everyone now is this buzzword misinformation. ""Unsubstantiated pandemic claims"" is a euphemism for misinformation. There's a lot we don't know about how a virus from Wuhan which has turned our world so upside down that we can't see gran for Thanksgiving. And now that the election is over, maybe it's time to be a bit more bareknuckle about China's role in this. While it's not proven that the virus escaped from a lab, it's also not proven the virus evolved and transmitted to humans wholly in nature. So to insist on that narrative (the it happened naturally narrative) is unsubstantiated as well. The facts we do know: China allowed int'l flights out of Wuhan, while domestic travel was restricted. China claimed in early days that the virus is not transmissible human to human: you can't say that was good faith, because at that point it already reached pandemic proportions in Wuhan. 

I think the dissonance on China really comes down to people who have spent time working or traveling in China, or on transactions with Chinese firms, and those who have only watched Mulan. There's the China Xi wants you to see, like his crackdown on corruption, and the one he doesn't, like jailing folks for 18 years for criticizing him. It's all one China."
2020-11-20 16:45,"Whether or not this was and is a conspiracy is important, but much less important than the elephant-in-the-room: this is now an entirely possible and plausible paradigm for international warfare or aggression. 

Countries that want the security of a nuclear deterrent or an destructive economic weapon without the price tag need only pay for a top-notch virology laboratory. It can even be engaged primarily in legitimate research, with squeaky clean directors (insofar as you subscribe to the idea of squeaky clean bioengineering) who are simply not in the loop in one little area of operations.

No doubt this is ""bad news"" for the preponderance of our military industry, who, one can only imagine, is happy to characterize this paradigm as unrealistic or conspiracy-based. But for all the countries - take North Korea, for example - who neither have the budget, the habit, the entrenched industrial interests, nor the the technology to go toe-to-toe with Lockheed, Boeing, GE, etc., why would they choose the expensive, old model if they can discreetly and affordably engineer their Goliath-killer for a relative pittance?

If we don't hear coverage of this, it is only reasonable to question whether someone's fingers are pressing on the scales of threat-assessment and newsworthiness."

He sure has a knack for finding Billionaires and convincing them to fund his political errands.  I thought he had money- guess not.  Reminds me of another grifter.

He's like Roger Stone, minus the narcissism, but plus a seeming big love for drinking.  And both are quite the Machiavellians, and clearly unstable and morally compromised.

Has he had enough meddling with the UK (Cambridge Analytica and Brexit) and the US (Breitbart, Cambridge Analytica, Trump)?  Italy kicked him out when he announced opening a training camp for far-Right operatives. Or is his global skullduggery just getting started?

Hope Biden's DOJ, the FBI- and now the CIA, since Bannon's  acting as a foreign agent (with Guo's money) or a private individual conducting foreign policy/operations."
2020-11-20 20:37,"I have watched many of these YouTube channels including Lu De’s.  It’s unbelievable how much far fetched outrageous misinformation they are spreading before and after the election.  They are amplifying Trump’s claims of voter fraud and feeding them to the Chinese community which unfortunately many of them don’t get their news from more reliable English sources.  They really don’t care anything else about Trump as long as he is anti China.  When you ignore the truth and lie about anything to fulfill your political agenda, you are no different from the Chinese communists who lie and brainwash their own people.

These people are abusing our freedom of speech and could potentially influence US politics with their misinformation. They are no friends to our country,."

Like we are not supposed to contest the official story coming out of China, after the epic repression and evasiveness that characterized their initial response to the virus?  

And you are now criticizing Bannon because he suggests that the virus could have been accidentally leaked from a lab - when we all know that is more than possible, and numerous intelligence services agree with him?

What, exactly, is your beef with Steve Bannon? 

His podcast is one of the most fact-based, data-based sources of information about the pandemic.  I have listened since the first episode aired in January.  He has given a voice to Chinese dissidents, and he has offered fact-based reality checks to official narratives spun for political reasons.  Exactly the opposite of what you claim in this article.  He's brilliant."

He pauses, remembers that he's talking to a child, and asks, ""Do you know what scruples are?"" Addie replies, ""No, Mose. But one thing's for sure: If you got 'em, they belong to somebody else!""

If Steve Bannon is flogging the notion that the virus started in a lab, you can be pretty sure he's got an ulterior motive, too--and that the whole idea is 100% bogus. Anybody who would take his word for anything is a big enough fool to...well, vote for Donald Trump!"

The US have been full of disciples of Goebbels these last few years, a bit like during their months-long mass propaganda paving the way for the illegal US war of aggression in Iraq, and this Bannon should be banned from every wannabe respectable social media and prevented from pushing his propagandist garbage outside of the US, and prevented to ever set a foot again abroad in countries where he tries to rally up the local far-right, fascists & neo-nazis with his Goebbelsian propaganda.

Has he not spread fake news behind the scene together with Breitbart in The Brexit debacle, the Hungarian and Polish unrest that brought their autocrats to power?  We are in for so much disinformation. Biden will have a difficult time as the elected President with people like Trump, Bannon, Pompeo, Rubio, and others who actually hate helping the average working person. The economy is for wall street and for them. 
Yet they get the average person to vote for them with fake news, disinformation. 
They support racists, supremasist. This tactic seems to work for the gullible.  They are pointing at others as trouble. They advertise lies saying the democrats are socialists and communists. Yet these people are using the help from communists and socialist countries like China, North Korea and Russia to spread the  fake news. Seems the me spreading disinformation and fake news works for them so it is here to stay as well as in the EU. Divide and conquer. 
There seems to be much effort to destroy the Social democracy in the EU and democracy here and where ever free speech exists around the world. If we are not careful autocrats and oligarchs will rule many countries. Trump is one of them."

The US encouraged and sheltered fringe elements of Chinese society such as Falun Gong, fundamental Christians, political agitators, and corrupt officials & businessmen in hope of using them to destabilize China.

The effort have been mostly fruitless as Beijing have no problem censoring everything and people cannot vote anyway. However these people found a willing audience in the US to ply their trade with the freedom and chaos inherent in an democratic society.

Now you have Falun Gong, fundamental Christians, Hong Kong/Taiwan/Tibet/Xinjiang independence movement all working together as a voting bloc and echo chamber.

I have been casually tracking some baseless rumors on YouTube since COVID and Sino-Indian border conflict. Nearly all the ridiculously inaccurate facts and rumor about China can be traced back to websites with link to the groups I mentioned about and Indian media.

The damage these groups caused in the US is far greater than any advantage the US have gain in supporting them against China. Now these people are in the US, participating in American politics, using “free press” to their greatest advantage and there is no system to shut them down."
