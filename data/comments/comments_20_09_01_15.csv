2020-09-15 12:02,"A laudable proposal, seems a bit on the low side, but the question I have is, why do certain billionaires get outsized media coverage?

Bill McKibben has been generating many laudable proposals in the area of climate change - but we rarely find him, an authority on the subject (unlike Gates), in the corporate media.

Giving our billionaire class the respect usually reserved by a society for prophets isn’t going to make reining in inequality any easier."
2020-09-15 12:13,"Bravo, to lawmakers finally returning to the days of seeking a middle ground. That’s democracy. 

Sure, this is substantially less than what I’d desire, but substantially more than what GOP seek to sign into law. 

That’s a compromise. It’s almost like we can begin open discussions again with people of different views. What a concept, these days."
2020-09-15 13:01,"The Democrats need to back this compromise, not because it adequately meets the dire needs of individuals, small businesses and local governments, but because the reality is the NEED is DIRE and ZERO is ZERO.
Failing to advocate for this compromise is also a political failure. Democrats can  walk and chew gum at the same time....Pelosi can make a speech stating what the need is and why specific sums are requested; that because Trump and McConnell  could care less about the financial distress caused by the pandemic Democrats must compromise to get any help whatsoever....and that adequate assistance will,only come only with a Democratic victory in November."
2020-09-15 13:09,"The problem has never been passing something through the house, where there are ample votes to pass anything if Pelosi gives the OK.  The problem is in the Senate, where there is a large contingent of Republicans who will vote no on anything and McConnell openly needs Democrats to pass anything but is offering only crumbs."
2020-09-15 13:17,"Meanwhile, people are going hungry and rent and bills are not being paid. How is that helping the economy, again?"
2020-09-15 13:35,The story about a bipartisan group of legislators proposing a 1.5 trillion dollar compromise to aid with the economy and the pandemic is doomed. The leaders of both parties are not interested in the country as much as their election prospects so reason and common sense cannot prevail. Both are saying It's my way or the highway. This is what our country has come to.
2020-09-15 13:42,I wouldn’t call the Problem Solvers Caucus a group of moderates. Tom Reed is on it and he is no moderate. He supports Trump’s policies.
2020-09-15 13:43,"No one can define the conditions for wearing masks and social distancing. It's apparently not flattening the curve. It's not a vaccine (since we know only a fraction of people will take a vaccine, same with contact tracing, most will object). My concern is that there are pervasive negative social consequences from this culture of safetyism and no one knows how to define success. If it's that we get to 0 deaths, the continuing collateral damages to society are going to be amazing."
2020-09-15 13:53,The only thing getting compromised here is the well-being of the American people. $600 worked. Why should the American people have to accept $450?
2020-09-15 14:22,"So long as it does NOT have liability protection for businesses!  THAT we cannot accept - protecting billionaires again from the cautious and prudent behavior they need to take in these times, the training they need to provide to establish safe protocols.  No to liability protection!"
2020-09-15 14:28,"Sorry but bailing out hotel investors on Wall Street will not save a single job.  It will just save the billionaire owners - and hurt the vulture investors currently licking their chops.  The bankruptcy and loan defaults of hotels will hurt those who own the hotels.  It will also provide opportunities for vulture investors to pick up those hotels for pennies in the dollar.  So it will be new owners for the assets.

The actual job numbers for hotel workers will not change with or without a bailout.  Those numbers are completely dependent on the number of hotel guest - not at all on who owns the hotels.  Even if one hotel is closed and workers fired, a new hotel will be opened if there are costumers.  The job market for hotel workers always has been and always will be dependent only on the number of guest."
2020-09-15 11:10,"Much credit to the Gates Foundation for calling for a global and equitable distribution of the vaccine based on population. I seriously doubt if this will happen. After all, we live in a neo-colonial world."
2020-09-15 13:19,"As a first requirement before any Democratic ""negotiation"" on a new bill, they should require the Senate to at least vote on what they passed months ago.    Let the Senators put put their names behind their positions for the People to see. Somehow the idea that only Senate plans require votes has to be buried in the ground once and for all."
2020-09-15 13:10,"Remember, Democrats passed their bill in May. That's what, 4 months ago? And Republicans in the Senate waited until the last possible minute to try and pressure Democrats. They couldn't care less about working Americans.

Read about Biden's proposal for economic relief should he be elected:

""Should Biden take the White House and get a Democratic Senate, it will likely all translate into an immediate push to roll back President Donald Trump’s corporate tax cuts, slap significantly higher taxes on wealthy Americans and push through a multitrillion-dollar stimulus spending package aimed at fighting the Covid-19 virus, sending cash directly into people’s pockets, renewing enhanced unemployment benefits, rescuing struggling state budgets and investing in new infrastructure projects.""

This will benefit ALL Americans, regardless of who you support, who you voted for, where you live. This is what caring about the country, rather than your party, looks like.

Biden on November 3. For ALL of our sake."
2020-09-15 10:54,"Having immigrated into this country this is the view I had of the United States almost as long as I remember - that Americans are most generous people in the world and a country that the rest of the world could depend on for any calamities. I distinctly remember how the US Navy stepped in to help those countries hit by a massive tsunami on Boxing Day a few years ago. But the America I live in has changed for the worse. The man in the White House thrives and propagates those tendencies. So Mr. Gates, might as well donate his own money and help poor countries with vaccinations. Perhaps Pfizer vaccines which are not bought up by the US government could be secured for distribution in poor countries."
2020-09-15 13:55,"I just emailed my House rep and Speaker Pelosi,  urging them to consider supporting this proposal. Americans need relief,  and Democrats need some better optics—the kind that will earn us votes in November."
2020-09-15 14:06,"The House Problem Solvers Caucus? The House isn't the problem. The House passed a stimulus package months ago. The problem is Mitch McConnell, full stop."
2020-09-15 14:33,How can an un-elected federal judge overturn the safety regulations enacted by a duly elected governor which were put in place in order to protect the health and lives of the citizens of the state? Can such a politically appointed individual have more power than a popularly elected governor?
2020-09-15 11:14,"Here’s a new concept Why don’t we ensure every person in the US is vaccinated first? 
We can also require anyone entering the US show proof of inoculated as well.  As to doubling foreign aid, let’s address the homeless epidemic in the US first.  When was the last or first time Bill Gates walked the streets of Seattle and saw the homeless?"
2020-09-15 13:23,"Read how the Chinese have gotten their economy back on track to full employment. They started with business, real estate and infrastructure investment. Then people got their jobs back. Now consumer spending is back. Smart, they actually got something for the debt they took on. Remember the only thing that really counts is long term solutions, the short term ones only dig a hole that is harder or impossible to get out if."
2020-09-15 12:54,"I just want Congress to compromise on SOMETHING soon -  even if it's not the ideal plan - rather than run the risk of no assistance at all. Those of us collecting unemployment or running a small business are hurting financially, and would be grateful for even a lower amount of aid at this point, before it's too late. Refusing to compromise and therefore accomplishing absolutely nothing are both irresponsible and ignorant of the needs of their constituents at a time when we need the help the most. Making us wait weeks on end while lawmakers went on their summer break is totally unacceptable."
2020-09-15 11:26,An example of how Pres Trump's judicial appointees will/can impact future generations. The nightmare continues. It will worsen and liberties will be further eroded or lost if he's re-elected.  Vote!
2020-09-15 12:40,"The United States has not been ""stung harder by the virus than any other country,"" the United States has stung itself. There is no valid excuse for the American failure to address the severe consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. 

And no, our failure at home cannot legitimately be blamed on China, notwithstanding whatever President Trump and his ill-health officials might claim from inside their smokescreens."
2020-09-15 14:00,"Didn’t this judge learn, as all law students do, that the government can impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on the exercise of our Constitutional rights under certain circumstances?  Such as to save lives.  

The most common example is “You can’t yell ‘fire’ in a crowded theatre” (unless there actually is a fire) — your free speech rights can properly be abridged in that circumstance to avoid a dangerous stampede, injury and loss of life. 

A deadly global pandemic causing massive loss of life and terrible illness is just the sort of exigency that rightly grounds temporary, reasonable time, place and/or manner restrictions on rights such as free speech and assembly.  So this decision is not only dangerous but in opposition to settled law. 

It is well known in legal circles that many of the judges installed by tRump are inexperienced and unfit. This judge certainly appears to fit that mold."
2020-09-15 13:11,"How about a one time Federal tax moratorium on 401 K withdrawals?   (with a limit on the amount withdrawn - maybe -$50,000?)"
2020-09-15 12:17,The thought that there are 50 centrist legislators left in America that can put petty pork belly politics aside long enough to actually mitigate suffering is the first ray of sunshine I have woken up to in weeks. Thanks for some hope for change!
2020-09-15 11:47,"We are dealing with world problems that cannot be resolved with 'nice but empty words' anymore. It's time for action, not individually as much as united as a force of good. For that to occur however, we must oust the current divider and science denier in-chief, Donald J. Trump, and his facilitator, Mitch McConnell, an obstructionist to any change worth its name. It's time, and depends on our will to dictate the necessary changes...and get to work. The voting booth seems a good start, so reason and common sense may be brought back from 'lalaland'."
2020-09-15 14:11,Bill Gates needs to be focusing on making sure the US vaccinations will be delivered. The US guarantee/warranty on effective government expired in 2017!
2020-09-15 14:58,"Now that is what making laws is all about.  Negotiation and Compromise.  It is about meeting in the middle where neither Party gets 100% of what they want, yet SOMETHING is being done for the people whom they represent, the people who count in maintaining a functioning and healthy - both figuratively and literally- democracy.  Kudos to the House Problem Solvers Caucus.  I say let this proposal grow from ""little chance of becoming law"" to Law.  There is everything to gain and nothing to lose.  And let us not forget this November the failure of a Senate under Mitch McConnell's so-called ""leadership."""
2020-09-15 10:49,"Why don’t you provide the $4 billion? Sincerely, Working Poor 62 year old female"
2020-09-15 12:27,"The “centrists” are at it again.

So reasonable, so calm, so... inadequate.

The centrist fire department comes and puts out half the fire ravaging your house.

The centrist bank gives you half the mortgage you need to buy a home.

The centrist plumber comes and fixes half a leak.

Do you say thanks?

Decades of “reasonable” centrism has given us a government incapable of actually accomplishing anything. Worse, it shields do-nothing Republics from the consequences of sitting on their hands. “I didn’t want to spend this money,” the Republics say, after the centrists pour cash into fixing half a problem. “And now, after all this money, the problem is still there. I told you the government can’t do anything.”

Obamacare is a perfect example. To satisfy the “centrists,” instead of a normal healthcare system like other rich countries, we have an absurd kludge that fixes part of the problem, is still absurdly expensive, doesn’t cover everyone, and is stupidly complex. Ten years on, Republics are still trying to repeal it. Great compromise, centrists.

The Obama stimulus act is another. Too small to quickly pull us out of the great recession (but big enough to help a bit), it allowed Republics to complain that Democrats wasted money for nothing and that the government can’t do anything right. Good job, Dems!

Go away centrists. Fixing a problem halfway is worse than not fixing it and gives cover to the anti-government right. 

Do it right or don’t do it at all."
2020-09-15 15:21,"Maybe if House Democrats include a provision to name even more military bases after Confederate traitors or even propose a monument to Confederate traitors on the Mall in DC, they can convince Republicans to give aid to Americans in need."
2020-09-15 13:08,"I respect science. Which is why I wholeheartedly embrace Trump eating so much fast food. Science, along with his bloated visage, tells us he is only steps away from a massive coronary."
2020-09-15 14:54,"Pennsylvania has a governor, Wolf, who puts public health and safety above politics! Thanks Governor Wolf of Pennsylvania. South Carolina has a governor, McMaster, who is loathe to do anything but mouth platitudes. The Lt. Gov. of South Carolina, Pamela Everette, supposedly and astute business woman, just took her husband and her two children to a SC Nascar event at Darlington, SC where practically nobody had a mask on and she got Covid 19. But not to worry, Pamela says, because hers is a mild case. But Pamela there are 3 other people in your immediate family and presumably your children have grandparents who are even much more vulnerable because they are older. This is what we have to deal with in South Carolina, too small and republican to be well informed, too large to be an insane asylum."
2020-09-15 11:52,I’m done having to beg red states to send a little of our own tax dollars back to my own state.  Why do I pay federal taxes to a government who has abandoned my state?
2020-09-15 14:34,"While Trump appointed scads of ""pro life"" judges he also slipped in a ""right to assemble and die"" one. Wonder  if this judge goes to Trump rallies with his mask at home?"
2020-09-15 12:09,"Please reengage Madam Speaker. If you  embrace most of this deal you put the burden squarely on the White House and Senate and maybe bring some relief to the people. 

I’d have to see the details on “employer and worker protections” but could be palatable given how little OSHA is doing today. 

Half a loaf."
2020-09-15 12:34,"Ronald Reagan’s “government is the problem” is now a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Grover Norquist’s “drown government in a bathtub” is now a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Donald Trump’s “ I alone can fix it”; “I don’t take responsibility at all”; “it is what it is” are now official United States government policy."
2020-09-15 14:03,"Oh goody, the centrists. I will absolutely hold my breath and wait to be saved by history’s most courageous faction."
2020-09-15 14:24,"Good for these group of people willing to compromise. It almost certainly this or nothing. Of course, it won’t pass because compromise, the key to democratic self-government, is now repugnant to tens of millions of Americans. If this attitude doesn’t change, our republic is doomed."
2020-09-15 14:40,No immunity for corporations. The democrats need to make this a dealbreaker.
2020-09-15 13:19,I’m not saying that America desperately needs this aid but amazing how well Conservatives get together when they stand to loose the upcoming election.
2020-09-15 14:52,"May Judge Stickman never be infected by the Covid-19.  

Perhaps the Chief Justice of the Federal Supreme Court, Roberts, will have to eat his words of how the Courts are not Political, not Democrat or Republican.  Judges like Stickman prove Roberts wrong.

What right does someone have during this crisis of a Pandemic to intentionally spread this deadly infection, just because they want to party, not wear masks, social distance or wash their hands?
And how ironic is it that it is Republicans bringing these suits.  
This just proves the point that that the Republicans could give a fig about the general populace, with the exception of a few of the Republican Governors, like Gov. Baker of Massachusetts and DeWine.

Governor Wolf is the Leader of Pennsylvania.  His rules should be followed, not Judge Stickman's ruling.  After all, Wolf's main edict is to protect all Citizens of Pennsylvania, not just some citizens.

Selfishness and power seems to be what rules Judge Stickman."
2020-09-15 15:46,"The bipartisan compromise proposal makes a lot of sense which likely means it is dead on arrival. Pelosi's statement they the House will remain in session until agreement with the White House and Senate is reached is welcome news. Now she and the White House need to back that up with compromise legislation which will satisfy only the American people who need it. The election for them, not the interests of ordinary Americans, is the major consideration."
2020-09-15 16:06,"Yes, the center needs to reassert itself, but I doubt it has time to do it before the election, or if it has time to do it at all."
2020-09-15 16:07,"A compromise halfway between barely anything and what people need will leave people with half of what they need.

What's the point?

House should reject this and remind McConnell he can let the Senate vote on the the Heroes act passed by the House in May whenever he wants.

Get the people and states what they need."
2020-09-15 16:15,"""Pelosi says the House will not leave for the November elections without acting on another stimulus measure.""

Good for her. 

As for the centrists' proposal, at least it's a real compromise. Of course, that won't appeal to the McConnell Republicans who prefer to bargain in bad faith. The Democrats indicated their willingness to compromise by splitting the difference between their initial bill of three months ago and the belated Republican response. It goes without saying that the initial Democratic bill would have protected incomes, food, housing, public schools, etc. whereas the Republican response included a corporate tax break and liability protections for negligent corporations."
2020-09-15 16:18,"Since the main boulder is McConnell, why wouldn’t House [speaker] discuss with him and come up with a veto-proof bill? But we know MoscowMitch is not for doing anything that might help the people. 

Boot him out - of KY or wherever."
2020-09-15 16:20,"Does Bill Gates not understand that their are poor people without access to health care here in the United States?

Is he so sheltered in his Seattle Castle that he doesn’t see the hunger and suffering here?"
2020-09-15 16:25,"Time to the People to revoke that judge’s life time appointment, in permanent fashion."
2020-09-15 16:37,"If we are honest, even the original 3 trillion in the Heroes Act was inadequate.  So I find it bizarre that after the Republican negotiating tactic is to reduce their proposal from 1 trillion to about half that, there are House Dems who think they can compromise with these fools who are literally burning down the house.  A total derangement of sound policy is the route the GOP has chosen.  In view of this, and their president's announcement yesterday that he has permission to become as vicious as he chooses in his campaigning, the Democrats need to stick to their guns as the only adults in sight."
2020-09-15 16:38,"So Trump abdicates his responsibilities and leaves the decisions to fight the virus to the states, then his party fights those decisions in court. This way he can’t be blamed, he is free to blame others and his judges won’t contradict him. What a great way to never lose an argument."
2020-09-15 16:38,I am good on all of it except bailing out the states who have been mismanaged well before COVID. Their retirement plans are not the rest of the countries problem.
2020-09-15 15:25,"$1.5 Trillion does not come close to the needs of We the People during a virus that has killed more Americans than every war after WWII combined.

If this is what ""Centrists"" think is a good plan, that explains why we are polarized.

Sometimes doing little is more extreme than doing too much.

The Center needs to be less extreme!

The Center and the Left need to until against the Right, because the Right is letting people die.

What did you say, even Republicans wouldn't let people die?

Go watch the video of the 2010 Republican debates where the moderator was asking whether a man who neglected to buy health insurance and would not for should get hello from the government.

Someone in the audience of PROMINENT Republicans yelled ""LET HIM DIE,"" and the room erupted in cheers and applause!

That was their promise to Americans die.

PROMISE FULFILLED!"
2020-09-15 15:35,"Even though I typically side with the left, I think this stimulus package is something that they should probably be a bit more willing to negotiate on.  The conservative party is defined by penny-pinching, so them not agreeing to the 3 trillion dollar amount doesn't seem that unheard of.  But, IMO, the left looks bad when they continue to let Americans go with nothing by refusing to negotiate with a party defined by being conservative."
2020-09-15 16:02,"One wonders why Pelosi didn’t insist on including more protections for workers and state governments way back when the Republics would have passed anything in order to bail out their corporate pals. 

Now what’s her leverage? The good of the country? Good luck with that."
2020-09-15 16:06,So they're afraid of facing constituents in the absence of more coronavirus economic relief? There is an alternative. They can all resign thus precluding any further public-contact embarrassment.
2020-09-15 16:20,"Keep it up, Speaker Pelosi. Show the American people that we come first, that our health and welfare are what keep and maintain a functioning democracy. Shame Mitch McConnell and his colleagues taking up precious space in the Senate. Let it be revealed that thinking, and caring, Americans are on to this present majority “leader’s” agenda focused on bettering the greedy and Wall Street. Please take care of those whose lives and livelihoods are daily being threatened by this pandemic and recent environmental devastation. This present paradigm simply can not be allowed to continue."
2020-09-15 15:49,"I doubt there will be any relief package anytime soon.

   In April the GOP senators allowed the passage of a COVID relief package that expired on July 31. This time around,, already 6 weeks after expiration,, the GOP is finally getting around to negotiating a ""skinny"" relief package. Talk about a day late and a dollar short.  Call me a cynic. The first relief package was passed and timed to tide the country over to the end of July, at which point a reassessment of Trump's chance of winning was made. 

How does this translate into a Trump loss?

  If the GOP senators had believed Trump was likely to win, there would have been a relief package  already passed prior to expiration.
  The GOP senators have already thrown up their hands and believe Trump will lose, thus want to leave the largest mess that it is possible to have for Biden.

In September 2008, the largest crash since the crash of 1929 doomed McCain.
In September 2020, 200,000 needlessly COVID dead Americans and an economy running at Great Depression Era level ""should"" doom trump."
2020-09-15 15:33,"This should have happened MONTHS ago, back in May. I'm not impressed by either party with their handling of this - where was this refusal to go anywhere without a deal BEFORE their recent recess? 

People continue to suffer and you all go on recess? No excuse for the handling of this from either side. Grow up, start earning your 6 figure salaries and get it done."

Our nation is a wreck and I am exhausted and depressed by all of it: dysfunctional government, divided people, inherent racism, cancel culture, lousy healthcare system, journalism that doesn’t call a lie a lie, journalism that navel gazes, journalism that allowed all of this to happen because circus clowns sell.

2020-09-15 12:40,"This is not ample common ground.  This is Pelosi again trying to bail out the pension funds.  Those pension funds have been in trouble for years, and it has nothing to do with the pandemic."
2020-09-15 12:48,"Let’s hope the moderate path forward succeeds. Millions of Americans are in the verge of losing their homes and are having to choose between paying utility bills or for food. On the flip side, it would be close to criminal if Mr. Barrack, who has played fast and loose with mega-loans, were bailed out. Let him go bankrupt like ordinary Americans would; let him sell his property assets. Give that money to ordinary Americans who really need it."
2020-09-15 13:08,"That compromise bill from lawmakers seems reasonable and would definitely show that the financial crisis millions of American families aren’t ignored. My fear is that the Democratic leadership is seeing anything done as a win for Trump. 
But Democrats should be very carefully not to play that strategy because the frustration of millions of people feeling that both parties aren’t doing anything for them will lead to a lack of participation in the next elections and might not be a good thing for democratic candidates.
Struggling Americans and businesses are already furious how Congress left them in the dust in August before going on vacation, if that happens again, I am convinced it will have a political impact"
2020-09-15 13:11,I hope every Republican fighting agains common-sense Covid 19 laws contract and pass due to the virus. Either you stand with humanity in this great time of crisis or you don’t. Governors MUST be allowed to impose regulations in times of crisis.
2020-09-15 14:37,"It is insane that the bipartisan House Problem Solvers aren't leading the parade on this.

It is critical that this pandemic support be provided. And if the extremists in both parties prevent that, they need to be held accountable.

And I mean Democrats as much as Republicans."
2020-09-15 16:56,Democrats shouldn't give Trump any help on the economy before the election. The Republicans certainly wouldn't help an  incumbent Democrat.  Any stimulus should take effect after the November election.
2020-09-15 17:25,"Very reasonable proposal by the centrist lawmakers. The $500 billion covers the expected shortfall in both state and local government revenues through 2022 (this according to the Times own reporting). I've never understood why the Democrats proposed $900 billion--it does look like a pension bailout for blue states. The proposal for extended unemployment benefits gives Democrats more than 75% of what they asked for. Plenty of funding for other areas as well. Should Democrats sweep the presidency, House, and Senate in November, they can always revisit additional stimulus if they feel it's necessary in the New Year. I don't see why Democrats wouldn't jump at this if they really care about the average American. I can see why Republicans might balk a bit at the price tag. The money the Republicans have proposed for state/local governments at least covers most revenue losses through this year. I can see why they might want to wait and see if the economy recovers faster than expected before offering the full $500 billion--that could still be funded later. The unemployment benefits are also more than Republicans offered, but not by much (they offered $400). Republicans should also give a bit to help average working Americans--especially because they're the ones who put Trump in office. Come on legislators--compromise and get this stimulus package done!"
2020-09-15 17:48,"If we've already 'flattened the curve' and we get a vaccine and only 30-40% of people are willing to take it, are we supposed to wear masks in perpetuity?"
2020-09-15 17:52,"Sorry to say it but the idea of the Democrats giving McConnell and Trump a big win ahead of the election is insanity.
People are suffering, so Pelosi et al. must hold out for a bill that THEY would see as a win for the American people.  It should probably include entitlement to free healthcare for anyone out of work, or otherwise unable to get insurance cover at no personal expense, for example.
But the correct negotiating tactic is to start with the bill the House passed, and each time the Republican Senate rejects it, send it back with MORE provisions for helping out ordinary Americans, not businesses.  NOT ‘compromise’, which at a time like this is the worst of both worlds."
2020-09-15 17:07,"The judge in Pennsylvania apparently believes that we can't prohibit shouting ""Fire"" in a crowded theatre because it is unconstitutional, even if hundreds get trampled in the stampede.  An insane ruling, I don't care what the judge's politics are."
2020-09-15 17:40,"I'm grateful for the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, standing her ground, attempting to protect the majority of Americans who are under assault by the GOP and acts of nature. If the government will not help the masses then this country will surely fall into an avoidable depression and not be very pleasant for even the one-percenters."
2020-09-15 18:01,"Either Republican Senators are living in a bubble, or they are simply afraid to go against McConnell and the President.

If you set aside all of the drama and politics, the economics of where we are - and where we are going - is crystal clear...

If most of American consumers do not get help soon...they will stop consuming.

Add to that a delayed, perhaps very volatile post-election time period, further exhausting the public and increasing fear and anxiety; not to mention continued suffering...for most American families.

Then we enter the most critical time period of economic stimulus to our economy...the Christmas season. 

Consumer won't be consuming. Because they won't be spending. Because they won't have the funds - or the confidence - to spend; thus plunging our economy further into recession, or more likely...depression.

Is this the Republican Party's intention? Do they not see that the stimulus funds they refuse to spend now - our money, taxpayer's money - will be spent many times over in social services and healthcare via a depression?

This isn't rocket science...so, are they living in a bubble? Or looking to hand a broken country to Democrats? 

Or do they simply...not care?

Spoiler alert Senators...it's our money. And we need it now."
2020-09-15 17:25,"As a senior citizen and a lifelong Pennsylvanian, I have strongly supported the efforts of our governor, Tom Wolf, in the actions he’s taken to curtail the Covid-19 pandemic. Our commonwealth has suffered about 150,000 confirmed cases of the virus and nearly 8000 lives have been lost to it.
I’ve been proud of the willingness displayed by those around me — wearing masks in public, using the handcleaner and paper towels provided at the entrances to businesses.
Although I’m a strong proponent of protecting my constitutional rights, I have never felt (not once!) that compliance with PA’s pandemic regulations impinged on them. 
I’m in good health, but I am getting close to seventy years old. I’m grateful to every young person who’s protecting folks like me from this terrible disease.

So. My congressman, Mike Kelly and others have elicited a ruling from Trump-appointed Judge Stickman that declares some of Governor Wolf’s actions “unconstitutional.”
Some Republicans are calling for the governor’s impeachment. 
I believe this is known as an “election-year political circus.”

The following statement should set off an alarm in the mind of every clear-thinking citizen:
“Mr. Trump, at an event in Arizona, celebrated the decision, calling it a ‘great ruling.’”

If the president, who has so often displayed profound ignorance of the rule of law, calls a decision handed down by a judge — “a great ruling” — what are the chances that it is?"
2020-09-15 17:03,"As the US Senate is wont to have a prop mounted on an easel, it would be wise for the Democrats to have one and only one slide containing these  two details:

2020-09-15 17:24,Republicans in Congress are a lost cause; they’re compromised by the Trump-McConnell-Putin cult. But it’s also sad that we are applauding Democratic lawmakers for doing the bare minimum effort while compromising everything (again!) and not taking yet another vacation (recess). Where is the fight?
2020-09-15 18:37,"I surely hope that congress can help my fellow Americans in need. 
I check the Covid data for my area in Missouri and I watch it rise daily. No mask ordinance locally because we have a spineless local government and no mask mandate because we have a spineless GOP governor. 
105,000 plus Covid cases in Missouri and so many of my fellow Missourians out of work and ill or dead. 
And the Covid numbers predicted to hit terribly high marks this fall and winter. 
Will I be able to stay alive? See my adult children again? My grandkids again? Will we be able to keep our house? Will my husband with asthma make it? 
So many scary questions that Americans are asking themselves because Trump lied and did nothing. 
We could be like other developed nations on the other side of this but Trump not only lied, BUT DID NOTHING. 
Thank you, Speaker Pelosi, for your efforts."
2020-09-15 20:01,Michael Caputo's apology is nothing  more that Trump theater.  There is no way a person at Caputo's level in the government would make his statement without first clearing it with the President.  It was meant to send the message that the scientists are enemies of the Trump Administration and that their concerns about Coronavirus is politically motivated.   Any Other President would have immediately fired him.
2020-09-15 19:36,"""Michael R. Caputo, the assistant secretary of health for public affairs, apologized Tuesday morning to Health Secretary Alex M. Azar II and his staff for a Facebook outburst in which he accused federal scientists working on the pandemic of “sedition” and warned of coming violence from left-wing “hit squads.”""

An apology?  How timely.  Unfortunately, Mr. Caputo, once you say something like that in a Facebook video, the cat's out of the bag.  An apology changes nothing.  The conspiracy theorists who populate your channel, and the far corners of the internet, will assume, and propagate the notion that your apology was coerced by the so-called ""deep state."""

2020-09-15 19:32,"Caputo should not ""consider"" taking a leave of absence, but rather be placed on a leave of absence for the incendiary and reckless comment he made on his personal Facebook page.

To state that ""anti-Trumpers formed a “resistance unit"" and that he urged ""his gun-owning followers to buy ammunition because “it’s going to be hard to get” and warned that left-wing hit squads across the nation were training for violent attacks"" clearly points to an individual who is in desperate need of professional care.

Once again, Trump only hires ""the very best"" . . ."
2020-09-15 19:36,"So Michael Caputo says “my bad” after doing his boss’s bidding? 

It’s out there now, the threat of Election Night violence a further ripping of the national fabric. His usefulness is complete now, having cast official doubt on government scientists—those that are left, anyway—as well as painting a scene of armed militia and camos and rifles and blood in the streets. The president got someone to fall on his sword—except himself, something at which he’s expert.

Who can’t see through this?"
2020-09-15 19:41,Michael R. Caputo’s exhibition demonstrates his poor impulse control and low frustration tolerance; he is unfit and need not consider resignation as he should resign just as quickly as his Facebook outburst.
2020-09-15 20:04,"Caputo is thinking now of taking a leave from his HHS position because of physical health reasons? It is amazing how quickly arsonists start a fire, run away and then watch it burn. 

I would ask who was responsible for hiring him but we can guess with 100% accuracy."
2020-09-15 20:05,"It is good that Michael Caputo apologized for accusing ""...federal scientists working on the pandemic of “sedition” and warned of coming violence from left-wing “hit squads.” --

But the apology is not nearly enough to make things right. His misdeeds of yesterday have potentially violent consequences.

Mr, Caputo's facebook post, and its insidious digital offspring and person-to-person rumor mill are now integrated into the malignant fantasies of many, many true-believers in Trump's base, who may view this as essentially a call to arms.

Moral and civic considerations require that he and Messrs Azar, Redfield and Trump get on TV and denounce this, over and over again today.

Alas, methinks that is unlikely"
2020-09-15 19:38,"Mr. Caputo must resign immediately. His comments on Sunday, accusing government scientists of sedition, claiming, without evidence, that left-wing hit squads are preparing for armed insurrection, and encouraging gun owners to ""buy ammunition...because it's going to get hard to get"", are nothing less than a high federal government official inciting armed violence and encouraging supporters of Mr. Trump to believe that any election result in which Trump loses is illegitimate. No physical illness or emotional distress can excuse these comments. He must resign immediately, and congress must investigate his attempts to politicize the CDC."
2020-09-15 20:07,"“He is considering a leave of absence to address physical health problems, according to one source familiar with the situation.“

What about Caputo’s obvious mental health problem?  He needs professional help, badly."
2020-09-15 19:39,How about Caputo apologize and resign for the damage he has done to the public trust?
2020-09-15 19:45,"Caputo needs more than a health check.  He should never have been appointed in the first place, to attempt to determine what is appropriate  scientific evidence from lifetime, lifelong scientists who have multiple, advanced degrees, who have been doing this work at CDC for decades for our country and the world to prevent epidemics.

Further, he is an ""alleged"" PR person, who should never have been appointed with a questionable background of cavorting around with a questionable Russian operative, and Roger Stone, a dirty tricks specialist, back from the Nixon era!"
2020-09-15 20:02,"I would not be at all surprised if the next thing we hear from the president is that Caputo has done such a wonderful job on behalf of the administration that he will replace Mike Pence on the Republican ticket. After all, then Caputo’s sole responsibility would be to gaze adoringly at Trump at all times, a low-stress job for a very high-loyalty kind of guy."
2020-09-15 18:19,"Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the House would not leave for the November elections without acting on an additional round of aid. Really!  That's what, six whole weeks. Weren't they out practically the entire summer, including at the onset of the lockdowns, the great lady herself home showing off her ice cream.  Staying just long enough for that first crucial bailout legislation to secure a few crumbs for the desperate after making sure the markets were okay."
2020-09-15 19:40,"Re Caputo:  Sorry, an apology isn't enough.  At any other reasonably functioning organization, security would have come and escorted him out of the building - yesterday.
That he's still there says it all."
2020-09-15 18:43,"I agree that hospitalizations and deaths should be factored together with positive virus cases to give the true scope of the pandemic. But the high positive rates we are seeing now in many parts of the country are very troubling. Even though the average age for virus infections has fallen and many don’t require hospitalization, these people will inevitably come into direct or indirect contact with more vulnerable populations. There are many, many elderly people and those with preexisting conditions that could still die by contracting COVID-19. This should worry everyone. 

The US already has the highest number of deaths in the world due to gross mismanagement and lies by this administration. This plus with the tendency of right-wing Trumpers to dismiss science (likely because they don’t fully understand it) has brought us to this point. 

We have to bring infection rates down, exercise caution until a vaccine is available and remove Trump and his incompetent team from power because they are ultimately responsible for this mess."
2020-09-15 19:17,"""Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the House would not leave for the November elections without acting on an additional round of aid.""

Correct me if I'm wrong, the House has a bill that the Senate has not voted on ( among hundreds of others).  Why would Pelosi negotiate until the Senate first rejected the existing bill? 

Also, can Pelosi please confirm the Democrats non-negotiables, like perhaps  no get-out-of-jail card for corporations and business that are sued; no more money for big corporations, airlines, hotels.  I already know their one hard stop, which they stated in the last negotiation with Mnuchin: nothing under $2 Trillion.  Unless, of course they have already caved on that."
2020-09-15 19:51,Let's all get together and save Trump's hotelier donor buddies from their Wall Street gambling problem. Surely they'll rehire their employees and restore their health benefits if we cover their debt and give them operating capital.

That is where he came from and as he is a Roger Stone protege, it will be a top level job."
2020-09-15 19:40,"So...Mr Caputo announces on Facebook that CDC scientists are undermining this administration’s agenda and committing treason at the same time Trumpers should get their ammo together in preparation for an armed defense of Trump if he loses, yet he announces in mainstream media that he is wrong and may take a leave of absence.  Why not announce his leave the same Facebook feed?"

There is no doubt in my mind that this is a deliberate tactic used to inflame drumpf's base. The bell is rung, the seed is sown, & the toothpaste is all over social media. No apologies or retractions will kill the beast. There needs to be serious consequences for these people who are perfectly willing to lie & humiliate themselves in service to their orange master (& his master/s)."

Meanwhile other countries are opening up because their governments encouraged their citizens to conform to health protocols early."

He's doesn't just need a mental health break, he needs to be out of government with the rest of the Trumpian oligarchy."
2020-09-15 20:25,"Apology my eyes. The right-wing party in Germany has been using the same tactics: create an outrage, then backpaddle slightly. The seed is sown among the ones who are receptive to it. They tune out any “apology” or “clarification”. Words cannot be made unsaid, and this guy in particular - a political communications mercenary with a track record in Russia and the Ukraine, of all places - know that full well. Trump and his followers are setting charges within our society. Plain and simple."

2020-09-15 20:03,"Michael Caputo is using “leave of absence” as a get-out-of-jail free card. I hope law enforcement and elected officials don’t let him get away with this, because he will likely continue endangering the public while drawing a paycheck from US taxpayers. “Stress” is not an excuse for hiding bodies. Like other clowns on the right, he uses facebook and twitter as a free-play zone where he can defame and incite violence among thousands or millions of followers, because it all somehow doesn’t count in cyberspace.

It’s not “social media”; it’s “antisocial media”, and the publishers need to be held accountable because this medium is being exploited by bad actors who are encouraging people to stay in areas flooded by wildfire, to take maskless children to Qanon rallies, or to arm themselves against their neighbors, under the illusion that they are fighting utterly phantasmagoric threats.

Michael Caputo is as far as I understand it (and I am not a legal expert), breaking the law. He should be in a courtroom for inciting riot, harassment and criminal negligence regarding the science he is hiding on COVID-19. People will die because he is concealing vital public health information. He should have the chance to defend himself and seek civic redemption; but this behavior has to be stopped in the interest of public health and economic recovery."

“ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), known as a trustworthy scientific publication. Its high standards of evidence and its reliability have made it an important source of data for clinicians and public health researchers for decades.

That reputation is now at risk. According to recent news reports, the (spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, Michael Caputo — a political appointee and protege of Roger Stone who worked as a consultant for President Trump — has tried to force the CDC to delay the MMWRs and coerce the CDC into altering wording on its findings. He has also demanded that the CDC retract published MMWR articles. Caputo’s rationale has been that CDC scientists are part of a “deep state” opposed to Trump’s reelection and that the reports contradict Trump’s statements about covid-19 and make him look bad. “

the idea of the fascists is to discredit science and bring disrepute to the entire scientific community as weak under political pressure by the fascists and create panic in the minds of the public, specially among the illiterate trump voters to cause chaos during the election and use the confusion to steal yet another election win for trump !"

The racists in trumpland think that since it's ONLY affecting POC then we need not to worry but let the truth be known that trump and republicans are killing whites and their own base too. Every time trump holds a super spreader, he's killing or sickening his own voters. Democrats aren't there, his own voters are there. I know people are saying if they die then that's less dummies but the ones that live are spreading it to innocent people.

So glad the Democrats are still working on behalf of Americans as usual. Pelosi is moving full speed ahead and likely prepping for a new administration. Meanwhile, republicans are doing nothing except lying to people which is their only job at this point. 

If the republicans had the votes, they wouldn't need to purge voters off of voter rolls, destroy the post office, replace elected democrats with republicans or lessen their power if they're elected, they wouldn't need to gerrymander to steal votes from Dems and more.

It's well proven that people below the poverty level spend 90% or more of the money that comes into their household.  Americans who have lost their jobs to the Trump Virus and can't pay their bills will put 100% of any money going into their households back into the economy just to keep their homes and feed their families.

What better way to stimulate the economy than help Americans who have suffered misfortune, as any stimulus package helps all Americans?

Republicans know these facts, they simply have no concern for Americans who aren't as rich as they are."

I don’t understand why the press, including the NYTimes, refuses to come out and say what is the evident and obvious conclusion about the consuming lies that Trump and his minions continue to repeat and sometimes make up in public, which is that under standard psychiatric guidelines they are either all suffering delusions or they are intentionally lying to the American people.  Simple. The press needs to stop repeating the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. That’s the definition of insanity."

People who still can't imagine how Donald Trump managed to grab so much power for himself have no idea how devoted his followers are, and how willfully ignorant on some subjects like climate change, race, and Covid management. some of them are threatening revolutions and to bring out their guns if Biden wins. There's threats of violence on both sides sometimes, to be fair, but the majority of overt threats come from people who support Donald Trump.  It is terrifying."

How about Michael Caputo apologize to the entire nation for raising a dangerous false flag, likely raising the chance of armed conflict among Americans after or in the run-up to the presidential election and thus weakening our country, and scaring or needlessly alarming tens or hundreds of millions of our fellow countrymen/women??

He did the exact opposite of what a public health official, let alone one serving in a public affairs capacity, let alone the chief of public affairs ought do.  He should seek and receive professional mental health care, in addition to care for whatever “physical health” problems he may have.  And regardless of a promise to seek such care, he should resign or, more appropriately, be fired, not just take a (presumably, paid) leave of absence; as he appears to be NOT “otherwise qualified.”"

The GOP is, as of now, composed of small minded people who are more concerned about being in power, keeping America white, and satisfying rich donors.  I guess that power is as good as respect if you can't get the latter and this administration and the GOP members of Congress have not earned our respect at all.  

They would prefer to see us impoverished, desperate, or dead.  Dead people have no complaints and don't talk back.

Does he understand that the MMWR reported facts, not politics or spin, and that people relied on it to get plain facts about patterns of disease in the US?  I think not.

This is the Trump -- aka conservative Republican -- playbook: Get a bunch of crazy loonies like Caputo to scream and yell about the ""deep state"" so that seasoned and experienced professionals flee to jobs where they won't be regularly attacked for doing their work.   The goal -- gut the federal government and especially the agencies and programs that comprise the fabric which is our social welfare system."

2020-09-15 22:39,"Mr. Caputo can get long term rest and recuperation in a Federal Correctional Institution close to Washington DC in lovely, bucolic Butler, PA."
2020-09-15 23:16,Caputo should be 1) ashamed 2) committed as delusional and 3) fired.
2020-09-15 23:41,Remember Trump only hirers the best people.
2020-09-15 23:47,"The Sisters of Charity at my Catholic School taught us that one should think before you act and if you made a mistake apology, but it should be rare and heart felt since you should never put yourself into that situation by your unthinking. Caputo apology is a joke this man like Stone, Miller, Trump and Barr are vile reptiles (probably a slur on reptiles sorry). He makes himself like all of them to and the base as the victims. Yes, I believe there are armed groups right wing racists which Barr just ignores. Interesting there is a whislteblower complaint against Wolf at Homeland Security over that fact and also about being told not to write reports about the Russians. Murphy the whistleblower can't be demonized by Barr or Trump since he is a card carrying conservative who voted for Trump. Caputo needs to go, I love he admits he never read any of the reports on one hand, but he was haunted by the covid dead. Gee, I thought Trump said only 1,900 died and they weer all old anyway. One common factor in the Trump administration is the number of his favorites who have mental health issues. Here is one the media never seems to discuss when he bragged about the test they gave him last November and how smart he is - that is a test that is employed after one has had a stroke and he did have one tiny one. I have relatives that have them. Look at pictures from then and his eyes and why he grabs rails when he walks. Caputo has nightmares must be of himself."
2020-09-15 23:37,"Caputo may be deranged, as he, himself, has admitted. As a society, we may or may not hold him accountable, directly, for that reason. He probably needs help.

On the other hand, I blame Trump and his administration of assorted conmen, traitors and white supremacists. They've gone way out of their way to find vulnerable individuals who are vaguely qualified to carry out Trump's evil work.

Trump and his entire administration, current and former, need to be put on trial for crimes against humanity."
2020-09-15 23:04,"Caputo Apologizes. Oh, to his boss. To save his job and his paycheck. When is he going to actually apologize to the American people? When is he going to apologize to the scientists whose reputation, careers and character he maligned? He should be fired immediately. Why is the American taxpayer forced to pay the salary for this known Russian agent?"
2020-09-15 23:41,"“Then on Monday, The Times reported that a Facebook presentation by Mr. Caputo the previous night was filled with bizarre and incendiary comments. He had attacked C.D.C. scientists as anti-Trumpers who had formed a “resistance unit,” engaged in “rotten science” and “haven’t gotten out of their sweatpants” except for coffee shop meetings where they plotted against the president.  He urged his gun-owning followers to buy ammunition because “it’s going to be hard to get” and warned that left-wing hit squads across the nation were training for violent attacks. “

Yep sure sounds like a trump supporter."
2020-09-15 21:32,"""... a leave of absence, to address physical health problems ...""

He may want to look on the mental health side of the ledger."
2020-09-15 22:04,"Caputo accomplished the damage that he wanted to:  riling the right-wing base before the election.  

His posts were a transparent hoax from a skilled propagandist, who spent years working in Russian media and helping Vlad with his image.

Don't believe a single word he says."
2020-09-15 22:04,Caputo's the sanest one in Trump's administration.  Leaves one to wonder how out of it the rest of them are including Don the Con himself.
2020-09-15 22:35,"Be afraid, be very afraid!!
Caputo is expressing out loud what trump has refrained from doing- a step too far even for this monster devoid of most scrupules.
He’s certainly not repudiating him nor is the GOP. We are headed in the direction of civil war."
2020-09-15 22:47,"This Trump sycophant has one thing right; If Trump tries to steal the election with lies, trickery, and not counting peoples votes, there will be widespread rioting. It will be justified if Trump tries to steal the election."
2020-09-15 22:00,it is outrageous that Caputo is earning a federal salary with this behavior. that is our tax dollars supporting his recklessness.
2020-09-15 22:25,"To vote these horrific,incredibly, willfully, bad intentioned people out should be each responsible citizens’ duty. To incite atrocities seems to be their main goals and they thrive on it.   One big, bigmouth started this behavior before and during the last election and look what condition America is now.  We have never seen so many disrespectful,ill-mannered people proud to leave all morality aside. The actions and decisive language used by this leader and his cohorts spreads like a virus, and like the virus it isn’t going away and is deadly."
2020-09-15 22:48,"So if someone in government ever wrote a pro-Hillary email to their friend, that disqualifies their entire professional career, especially any checks they may have placed on the Trump administration.  But if a Trumpster goes on a public rant about Democrats being revolutionary punks, out to destroy America,  that’s ok.  If he’s allowed to stay,  we’re doomed."
2020-09-16 0:05,"I think this situation is taking it's toll on everyone, but most harshly to most ardent denialist,  who don't understand what's happening to them, display increasingly erratic behavior.

Their belief systems being torn down, their increasingly surreal struggle to remain relevant in an hostile and demeaning  political environment.

As we see, there are obviously many within the current administration operating on the edge of reality, doomed to failure, racked by an unfolding guilt paired with a nagging sense of 'something is wrong' but unable to accurately identify it and have no personal tools to resolve their inner conflict.

I hope that these unfortunate individuals very public display benefit society by creating visibility of the very real effects of  mental illnesses on the individual, family and society."

2020-09-15 23:39,"Well, Caputo is an idiot. Lets discuss something more important.

Drive through flu vaccination sites are important for the same reason as drive through COVID testing sites. 2 reasons: first, they are safer for all concerned, and second, because they reduce fear, more will get flu shots. I am not optimistic that this will be implemented, but am posting this in the hope that someone from a large pharmacy chain will read this and implement."
2020-09-15 21:46,"The barking lap dog Michael Caputo has absolutely zero qualifications for the job that he is in, other than his total loyalty to repeat the lies told by the con man Donald Trump.  Why is the US Congress so quiet to this total breakdown of law and order in our democracy?  Bill Barr is destroying the Justice Department.  Andrew Wheeler is wiping out our air and water quality regulations at EPA.   Mike Pompeo is destroying treaties with long term American allies to fulfill his Evangelic proclivities.  How can Congress sit idly by as Trump and his corruption destroy the USA from within?"

2020-09-15 21:55,"Caputo needs to resign immediately.  A voluntary leave of absence won’t cut it. He had no business in that position to begin with. The only reason he is in government is because of his connection to Trump and his coterie of unreformed Nixonites, that coterie of political vandals with convicted felon Roger Stone as it’s annoying public face."
2020-09-15 23:09,"Why can an unelected official, a CEO, a teacher, a journalist, a doctor, a cop, a coach, etc. take a leave or be fired for reckless behavior and incompetence yet the President is immune?

2020-09-15 23:23,"Another good takeaway from this.  It shows that even while Trump can spout nonsense, hate, fake news, anti-science and plain old nutball theories, not all Republicans or members of his administration can."
2020-09-16 0:11,"He intended to terrify all voters in order to impact the election. Scare Democrats into not voting or voting for Trump, or else. That’s it.

2020-09-15 21:49,"A little about Caputo. I’m surprised NYT didn’t include this:

Data taken verbatim from Ars Technia article “Bonkers federal podcast downplays COVID-19, blasts health restrictions” dated today by Beth Mole

“Though Caputo has no background in health care, the White House installed him in the department in April—a move reportedly made to assert more White House control over HHS Secretary Alex Azar. 

Caputo is a longtime Trump loyalist and former campaign official. He got his start as a protégé of Roger Stone and later worked as a Moscow-based advisor to Boris Yeltsin and did public relations work for Vladimir Putin.”"
2020-09-15 22:36,"Leave of absence??
Seems to me he has been on one of those for some time. 

How about he resign immediately and then be arrested for inciting armed insurrection? How’s that for your treasonous act?"
2020-09-15 22:55,"Give me a break. Caputo's immediate resignation is the only acceptable move. No ""government official"" elected or otherwise can get away with that bat-crazy stuff. Enough, enough, enough."
2020-09-15 21:45,I suspect that most Trump loyalists are off their meds.

Although European officials have shown much better sense than we have in reconciling virus facts with politics to devise responses, we can't point to Europe and say things are automatically better there.

2020-09-16 1:13,"Talk of an armed revolt if Trump is not re-elected is meant to scare people in the political middle, who otherwise are considering voting for Biden, into voting for Trump with the rationale that if they do so possible violence can be avoided. These obvious scare tactics are meant for those people.  Recall what Lamar Alexander said with respect to voting NO impeachment, even if what Trump had done was plainly wrong because if impeachment succeeded: “it would rip the country apart, pouring gasoline on the fire of cultural divisions that already exist.”  Trump and his sycophants are trying to fan these flames in the hopes that people will be scared into voting for Trump.  That we have gotten to this point in this country at the hands of the Republican Party is utterly ridiculous."
2020-09-16 0:48,"The Europeans also have new daily virus infections and deaths yet now they are adapting and moving on instead of insisting everything including public schools stay closed indefinitely and counting on finding a vaccine in their mailboxes on January 1. Their schools are open and large crowds of 1,000 or more are allowed to gather in France. The virus hasn't been eradicated there but it seems their mindless fear has been eradicated.

I wouldn't vote for Trump ever but I have to wonder if his fans who keep saying that the virus will magically disappear after the election are right. How else to explain the barely hidden glee from those who hate Trump at ""spikes"" and new cases in red states? The virus is far less deadly or dangerous than many Americans on the left side of the political spectrum believe and I'm betting suddenly there will be far more media coverage of how the danger has been overplayed if and when Trump is voted out in 6 weeks. All of a sudden the virus won't be ""dangerous"" anymore and we won't need to run around screaming that stacks of grandmas' bodies will be in the streets *in two weeks* if museums and restaurants open. 
The public school teacher's unions will of course still spread their propaganda and fear and insist that schools need to stay closed forever but that is a different story."

2020-09-09 10:04,"Tough news in the morning from the UK--the surge in new cases coupled with the halting of the vaccine trial-- is more evidence that the most effective defense is still social distancing and masks.  

Be safe everyone."
2020-09-09 11:13,"All of us are hoping for a safe and effective vaccine.  That and individual safety precautions, common sense and good public health are the only way through this hearty and lasting disease.  There’s no room for politics.  We should all be on the same side.  The goal is to stop the disease, not for any political endgame, but for the health ( and sanity) of our people.  When a vaccine can be developed that has gone through all the necessary safety checks, then again, and is proven effective, and not related to any politician’s timing, then that’s when it’s ready.  Science over politics."
2020-09-09 11:14,"The investigation into the troubling development of transverse myelitis in a trial patient is a warning that a vaccine may take a long time to develop, which is the norm. As always, Trump has pinned his hopes on a magic bullet: a vaccine to be developed in unheard of time to fix this crisis (the latest iteration of the virus will “just sort of disappear,” injecting bleach, hydroxychloroquine , etc.).  A real president, a responsible president, an intelligent president would factor in reality and be making contingency plans to better contain the virus pending an effective vaccine and to build in systems that would better protect our population from contagion, e.g., funding to schools and other buildings to install state of the art ventilation systems, more PPE, free and accurate rapid testing and contact tracing capability, and nationwide standards that help prevent transmission from rural areas that think Covid-19 is a hoax. If we want the US economy and our public health to survive, vote for Biden who already has a plan and the people in place to rapidly implement the steps all advanced nations took months ago and continue to take, so that they are operating more normally than our economy can."
2020-09-09 11:21,"The pause in the trial does indicate the vaccine trials are not political in nature even if they end up helping one candidate. The analysis of the potentially adverse reaction will be performed by investigators independent of the drug company. In any study which enrolls many thousands of volunteers unrelated illnesses are sure to happen. That is not to suggest this is the case here because adverse reactions occur with all drugs and vaccines including antibiotics and the Shingles vaccine. A risk-benefit analysis must be made by, ultimately,  the FDA and each individual person. Transverse myelitis, if that is the diagnosis, is a serious neurological condition generally manifesting itself with leg weakness, often severe. The workup of that patient, even expedited, will take many days or longer. The prognosis will depend on the specific cause and response to treatment."
2020-09-09 11:44,"21 percent of Americans in a poll said they would want to get vaccinated ASAP. FDA has shown  it is not able to stand up to pressure from Trump, rendering all protestations and assurances from Hahn not credible. What about the pharma companies? I feel little assured by their big proclamation of honesty.  That was an obvious PR move, something they HAD to do. I read carefully a number of  statements by Pfizer CEO. Never has he said that Pfizer would not seek an approval before the Phase 3 trial would be COMPLETED, only that sufficient Phase 3 data must be available. ""Sufficient"" is the key word here, open to debate. Enormous White House and stockholder pressure will be on Pfizer. The sheer existence of Pfizer's partner, a much smaller  German vaccine developer BioNTech may depend on securing a chunk of the market in the face of an extreme competition.I dearly hope that the difficulty Astra Zeneca has run into can be cleared: They have undertaken to mass-produce a vaccine conceived by a small British biotech from Oxford University, venture capital-founded. Thus the bad luck seems to have struck exactly the kind of company least likely to bow to Trump or stock market pressure."
2020-09-09 10:35,"Keeping integrity is as important as achieving a working vaccine and hopefully this fires a shot across the bows of the sceptics/want it at any costics/ and the politics.

However, Trump’s politicizing of the vaccine and push for it to come out in time for the election along with his people destroying the integrity of the government watchdogs who will be assuring our safety will taint my confidence in any vaccine that comes out."
2020-09-09 10:28,"As the president desperately pushes the fantasies of a pre-election vaccine to rescue him from the sea of 190K deaths swimming around him, we read of one pharmaceutical company that said, ""Oh-oh.""Good for AstraZeneca for stopping the trials; the larger question in this competitive race for unimaginable Big Pharma wealth and prosperity is, ""How many other companies would be honorable enough to go public with its findings?""

In America, citizens cannot count on the president or those in his thrall who run the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the National Institutes of Health or the Food and Drug Administration. The number of health ""experts"" and ""advisers"" to the presidency since the late winter and early spring reveals only an individual or two who are willing to row their boat against the rushing downstream tide of panic as demonstrated by this administration.

The plain fact is that the scientists, virologists, epidemiologists and doctors do not know enough about this particular strain of  virus. It has baffled them at every turn; indeed, their only advice has been to mask up, wash hands thoroughly and ""social distance."" We can see, from the number of infections on college campuses and on beaches, how effectively those messages have been learned.

The surgeon general earlier this year counseled against mask wearing, then back-tracked. This administration is a mess and we're expected to believe whatever they tell us?

Who, in his her or right mind, trust Trump?"
2020-09-09 11:29,"If they force health care workers to be vaccinated with a potentially dangerous injectable you will have push back.

2020-09-09 10:44,"Those indonesian punishments such as lying in a coffin remind me of 1970s school punishments.  They're meant to humiliate and while they make the punisher feel better they're completely ineffective at long term behavior change. 

Would be so much more effective to be consistent with the literature- random rewards for wearing masks properly, give the maskless a mask to wear. Instruct those that aren't wearing them properly to do so. People follow the herd.  If you're the only one not wearing a mask, you will soon."

At least the vaccine companies are willing to carry on with safety measures....we hope."
2020-09-09 12:16,For those who thought there would be a SAFE Vaccine quickly this is the reality of development. There will be no vaccine for all for quite sometime.
2020-09-09 12:16,"SCMP reported yesterday that China has progressed well over its vaccine development.  Although there are three in the final Stage III testing period with large population, two out of three have been approved for emergency use.  And their protection period is longer than six months. 

We don't have to treat everything as a competition.  What the world needs is cooperation.  In this tough environment, every country is doing their best to come out with their own vaccine.  Some succeed and some don't.  Life will become much easy if we accept that. It is just the stock markets that are unforgiven."
2020-09-09 12:17,My heart sinks.  A single adverse reaction that might not even be attributable to the vaccine once fully investigated is just fodder for the anti-vaccine crowd.  Might this be a case of too much transparency?
2020-09-09 12:17,"The key to an effective COVID vaccine is an effective vaccine and public confidence.  By releasing the bad news and the good news, the pharmaceutical companies are bringing much-needed transparency to a process that can be thoroughly undermined, to catastrophic  results, by Mr. Trump’s politics.  Please, drug companies, keep up the good work, and keep the public informed of every step and every misstep.  We can handle the truth, and need it if we want this to work."
2020-09-09 12:26,"This shows the importance of following settled science, rather than rushing things through with an emergency authorization that skips steps.  Confidence in all vaccines could be destroyed if an improperly tested vaccine gets widespread use and turns out to have serious side effects. 

We need a president who listens to experts and does what is right for Americans.  Trump just cares about himself.  190,000 dead? Who cares as long as he gets re-elected?"
2020-09-09 12:35,"What’s amazing to me in all of this is how we have basically adapted to living, working, and learning in a pandemic.  We’ve now come to accept the new normal and wait for some vaccine to save us. 

Instead of leadership working hard to contain and control the virus, in this country, we’ve basically accepted it for ourselves and for our children.  

Our minds are so warped."
2020-09-09 13:24,"The fact that we've reached Stage 3 clinical trials in under a year for a virus that was previously unknown is one of the most impressive human achievements of all time. It's like a miracle. Thank you, Science."
2020-09-09 13:29,"While Astra-Zeneca is to be applauded for following through on its promise to conduct legitimate vaccine trials, the simple fact of the matter is that the Trump administration has already shot itself in the foot, because it cannot be believed or trusted. Some polls are indicating that upwards of 30% of the population is saying that it does not trust the government to truthfully, honestly and non-politically approve a Covid-19 vaccine, and that they will not be vaccinated.

That leaves AZ and the other pharma companies --- all of whom had their own credibility problems going into this --- pushing back against Trump's daily trumpeting of a vaccine being available before ""a certain special day."" In this perverse, upside down world we find ourselves cheering when a vaccine trial is halted, because that's the only sign we have that Trump isn't interfering and that the company is taking this seriously and following protocol.

Johns-Hopkins estimates we will most likely need around 70% of the population immune in order to effectively reach herd immunity. If 30% of respondents are already skeptical of the vaccine development process, and with Trump certain to continue to exert pressure for a vaccine before the election, we are already at risk of failing in this effort. The FDA and CDC must redouble their efforts at transparency and regain the trust of the American people, or we will be right here this time next year."
2020-09-09 13:39,"I feel badly for the individual who developed an ""unexpected adverse reaction"" to the coronavirus vaccine taken during these trials.

Whoever this person is, thank you for volunteering and for putting your health at risk for the sake of others and their safety.

This kind of adverse reaction is exactly why rushing into any kind of ""emergency"" approval by the FDA should NEVER be allowed.  Thank goodness there are nine drugmakers who ""stand with science"" and will NOT move forward unless the vaccine is safe and effective.

It is deplorable and dangerous for ANYONE to rush this process purely for political gains of from political pressure and/or influence."
2020-09-09 13:52,“Warp speed” can easily become dangerous if the scientists are not allowed to progress in the usual and safe fashion. There will be adverse reactions. The goal is to have no deaths. This virus has been politicized because of the way it was handled. The vaccine must not be part of this political process.

2020-09-09 14:03,"We in the US need to learn to adapt to coronavirus instead of just waiting for Trump to be voted out and expecting a vaccine will be invented sooner or later. The number of Americans who have suddenly turned into anti-vaxxers shows that it's time to enact adaptive measures. We don't know if or when a vaccine will be available and coronavirus is here to stay.  Schools can't stay closed forever and virtue signaling that ""I haven't left my house since March"" isn't sustainable."
2020-09-09 13:57,This is why they do phase three testing. I am not voting for Trump. I have less fear politics will interfere with good science given the transparency here. Hopefully the myelitis had absolutely nothing to do with the vaccine.

It would be none other than trying to ascertain whether leadership ‘remedies’ in a time of continual rising deaths were worse than the disease. Leadership worrying about the way of ‘constitutions’ in the time of plague? Arguably both , a paper one and a human one, would have seemed to be looked upon as legitimate to be tampered with during this US leadership experience of the 21st."
2020-09-09 13:08,"In reality we should have adapted to living in a pandemic with the fewest casualties long ago.  Our administration has always put forward the easiest path of not waiting for a real  solution to the crisis, relying on the vaccine which was not far away or amazing cures such as bleach or hydroxychloroquine (spelling?). These were nice dreams but unreal.  Meanwhile , it allowed us to move along as though there was no pandemic and life could be ""normal"".  Obviously it was a big mistake and the wrong path to go on.  We have to learn to adjust following the science, the advice of respected scientists.  For the time being life must change and restrictions followed .  Until there is a vaccine or a cure, the pandemic is the master."

But, less would have been made of this rare but very serious inflammatory condition if  ignorant self-serving politicians like Donald Trump hadn't politicized the rush to vaccination. Everyone wants a safe vaccine against Covid-19. But after Trump's meddling fewer Americans will be willing to be vaccinated even when a ""safe"" vaccine is really available. Trump is one of those creatures who fouls everything and everyone with which he comes into contact."

2020-09-09 13:51,"From what we are hearing that one of the subjects developed transverse myelitis (inflammation of spinal cord leading to severe paralysis. It is a frightening complication but not unique to just this vaccine. Many vaccines do cause rare serious complications like Guillain Barre Syndrome myocarditis, encephalitis and intussusception . I just hope it is carefully assessed without any political interference. Like what John Barry wrote, if you mix politics with science you get politics. 
We did not seem to learn many lessons from the previous pandemic of 1918. Let us at least hope we learn the lessons from the  ""Cutter Incident"" of 1955."

2020-09-09 14:30,"The [sad] reality is that a vaccine ... or most anything else that tens of millions of people are exposed to ... can have serious side effects.

It is both due to this social media era, but more significantly Trump being so loud and outspoken and wrong, that cases like these will justify both current anti-vaccine people away and scare normal people, at least for a while."
2020-09-09 14:22,"All these articles about cases on college campuses, but where are the articles about college campuses that have successfully tamed the virus!?

Notre Dame put classes online for 2 weeks to quell an outbreak. Now classes are back in person, with a test positivity rate under 1%. Shouldn't that be reported/celebrated too?

If only bad news is reported and good news is purposefully hidden, it makes people start to distrust the media, which is not what we want. Report everything objectively, and remember to give us hope. College campuses that figure out a way to safely reopen should be APPLAUDED, not condemned! We WANT to figure out how to reopen society safely, not stay shut down for the next two years."
2020-09-09 13:39,"China is the world leader in bio-science.  They have many more MDs and bio-researchers than the US.  What takes a US research team six months the Chinese researchers do in one month.  They're also the world leader in manufacturing drugs; essentially all our drugs and their raw materials, and vitamins too, come from China.  

They'll likely come out first with the safest and most effective vaccine, and probably at about half the price of anything we produce.  They've had a good head start on development since they've been working on coronavirus vaccines since SARS/2002 and the Wuhan lab (from which this Virus most likely accidentally escaped from) was deep in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.  

Sinopharm, Sinovac Biotech, and CanSino have been in P3 trials since June with vaccines that seem to be safe and produce antibodies.  The senior managers and Chairman of Sinopharm have all been injected. 

A big problem rarely mentioned is that Pharma is running out of P3 test subjects because the Virus is petering out.  In fact excess deaths in the US went below the official CDC epidemic threshold during the week ended August 22nd.

Trump will go ballistic if China gets there first; won't be helpful for his re-election."
2020-09-09 13:08,"And Trump rambles on.  Nothing changes with that man.  We need leadership from the top and what we're getting is rants, blathering, and lies.  We need competent cabinet secretaries but what we have instead are sycophants who march in time to an incompetent leader whose sole concern is his poll numbers and winning at any cost.  

When and where leadership would have been appreciated it's been nonexistent.  Instead we hear how cities are going up in flames, riots are at peak levels, anarchists are destroying our country, the virus is retreating.  Where is the leadership we need?  Where is the financial aid so many Americans, not corporations and not the richest, need desperately to survive?  It's not being offered by our leaders.  The senate, run by McConnell who is interested solely in himself, prefers to offer inadequate aid which hurts the ""red"" states more than the rest.  

There is no one in the majority in DC who is speaking up for the Americans they claim to care about.  They are operating under the delusion that unemployment and the virus will melt away.  They think that $600/week was too much.  Let's see them survive on $300/week.  They're paid with our tax dollars but they don't want to help us with our tax dollars.  Throw the bums out."
2020-09-09 13:34,I would wait until Trump is out of office before I’d take the vaccine.
2020-09-09 14:42,"From article and comments, the thought occurs that many Americans may avoid the vaccine because of Trump's politicization  of the vaccine.  To counter this reluctance of vaccine, would Mr. Trump and his family be willing to be among the first to take the vaccine.  Of course, we would need reliable observers (from among Democrats most likely) to make certain Mr. Trump was not substituting a flu vaccine or other type of injection for the vaccine.  You have to be very  careful with Mr. Trump, whose transparency is generally very opaque."
2020-09-09 15:15,"Is the US testing samples of sewage water for COVID 19?  This is being done in Europe and Australia, to locate local outbreaks early, and it is effective.

Too much emphasis on survival of the young and lucky, not enough real effort."
2020-09-09 16:21,"The global 7 day average of daily new cases is almost 250,000 cases with a 7-day average of reported deaths of over 5,500.  As the fall approaches and people move indoors, cases are increasing in countries with good national plans and which had dramatically lowered transmission in the spring.  People in the US are gaining confidence because our daily new case average is decreasing, but this confidence is almost certainly misplaced in any state other than Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Each of these states has had a prolonged period of low transmission, because their leadership instituted comprehensive state-wide plans.  They should consider adding restrictions as the fall begins to make sure things don't get out of hand again.  Certainly the rest of the states must consider aggressive lockdowns now.  Opening schools with no safety plan is risky."

As a physician, I understand that the development of an antiviral vaccine can require years of research and scrupulous testing. “Warp speed” should not and cannot be part of the process, nor should partisan politics play a role. Our president is desperate to make a huge splash in order to boost his re-election prospects, and a Coronavirus vaccine would fit the bill. BUT, a vial if diluted viral material is nothing without extensive and rigorous testing in multi-phase trials over time. And this is not yet the case for any of the developing vaccines. Trump’s promise of a vaccine by Election Day is much like his theory of injecting or swallowing Lysol ..... complete and utter stupidity. If Trump tells us to take the vaccine, then, as Nancy Reagan told us, we should just say no. And run the other way as fast as we can."

2020-09-09 16:13,"‘As drugmakers pledge to thoroughly vet vaccines, one company pauses its trials for a safety review.’

There’s a reason why, historically, only one in three vaccine candidates in phase 3 trials has ultimately been approved. You really don’t know about efficacy or safety in the real world until a new product has been tested in at least tens of thousands of subjects. Even then, many vaccines have been superseded by better vaccines later. 

And occasionally, a few vaccines are later withdrawn when rare but serious reactions are found during routine post-approval monitoring. This happened with the initial rotavirus vaccine, which was quite effective and saved many lives, particularly in the third world. Unfortunately, it caused intussusception, a treatable but serious GI condition, in roughly 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 100,000 infants.

When I mentioned this to the waitstaff (all of whom were extremely diligent in wearing masks and gloves) they said that because it's so hot in the kitchen, they cannot work with a mask on their faces.

Hmmm.  Not really the answer I was hoping for.  We immediately left both restaurants.

I certainly hope the health department and code is much stronger for New York restaurants than they were at the ones we experienced.

2020-09-09 10:53,"Developing an effective and safe vaccine is a  difficult and sedulous task. Operation Warp Speed is a politically motivated fantasy of Trump since no vaccine can be rushed and forced on the public without careful and meticulous study. This unfortunately takes time and requires caution and scientific skepticism even during a devastating pandemic. Hopefully before the next year there will be enough data that some vaccine that truly works to mitigate the disease, to stop its spread and is very safe can be approved. But wishing for it cannot rush that process. The complication of a neurological disorder of transverse myelitis, a  rare demyelinating auto immune disorder of the spinal cord that leads to paralysis is a serious and rightfully will require rigorous analysis to determine if the AstraZeneca vaccine can ever be approved and that is without any proven data that it works in large double blind clinical studies. Then the hard part of manufacturing and distributing the vaccine comes and that to effectively crush the pandemic  must be given to the vast majority of 8 billion humans around the world.  This is a very formidable task and will never be accomplished in the warp speed fantasy that Trump envisions. He must stop politicizing the vaccine process  and taking any credit for its development because it will turn off the public from ever taking an effective virus when it is approved particularly if the public thinks its approval was rushed for political purposes."
2020-09-09 10:08,No great surprise that there has been an adverse reaction to a vaccine on trial. That's the whole reason for trials in the first place. We need efficiency more than we need speed.

2020-09-09 12:29,"This is standard operating procedure for a clinical drug trial. I’d be concerned if no trials reported any adverse events - trial investigators have to report all-cause mortality and state for what percentage of that they could not positively rule-out drug effects, for one thing, and for another there’s a reliable chance that some participants will get sick while in the trial because there are thousands of people enrolled all over the country, and recruited from hospital populations. I’m encouraged to hear they’re adhering to clinical trials protocol so diligently."

The lockdown we all took part in in March and April and May, before people started doing “socially distanced hangouts” and restaurants opened and cases dropped in New York, actually worked, but that time was supposed to have been used to set up systems that would maintain a low level of cases over a long period of time. Instead we are now in an extended hold period as those of us still doing what’s right feel stir crazy and paranoid and many have decided to essentially live life as normal. It is maddening. I would happily accept one or even two months of strict lockdown again to get cases down and re-set. It’s obvious we can’t hang all of our hopes on a vaccine and many of us can’t and won’t take the risk of getting ourselves or others sick in the meantime."

Every state he goes to that has mask orders should enforce them.  He is not above the law and his bad example may literally be killing others as his supporters follow his example and may communicate the virus."

Sorry, I’ll pass — for now, anyway. I’m not going to risk so my life so Trump can gloat that he’s actually doing something."
2020-09-09 18:34,The only thing that could have stopped the virus was a total closing of our borders in January. No one in this country would have accepted that and the media would have gone ballistic. Trump has not reacted well but blaming the pandemic on him is pure politics.

2020-09-09 17:37,"Turning down any offered vaccine has never crossed my mind until now. Having lived through measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox, any vaccine that has been developed to eradicate deadly childhood ( and adult) diseases is welcomed...by most. Schools,the military, hospital and essential personnel are all required to take them.

However, the Trump Coronavirus has overlapped with the Trump vaccine leaving many to be skeptical regarding any advice from this administration. After listening to the scientists and DJT’s interviews with Bob Woodward, few will take this vaccine that comes with a due date of November 3. Woodward’s interviews with Trump reinforce what we have long suspected, he knew early and then proceeded to lie, yet again, to the American people.

Months later we have 180,000 dead, a tanked economy and a miserable, unemployed populace.Because Trump didn’t wish to panic anyone or interfere with the rise of the stock market.Because he couldn’t be bothered....

So here we are, to take the vaccine or not? Once Germany, led by a scientist, and Canada certify a vaccine I will comply. Until then, Trump and his cult can line up for their Trump dose.

I wish them luck."
2020-09-09 18:08,"We’re all long past the point where revelations of trump’s mendacity is shocking.  Good for Bob Woodward to get trump’s remarks on tape for the record; within days the virus will (unimaginably just months ago) have claimed the lives of 200,000 Americans and severely disrupted the lives of 300  million of us! And it’s far from over yet.  Effective and honest leadership always matters.  How this guy can have the temerity to claim he’s done “a great job in fighting the virus” is just more of his twisted “up is down and down is up” mentality.   More outrageous though is how any patriotic American can still want to vote for him given the depth and breadth of trump’s perfidy.  Vote on November 3; work to elect Biden and every other Democratic candidate on the ballot."

Jeez - my head hurts from the no one in this administration's ability to give an honest, cogent, solid answer to ANYTHING.  And my neck hurts from the constant back and worth and up and down of the various opinions being thrown all over the place.

Neither this president nor his administration have been able to focus and roll out any kind of well thought out and executed plan regarding this pandemic.

Trump wants to believe that you will be able to get a vaccine before election day so that you'll credit him for it, then you'll vote for him out of gratitude.

Are you going to fall for that?

Some of you will.

Have you ever known anyone that you thought was ""two-faced""?

Didn't you think they were exceptionally despicable?

Trump told the reporter Bob Woodward one thing about his views about the seriousness of the coronavirus threat to America, then told America the opposite.

The vaccine is a major priority, but it has to be proven safe and effective before release. When it is ready on Day X, whenever that might be, we must be ready to vaccinate the population.  Trump tells us that Day X could be election day. This is crazy.  This politicizes the development process.  At worst, it could result in premature use, thereby threatening our health when a more careful release would benefit all.  He once said it is like the flu, it will go away in a few days, it is only 15 people and it will go to zero, it will go away in warm weather. and  similar statements that turned out to be wildly wrong.  Given this record, we must ignore him saying we will have a vaccine by the election.  But his past statements on testing are worrisome because they suggest that he will fail in distributing the vaccine as he failed in distributing tests.  He outright said that everyone who wanted a test will be able to get one. Still not true.  Is he actually ramping up the vaccine distribution so that everyone can be vaccinated when one becomes ready? Or is this just another pending failure in his response to the pandemic?  We all want the pandemic to be over.  We must not be misled by his empty statements crafted to generate votes for his reelection."

On February 25th, I fell ill with the coronavirus.  At this time tests were not available.  The acute phase of the illness was terrifying, with shortness of breath so extreme, I could not lay down for 2 weeks.  I had to sleep upright on the couch, when the coughing stopped long enough to nod off.  What is worse, however, is that 6 months later I have not recovered.  The lung and heart damage is so extensive that walking from one end of my small apartment to the other requires at least 10 minutes of recovery to be able to breathe normally.  For whatever time I have left, with every labored breath, I will curse the name of Donald Trump, the man who chose his campaign over the lives and health of the American people."

Otherwise, if a drug company brings a vaccine to market early, rushes it to make Trump and the GOP happy and people get sick and die because the vaccine is no good, they can be bankrupted in civil suits. 

The other thing working against politicization is that the researchers running the trials will scream bloody murder if they announce the vaccine and the data doesn't match, researchers depend on their reputations, they aren't political hacks like the head of the NIH or worse, the FDA (anyone remember the FDA on its website promoting under Bush II prayer to cure menopause, or having nonsensical ""information"" that abortion causes cancer or birth control fails 50% of the time? ).

It was like an Alfred Hitchcock movie where somebody is about to drink poison and the audience is screaming, ""Don't drink it!"" 

We realized by February that this was the worst-case scenario scientists had been predicting after their experience with SARS-1 and Ebola. 

They even made a Hollywood movie (Contagion) which predicted events with uncanny accuracy. 

Obama and the CDC literally prepared manuals on how to deal with this specific situation. Trump was ignoring them. 

Biden (for all his faults) deserves credit for this project. 

The most important thing, the CDC manual stressed, was speed. At the beginning, a few cases can be controlled with contact tracing. After a month, the cases can (and did) multiply a thousand-fold. 

The second important thing, the CDC said, was clear leadership. 

China, which worked with us to set up their own CDC, followed our advice. Result: after 4 months, and 4,500 deaths, the new cases and deaths were effectively zero, and they're starting normal activities again. 

That could have been us.

It is good news actually because it uncovers risks. The value of a “sick person” in a phase 3 trial is that one represents many. The AZ trial has the largest group (I think AZ had 30,000?) so the sample size accounts for natural mutations in the larger populace. So one represent potentially millions. That is the core of safety.

Science by press release is a new phenomena driven by our need for quick solutions. Any news released, if not peer reviewed, is worthless. It is hard for people to understand because they have no education on clinical processes, which are quite rigorous and smart; they even have an underlying tenet built in that pharma is not to be trusted. 

A “vaccine” may come from newer technologies like RNA manipulation or T Cell approach, technologies developed for cancer (where the money is). The secret no one talks about: Current vaccine development is decades old; the low profit margin demotivated Pharma’s effort to innovate. Technology is outdated and most of vaccine manufacturing has gone to India. All this spells delay. The true vaccine will take years. The many patient “types” will require several vaccines.

Basically we won't know any of those things until this vaccine goes through the test of time; even if I get the shot I will likely still wear a mask and social distance.

This Week in Virology podcast ﻿<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyQ6fuCtg4A"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyQ6fuCtg4A</a> discusses the new covid-19 vaccines in phase III, prospects for FDA EUA before election day (really low), significance of the AstraZeneca transverse myelitis (rare but reported in coronavirus vaccines, usually resolves in ~3 months but sometimes lasts for years; 1 case reason for concern but not to cancel trial, 2 cases reason to worry, 3 cases reason to really worry). 

If an RCT is promising enough based on one endpoint for the FDA to give emergency use authorization, that would kill the trial for all the other endpoints, because they'd have to end the trial and offer the vaccine to the placebo group. 

That was the problem with remdesivir. Once they saw it reduced hospital stay, they ended the trial, and gave it to all patients, but they never found out whether it improved survival -- and they never will. 

Vaccine trials have different end points. Does it prevent infection? Or does it let you get infected, but prevent disease? Does it give you early immunity (1-2 months) or late immunity (6 months, 1 year, more)? Common cold coronaviruses give immunity that only lasts for 1 season. 

The only way to know if the vaccine will protect you for >1 year is to wait >1 year and see. (Duh.) But that won't be until 1 year after the election.

Articles couched in the kind of language used here, comparing, for instance, getting your oil checked before a long trip : ""It makes you feel better, does it doesn't make your trip any safer,"" are not helpful and potentially dangerous.

I don't understand why NYT presents information this way."

Of nearly 6,000 patients in the New York area who were so sick last spring that they were admitted to Northwell Health hospitals, only 30 percent were febrile when they came in, according to a study by Dr. McGinn that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

So there is some ""science"" here, if by that you mean data.  Like the disinfecting procedures that the Times has recently reported as mainly ""theater"", temperature checks seem to have limited, though not totally useless, application.  They maintain at least a perception of ""doing something.""  The 30 percent of febrile persons reported here might also skew the data upward, since they had taken the steps of seeking treatment at a hospital.  Kabuki theater or not, the temperature checks provide a reminder to people that the virus is still among us and circulating ... somewhere and carried by .... some people.  Lots of unknown unknowns here."

Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care

I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night.
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago"

My god. What has happened to critical thinking skills in this country?! Stop and think. If you are running a temperature and the cause is COVID, you have been shedding the virus for up to ten days. Unless you are ready to shut down the entire school, factory, restaurant --and that would be the only reasonable response--there is NO value in doing this. 

In fact, there is a very real danger. Taking temperatures gives a false sense of control where none really exists. We continue to latch onto faux solutions while studiously ignoring the choices we know have an impact. 

How hard are we going to work to pretend that opening schools make sense? 80,000 college students are positive with many being symptomatic; there is accruing evidence that this virus does long term/permanent damage. We won't know the full fallout for years.

There is an article up right now that assumes the spike this fall is because of reopening travel. Has it not occurred to the journalist penning that article that the other event that happened was going back to school?

Until we stop trying to force abnormal into a normal-shaped box, this pandemic will get the better of us, and it will do so because at every turn we invoked magical, preposterous, deadly thinking in the attempt to let the wheels of corrupt Capitalism grind on. Until and unless we put people and safety first, this virus will win."

They took my temperature again about an hour later in the pre-op room when I had a surgical cap on. This time it was over 101. I protested that it had been 97-something just an hour early, and the nurse said it was because I had just come in from outside. Eventually they managed to lower my temperature to under 100 by taking off the surgical cap.

No, it's not highly accurate, but it certainly makes you aware of the virus and that your next plane trip or shopping trip depends on you not having a fever.

And while it makes sense that people with fevers ""probably"" aren't going to be the people going to restaurants, that doesn't mean that there aren't some people with fevers who might attempt it.

If this precaution, which is cheap and easy to implement, prevents a few hotheaded bozos from super-spreading inside of a few restaurants, then I'd say it's worth it, particularly once you take into account that the negative ramifications of just a few events like that hitting the headlines would reverberate across the entire restaurant industry, regulatory environment, and consumer confidence.

You could even argue that the mere existence of requiring temperature checks might dissuade some people who aren't sure if they're sick or not from deciding to eat in a restaurant. There could be preventative value in that as well.

The only magic bullet is accurate and frequent rapid testing. Unless that's in widespread deployment, then temperature checks are one easy piece to implement along with mask-wearing, ventilation, social distancing, etc."

The dangerous people are those undiagnosed without symptoms.  They are the superspreaders.  Those with a fever are mostly home in bed.  Now hear this.  Covid spreads almost exclusively through the air and at a distance much further than your super special six feet and can stay in a room for hours! The only protection is good ventilation and wearing a mask.  That means a mask that covers your great big nose.  I was in Walmart today and spotted at least six people with their ugly noses sticking out which I was itching to punch. Are they really that stupid?  Judging from the number of people supporting Trump, the answer is probably yes. And add to that the homely overweight troll in the Trump mask.

I order shoes, something I never did before. I may order some clothing too, though I am leery of anything not fitting me.  No way I will eat in restaurants before most people are vaccinated, especially where I live.  No way I will travel, which means I will miss my youngest grandson's Bar Mitzvah this year.  As someone whose work included health education, I will heed the truth, not the political spin.  This is a virus that can kill a person my age, especially with my underlying conditions.

It’s not going to make your trip any safer.”

OK, so the current advice is don't check the oil before a long driving trip?  Give me a break.

At hospitals, it's true that there are multiple temperature checks.  However, it's also true that patients are questioned more than once about possible symptoms, travel, contact with sick people, etc.

Just because temperature checks alone don't catch all Covid cases doesn't invalidate the ones they do catch.  We should be grateful for easy and cheap ways to stop even a small fraction of the infections from this too-easily transmitted threat.  If the author were over 65 she'd view this differently."

How many of us have started a vacation flight with a fever, just to avoid cancelling, or showed up sick at work for ""can't miss"" obligations? Is a slight benefit of temperature checks the same as no benefit? 

Indeed, this article is really about cost benefit analyses, and the problem of providing false psychological security. How do we get allot our resources? Spend them on temperature checks at the door, when restaurants necessitate a more complex risk: Taking our masks off while we are sitting indoors for extended periods? 

The article also might have included a clear look at our international obsession with fomites and wiping down surfaces, when there are zero Covid cases worldwide that have been traced to contact infection. Experts now say contact is - at best - a highly rare source of infection. Yet we confront a terrifying pathogen by actions that provide an illusion of control; spraying and wiping helps. So does taking temperatures."

Like some of the other ludicrous recommendations, we are swimming in a sea of non-sensical rituals to get us through the day. Entering a restaurant and wearing a mask as you quickly walk to your table and then taking it off is ludicrous. Why? Because one has to be in close contact with another person for a significant length of time to spread a virus.  Still we play the game, until we will be free again, with the availability of a tested vaccine.  Then, this national nightmare will finally end."
2020-09-16 3:56,"I think part of the value of doing the temperature check is that people who ALREADY KNOW they have a fever won't come to the store or restaurant, because they know they won't be allowed in.  It's a dissuader as well as trying to catch the unaware person.

Yes, it shouldn't be necessary to dissuade the feverish in the ideal world, but that's not the world we live in.

We here, in ""exceptional America,"" often think of a famine as some kind of biblical plague that God sends to punish the evil and the wayward.

Here is the reason.

THE FEDERAL GOV CAN CREATE AS MUCH MONEY AS IT NEEDS OUT OF THIN AIR. IT WILL NEVER RUN OUT OF DOLLARS.

Here is the way it works. Suppose Congress were to pass the Democrats' $3 TRILLION relief bill. As soon as the President signed it, someone at the FED would wander over to a keyboard, hit a few keys, and $3 TRILLION would appear in the Treasury's account.

It has to be that way. We need the money now. We cannot wait for a tax bill to be passed and the money collected. We can't wait for the Treasury to hold an auction, sell bonds and collect the money.

This money will increase the deficit, but it is not ""debt"" in the usual sense. It is owed to nobody. It never has to be repaid. The is no cost to the taxpayer.

Now, in normal times, we MIGHT have to worry about inflation because we might have too much money chasing not enough stuff.

Now they are quibbling over unemployment benefits for 28 million out of work and because some cities may use federal help to help millions of others whose jobs are at risk. In our state, the state of denial, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham says ""we will reauthorize those unemployment benefits over my dead body""   I don't see you missing any meals and traveling by bus, Lindsey"

Now it's Mitch McConnell's turn to add to the misery by denying any help to the states, particularly those states that have historically provided fairer treatment for those people who work in first responder roles. Look to nothing to be done in this upcoming session and the misery to compound as we go into the fall and wait for flu season. This will be the worst man-made disaster in the history of the Country."

What better example of fiscal stupidity on the part of people we thought knew better.  At the same time the Democrats continue to spend and spend as they generally have, whether needed, useful, or not.  

Why anyone should be eager to support either party is hard to figure out."

I wonder if the volunteered at the food banks in their districts. Or talked to the folks who were being evicted from their homes or foreclosed on. Or talked to the children who are afraid because they don’t understand why their parents are angry or depressed or weeping all the time. Or talked to the folks who have lost their jobs or trying to get by on one job instead of the three that made life possible. Or the people with family members who have died from C-19, or been long-term or perhaps permanently been debilitated by it. Or the people of color whose relatives have been murdered or destroyed by corrupt policing. Or the folks who are losing their medical insurance or can’t pay the chemo bills not covered by their insurance. Probably not. They were in hiding in their district homes or their vacation homes still feeding at the public trough of tax dollars, not worrying about their next paycheck, or whether they could keep up their medical insurance. 

And the media obsesses about Nancy Pelosi’s hair trying to make it an equivalent to Trump’s multiple maskless packed mob rallies.

2020-09-08 13:01,"Remember that sage advice - the perfect should not be he enemy of the good?
Despite the thankfully falling unemployment rate millions of Americans, particularly lower wage, service industry workers, remain unemployed or underemployed, in need of food, housing and healthcare assistance. Truly small businesses have been devastated and many rendered extinct. The Democrats should have agreed to an aide package addressing these needs, including extended unemployment and food stamp assistance; unused PPP funds should have been supplemented with new funding and directed to small businesses. 
True, many crucial needs such as aide to state and local government whose fiscal health has been upended by the pandemic, and aide to schools and hospitals would not be addressed in the compromised aide package. Further negotiations would be required; in all candor, aide to local governments will likely require a Democratic sweep in November. Trump the Impaler wishes to skewer his Blue State demons hobbled by coronavirus. 
But the Democrats share the blame with the Party of Trump in denying aide to those in dire need. If the Democrats offered such a limited aide bill and Trump’s party rejected it we could point the finger of blame in one direction. As to those suffering today,  the shame is  on both parties."
2020-09-08 13:07,"Republicans think that they can have a strong economy by keeping the wealth from being expended rather than spending it to keep people and public institutions from falling into destitution so that they can resume actively sooner rather than later. 

This country enjoyed a century of extraordinary growth before it stopped in 1973 and has not been able to resigned it. Our policy makers do not seem to be able to understand the limits with which we must contend.

The losses cannot be simply shifted to few unlucky people, the whole country is facing a long term decrease in wealth and prosperity. Holding onto wealth at this time assures greatly reduced opportunities for all to prosper. The strategy must be to support people and institutions to be able to resume activities as soon as they can. That means spending money."
2020-09-08 13:10,"What is crystal clear is that politics, specifically election politics for November, 2020 is the major factor holding up passage of an aid package needed by ordinary Americans. If it were not a compromise, something rather than nothing, would be found. Republicans and Democrats are more concerned with their election prospects than they are about you and me. Both sides are playing to their base, their most reliable voters ,who each demand a maximum or minimum amount. Can anyone seriously believe that the leaders are asking their advisers "" Tell me what the people need, Tell me what small business needs"" rather than how will this amount or concession affect my district, state or the electoral map?"

Elected officials have had many chances to address it since the 1980's, but they always kicked the can down the road.

The trump party want to punish ""blue"" states that have thrived in the normal economy.  The trump party are using the pandemic and the economic crash that their Russian tool has intentionally exacerbated to pursue their agenda of starving state governments, crushing unionized workers, stealing worker pension funds, defunding public education, eliminating public services and shredding social safety nets.

They are also coming back to their desks full of lies about being so broke they have only chump change to throw at schools and municipalities and the additional millions of family breadwinners who are now facing the devastation of long-term unemployment with no help in sight. Every week, since supplemental aid was irrationally ended in July, millions of families  became more economically insecure. Every week, school superintendents, teachers and parents cried out for help so kids could go back to school without endangering the lives of their families. Every week, state Governors and mayors warned of drastic cuts in school aid and services if federal assistance did not materialize. Meanwhile, Trump was crushing the legitimacy of the CDC, cutting testing, while hiding and politicizing scientific data. Republicans were at recess on the playground, scheming their talking points about fiscal responsibility.

There are no two sides to this issue. Fairness in reporting, noble in most cases, is actually deceptive. The impasse and divisions are based on the false arguments made by McConnell, Trump and Mnuchin. Make no mistake: the fear we feel and the economic pain we face is 100% their fault."

2020-09-08 13:20,"Recently, I have been racking my brains, trying to come up with a different approach, different phrasing, some way to inspire my Republican Senators to take action. There must be some way to make Republicans in office aware that the country needs their help, some way to get them to do their jobs and provide the funding needed for individuals, municipalities, and states — funding that only the federal government can provide, because it is the only entity allowed to create money out of key strokes. Instead, Republicans conveniently keep trotting out the “deficit.” To whom, exactly, does the federal government owe money? Is there some secret cabal of bankers that is going to demand the US government pay them the entire national debt right now or in the next few months? Is China going to come knocking on our door, demanding that we pay up? Is everyone going to cash in their T-bills and bonds all at once? To whom exactly is the national debt owed? And if everyone who is owed money wants it right now, what is stopping the fed from just paying it by keystrokes? Nobody is trudging over to Fort Knox to haul out the gold any more. Increasingly, the “national debt” is looking merely like a convenient excuse for Republicans to refuse to fund anything they don’t feel like supporting. And it’s clear they don’t feel like helping their fellow Americans during a massive global pandemic. After all, they’ve got theirs!"

This could possibly be the fourth shutdown under Trump's watch.  Who isn't familiar with the last shutdown when Congress and Trump were unable to agree on the inclusion in the spending bill of some $5.7 billion for the construction of an additional section of immigration security wall or fencing along the U.S. border with Mexico.

Somehow, needing to secure and restore the $600 unemployment benefits to the millions who actually need this money is much more urgent and poses an honest life and death situation to those presently struggling and barely hanging on.

Once again, the priorities of so many lawmakers are upside down.  I just don't get it.  The people needing this money aren't the ones who own lavish second homes in the country nor drive around in expensive luxury cars.

These are people who need this money for food, rent, utilities, medicines - the very basic of needs.

I hope voters remember this stunt and will vote these selfish and self-serving Republican knuckleheads out of office in 8 weeks for they truly favored their own time away on break over the holidays and the entire month of August than hammering out a workable compromise with Democrats."
2020-09-08 13:30,Democrats should accept the inadequate stimulus bill but absolutely not the provisions of liability protection that the GOP is sneaking into it.  Mitch know this is inadequate to save the economy.  His real goal is to save his rich friends and campaign donors.  Let it pass in the Senate and let the House pass the same bill but with out liability protection.  Make the confrontation about GOP attempts to protect the rich.
2020-09-08 13:44,The way to ensure a safe and effective vaccine is pretty easy.  Sue the manufacturer for any harm.  That's how US capitalism works.  Now old Mitch will probably block that remedy given his boy is up for reelection and has failed dramatically in leading the country on the pandemic.

Between a complete denial of the seriousness and potential impact this virus could have on human life as well as economic ramifications and a Pollyanna view that the economy would be back to normal by June or July and life would continue on as before, how in the world can anyone expect the Republicans to do the right thing NOW and approve a pandemic aid package that millions, MILLIONS of Americans need RIGHT NOW?

Any degree of effective Republican leadership from the very beginning has been void across the board.  Instead of implementing aggressive measures to help combat and control this virus, the absolute opposite has resulted.

If the Republicans couldn't effectively manage the pandemic from the beginning, why would there be any glimmer of hope they would place their petty ridiculousness aside and actually make helpful and effective decisions which could help millions of people today?

For once, just once, I wish these lawmakers would think about someone else for a change instead of themselves."

Why don't they understand that monies that they would give to fund states' needs help the nation's economy in exactly the same ways that funding federal programs do!  

State and local workers such as teachers, highway crews, custodial staff, etc. spend money on food, rent, mortgages, etc., thus driving the economic engine.

Keeping these people afloat helps lessen the burden on the welfare system, food stamps, etc.  It helps prevent evictions (thus keeping people from relying on homeless shelters) and defaults on mortgages.

Are they so short-sighted that they can't see that helping people at the state/local level would give them better unemployment numbers that they could tout for reelection?

They're so blinded by their own partisanship that they're moving backwards: The Dems met them halfway to their proposal, but then they cut their own proposal in half!  And then they took a vacation.

Despite Republicans' lies, the economy and job numbers (and lowering deficits/debt) have consistently done better under Democrat administrations over the last 40 years.

I'm no huge fan of democrats, but the republicans are ghastly in their obstructionism.  We pay these awful people six-figure salaries, but they act like they own this nation.

Can it be any clearer to even a high school sophomore that Trump is willing to play politics with people's lives in order to win re-election? 

And months after coronavirus arrived at our shores, up to 90% of Republicans think he is fit to be our president again.

2020-09-08 15:16,That Republicans will secure a vote on aid to hospitals and workers that will not pass the Senate because of the requirement to have 60 votes is a victory for McConnell and Republicans but not the American people.

It does give me some hope that it convinces both parties that neither side will cave to the wishes of the other and lead both to compromise. That is what the American people require. Is it too much to hope for? Probably yes.

Before Moscow-Mitch told everyone to go on vacation  they weren’t able to pass their previous Senate bill totaling 1T in relief. They didn’t even bring it to the floor for a vote because they didn’t have sufficient Republican support.

So, as people are being evicted from their homes, millions are unemployed, the US Covid-19 rate soaring and among the highest in the world, 1 out of 4 children going hungry, etc. the Senate Republicans walked the walk and took a vacation.

When it comes to vaccines or their approval, I don't trust the White House, for the obvious reasons. Hard to trust the head of the FDA, after the plasma fiasco. The FDA head can override the scientists when it comes to approval of a vaccine. Should we trust the FDA? An emergency authorization would be made by the same bunch of political appointees. Why trust that? Would it change anything if such an authorization were sought by these 9 drug companies? The White House has given them billions. We have no idea what binds them to the administration, or where their political alliances lie. Good grief, the new US Postal Service head illegally compelled his employees to give tens of thousands of dollars to the Trump campaign. A respected prior head of the NIH tells us we can no longer trust the CDC which has tiptoed too much around what's-his-name. It comes down to trust. And Trump and his co-conspirators and his associates and his administration have deep-sixed the trust we must have in them and in the process. Never missed a vaccination in my life.

I have an idea-all of Trump’s “best people” including White House staffers be vaccinated first then exposed to all of those who are infected at the time the vaccines are released.
Then, quarantine them for two weeks to see the outcome.
Or, watch and see which of those “best people” or staffers refuse to be vaccinated.  Either outcome should provide us with information to accept or decline Trump’s much touted vaccinations.

In essence, Trump's comments have been his worst enemy because he's debasing the solution to the problem. If he simply kept quiet and allowed scientists and doctors to manage the crisis, America would not be dead last amongst developed nations.

The result of denying science by Republicans has cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans.

Because of that disreputable record, their political sympathies are no doubt far more aligned with the repugnant, Republican, pseudo-patriots who would love to announce the successful creation of a vaccine before November 3. They could get away with lying to the public for a very long time and then come up with all kinds of excuses, denials, and defenses if anything went wrong.

I suppose Big Pharma isn't 100% evil...they've done some nice things along the way.

Except opioid death, on its way back up in response to our current crisis, soon may make competing headlines.

In case you forgot, the opioid epidemic was intentionally created, nurtured, implemented by Big Pharma.

Settlements into the high hundreds of millions indicate Sacklers were the ugly tip of the pharmaceutical iceberg.  This fatal scheme implicates the whole industry.

I’ll tell you right now, there are millions of Americans who aren’t going to go near a COVID vaccine including me. Not until we are absolutely, positively sure it’s safe & effective.

If scientifically backed plans had been put out to schools, the schools could have focused on making adjustments for their population.

Lack of freedom of speech is terrible. Hong Kong is a crude example of the thinking of Beijing. When we asked to the people if they had any family member unexpectedly sick, and about 17,000 said: yes, we have one, or two, or more. That answer and the geographical distances indicated the speed of the infection. Then we realized that the virus was going to humble all of us. Yes, including the communist party.

Developing a vaccine needs to be a slow methodical process, carefully vetted, and new experimental approaches need to be considered untested and with unknown safety till tested in very large numbers.

While the economy is staggering, the stock market is churning. There’s long been talk of a transaction tax; that would translate people playing games with high volume trading and other strategies into something useful for the rest of us.

In short, this is the way it’s done and it has proven its worth over time. The disservice occurs when stakeholders - in this case our President - get ahead of the science.

Good luck to the patient. Sure hope they have a complete recovery. And hopefully the scientists too will now have an idea of what an extreme adverse reaction can look like. 

I am in no great hurry to take these brave new vaccines. So back to masks, washing hands, social distancing, vitamins and hoping that the virus mutates to something very gentle."
2020-09-09 2:38,Incredible that pharma companies have to issue a non-binding ‘pledge’ to “stand with science” and not seek approval for a vaccine that isn’t safe. What?  Isn’t that a given?  Aren’t they scientists?  Imagine auto makers pledging to stand with engineering and not to put vehicles on the road that aren’t safe. Or beef produces saying they’ll not produce meat that will make you sick.  Really?  This is intended to give the public confidence but it just confirms for me that they are under undue pressure to ram thru a vaccine that isn’t safe. Make sure they are held accountable and can be sued for failure. All these companies understand is the money.

I served in the Chaplain Corps of the US Navy for 15 years before I had to return to my home diocese several years ago.  I wrote a letter to the President using the White House website about some concerns related to my service prior to my resignation of my commission.  I received a response from the Commander of the Judge Advocate General Corps addressing my concerns, explaining the situation and giving me a point of contact with phone number should I have further questions.  I got results from the President using the White House website!  Try contacting the CEO of your local electric provider to explain why you had to suffer without power for a number of days after the recent storm and your would receive....nothing in response.  This President gets things done and requires his subordinates to act.  My experience does not make me believe that he does not respect the military or veterans.

2020-09-07 15:43,"The current state of affairs between the U.S. and China is troubling. When Trump was unable to deliver a comprehensive trade deal, as usual he became vindictive. Now China is demonized, and has become the political fall guy for Trump Administration's failures. ""Blame China!""

Inequities in the relationship needed to be dealt with, but things did not need to get this bad. Cooler heads might have avoided a destructive trade war that now has the potential of turning into shooting one in the S. China Sea. 

We reached this low point because Trump listened to his firebrand trade adviser Peter Navarro, former Fox News talking head. In a recent column Paul Krugman referred to economist Navarro as a 'quack.'"
2020-09-07 15:39,"Coronavirus is just laying bare the incompetency, indiscipline, disorderly, dishonest and disorganized behavior of India as a country and a society that were hidden for more 70 years since British left the country.

In any society or country, its leaders and its population have to let go of some selfishness and be committed to the society or to the country for larger good and development. That commitment towards common good of society has been lacking in India since British left. Therefore, society has never developed all these years and it is now showing up in the form of coronavirus takeover. When China could do it with similar population, India too could have flattened the curve by now. No excuses. It all comes down to discipline and commitment towards the society by its leaders and population."
2020-09-07 16:11,"“Natalie Lambert, a health researcher at Indiana University School of Medicine, recently surveyed more than 1,500 long-haul patients through the Survivor Corps Facebook page and found a number of common psychological symptoms. She found that anxiety was the eighth most common long-haul symptom, cited by more than 700 respondents.”

It would have been useful to point out that these numbers may be of limited value in understanding the broader experience of Covid-19 survivors, as they derive from a rather non-ransom survey.

Almost by definition, people join a support group (such as Body Politic) because they already are experiencing some level of difficulty coping, with a smaller number of people joining in order to ward off or avoid such difficulty.  It makes sense that a large percentage of the support group members surveyed reported anxiety, since that condition/symptom may have been a reason they sought support in the first place or continue to be active in the group.  Extrapolating from those numbers, drawn as they were from a self-selecting subgroup (people willing to take the survey) of an already self-selected group (people choosing to join a support group aimed at helping people understand and cope with longer term personal impacts of a specific diseases), in order to reach valid conclusions about an exponentially broader population, is a bit more complicated."

Every time I now hear that a right-winger has contracted coronavirus or has died from it, I get feelings of schadenfreude rather than sorrow.  I reserve the sorrow for the poor, innocent healthcare workers who are forced to take care of them."
2020-09-07 17:45,"Sound science on the virus only goes so far. The unknowns about the virus are pervasive. 

The number of people who have been infected and the mortality rate are largely unknown.  And there is a great deal about mortality risk that is also unknown.

Most of our universities, which are guided by sound science, appear to be failing miserably.   Sound science is only as effective as individual compliance. 

While most precautions call for compliance from the general public, most of the danger is confined to discrete groups. Yet there isn’t much in the way of targeted precautions. The prevailing view is that you protect the vulnerable by protecting everybody. 

Because the virus spreads exponentially, success in control can vary widely over time. It ain’t over until it’s over. 

True success takes into account the ability to return to normal practices without spurring an outbreak. Success in this regard has been limited 

Some people will tell you if this measure or that measure had been taken, 31,111 lives would have been saved.  But they overestimate the state of our knowledge and underestimate the state of our ignorance. 

 Surely, our major state universities did not ignore science. And yet things are spiraling out of control. High quality efforts to open up look good on paper. In reality, not so much. And if you’re guided by what’s on paper, you will underestimate what we do not know."

2020-09-07 20:34,The last that I knew about taxation is that states and cities have the power to levie taxes. Why do they need the power of the federal government to help them with their budgets? The only answer is that they already have pushed their respective economies to the brink of failure with their over the top taxation already and the high tax states want to force their tax burden on lower tax states. It's time the high tax states learn to live with the revenue stream their citizenship is willing to pay and not con others into paying their bills. Como is no different than Madoff in his actions.

Then a tourist entered and started yelling that he refused to  have his temperature taken, that the store had no business taking his temperature, asked for the manager, etc.

Instead of issuing precautionary guidelines such as wearing masks or gloves when riding transit, they’re telling Americans to avoid it altogether! This false recommendation is mostly a reminder of where they’re headquartered; Atlanta, where it can be safely assumed you’re ignorant about transit unless you immediately come out and say something gushingly positive. Not only is the CDCs advice about avoiding transit horrible public policy, but it makes me suspect about what else the CDC is biased about."
2020-09-07 20:25,"I am a pretty healthy guy, do not smoke, drink, or use other ""stuff"" to pollute my body. I even eat quite well, hardly ever eat meat, and never overfill myself. I believe I picked up this corona somewhere on a bus or train, it gave me severe headache and a bit of dry cough. It all went away in a few days, and I say thanks to the raw garlic, ginger, and French shallots I have with avocados each morning mixed with a bit of lime juice, iodized salt and high quality balsamic vinegar. Yes, I also like a couple of table spoons of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water daily.
My take on this corona virus is that it is cleaning up the earth of a lot of unhealthy people. I have always felt that there are many individuals living because of assistance from modern medicines who would have otherwise died in infancy. The people among us who have been kept alive because of modern medicine are actually a burden on the society at large because of the cost of keeping them alive due to long term medical care. So, corona virus is doing a clean up.
I believe, we all should let this corona take its course, it will kill off all the people with weak constitutions and make this world a healthier stronger place. If I was weak, I would find it better to be dead then be a burden on hospitals, doctors, nurses, etc.

If the new standard is no cases, ie positive tests of any kind, even though the tests have a high percentage of false results, in particular the rapid tests have a high false positive rate; and that asymptomatic spread is real, especially in kids, despite all available evidence to the contrary; and that those who had Covid can get reinfected and potentially die, which is also false, I assume that this whole in person school thing will last 2 weeks, maybe less. It seems like it's vaccine or bust, and the vaccine better be 100% effective, or even that won't matter. I know Covid hysteria is an important part of liberal virtue signaling, but when it hurts your kids it's demoralizing, angering, but mostly depressing."

It's obvious many of them have been asymptomatic and taken the virus back to college.
Since the  majority of them are asymptomatic or have few symptoms and do not suffer with the virus, when the colleges find they have an outbreak (would be interesting to know how they determine this, since there does not appear to be any comprehensive testing), all students should be confined to campus until they test negative.  Lockdown in college for all of them.
Sending them back home and out into society is the last thing you should do as they won't isolate or quarantine when home;  hence vulnerable people have to continue to do so because of these selfish youths."

One, it would be nice to see stories of colleges that are managing the virus well. There are universities and colleges that have not had outbreaks and others that have managed to get an early surge under control. I’d love to hear about what is working for a change. 

Second, it would also be nice for the NYT to remind readers that all the schools, and every school district in the country, is having to figure out its response to COVID without any support from the Trump Administration. They’ve offered no formal guidance whatsoever on the safe reopening of schools for students of any age.

2) Doctors must monitor the body's immune reactions through lab work like ferritin levels to determine if there is a cytokine storm or other reactions like pervasive blood clots and deal with the conditions of the moment.
3) Newer Multiple Sclerosis drugs that can dampen immune reactions and kill viruses should be explored for efficacy in controlling the COVID-19.
4) This is just a thought, but is it possible that all the micro-plastics in our food supply may be also increasing our background inflammatory response?
5) Doctors need to share on a global scale their anecdotal experiences with experimental treatments especially for trying to save peers and family.

While I am not yet in the 80 age group, I'm not that far behind.  But more importantly, I have had a compromised autoimmune system for the past 20 years.  It all started with a diagnosis of iritis occurring in both eyes at the same time.  The specialist I was seeing warned me that this was a pretty strong indicator of autoimmune issues to follow, i.e., RA, lupus, type 1 diabetes.

I really appreciate this article.  I see it as just another crucial piece of information to have to help protect my husband and myself the best way I can from this virus.

Neither of us are sitting home, wringing our hands, scared to do or go anywhere.  But we are extremely mindful of keeping a safe distance, wearing a mask and practicing pristine hygiene.

We were invited to a joint birthday party a few months ago.  Of course no one wore a mask nor kept any kind of a distance.  When the birthday cake was brought out and the two recipients had to blow out the candles four times before complete success, even though we were at the back of the room, we said lovingly - ""happy birthday kids.  We love you, but we're going to book.""   We were extremely nervous and stunned at the behavior of everyone at that party.

Needless to say, we tend to stick close to home, forget the birthday parties.  It's safer to mail a card and a check then wish them well in person.

Keep reporting about this stuff NYT.   It's crucial!"

The tragedy is that we have learned nothing to prepare us for the inevitable next threat - and have far fewer resources to deploy."

You would think this would be a baseline knowledge regardless of a virus or an infection or a pathogen.

I strongly fault Faucci that he did not alert nursing homes, hospitals and other facilities caring for the elderly -  these folks are really vulnerable.

We needed a surgeon's scalpel but we got a Faucci hammer.

And to use a current favorite military term - these seniors are a cannon fodder for Wuhan or whatever POTUS is alleged to have said about soldiers in WW II.

Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling touted mega doses of Vitamin C.   What about antioxidants?   

This is one person's anecdote.   But before this 65 year old contracted Covid, I think I set a record for consuming brussels sprouts in one year.   I also ate plenty of fruit, mainly citrus and berries.    I had a mild case.   The fever was over in 24 hours.   I mowed the lawn between viral outbursts in my system.

Pauling's claims have been discounted by plenty of research studies.   But still, I think his ideas about proper eating can be used to prolong lifespan and the ability to fight disease.  The guy won two undivided Nobel Prizes.   He was born in 1901, and lived to be 93 years old."

2020-09-08 19:21,"""Covid-19 patients who are 80 or older are hundreds of times more likely to die than those under 40""

What I am reading elsewhere is that old people will be the third in line group to receive the vaccine when it is available.

Yes, it is true that they are less likely to be infected than those who have to interact with many people daily in person.  However, if you factor in the huge difference in death rate of the infected between quite old and fairly young people, those over 80 will have had a higher overall chance of dying of COVID-19, period."
2020-09-08 19:22,"I hope someone, somewhere is investigating whether fasting (intermittent or extended) can be an adjunct natural therapy. Fasting very quickly reduces inflammation."
2020-09-08 19:30,"I am tremendously grateful that this article was printed.  It s the first on I have seen addressing , what is to me, a life threatening issue for the elderly.  I have immune senescence and inflamaging.  (I have had an infection or have been on antibiotics for 50% of the days since June 23rd.)  I am also rather paranoid about allowing anyone without a mask within 12 feet of me.  I try to keep masked people further than 6 feet away too.  This has caused some reactions from others but I know this disease will kill me.  I'm not afraid to die but this death is a particularly horrendous one and that terrifies me.  I am so glad that the scientists are investigating this.  People need to understand how their actions can effect others.  Someone's ""freedom"" to not wear a mask could kill me because the virus is airborne and they would go blithely on their way not caring."
2020-09-08 19:48,"There are a lot of reasons for older people (joint problems, cardiovascular problems, relatives with dementia, diabetes, and probably more) to eat a generally anti-inflammatory diet, keep your weight down as best you can, find an exercise program that works for you, take a daily baby aspirin if the doc thinks it’s a good idea, take turmeric and ginger, take fish oil high in Omega 3s and low in mercury, and make sure you’re not deficient in zinc or Vitamin D or C. All without overdoing it of course. 

Sounds to me like Covid is yet another reason to do that stuff. Address chronic inflammation and give the immune system what it needs to keep working. No guarantees in life but it’s generally prudent to up your odds of good outcomes."
2020-09-08 19:58,"I was 56 when I caught H1N1 eleven years ago. It was mild, but it initiated Celiac, an autoimmune disease. Wearing a mask and distancing is a minor inconvenience compared to the known and unknown consequences of infection. How many of those with even minor symptoms will have life-long damage and (or) autoimmune disease(s)?"
2020-09-08 20:02,"I’m an immunologist. It is very true that aging increases chronic inflammation in a way that is not helpful for fighting off infectious diseases. There are many causes, most of which we currently cannot treat. However, losing weight if you are overweight and also exercising are two extremely beneficial and highly effective ways to reduce inflammation at any age. This is because fat stores and produces inflammatory cytokines that contribute to the inflammaging.  In addition, increased muscle mass helps control your blood sugar, which improves your immune function."
2020-09-08 20:33,"my diminished immune system just knocked me out for several days after the senior flu shot. two days of intermittent high fever, followed by two days of near unconsciousness.  I think I'm ok now, but any further problems and I'll get tested for covid. reactions to flu shots are not uncommon for me, but the high fever, 102, was unusual. I usually just run the gamut of flu symptoms over the course of a week, starting a week after the shot."
2020-09-08 20:42,I am not sure the experience with the elderly is what these experts describe. It is true that they have a substantial higher fatality rate. However most of it appears to be during the initial stages of overwhelming viremia and not the second stage of cytokine storm. I wish we actually study the elderly in more detail rather than conjecture. I think we can save more elderly if we start anti-viral therapy such as Remdesivir and perhaps even convalescent plasma early. It is worth looking how many elderly received Remdesivir.
2020-09-08 21:08,Thank you for providing the medical research that supports our rationale for being super careful. No travelling. No restaurants including patios. No visitors to our new condo in Yorkville Toronto including children and grandchildren. Outdoor walking daily fully masked and socially distanced. Lots of Netflix and live sports on TV. And that is the accepted discipline until there is an effective vaccine. Six months and counting. The time will zoom by.
2020-09-08 21:14,"There is lot of hand waving in research too these days. Lots of researchers try to publish with flimsy evidence just to get academic credits. It is OK to do so so long as it does not come into conflict with human interfacing. Haphazard reporting also does not help. For example the word ""diabetes"" is thrown in without any scruple. Yes it is a malady but many people keep it well-controlled. The researchers do not make a distinction---they sweep all diabetics with the same brush about severity of the disease and fatality. Scientific research has lost its golden touch of yester years."
2020-09-08 19:57,"The FDA ignores, and the larger medical community seems unaware of, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that  exactly addresses the overactive and dysfunctional immune system of the elderly and those with chronic inflammation. 

Leronlimab is an mAb which blocks the receptor site for CCR5 a signaling protein on macrophages and T lymphocytes. Blocking CCR5 stops the chemokine CCL5/RANTES from binding and stops the inflammatory cascade of cytokine storms and macrophage activation syndromes.

Critically importantly, leronlimab stops the cytokine storm in any patients, not just the elderly. Leronlimab blocks trafficking of macrophages to areas of inflammation, reverses exhaustion of T cells to allow the an appropriate response of the adaptive immune system, and reverses the cytokine storm.

This is exactly the treatment needed for Covid 19. Most patients fight the disease without a dysfunctional collapse of the immune system. Time and lives are being wasted while the FDA hems and haws."
2020-09-08 21:07,"How about another driver of this risk - residence in nursing homes? With 45% of deaths attributable to nursing homes, why are we not surprised? It's the nursing homes that cause the deaths, not the elderly...yet it's much easier to throw up our hands and blame the elderly than to overturn laws that protect nursing homes or drive out their powerful lobbyists. 

Additionally, there is a wide variance among individuals when it comes to aging immune systems. 

From Geriatrician and gerontologist George Kuchel of the University of Connecticut:  “It is not chronological age alone that determines how one does in the face of a life-threatening infection such as COVID-19,” he cautions in StatNews. “Having multiple chronic diseases and frailty is in many ways as or more important than chronological age. An 80-year-old who is otherwise healthy and not frail might be more resilient in fighting off infection than a 60-year-old with many chronic conditions.”  

Writing in AgingCell,  Duggal et. al. compared immune profiles of 125 adults aged 55-79 with 75 younger but more sedentary adults. The active “older” group, who had engaged in cycling over a period of years showed significant evidence of reduced immunosenescence. 

 Why aren't you quoting some of these sources? Your ageism seriously harms healthy adults who are threatened with the curtailment of activities that keep them healthy and protect their immune systems.

2020-09-08 21:29,The Times is on to something and I hope the paper continues to slosely follow the science/medicine of the body's immune response.  To my knowledge there is only ONE prospective covid therapeutic that is undergoing the advanced FDA approval process - stages 2 and 3.  The drug is Leronlimab.
2020-09-08 21:40,"""Will you still need me, will you still feed me when I'm 64""?  Thank you Paul McCartney!! No matter what the researchers say about statins lowering inflammation and using metformin, we are all going to die some day. And, honestly, it will probably be when we are over 65 and definitely will be when we are over 80. In the meantime, live every day like it's your last and don't let them keep you alive just to take up space in and help fund: a doctor's office; a hospital; a hospice."

As with so many other diseases that are closely linked with inflammation responses (e.g. MS,RA,etc.) the detailed biochemistry of the immune response is key to understanding the mechanisms at play. Please do more in-depth articles on the immune response."
2020-09-08 23:33,What would really be interesting is to look at the elderly who had no/mild Covid symptoms and recovered well.
2020-09-08 23:52,"COVID or no COVID people over 80 are more likely to die from any health related cause. Almost all of us are being treated for conditions that previously finished off folks at younger ages. For that reason many of us are more active and fit in spite of underlying health problems. 

The other factor keeping many old folks alive and well in this pandemical time is that we follow the advice of public health authorities: wear a mask, maintain social distancing, and avoid large gatherings. 

When the pandemic begin old people worldwide were expected to drop like flies in winter while everyone else would be fairly safe. Except for elderly healthcare residents who live in conditions beyond their control, in this country younger adults of all ages seemed to contract the virus primarily due to factors that made them more susceptible. As New York's governor pointed out, the health care workers had a better record in staying COVID-free and alive than the general public because they followed the Stay Safe rules whereas many young and sound folks didn’t.

Old or young, let’s all believe and do what the professional medical doctors advise. That way we can watch the trend line show us how low it can go, and school, work, life as we’ve known it will return,"
2020-09-09 0:19,"“The key to successful aging and longevity may be to decrease chronic inflammation without compromising an acute response when exposed to pathogens. How are we going to do that? Nutrition. What we eat is probably the most powerful and pliable tool that we have to attain a chronic and systemic modulation of the aging process.

 In the first systematic review of the associations between dietary patterns and biomarkers of inflammation ever published, the dietary patterns associated with inflammation were almost all meat-based or so-called “Western” diet patterns, while vegetable and fruit-based or “healthy” patterns tended to be inversely associated, meaning more plant-based, less inflammation.”. <a href=""https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-counter-the-inflammation-of-aging"" target=""_blank"">https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-counter-the-inflammation-of-aging</a>/"

2020-09-09 0:36,"Unfortunately, neither this article nor the sources/experts cited are actually answering the question they set out to answer: namely, does an aging immune system make people more vulnerable to COVID?

They make the fatal analytical flaw, quite common in medical research, of looking at age as one monolithic category. So the question that's really being addressed is the following:

""Does aging, ASSUMING THAT PEOPLE ARE BECOMING PROGRESSIVELY OVERWEIGHT/OBESE AND PROGRESSIVELY SEDENTARY, adversely affect the immune system?

The answer is clearly, yes, it does impact the immune system.  The people doing these studies could easily have looked at various subsets of the elderly (for example, in the first source, they could have broken out elderly people with low or normal BMI.)

Researchers who have looked at highly active elderly people who control their weight (in other words, athletes) have found aging immune systems generally do just fine.  To do this sort of study, you have to find people with normal BMIs, and people with low levels of CRP, IL-6 and TNF-a. These studies are not even collecting most of that data.

As the immunolgist (""Scientist"") noted below, weight control and exercise have huge positive effects on the immune system.  Fat deposits are not just static.  Fat is metabolically active and producing things you don't want produced in high levels."
2020-09-09 1:29,"It will be interesting to do a comparative study of possible immune boosting supplements prescribed by traditional medicines around the world (Chinese/Ayurvedic/African/Egyptian/Native American etc.). 
Not sure if such supplements are prescribed by practitioners of traditional medicines."
2020-09-09 3:58,"If COVID-19 patients under the age of 30 suffered the exact same high mortality rate as COVID-19 patients over the age of 60, we’d be hysterical and do so much more to protect them.
 
As a society, we tend to suddenly devalue many people when they live longer than 60 years, especially if they also reside in elderly enclaves.

There are a few rare nursing homes in COVID-19 areas that have had zero COVID-19 cases let alone deaths. Why don’t we require all nursing homes to follow their highly effective but more expensive practices?"
2020-09-09 4:04,"Check out the The American AutoImmune and Related Diseases Association to see what folks focused on auto-immune diseases and responses are figuring out.

2020-09-09 4:35,"Very interesting - this article explains more about the changes I’ve been experiencing in recent years than anything my doctors have told me: from dismissiveness at worst to ‘allergies’ at best and prescribing corticosteroids, (which have also left me more susceptible to other infections), as the seasonal flu (even with a vaccine) or even a common cold seems to constantly wear me down
for months at a time.

There may not be any solution to this aging - other than moving someplace warmer in retirement where I feel stronger - but at least I now understand.  And will definitely continue to practice the utmost precautions to avoid Covid-19."
2020-09-09 2:19,"People also become more lonely as they get older. Suicides are highest among single elderly men. The DRN neurons in the brain are activated in those who experience intense loneliness, according to Yale researchers. They are just figuring out what these neurons do to the brain and body.

2020-09-09 5:05,"We have to remember that in the last Pandemic, those who were most likely to die, weren't the elderly, but the younger people, between the ages of 20-40.  My elderly mother was born in 1921, 13 days after the last Pandemic died out in December of 1920.  Her mother might of been exposed to the virus being pregnant while living in Chicago while her husband was attending medical school.  Her mother's brother who was around 20 died of the virus while attending college in Ohio at the time.  We did know early enough with the Kirkwood Nursing home in Seattle, the toll the virus would take on the elderly.  We should of demanded that any relative or close friend remove all residents from nursing homes for a year.  It could of been done, as their deaths have been horrible with no one there, and excruciating.  Even with PPE, this particular strain of the COVID virus, somehow is devastating this age group.   I don't think that we were prepared at all, definitely with not seeing decades ago that as a country, we should still manufacture PPE, and most important drugs, as well.  That is where it all fell apart, very little PPE, so that the healthcare workers infected people in the same facilities that they were working to help save, namely: nursing homes, hospitals, clinics, EMT workers, etc.  This particular virus strain, is so novel, that the elderly haven't been exposed to any aspects of it."

We practically know instinctively that the very healthy will stand out but what I am hopeful of is enough data to put a nail in the coffin of deniers that their bad health is not that bad, pardon the pun.

I would like to know how much better my 20something fitness body is serving me internally than just guessing. I am lucky, I got enough alarm being in Asia that I started taking cautionary steps early, followed the Hong Kongers in wearing masks right away and even got a stock of great 3 layer masks before they went to the price of gold.

2020-09-09 11:26,"Things may not be what they seem. There are now tens of thousands of COVID ""long-haulers"", people who continue to suffer after-effects months after infection. Their symptoms seem remarkably similar to the known symptoms of mild thiamine deficiency. The latter include chronic fatigue, brain fog, anxiety, breathing difficulty, racing heart, radiation sensitivity, loss of taste and smell, gastrointestinal issues, tingling and swollen arms and legs. There are reasons to believe the long hauler symptoms are in fact due to thiamine deficiency.

There is a case I am aware of, of a non-COVID elderly patient who was seemingly in the final stages of decline - unresponsive and put on a ventilator. Her granddaughter recognized the symptoms of Wernicke’s Encephalopathy, which is an often unrecognized condition caused by severe thiamine deficiency. She asked for the appropriate intravenous thiamine regime for this condition to be started and the patient quickly recovered.

There are numerous factors which can deplete the body's thiamine reserve, such as a diet high in sugar, various drugs, digestion issues and stress events, including viruses. The elderly are known to be particularly at risk of deficiency. 

I suggest that COVID outcomes are, at least partly, a function of initial thiamine level ranging from asymptomatic to the results described above. Poor outcomes could potentially be avoided by thiamine supplementation, preferably before exposure."

Half of people are wearing masks, half are not. Who knows what's going on."
2020-09-02 3:19,"So, the CDC is stopping evictions. The current term will probably be extended until a vaccine is available. But if Congress doesn't provide support to folks who are out of work and facing eviction, then when a vaccine becomes available, lots of folks will be evicted, and then imprisoned in the US' modern day debtors prison. 

Sounds like a wonderful plan: laid off during the pandemic, evicted after a vaccine becomes available, and then thrown into prison for failure to pay fines and legal fees.

Who said Trump doesn't care about Americans?"
2020-09-08 14:03,"I wish stories about the vaccine development did not look like a press release from the vaccine makers.  For example, when this article says that the antibodies formed by volunteers in tests ""neutralize"" the virus, what does that mean in factual terms?  The antibodies bind to the virus particles? The virus is not infective? Or something else?  I think it means only that they bind to the virus, but maybe an explicit characterization would be more informative and correct the wrong interpretation of a vague term.

The only thing about side effects these trials indicate so far is that short-term effects are not evident.  Long term effects are still an open question.

""Moderna and Pfizer are testing a new kind of vaccine that has never before been approved for use by people."" The prospect of delayed effects is significant.  For at least one of the vaccines mentioned, an engineered virus ""agent"" will introduce the Covid 19 RNA into recipient cells.   

The virus agents and the protein they synthesize in human cells are not a static challenge. If they persistently churn out antigenic proteins, long-term responses of the immune system to a chronic challenge remains an open question. We can hope it will be just what is needed for a durable immunity to Covid 19. Ending trials of these vaccines early seems a lot riskier than usual for vaccine trials."
2020-09-08 14:07,For Carl- You seem to have forgotten CiVax from soligenix on your previous list of vaccines in development. It may end up being one of the most promising too. It's early stages but it's quite novel versus all of the rest.

If we were using less novel mechanisms I’d not be as concerned, but these vaccines don’t have any long-term data on the delivery mechanism, unlike the Oxford vaccine."
2020-09-08 16:12,"Just curious. Why does it make sense not to engage in the correct protocols to bring this very important vaccine to market?

And how sad.  Because if things had been handled with truth and honesty from the get go, these vaccines could be viewed as safe if they are, and thousands could be getting the vaccine safely.  

But distrust Trumps trust now.  And people will refuse, rightly so, and the ramifications will prevail.  More COVID."
2020-09-08 14:42,I really wonder if the level of distrust that is shown by the commenters to this article is based on their actual skepticism or it is political. In other words if Biden were in office and the vaccine came out would they still be questioning it? If it is a political objection then why not just say it “I don’t trust Trump and I don’t believe it”. Why go through the theatrics of questioning the Science and research methods when in fact the real objection is that it might help Trump? I am not a pro Trump in any way but I feel these objections are very disingenuous and these people‘s ideology is clouding their judgment.￼￼￼￼

2020-09-08 16:32,There are so many problems with this article. We have no idea who has been exposed already. We rely on tests which seem to produce false positives and false negatives in abundance. And where exactly are all these volunteers coming from?  How can there be any consistent monitoring and/or testing when there are so many entrants in the vaccine race?  This article treats these problems rather blithely. I am over 65 and I assure you I won’t consider any vaccine which is rushed to market because it seems to work pretty well.
2020-09-08 16:24,"Given that we have lost all trust in the CDC and the FDA as totally politicized agencies under the WH, I would never try a Vaccine that comes out before election day. In fact, I will wait until Dr. Fauci says a Vaccine is now ready for distribution."

That is just too blatantly obvious for me and there is no way I would ever believe that adequate testing has been done to ensure that it’s safe and effective.  The likelihood that it’s a political stunt is far too great, and yes, I think Trump is just that diabolical.  I’ll wait thanks, probably for the Europeans to green light something.  Or for Trump and his cabal to be gone.   But this administration, this CDC and this FDA?  No way."
2020-09-08 16:47,"Problem-- The CDC and the FDA have been taken control of by Trump appointee whose first and sole allegiance is to Donald Trump.

Yeah...a Vaccine delivered by these agencies and the pharmaceutical companies who PROMISE US that they will skimp no rules and cut no corners to get to the finish line before the November Election?

Meanwhile McConnell will certainly press for monetary and legal immunity for these companies if the Vaccine goes horribly wrong? Side effects? Long term Issues yet unknown?
 
For a president who REFUSED to even treat Covid-19 as a real threat-- FOR MONTHS?

I’m hoping for a vaccine and if it happens before the election I’ll be very grateful.  The sooner the better, provided...  But the new technology begs several questions. Will FDA clear the vaccines based on a marginal benefit to risk analysis or will they only be released if the data show they are safe and effective? Please publish an article about the risks associated with the vaccine technology.  Experts could weigh in now and it would help the public know about the regulatory pathway for approval."
2020-09-08 17:59,"Manufacturing and distribution hurdles will make an October release little more than an opportunity for good press.

It means logistic networks for delivery at -20F from the manufacturer to distributor to retail at unheard of volumes.   The article seems to imply manufacturing capacity at 10s of millions of doses per month. The math isn’t hard to figure out. It’s going to take time."

2020-09-08 18:32,"This is extremely good news. I will be first in line and I hope most Americans will join me. It is totally irresponsible for politicians to cast a cloud of doubt over the legitimacy of a vaccine. Clearly this is a designed talking point.
I don't know which is worse, the fact that the Biden campaign is promoting such nonsense or the fact that people are believing the nonsense.
Do people think that Trump is secretly developing the vaccine on his own in the White House kitchen? There are literally thousands of doctor's and scientists working on a safe vaccine. People that are saying they won't take the vaccine because of Trump were never going to take it in the first place."
2020-09-08 19:34,"Even a consortium of drugmakers is not a sufficient gatekeeper for the approval of COVID-19 vaccines for use by the general public.  Despite public relation ads, these corporations have a laser focus on the profit motive.  They are corporations exposed to the carrots and sticks of regulatory and tax policies of the current government.  And they are jostling for position in the market.  No, the gatekeeper needs to be more sophisticated than drugmakers and federal regulators."
2020-09-08 19:50,"We are really supposed to believe that a Phase 3 trial of a couple months (or less in the case of the vaccine that isn't even finished enrolling, yet plans to be done in October) is going to be sufficient to test the efficacy/safety of these vaccines??  Is anyone checking to see that people in the trial are even having the potential of being exposed to the virus?  Doesn't do any good if you are not.  The whole idea of having extended Phase 3 trials is to ensure that you have sufficient data to draw conclusions.  This sounds like a recipe for certain disaster - introduce a vaccine that may or may not be effective, and then people believe the pandemic is over, run out and do whatever they want with no precautions."
2020-09-08 19:51,"I don't think the timeline being discussed will allow these new vaccines to achieve a reasonable standard of demonstrated safety. A completely new type of vaccine? with basically a few phase 3 trials and no long-term follow up?

2020-09-08 22:05,"I wonder what cells these companies are using to propagate these mRNA constructs. Have they ever used mRNA vaccines on animals in a large manner? I remember the 1976 swine flu vaccine (thanks to an excellent article in nytimes),that caused an unfortunate outcome of Guillain Barre in 450 people. A small number but it left everyone else susceptible to the same problem. The irony was the animal farming industry refused to agree to vaccinate animals, so boy, all of them were a whole load better protected than humans during that period. Of course it was a mild disease, but we know this in hind sight. Then too the US rushed to vaccinate with a hurried vaccine by rightly projecting ahead of time to keep the country safe. It was a difficult decision and sadly a bad gamble. The rest of Europe was far more cautious, stock piling vaccine and waiting, probably for our impatient nation to provide data. So while I mull questions on what if the mRNA vaccine insert recombines with the virus in some people, causing a new virus to emerge, I’ll just keep wearing masks, washing my hands and ensuring safe distance. Of course, I will be keenly watching the companies that are much slower and taking longer to produce vaccines/drugs. Maybe even invest in a couple."

2020-09-08 22:54,"An important measure of the phase 3 trials is determining how efficacious the treatment is: does it do what it is supposed to do.  Really the only way to do that is to release these volunteers into the wild  and see who gets sick and who doesn't.  With a disease such as Covid 19, with such a low prevalence rate, it could take many months to get any significant data.  The safety related data will be easy to come by and will be available soon but the efficacy data won't be reliably back until next year.  Giving out the vaccine prematurely to millions of people just because it is deemed safe seems foolhardy without really know if the think actually works."
2020-09-08 23:59,"Not overly concerned about safety (the drug companies want to protect themselves), as much as effectiveness.  People will think they (and others) are protected when they aren’t, then keep spreading the virus to others.  And it’s going to take months to set up a fair and efficient distribution system.  Not expecting general distribution until spring 2021 at the earliest."

2020-09-09 2:53,"Trumpers will take the vaccine the day after they start wearing masks.  That puts the rest of us at risk by participating in the uncontrolled trial of a prematurely-approved vaccine.  Our deaths will legitimately feed the anti-vax movement.  The population will decrease, reducing air and water pollution, leaving a paradise for the rich folks who supported Trump but got regular SARS-CoV-19 testing.  Unfortunately, no one will be left to mow their lawns or cook for them."

The clinical review, including an overall benefit-risk assessment and recommendations for regulatory action is the best source of information for people seeking to understand if the vaccine is something they should take.

This is commonly available online after a biologic is approved.

However, I believe it WOULD NOT be available before approval, even if a vaccine is made available on a mass basis through an “emergency use authorization”.

A reason to be vaccine “hesitant” if the vaccines are made available without first being approved.

And I might offer it to people I care about and immediate family if they were willing. 

However, as far as advertising the 'cure' to others, that blurs the line between science and self-promotion. Only randomized trials on a large population can prove whether the idea of a cure does what it says it does."
2020-09-02 14:16,"Back in March there was a report of Stanford student conducting DIY testing for the virus for acquaintances. Generally anyone with access to a gene sequencing machine could do this since the genetic sequence of covid-SARS-2 had been published in January. There are thousands of such machines in academic and industrial research labs. In March the CDC still had a monopoly of testing using its slow and defective internal testing.

DIY gene sequencing is safer than DIY vaccine injections."

But then it's one other person, then a few, then a lot and then all of a sudden there are side effects that nobody could have expected and some sucker has their life ruined by something they didn't need to take. 

It doesn't matter how smart you are, the only way to know - rather than believe - that a vaccine is safe is by large scale randomized trials. And worth recalling Feynman's aphorism ""The easiest person to fool is yourself.""

2020-09-03 3:54,"I have a Ph.D. in microbiology and I thought about doing this myself.  Most people seem to be missing the fact that there is an extremely large body of information in the scientific literature on the best ways to make a SARS-CoV vaccine, both from SARS in 2003 to SARS-CoV-2 in 2020.  In fact, there are so many studies out there that I could put the question on an Immunology final exam and I think most undergraduates would get the right answer.  

Additionally, most of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines now in Phase III clinical trials have been published in peer-reviewed journals with detailed methods on how to re-produce them.  

Lastly, these methods are indeed relatively simple for someone with my level of expertise to follow and it would be easy to generate an identical vaccine in my lab.  Moreover, it is also relatively easy to test one's own immune response to the DIY vaccine just as would be done in a clinical setting.  This would offer just the amount of efficacy verification that a Phase II clinical trial provides.  

However, it is deeply unethical to use my labs resources to do this, it is stealing.  It is also beyond the pale to do this for other people for profit. 

Yet, if the SARS-CoV-2 mortality rate was similar to the 2018 Spanish flu I think these ethical calculations would change.  But if SARS-CoV-2 had a higher mortality rate, I also think our governments' response would have been more intelligent as opposed to being so juvenile.  This discussion would then be moot."

A certain amount of risk is involved in any human endeavors. However, I don't agree with accepting money except for expenses. 
While I would not personally volunteer for any ""home remedy"", I do believe these people have the freedom, knowledge, and ability to 'invent' their own health regimen, 
...and that is WHY they have not been prevented by law from continuing in their perhaps fruitless[...or dangerous] pursuits. 
What I do know is that every biology scientist is looking through the best microscopes on Earth trying to solve this problem, and who knows what or who will solve many other human health issues? 
The volumes of medical knowledge compiled during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic will be greater than in all human history, and that is the GOOD NEWS for today."
2020-09-04 18:04,"Some seem to take from this article the idea that these ""do it yourself"" vaccines might be dangerous. But the materials used in them are innocuous and incapable of causing Covid-19 disease. No one is using live virus for these vaccines, or anything that might make anyone ill. 

The worst that could happen is that the vaccine does not work to immunize against the virus. As long as people are not misled into thinking that the vaccine does work, I see no harm in what these scientists are doing. 

And I see some benefit. I'm in favor."
2020-09-04 14:56,"Prednisone is my jam.
I have asthma and every other 2-3 years I get really sick.  Non productive cough, severe congestion. the only thing that helps me is a two week course of prednisone with high dose advair.  

The Medryl pack is not enough to bring down the inflammation.  This is what I did last January which was the last time I was really sick- I don’t think I had covid- my antibody tear was negative. 

I see a pulmonologist and follow up every six months- especially now -"
2020-09-04 15:39,I'm glad the medical establishment is finally learning to treat this illness; but steroids should be for more than just the critically ill.  I was a 'long-hauler' and sick for over three months; but not bad enough for hospitalization. I knew I was suffering from inflammation and an anti-inflammatory diet helped.  I'm sure steroids would have been more effective at calming my system.  After five months I still sometimes get residual symptoms- and NSAID's help a lot.
2020-09-04 17:52,"It seems we are proving many facets of Covid. Some people die of the infection, some from inflammation and some from clots. Each requires a different treatment. 

It will be interesting to see if steroids treat the lingering effects some patients are reporting which can range from myocarditis to a foggy brain. 

The more I learn, the less I believe the infection is overall benign to all but a few. The same could have been said if polio."
2020-09-04 17:13,"Given what we know about steroids, this should have been an instinctive response among care providers to begin with."
2020-09-14 17:14,What a nut job.  Fear for the republic.
2020-09-14 17:17,"What the hacking, interfering and meddling Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu is going on here?

Alex Azar and Mike Caputo are both useful assets and idiots for both men.

Along with Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Jared Kushner, Mike Pompeo, Bill Barr and Chad Wolf.

While COVID-19 aka novel coronavirus-19 aka SARS-2 aka COV-SARS-2 is making a cruise ship buffet petri dish domesticated animal farm of Americans."
2020-09-14 17:19,Mr. Caputo sounds like he is very stressed and having a serious mental health breakdown.  He must be removed as he is fomenting “armed conflict”.
2020-09-14 17:16,"Michael Caputo believes that left wing radicals are trying to kill him.  

Just think about that.

This is certainly the end product of Trumpworld: the total collapse of rational perception of reality.

But more so, this man needs major help.  Why are the people around him not intervening?"
2020-09-14 17:14,Pretty sure this guy isn’t stable enough to be in the position he currently holds.
2020-09-14 17:14,Very reassuring to find there are people in this Administration who are even loonier than Trump.
2020-09-14 17:17,"Every day that passes, this administration becomes more and more bizarre."
2020-09-14 17:19,Left wing hit squads out to get him?  Talk about drinking the Koolaid.  Trump and Jim Jones seem to be having similar effects on their followers.  Not good at all.
2020-09-14 17:20,"What utter nonsense. Here’s the critical difference about the importance of science over political interference during a pandemic: every single political appointee could resign tomorrow and the country would be immensely better off. The complete opposite would occur if every CDC and NIH scientist decided to take a walk. Scientists aren’t interested in politics. They’re interested in solving complex problems for societal benefits, with zero interference from politicians. This administration blames and politicizes everyone and everything to escape taking responsibility for the mess they have allowed to get worse this entire year."
2020-09-14 17:21,"Mr. Caputo appears to be correct about one thing.

It’s hard to argue that he has a mental health issue."
2020-09-14 17:22,"If his mental health has “failed” as he states himself, perhaps he should take a break, for everybody’s benefit."
2020-09-14 17:16,"Facebook needs to take his stuff down and he needs to take a leave of absence to address his current mental state. He sounds unhinged. Unfortunately, starts at the top of this administration."
2020-09-14 17:21,"Is it any wonder that Americans now live in an ongoing debacle? 
With COVID-19 ‘under control’ and
‘forest management’ responsible for the West Coast fires, why worry...be Trumpy.

The gentleman at the CDC certainly needs counseling and to be relieved of his duties.

Threatening people because you disagree with them is NEVER OK."
2020-09-14 17:11,It can’t be any clearer. The people running the government don’t believe in democracy. We have wannabe dictators and authoritarians in control of our supposed democracy. Everyone is wringing their hands about whether our democracy will be lost. Aren’t we there already?
2020-09-14 17:19,I hope this poor man will be immediately removed from his position and sent for the mental health services he so obviously needs. This is clearly part of the outcome when the president installs inexperienced political hacks in important government positions.
2020-09-14 17:21,"Rarely at a loss for words, all I can say is, Wow!"""
2020-09-14 17:21,This administration seems to mirror many of the major plot twists in Harry Potter more and more each day. Luckily we’re all blessed with the miracle of magic...voting.
2020-09-14 17:22,The damage from amplifying such lies is potentially as deadly to our democracy as Covid is to our health.
2020-09-14 17:20,"Michael Caputo is a political consultant, not a doctor or public health specialist.  Why should anyone listen to him about coronavirus?"
2020-09-14 17:20,"This insanity has to come to an end. People with obvious mental health problems are running huge swathes of the US government. Paranoid schizophrenia should no longer be allowed a voice in government. A new government will have to introduce legislation to prevent this from happening again. It’s the greatest danger the world faces today, it is rendering society totally inefficient."
2020-09-14 17:21,"Mr. Caputo should never be confused for being more intelligent about a thing medical than Drs. Scientists. I am up to here with having to experience absolute uneducated baffoons assume they know more above the highly hard-working, educated, and established science population. Sure, Caputo went to college for a BA which doesn't prove to me he is at all educated to speak about much whatsoever.  I want him to stop making things up, stop accusing when he has no idea what the answer is, and otherwise enjoy the fame. I wish for his candle to blow out by hue and cry."
2020-09-14 17:22,Caputo’s comments should be afforded any legitimacy. The history of his rhetoric clearly points to partisan ambition that does not shy away from deceit for personal gain. Next.
2020-09-14 17:14,The rhetoric from this regime continues to get even more terrifying.
2020-09-14 17:16,What kind of a world do we live in where a spokesman for the Health and Human Services advises the public to purchase ammunition?
2020-09-14 17:20,Sedition by C.D.C. staff? Unsupported accusations like this are insane. The medical and scientific community should speak out in a unified voice denouncing remarks like this coming from a top official in HHS. Silence during times like this is inexcusable.
2020-09-14 17:21,"Sadly,
Mr. Caputo has no background in health care
Mr. Caputo has no background in health care
Mr. Caputo has no background in health care."
2020-09-14 17:20,Interesting that Caputo acknowledges being mentally unhinged.  Honesty about mental instability is a remarkably isolating characteristic in this administration.
2020-09-14 17:21,"Quick trip to Wiki (not the first line of factual defence I'll admit)

He worked for the Reagan Administration with Oliver North, and later as director of media services on the campaign for President George H.W. Bush in the 1992 United States presidential election. Caputo moved to Russia in 1994, after the fall of the Soviet Union, and was an adviser to Boris Yeltsin. He worked for Gazprom Media in 2000 where he worked on improving the image of Vladimir Putin in the U.S. He moved back to the U.S. and founded a public relations company, and then moved to Ukraine to work on a candidate's campaign for parliament."
2020-09-14 17:16,Scariest thing yet. Complete loss of tether. And with a lot of followers on social media.
2020-09-14 17:16,"Caputo works in COMMUNICATIONS! 

The inmates are truly running the asylum. 

For the next 50 days it looks like we can expect maximum projection of the Trump administration’s ill-intent onto others and maximum chaos to ensure an insure, unsafe election. God help us. 

Take action, organize, and vote as if your life depends on it."
2020-09-14 17:18,"In any other official in any other administration had said anything remotely like this in public, they would be fired that very day."
2020-09-14 17:21,"Is there any qualification besides being stark, raving mad to become a Trump appointee.

The words used. and positions taken are untenable."
2020-09-14 17:21,"If Trump wins, or successfully steals, this election, purges of liberals and intellectuals, not only from government and schools but from private companies, will reach a rate unseen in the west since Germany and Italy during the 1930s."
2020-09-14 17:22,"It’s plainly obvious that the facts don’t align with the narrative Mr. Caputo wants to present so, therefore, the facts are simply irrelevant.  That’s how the this administration has always operated and I am certain their methods won’t change with less than two months to go before the election.  Unfortunately for our country and thinking, rational people everywhere, facebook and other social media are platforms for Mr. Caputo and others to say and spread anything they choose. Therein lies the danger to our most fragile republic.  And I stress the word “lies”!"
2020-09-14 17:20,I'm at a loss for words. This is what our  democratic government has come to. And it continues to perpetuate the lies and conspiracy theories. I fear that we may not survive these past 4 years; god help us if there's another four.
2020-09-14 17:20,"Okay, so this seems like further evidence that President Trump and his people are planning to incite violence if the election doesn't go their way.  Why else invent the existence of a dangerous counter element?  This is a tactic repeated by authoritarians to incite violence against their opponents.  Not sure what to do about this sort of rhetoric, but it is highly disturbing."
2020-09-14 17:13,"You mean THE Michael Caputo who spent a decade working for Russia and then Roger Stone? That Caputo?

Okay."
2020-09-14 17:22,Bad enough if he wasn't a representative of the People of the United States. This is not just slander. It's treasonous.
2020-09-14 17:16,I think Caputo is in danger due to his own baseless and seditious remarks. The entire administration consists of treasonous liars and murderers whose inaction caused the deaths of nearly two hundred thousand Americans.
2020-09-14 17:24,"Paranoid, insane, and dangerous; he needs to be removed and institutionalized. Congress, push back, do you job."
2020-09-14 17:24,"Michael Caputo, 58, the assistant secretary of public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services, seems to be off his rocker.

He belongs in the DeJoy category of Trump-enabler working to install Trump as dictator-for-life for America.

Incredible, but true is all you can say about these crazy people that cannot accept the reality that white people will soon become a minority in the United States and are doing everything they can to keep white people in power at all costs."
2020-09-14 17:14,"Mr Caputo said that his “mental health has definitely failed.”
Yep."
2020-09-14 17:15,"Wow, that is just sad. That poor fellow needs a break. I’m not sure it can wait until the first week of November.￼"
2020-09-14 17:20,He does need mental health intervention.
2020-09-14 17:15,Looks like all the Trumpites are preparing to shred the last bit of faith in democracy and keep Trump in office at all costs.
2020-09-14 17:16,I'd say his mental health is definitely an issue.
2020-09-14 17:16,This man is a danger to himself and others. He needs to be placed on leave and have a psych evaluation.
2020-09-14 17:21,The best people.
2020-09-14 17:14,Why has he not resigned yet?
2020-09-14 17:18,"His mental health is failing alright, but only because he’s bought into the world of conspiracy and lies Trump has been feeding all of his followers. This is what it looks like when you become completely disconnected from facts."
2020-09-14 17:20,"Well, the bit about his mental health failing appears to be true."
2020-09-14 17:23,Another Trump swamp creature.  Biden needs to use this guy's words against Trump as an example of what is yet to come.
2020-09-14 17:20,"This administration has alienated most anyone qualified to hold these government positions. While terrifying, it’s no surprise to see the CDC falling apart. We are left with unqualified lackeys who resort to this disgusting gaslighting and conspiracy theories."
2020-09-14 17:23,There is no excuse for this! Caputo needs to be fired immediately!
2020-09-14 17:24,Holy Cow! It feels a lot like 1938. This guy brings fear a loathing to a whole new level. Trump seems to have a never ending supply of people to stir up trouble. Are people really falling for this?
2020-09-14 17:26,"I'm not sure which is more absurd...the fact that this man can say theses things with a straight face...or...there are citizens of the country who will swallow this garbage hook, line and sinker.

Both show how fall this country has fallen under the weight of this current administration."
2020-09-14 17:11,"Sedition is what TRUMP and his minions are practicing. The audacity of such an accusation is immoral and speaks to how ""low they will go""."
2020-09-14 17:23,"With people like this in a position of power thanks to Trump, it's no wonder at all why we have had by far the worst response to the pandemic in the world. Forget warp speed what we have here is warp brain. My god can it get any worse."
2020-09-14 17:23,I am completely at a  lost for words.
2020-09-14 17:25,I think an intervention is required ....
2020-09-14 17:14,Is Michael Caputo in his right mind? Is everyone in the trump administration a candidate for a straight jacket?
2020-09-14 17:15,"And so it begins.

By November 3, Trump will be calling on his second amendment people to kill Democrats on sight for stealing the elections.

Then the Trump dictatorship will begin in earnest under the guidance of Vladimir Putin.

And Republicans will cheer.

Remember the bestselling Made in China MAGA shirt:

“I would rather be Russian than a Democrat.”"
2020-09-14 17:17,"Wow, yes, his mental health has “definitely failed,” as he says. Throw in a generous helping of paranoia, shadows on the ceiling (definitely has to be an apparition; shadows on one’s ceiling just don’t happen for mentally competent people), throw out some wild, unsupported conspiracy theories, and voila, the ideal trump appointee! 
Is this nightmare over yet???"
2020-09-14 17:21,This entire administration is a criminal conspiracy to take over control of the US government. There is only evidence of right wing armed insurrection as documented and published by the FBI.  This is outrageous and there must be immediate consequences. This man must be arrested for inciting violence and treason.
2020-09-14 17:14,No evidence. Hear say. Unfounded theories. Maybe there is some truth.. to his claims of mental unstability. Trump should find a replacement and let the man rest.
2020-09-14 17:14,In normal times this guy would be out of a job by the end of today.  These are not normal times. He'll probably get a promotion .Yikes !
2020-09-14 17:21,"All I can say is a prayer; ""Oh my God help us from this craziness"
2020-09-14 17:24,Methinks Mr. Caputo's train has left the station...
2020-09-14 17:25,Only the best people.
2020-09-14 17:12,This man is sick and is in a responsible position in an important agency of our government. That's what this administration is come to. Very dangerous.
2020-09-14 17:24,This man is a 'top communications official'?  I wouldn't like to hear from his subordinates.
2020-09-14 17:26,Do we need more proof that the inmates have gotten control of the asylum?
2020-09-14 17:16,And people wonder why Trump needs to be removed from office.
2020-09-14 17:19,"Caputo is unhinged.  Our tax dollars pay for this. 

I am so discouraged — hanging on for, and working, towards the November election."
2020-09-14 17:21,"Alas, the nation will just shrug.  Another “good person” on the other side.  Even the author of this article fails in their duty to speak the truth, and to say frankly that a right wing nationalist white supremacist movement intends to end this Republic.  Trump is leading, Russia is assisting, and these are his foot soldiers."
2020-09-14 17:23,Another Trump appointee with ties to Russia who is only tangentially qualified for his position slings lies and false accusations as he lies about facts that do actually impact life and death decisions. There is so much of this everyday. It is wearisome and discouraging.
2020-09-14 17:26,Each day we see members of this administration go further and further into mad conspiracy thinking. The paranoia seems to be infectious.
2020-09-14 17:13,Scariest thing yet. Complete loss of tether.
2020-09-14 17:15,"Beyond belief, even for the Trump administration."
2020-09-14 17:22,"Michael Caputo, current DHS spokesperson and former employee of Vladimir Putin and then of Gazprom.

Mr. Caputo's appointment at DHS coincides with the federal government's decision to route all CDC public information through the DHS before public release."
2020-09-14 17:25,"If people want to gather together unprotected against spreading a deadly disease to praise Trump, who am I to condemn them?  Perhaps we should honor them as patriots willing to be crash test dummies on Trump’s victory train as it gets derailed one car at a time, you have to admit, love him or hate him Trump is not a nice guy.  Those who like that aspect might reconsider your motives if not your soul to see if it is salvageable."
2020-09-14 17:15,What are we doing reporting the words of the lunatic fringe as news? We need to include the fact that he is being referred for observation and at what institution.
2020-09-14 17:16,"I keep thinking, “We’ve reached the bottom of the barrel.”

The Trump administration keeps making me think I’m wrong."
2020-09-14 17:22,"Mr Caputo is perfect for Trump. A crazy man surrounding himself with other crazy people. The man even said that he is failing mentally. But it is also very scary, the setup for a civil war between the left and the right. 
     If only we had more tin foil hats to pass out."
2020-09-14 17:23,"OK, we can no longer trust the CDC.   Is there any agency left immune to having it's leadership replaced by a lying Trump supporter?"
2020-09-14 17:25,I have to agree with this poor guy that his mental health has failed - it probably failed a long time ago. It is frightening to think that he is saying such things and there are some people who believe him. This sounds incredibly dangerous.
2020-09-14 17:27,Republicans can stop this any day they choose but they choose not to.
2020-09-14 17:24,Remember when you had to be somewhat in touch with reality in order to head a government agency?  Miss that
2020-09-14 17:26,"""Mr. Caputo, who has faced criticism for leading efforts to warp C.D.C. weekly bulletins to fit Mr. Trump’s pandemic narrative, suggested that he personally could be in danger.""

Caputo may have very well ""Streisand-ed"" himself."
2020-09-14 17:13,"He doesn’t sound mentally well. How could you make such explosive accusations without offering evidence if you were well? If he does speak truth, I want to know too. Anyone else remember when people in power inhabited reality?"
2020-09-14 17:16,"I don't think anybody is shocked that an official from the Trump administration would utter such provocative and dangerous propaganda.  What still remains shocking is that the entire Republican party remains silents and steadfast  to Trump.

The NYT's and other media outlets might as well report the headline as, ""The Republican Party Alleges Broad Conspiracies and Warns of Armed Revolt""

At this point they're all speaking with one voice and that is the voice of fascism."
2020-09-14 17:19,"This is insanity. Not even a top headline story, under the fold we have an Administration official in charge of communicating to the American people about the pandemic, instead, he is calling for armed insurrections?"
2020-09-14 17:22,"This man certainly needs to have his mental health evaluated. Hit squads!  Buy ammunition.  Where does trump find these people?
Another trump appointment sent to undermine the credibility of the department he works in.  And then destroy it. The CDC has been respected around the world for years and trump is destroying its credibility. Everything he touches dies or he attempts to kill it.
Sanity needs to be returned to the White House and to the government. Vote blue!  As if your life depends on it - and it does. Vote blue!"
2020-09-14 17:22,"Well, Caputo is right about one thing: his mental health has definitely failed.  Long shadows on the ceiling?  Really?  Mr. Caputo, you clearly need to seek psychiatric help.  If anyone out there knows Mr. Caputo, please prevail upon him to get help, as he is clearly having a mental health crisis."
2020-09-14 17:24,He’s right. His mental health has failed. Which means he should resign and get treatment. Unbelievable that a senior government official publicly states such nonsense and pours more oil into the fire that’s already dividing the country. What do these people want? Civil war? Unreflected devotion and obedience? That’s not America!
2020-09-14 17:25,"When someone tells you that his “mental health has definitely failed.”
and that “I don’t like being alone in Washington,” describing “shadows on the ceiling in my apartment, there alone, shadows are so long.”, he should be believed, and evaluated by independent medical experts.

That's just simple decency, not expected from the Trumpists because it's an inconvenient truth.

VOTE!"
2020-09-14 17:25,This is what you get when paranoia and ignorance are what passes for leadership... aided and abetted by the Republicans in the Senate who are willing to say nothing to keep their power as every vestige of democracy is undermined by Trump and his entire administration.
2020-09-14 17:25,"Everything- and I mean everything- this man says is pure projection.  He's applying the very likely reality of far right violence (they're the gun fetishists armed to the teeth) and Trump refusing to leave the White House should he lose the election, to incredibly unlikely behavior from Biden and Democrats/liberals.  At best, it's a head-spinning act of appalling revisionist reality. At worst it's very nearly criminal-level incitement to political violence."
2020-09-14 17:20,"I feel that this coverage of Mr Caputo is very overdone. HiS words are incendiary, and incorrect. Inciting people to buy gun and ammunition makes me nauseous."
2020-09-14 17:27,This has all of the earmarks of a mental breakdown. He should be removed from his duties immediately and provided help.
2020-09-14 17:22,"I would like to post a comment but I am, perhaps for the first time in my life, speechless.  Words simply fail me as I sat slack-jawed reading this report.  The fact that the administration can continue to find the single most inappropriate people for a whole host of positions, CDC, NOAA, HHS, NSA, Justice, EPA, and on and on, does show some modicum of talent.  As perverse as that is."
2020-09-14 17:22,"He has obviously lost touch with reality, and, given his position, he is dangerous. His urging Trump supporters to buy ammo may lead to deaths. Republicans and cabinet members must speak out or they may be complicit in violence."
2020-09-14 17:28,I’ll say Caputo’s “mental health has definitely failed”!
2020-09-14 17:28,could someone in the Trump administration please tell me where these forward military bases are located so I can join up---they seem to be a secret to everyone who isn't wearing a MAGA hat.
2020-09-14 17:30,"If these crazies continue to spread this nonsense--undermining the CDC, predicting it's the Left that won't honor election results (when we know it's the Right who will cheat to win and refuse to concede if they lose)--we are all doomed."
2020-09-14 17:30,Another candidate for FOX and Dancing with the Stars. Only the best.
2020-09-14 17:27,His mental health failed. What else does a public official need to say to be removed? Is there anyone sane enough in the administration to help Mr. Caputo out?
2020-09-14 17:27,Considering Caputo’s comments worse things could happen.
2020-09-14 17:28,He's right about one thing - his mental health definitely has failed.
2020-09-14 17:28,"Sad and shameful,  The US is going nowhere fast ... ""Oh Canada"" keeps running through my mind."
2020-09-14 17:29,"He “went down fighting,” Mr. Caputo said. “Why? Because he couldn’t say what he had inside him.”

Exactly, Mr. Caputo. You can't say what's inside you WITHOUT EVIDENCE!

You can't say what's inside you without appealing to the rationality of others! 

You can't say what's inside you without seek corroboration! That's how knowledge works. 

Everything - I mean, everything - about a sound education is lost on Mr. Caputo. But, first and foremost, how science works.

This guy should be no where near the reigns of power."

2020-09-14 17:28,"Unless the Republican-controlled Senate joins with Democrats to remove this unhinged Trump surrogate, the nation is in thrall to the GOP/Trump insane asylum. The GOP had the power to impeach the impeached wreckingball, but instead acquitted him so he could continue his unfettered ruination of the nation's health and economy."
2020-09-14 17:29,"This is terrifying. Caputo sounds like he's in the midst of a full blown mental health crisis. Watching the shadows on his ceiling, dreaming of outlandish conspiracy theories? That this man - with no background in healthcare and sounding like he's in the midst of a breakdown - to be in charge of messaging at HHS during Covid isn't just frightening - it's criminal."
2020-09-14 17:29,Is this for real?  An alternate reality world colliding with facts.  Or living in universe of alternate facts.
2020-09-14 17:30,The paranoia in the administration is getting out of hand.  Trump is under attack by an Antifa organisation that doesn't exist and he is being defended by a Qanon organisation that doesn't exist.  If antifa and qanon start shooting will the imaginary bullets cause collateral damage? People in the real world want to know.
2020-09-14 17:22,He admits himself that his mental health is failing. He is obviously going crazy and thinks the shadows in his apartment are out to get him. He needs to be removed immediately.
2020-09-14 17:27,The left wing insurrection has been in progress for 3.5 years.  Nothing burger as usual.
2020-09-14 17:28,"Just imagine if POTUS were astute enough to actually fire this guy and show the world he won't stand for crazy and anger...since he's all about law and order and full transparency?

It would be game over...4 more years.  

Thankfully, he can't see beyond immediate support."
2020-09-14 17:23,"If you can’t fix the problem, or are not interested in fixing the problem, manipulate the message, lie, mislead and dissemble, and blame the actual truth tellers for your failure. Trumpism: Wealth before health, personal profit above all."
2020-09-14 17:23,The shadows on the wall are coming for you Mr. Caputo.
2020-09-14 17:26,"These types of claims are devised from the Trump playbook:

1) Truth not required. In fact, it should be avoided.
2) Spin, lie, deny and repeat - about everything.

End of playbook."
2020-09-14 17:27,"This is the guy who did PR for the Russians via Gazprom, trying to burnish Putin's image in the USA.  He lived in Russia and Ukraine.  Now he has come unraveled in Washington.  He is clearly unfit for his job and just as clearly in need of help.  Trump will use him up and throw him away."
2020-09-14 17:30,"Each day, another frightening low.  Worst of all, we become numb.  That yesterday’s outrage has quietly become today’s policy is overlooked"
2020-09-14 17:27,"CDC, FDA, DoJ, State, IC/DNI, DHS...

All tainted, gutted, demoralized by Mr. Trump and his appointees.

The ""deconstruction of the administrative state"" continues apace, and the mainstreaming of conspiracy theories grows, one day at a time."
2020-09-14 17:27,Roger Stone and now Michael Caputo are priming the pump for Trump to declare the Sedition Act if he loses the election in November and/or to counter widespread protests and unrest if the popular vote is again overturned by the anti-democratic Electoral College.. It's their last ditch attempt to hold onto power and avoid the almost certain jail-time they all have in store once Biden/Harris win the election.
2020-09-14 17:28,"I guess if ""pro-truth"" and ""pro-science"" make you ""anti-Trump"", so be it.  But it sounds like this guy has lost it and needs to resign."
2020-09-14 17:24,"Trump wants to scapegoat Fauci for his own failure to protect and save the lives of tens of thousands of Americans. But who elected Fauci president? No one. Not even if the family, friends, and relatives of tens of thousands of Americans now wish they had."
2020-09-14 17:26,"Look the source. Mr. Caputo has sought to change, delay, suppress and retroactively edit scientific reports on COVID-19 by the CDC that were deemed unflattering to President Trump."
2020-09-14 17:28,"""Mr. Caputo has no background in health care""......another example of why this administration has to go. It feels like we are living in the Germany of the 1930's. Extremism, incompetent people in charge of things they should not be medaling in. This guy in in his own words, mentally not well. 

What's even more shocking than this man's interference with the scientists and epidemiological reports that our medical professionals rely on is that there are a lot of people in the United States who believe this junk and repeat it as factual. 

They love Trump. I don't understand them. 

So the rest of us have to stand up for the truth and VOTE. If you can, drive those who lack transportation to the polls....every vote counts. Make calls and help get balanced sane people into office."
2020-09-14 17:30,This is dangerous beyond measure. No elaboration is necessary.
2020-09-14 17:30,"Long shadows, indeed. 

Trump and his cabal are long on projection and short on insight, stability, empathy, and self-control. And here we are witnessing the crushing force of hypocrisy when faced with continuous and unaddressed death and suffering. 

Perhaps we should be grateful for this guy’s pea-sized, but never the less existing, moral center. It may be all we have against Trump’s rampaging solipsism, greed, and disordered personality borne of trauma."
2020-09-14 17:24,"The United States. government...It's becoming like the "" ""The Bizarro Jerry"" episode of Seinfeld."
2020-09-14 17:27,"Yes, “his mental health” has definitely suffered. The poor man is unstable and needs help. He also needs to be removed from his position ASAP. Where does the president find these people?"
2020-09-14 17:28,"It is sad indeed to see an intelligent, highly educated person lose his mind. I hope the subject of this article is seeking professional psychiatric help and is being well looked after by his family. I wish him a successful recovery."
2020-09-14 17:25,"I agree with some of the other commenters that he seems to be mentally unwell, perhaps on the verge of psychosis.  I don't say this as a criticism, but as a description.  He should be relieved of his duties and gotten help."
2020-09-14 17:27,"Why does he still hold this position and how do we survive the exodus of the hardworking career scientists at the CDC.? Redfield has always been a right wingnut and Alexander seems cut from the same cloth.  Add our new advisor Scott Atlas and we have the triumvirate of disinformation, obfuscation and outright Trump pandering.  I wish another country would take me in for a while."
2020-09-14 17:28,"Per usual, as the last 3-plus years have demonstrated, Trump and his surrogates accuse the opposition of that which is true about themselves.  It is and always has been pure projection. By this rhetoric, they are setting the scene for their own violence and creating a boogey-man justification for it.

Vote."
2020-09-14 17:28,"Sadly, he reflects an illness that is consuming a third of the nation fed by an insane leader. The parallels to events of 1932 in Germany must be spoken of by Americans.  Our saving grace is a democratic tradition that has lasted 245 years. But the right wing thought they could control this extremist back in 2016. Now, look where we are now four years later!"
2020-09-14 17:29,"Wow, so fear, incitement and lies really are the only way the GOP knows they can win in 2020. It is beyond frightening how many people working for Trump are not well. And sadly, people I’m related to are believers in these lies and conspiracy theories. I’ll risk my health and vote in person."
2020-09-14 17:29,"If Mr Caputo is being sincere, I frankly worry for his mental health; such paranoia could indicate a serious problem. If you have evidence of a left-wing cabal at the CDC or elsewhere in the government, please show your cards. Otherwise, you are engaging in partisan fear-mongering and trying to muzzle scientists who are working in good faith to fight a pandemic in the face of an antagonizing and mendacious White House.

Disagreements are not uncommon in science, but they are not evidence of sedition (!). Nor is it helpful to raise the specter of left-wing anarchists preparing for a coup if Trump is re-elected--again, with no evidence given."
2020-09-14 17:25,It's rather apparent at this time that ALL Trump officials are pointed toward prison time or a 72 hr evaluation hold.
2020-09-14 17:25,"Mr. Caputo has expressed that he is in crisis. He would benefit from a mental health assessment. He appears to be exhibiting paranoia at a level that may place him at risk of self harm. Certainly, he is placing others at risk with his dangerous opinions of impending violence."
2020-09-14 17:26,"Caputo said that ""my mental health has failed"".
Obviously an individual for firing or maybe a person for promotion to Secretary of Health and Human Services.
Under Trump, probably the latter."
2020-09-14 17:23,Finally a Trump associate who is reasonable and measured.
2020-09-14 17:24,"Indeed, it seems his mental health has suffered.  I hope he seeks the help he evidently needs.  In the mean time, this sort of ranting is not conducive to trust in the CDC's communications.  Perhaps he should consider, or be asked to, step aside while he gets himself together.   The CDC is a critical beacon in these times, and its integrity needs to be preserved."
2020-09-14 17:25,Shame on Mr. Caputo and the others in this administration who are fomenting unrest and engaging in partisan attacks. What happened to not wanting to incite panic?
2020-09-14 17:27,"The apple doesn't fall far from the Trump and most certainly for both “mental health has definitely failed.”
Just another reason to redouble our efforts to get out every vote, so this administration is resoundingly defeated...no questions or recounts needed."
2020-09-14 17:30,"So in other words, no facts are backing up Donald's continual lies, so therefore the problem must be with the facts.

Michael is trying to rise up as the best sycophant and is being thwarted by science, the facts and evidence.  

No wonder he has to lash out at those who speak the truth."
2020-09-14 17:22,"The same Michael Caputo who is said to have long been associated with Moscow?

Who's really into sedition and treason? Methinks this is more conservative projection. That's really all we get from Republicans. Accusations that turn out to apply to them and not Democrats or independents.

It's long past time to clean house from underneath the foundation to make sure no Trump appointee or hire is left for the next cycle in our politics."
2020-09-14 17:23,"Michael Caputo has alleged sedition which implies that he has evidence to back up his claims.  He needs to present himself and his evidence immediately to the relevant authorities (the FBI).  I just hope that he isn’t confusing “sedition” with “presenting the facts rather than the alternative facts required to support Trump’s false narrative”.  

As to his self-confessed failing mental health, if, as seems likely, his colourful allegations prove to have no foundation whatsoever then I respectfully suggest that he is removed from office forthwith.  This will benefit him and his wellbeing whilst also allowing his post to be filled by a competent person."
2020-09-14 17:25,"Evidence of criminality revealed; claim being a victim and blame the other side with manufactured lies—NOT a claim “without evidence.” Trumpism in a nutshell. This is so dangerous: it’s hard to fathom a peaceful transition of power should Trump lose (and, tellingly, that’s assuming all the votes will be counted) and hard to fathom a representative government if he wins."
2020-09-14 17:28,"As a practicing research scientist, I can no longer trust anything coming out of the CDC.  This is embarrassing at best and criminal at the worse."
2020-09-14 17:30,"I have been quite anxious the last week. Not only for the safety of my family and friends, but for the rest of the country. We have people running this country who are opportunists and mentally unstable. They are fomenting insurrection against our country and its institutions. This is the scariest time in my 61 years on this planet. I fear my son, his friends, and their generation. What have we done?"
2020-09-14 17:27,"After Mr. Caputo is removed from his appointed, no-experience-in-healthcare position, it sounds like the poor man needs an intervention to address his delusions and paranoia."
2020-09-14 17:29,"I thought Trump was all about not ""panicking"" people.

That's all he does and all he's ever wanted to do."
2020-09-14 17:29,"“trump” keeps putting all the pieces together, planting false narratives, creating disinformation, and predictably always turning everything on its head. If he’s caught with his hand in the cookie jar he simply screams louder that you’ve got your hand in the cookie jar, instead. And his army of loyalists understand these strategies all too well. They anticipate where events are headed and immediately put in place a counter-narrative blaming the left for things they are doing. “trump” is in the process of creating the narrative for martial law.

The dilemma of Democrats is to claim the ground of civility while being continually poked. Very dangerous times."
2020-09-14 17:23,"If - by his own admission - his mental health has failed, he should resign his position, effective immediately. Or he should be put on administrative leave.

Either way, someone who hallucinates imaginary armed insurrections is not fit to be in a position of power."
2020-09-14 17:24,"My jaw dropped reading this and by the end I actually felt kind of sorry for Mr. Caputo - he is clearly distressed and suffering at the hands of the irresponsible and delusional administration he is part of. This administration feeds on the fear of the public and while the division and conspiracy theories are clearly tearing apart communities across the US in various levels of crisis (racial tension and strife, wildfires, and rolling outbreaks of coronavirus), it appears that even people who are instruments of this chaos are subject to its traumatizing effects."
2020-09-14 17:24,"In a functioning society, this person would be given a leave of absence and medical care to help him through this difficult personal time. In this administration, he will undoubtedly be promoted and given more of a platform to spread his theories."
2020-09-14 17:26,Some days I feel like I’m living in the beginning of a dystopian society.
2020-09-14 17:27,"Every time I read about the disruptive use of social media I want to pull my hair out.  Why? Why for the love of god does anyone with a rational mind turn to social media for anything?Government officials should be prohibited from using social media in connection with their jobs.  Grievances turn into facts and look where we are with this pandemic, we’re moving toward a disruptive and divisive election and an even worse winter. I want to go to sleep and wake up when it’s over."
2020-09-14 17:22,"This is terrifying. I fear that only rational Republican voices can cut through the haze of misinformation at this point, and unfortunately, those are few and far between."
2020-09-14 17:29,Oops. The department has a problem. An employee needs assistance.
2020-09-14 17:26,"Until Republican senators speak up in chorus, Trump's base will believe anything and everything, pushing this country closer and closer to the end of Democracy."
2020-09-14 17:32,"“You understand that they’re going to have to kill me, and unfortunately, I think that’s where this is going,” 

If that doesn't sound like something right out of the TDH (""Trump Desperation Handbook"") I don't know what does.

The sheer fact that Caputo has publicly stated his “mental health has definitely failed"" then this administration must immediately issue him a leave of absence and remove him from his post.  Anything less would be negligent and irresponsible of our federal government.

I had no idea that Caputo was a visionary, for he must be if he claimed that “all these people are all going to hell.”

If ANYONE I knew spoke like that, especially publicly, he or she would be removed from service and placed on immediate medical leave - not only for the employee's benefit but for the company's sake as well."
2020-09-14 17:34,"Not to be picky, Mr. Caputo, but you accuse all of your critics of committing thereby “venial sin” which will result in their quick dispatch straight “to hell.”

Actually, you have it backwards.  Venial sins are relatively minor sins, not resulting in eternal damnation.  Only a “mortal” sin is damnable.

So, you apparently really want to state that scientific critique is a “mortal sin”.  Yes?

Galileo would of course not be amused."
2020-09-14 17:27,What's left to say.  We're in Weimar Germany.  I hope the electorate saves us on November 3.

There is no bottom to the depths this administration will go to degrade and disgrace this nation. My third guess was The fake new infectious disease Herd Immunity proponent, Scott W. Atlas. He was probably tied up with his stock broker..."

2020-09-14 17:34,"Another Trump gangster. Worthy of Goebbels. ""Sedition,"" indeed. Caputo is a hack and utterly unqualified on health matters. He is a hit man for Trump who was sent to be the weak and wimpy Azar's ""minder."" Caputo is INCITING physical force in these pro violence suggestions. Truly disgraceful. I have confidence our security forces will enforce Trump's ouster from the White House after he has lost the election. This kind of talk is redolent  of neofascism. Caputo, Stephen Miller, Meadows, et al need to join Trump in the dustbin of history ASAP."

2020-09-14 17:27,Get a straightjacket for this guy - he's clearly a danger to himself and especially others with talk of armed insurrection. Folks who babbled on like this - conspiracies etc. - used to be shipped to the funny farm - now they're in the Trump government.
2020-09-14 17:32,This is the future that the republicans are offering you.  So what are you going to do about it.  These guys continue to be in our government because of money and lots of it keep them there.  They are useful idiots that serve the purpose at the time.

2020-09-14 17:25,I've said it before and I'm sure I'll say it again: Donald Trump has truly exposed the level of mental illness rampant in the US.
2020-09-14 17:26,"Wow....they sure do ""Crazy"" in the Trump administration. Trump's ""projection"" affliction must be contagious. If anyone is planning an insurrection after Nov 3rd, it's Trump's Charlottesville thugs."

They did not have the information or as much science than to understand all of what was occurring. Allowing political hacks like Michael Caputo to push there agenda on CDC has a chilling effect.

You obviously have a deranged underling manifesting paranoia and related delusional thinking.  As his superior in the chain of command, please place him on sick leave and have him transported under guard to the nearest psychiatric hospital for a thorough evaluation.  He is exhibiting signs that he could potentially be dangerous to those around him and possibly to himself.  This must happen before he begins to manifest these same tendencies in his behavior.

2020-09-14 17:30,"Wait a minute - this is the time Michael Caputo who was a CNN pundit who said his family was being threatened a few years ago.  Now he says he is going to be killed.

How do you spell the far right?  P-A-R-A-N-O-I-A."
2020-09-14 17:31,You can't make this stuff up
2020-09-14 17:36,Isn't Caputo in bed with the russians?I believe I was reading about that.No wonder hes so against the USA
2020-09-14 17:20,"Good grief, get this man some help."
2020-09-14 17:15,Preparing for delegitimizing election when Trump losses
2020-09-14 17:23,"This man sounds like an unhinged lunatic, I guess that's the qualification you need for Trump to put you in a position of power. four more years of Trump in the White House is literally unthinkable."
2020-09-14 17:23,This is all so jarring. Can sane minds please VOTE?
2020-09-14 17:23,"delusional and border on insanity.

 these  kind of people should belong to right-wing group in the internet. 

they should never have a chance at the government."
2020-09-14 17:37,This guy lived in Moscow and worked for Putin. How does he possibly have a high level job in the us government? Google him.
2020-09-14 17:37,Dear God. This man is ill and is crying out for help.  I hope someone in his circle cares enough about Capital or the country to state the obvious and step up.
2020-09-14 17:20,Irony is dead. Of course a Trump-appointed assistant secretary at HHS desperately needs to seek help for his own mental health issues.
2020-09-14 17:35,Will this unhinged rant convince Trump that there is such a thing as too much loyalty?
2020-09-14 17:36,"This man would be in jail in a sane world.  He is instigating civil war.  Where is Mr. Caputo from?  What kind of background produces such a coward?  He is an enemy of the USA. I do hope the Chiefs of Staff are paying very strict attention.  Actually, I trust that they are."
2020-09-14 17:23,desperate moves by desperate people
2020-09-14 17:27,"This is the fascist's playbook -- intimidate, bully, provoke, and belittle the less powerful -- and then cry that you are the one who is the victim. Caputo has a long sordid history of propping up fascists and neo-fascists, staring with his work for Oliver North in the Reagan administration and later handling PR for Putin, when he lived in Russia working for a subsidiary of Gazprom. Like all Trump retrogrades, he is intimately connected with Putin and Russian oligarchs and mobsters. The fact that he is anywhere near the public health function of our government is as big a scandal as any in this nightmare of an administration -- and there have been many. As for his claim of sleepless nights, we can only hope that is true -- he has lied, betrayed and bullied so many, that seems the least of what he is due."
2020-09-14 17:37,Sounds like he is on a bad acid trip. Shadows on the ceiling? Really?
2020-09-14 17:35,"He's deranged! He in essence says so himself - that his “mental health has definitely failed,” and even says “If you carry guns, buy ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it’s going to be hard to get.” Forget vaccines and masks - get a gun and bullets to protect your health America - says the guy who is in charge of American's health.

Shouldn't Caputo be subject to Red Flag Gun Laws, removed from office and his guns confiscated? He is obviously a danger to everyone around him.

I think he is merely telegraphing what the 'Profas' (pro-facists) are planning with their 8 trillion bullets, as Steve King claimed, they are hoarding. Sedition? Caputo seems to be inciting gun violence against everyone not in the trump cult, just as the cult leader is doing.

Zuckerberg profiting yet again from vile inciteful hate and misinformation."
2020-09-14 17:35,he is setting up his claim for mental incompetence when he is charged with crimes .
2020-09-14 17:27,"THIS is what four more years of trump will give us.  Conspiracy theories of the worst kind from the worst people in America.  They will rile up the ""base"" and we'll have armed militias on every street corner trying to beat back ""leftists.""  OMG have we not had enough of this idiocy?  Caputo needs to be removed from office along with all the others who are fomenting this violence."
2020-09-14 17:31,Get this lunatic out of government now.  I am sure he has a top position waiting for him at Fox News.
2020-09-14 17:35,"I've always tried to give Trump a benefit of the doubt, but I can't any longer. I am afraid my country is falling into the deep dark well of fascism..."
2020-09-14 17:39,So they intend to use the insanity defense? That comes close!
2020-09-14 17:33,"If I wasn't reading this in the NYT, I'd think this was some kind of bad joke.  If anyone should be accused of 'sedition', it should be Mr. Caputo and others like him, using public positions to engage in speech and accusations that can only be meant as incitement, a legal definition I hope lawyers out there are taking names and gathering evidence for future prosecutions of this egregious betrayal of the public trust!  This is all simply beyond the pale.  Their salaries should be returned to the taxpayer and their pensions nullified for the period served."
2020-09-14 17:30,"Sigh...

I’ve run out of comments for the ceaseless onslaught of stories like this that emerge out of the U.S. daily.

America needs to get its ducks in order, and soon.  The cracks in the foundations of your storied institutions are starting to materialize much more quickly than anyone could’ve anticipated.

And this is what your foreign adversaries, who continue to meddle in your elections, hope to accomplish.  To demonstrate that democracy has huge faults in it.  To affirm that authoritarian order is a better path.  That the worlds greatest democracy can be unraveled by four years of utterly gross incompetence.  And that, maybe America isn’t so great after all.

Please don’t let them win."
2020-09-14 17:39,How can any decent Republican ignore what is going on? This is a terrifying piece on a man that has no healthcare experience and appears to be delusional. Americans are dying across this country with no end in sight. If the President wants the American people to not panic he will remove this man immediately and leave the CDC alone to do what they do best.
2020-09-14 17:32,"Just when I think this administration can’t reach a new level of irresponsible and dangerous, here we are. This is a mentally unfit man among mentally unfit men who are working for a mentally unfit man. 

No one on the left is planning “armed insurrections”—there are literally already federal marshals, armed, insurrecting on behalf of trump, in our cities, right this moment. The right are already performing a coup to the best of their ability."
2020-09-14 17:40,I predict Mr. Caputo will have a show on Fox sooner than later.
2020-09-14 17:30,"Caputo has to go! He has gone off the rails and is completely insane.  Sadly, he is no different than so many of the political appointees Trump and his team of vipers have installed in positions that directly impact our lives. Many are perfect examples of the ""Peter Principal"" in action."
2020-09-14 17:31,"If someone had told me a few years ago that what we’ve been seeing during the Trump regime would ever be possible in the US, I’d laugh at them and ignore them. These stories rival and often beat the most ridiculous stories I have seen from the Balkans politicians I grew up watching. It is a lesson, for me at least, that the American, or any other western society, hasn’t really passed the point in its development where you can exclude the possibility of a complete societal breakdown that can lead to the worst in us. That such a fool can do this to a society, any society, it is at first funny but then very depressing."
2020-09-14 17:33,"OMG.  Usually there is that one sentence in an article that I seize on, but this is so full of outrageous, irrational and irresponsible statement by Caputo that I have to seize on this one where he says that his “mental health has definitely failed.”  

How is this guy still on the job?  Simply because he is no less detached from reality than the rest of Trump's appointees is not an answer."
2020-09-14 17:37,"“And when Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin,” he said. “The drills that you’ve seen are nothing.”

There you have it, folks.   The Trump Administration plan.  Saying the quiet part out loud."
2020-09-14 17:38,This guy is completely out of his depth in this position.  He needs to resign immediately and access mental health services.
2020-09-14 17:40,Every word out of this man's mouth confirms his statement that his mental health has been affected.
2020-09-14 17:33,"I think it's fair to ask how many people Mr. Caputo has killed with his pandemic denial.  Of course he's receiving threats--families get angry when loved ones are killed.  That's not evidence of any left-wing plot; it's just human nature.

Paranoia is what happens when you put mentally unstable people into stressful positions."
2020-09-14 17:36,This is truly alarming—especially coming from a government spokesperson and representative. Are there no lines that cannot be crossed in this administration?
2020-09-14 17:33,"This is how autocracies with greater aspirations role. Fueling the insecurities and anger of segments of the population vulnerable to propoganda with baseless conspiratorial claims. Create skepticism about institutions. Stomp all over cultural and social norms till the whole population is numb. And now we have this lackey beating the drum. 

The CDC and FDA can no longer be trusted as these venerable institutions once could. Not because of some deep state hogwash but because of the evident infiltration of politics and how their leadership either replaced with sycophants or cowed by this despicable administration. If there are ""deep state"" actors, they are trying to hold on to the reins of science and conscience hoping this storm will pass. 

If someone is threatening Mr. Caputo, that's terrible, wrong, illegal and should be dealt with. It's also sadly too easy to doubt that this true or that it is at least conveniently exaggerated. The autocrat playbook calls for this too."
2020-09-14 17:41,Caputo should be removed immediately. Hopefully that is something that both parties can agree upon.
2020-09-14 17:31,"All these folks who don't understand the difference between a democracy and authoritarianism need to spend time in China, North Korea, or the FSU."
2020-09-14 17:33,"It's clear that Mr. Caputo has mental problems, as he himself admits that his ""mental health has definitely failed."" He sees America's best scientists as traitors, fears ""shadows"" on his ceiling and talks of armed groups planning to overthrow the government on Inauguration Day. Worse, he encourages possible violence by urging Americans to buy up  ammunition for what he sees as a civil war after the election. This man's salary is paid by the American taxpayers. At the very least, he should be placed on leave until he seeks mental health help."
2020-09-14 17:38,so when are we voters going to demand Congress limit political appointments to qualified experts in the particular area like HHS DHS Treasury etc?
2020-09-14 17:40,The man needs help as much as he needs to be protected from doing more harm to pandemic discourse through delusional statements made possible by the position he holds.
2020-09-14 17:31,"That’s it. I just felt Eisenhower turn over in his grave, after all he fought for is being destroyed."
2020-09-14 17:40,This will not end with a Biden victory in November. We are all on a long dark night's journey into madness.
2020-09-14 17:31,"His words and actions have exacerbated the coronavirus, likely directly causing thousands of deaths, and he can't understand why he's being threatened? (assuming that's true, a big assumption given all the untruths from his mouth)"
2020-09-14 17:34,He should be asked first to resign and if he fails to do so be removed from office.  This is disgraceful.
2020-09-14 17:34,Amusing that Caputo  thinks he’s important enough to be targeted for execution. Takes “delusions of grandeur” to a new level.
2020-09-14 17:38,"It cannot be overstated how dangerous it is to have someone with this level of  psychiatric instability in a position to shape  the nation's morbidity and mortality  messaging on Covid-19. 
Does this administration have their own ""people"" shadowing it's major health officials in order to try to control their public communication about Covid-19?
The president has been lying about the severity of Covid-19 while his handlers of the nation's health experts are trying to shape their public messaging to conform to his misinformation. We know Trump lies about the novel coronavirus but we are only now getting the news of how desperately they are trying to make sure his lies are validated. They are responsible for the sickness, deaths and suffering of at least hundreds of thousands of Americans."
2020-09-14 17:40,"WHAT.

This man needs help. 

Sadly, that’s in short supply these days."
2020-09-14 17:40,"Verses of the Bob Woodward Trump interview are probably written on the walls of the Caputo home . Reaching such a level of denial has  obviously driven him mad  . "" All work and no play makes Michael go crazy """
2020-09-14 17:32,"Let's show a little empathy for poor, beleaguered Mr. Caputo.

I can only hope he gets the help he needs."
2020-09-14 17:31,"Never apologize, always up the ante. A cult of true authoritarianism. And Trump would be more than happy to collapse the entire system just to buy it back at a ruinous price. What does that say about us, if someone as shallow and cruel as Trump took a look at our nation and saw it as ripe for the taking?"
2020-09-14 17:32,"It's much more likely that the heavily armed militant Trump supporters would cause havoc if their man loses.  
Trump and his minions always accuse the other side of what they're being criticized for."
2020-09-14 17:36,"Doesn't this constitute a ""danger to himself or others""? 
People: WE are the 'others'! This man doesn't need media attention; he needs assessment. (REAL assessment, not man woman camera person tv.)"
2020-09-14 17:36,"A ""resistance unit""? Is that what Republicans are calling Democrats now? Fine. Then yes, we are planning an insurrection. It's called a democratic election. Because while leadership has failed, democracy has held. And the only thing that democrats will be burning after election day is sage, not torches."
2020-09-14 17:39,"If Mr. Caputo has received threats that is wrong and should stop.  Having said that, my expectation is that any ""armed insurrection"" after the election will be provided by the Right, not the Left.

As to his deteriorated mental state...the whole article shows how true that is.  Paranoid delusions seem to be a job requirement in the current administration.

Finally, the only loyalty that any, and all, government workers should have is to the truth.   Only dictators and kings demand loyalty to themselves personally."
2020-09-14 17:39,"trump officially has reached a god-like status when a follower tells the fold that the other side in the election are not only capable of but likely to commit violence if trump wins the election.
And he doubles down by advising trump supporters to get extra-armed while they wait for “Leftist trained hit squads.”
I have never seen such blatant eagerness for violence and general mayhem. 
This president loves chaos. He’s a fan of fighting. He must be stopped."
2020-09-14 17:30,It grates my nerves that my taxes pay this person's salary.
2020-09-14 17:37,"You don't have to be an Einstein, but reading him is smart.
""The world is not dangerous because of those who do harm but because of those who look at it without doing anything."""
2020-09-14 17:37,It's regrettable that Mr. Caputo wasn't able to take a cue from our Great Leader's handbook and  keep his thoughts to himself to avoid a panic.
2020-09-14 17:30,"These remarks create an atmosphere of chaos.  Just last week, Oregon authorities had to try to tamp-down false rumors that Oregon wildfires were set by Antifa, as a response private citizens were setting up armed checkpoints outside their communities.  This was a potentially very dangerous situation.  Seriously, is this what we've come to?  Officials who spread these lies are the most destabilizing force in our democracy, we need this kind of commentary from those who hold appointed office to stop."
2020-09-14 17:39,"This is a coordinated effort between Caputo and his boss to encourage the whacked out right wing extremists to feel the need to defend themselves with as much weaponry as they can accumulate. When Trump loses in November he will directly command them to take to the streets, and then declare martial law when they do, all the while calling on the military to stage and actual coup  to overthrow the incoming administration."
2020-09-14 17:39,"""left-wing hit squads were preparing for armed insurrection after the election""

That sounds more like something Trump and his DOJ pals would be more likely to do or say.  Besides, they have the NRA on their side while most members of the Left defy and detest the mere mention of firearms, not to mention ""hit squads"".

This kind of talk is exactly where conspiracy theories take root and suddenly, it becomes a fact.

This guy and the entire Republican Party are fast becoming a huge danger to ALL Americans."
2020-09-14 17:40,"Republican delusions and psyches are cracking under the weight of reality. Their fundamental identities are so tied to these delusions that they will never be able to admit they were wrong. 

Like anyone else in the throes of mental breakdown, they will hallucinate countless alternative explanations, including Mr. Caputo's belief that professional career scientists working at the heights of government are suddenly forming militias to overthrow the president. 

These hallucinations will escalate, and will compel the believers to ever more extreme behavior. They will not be able to see any alternatives. Self destruction—the destruction of the nation—will seem preferable to ""losing"". It is exactly like a suicidal person, except these folks have massive powers to insulate themselves and affect millions of people. 

This picture is no longer about logic, or argument, or politics, or right and wrong. Our nation is headed for all out conflict between beleaguered sanity and rabid psychosis."
2020-09-14 17:30,"This is absolutely mind boggling that a public official would make such reckless claims to the American people.  Oh wait, I forgot the highest public official omits the real truth about the coming pandemic.  We have plenty of evidence there."
2020-09-14 17:35,"Even amid all the bad news, this is sad to read. Person appears to be mentally ill, needs to be relieved of his duties, and given care."
2020-09-14 17:40,"Like 'Network,' but not in a good way. I can just hear Trump: 'Well, he likes me, so that's a good thing. He can stay as long as he likes.'"
2020-09-14 17:30,I would say that his mental health has definitely been compromised. It's good he noticed. Will he be taking compassionate leave soon? Please...
2020-09-14 17:35,"This is a bad framing to this story because, by publishing Caputo's comments wholesale, you have essentially provided a megaphone for him. Reporters need to rethink their approach to these topics; DJT and his minions do not care whether the message is received as true or not, let alone what people who comment in response to these reports say. All they care about is the fact that media provide them with a broadcasting mechanism because it helps to keep the social pot boiling (among other things). You could have led with this as a defensive response to the weekend report and not quoted him extensively; the story would be the same, but the broadcasting platform would not have been reported. Too often the media are being used; it's time to develop a more sophisticated strategy to reporting on this administration."
2020-09-14 17:39,"Why is Facebook leaving this post up? It is inflammatory hate speech, not based on facts, it calls for violence, it puts scientists at risk. This is the kind of talk that usually comes from an Authoritarian regime intent on misleading and lying to their citizens to keep power. Folks, I don't know about you, but I am beginning to be scared for my children."

2020-09-14 17:37,"Donald Trump destroys another United States institution, this time the Department of Health and Human Services with political appointee Michael Caputo.

During the Reagan Administration, Caputo worked with Oliver North to foment propaganda as part of Reagan's public relations efforts in South America and in Central America

Michael Caputo moved to Russia in 1994, after the fall of the Soviet Union, and was an adviser to Boris Yeltsin. 

He worked for Gazprom Media in 2000 where he worked on improving the image of Vladimir Putin in the U.S. 

Caputo was mentored by Roger Stone and became his personal driver.

Caputo learned from Stone that political campaigns could be turned into wins for candidates if the public found them entertaining.

2020-09-14 17:30,The Doctors plot will be next.  Or has that one already been taken?
2020-09-14 17:31,"As a human being, I hope Mr. Caputo gets serious mental health support immediately; his description of the ominous shadows in his apartment is not something to laugh at. As a citizen, I'm appalled that someone in this precarious state is even partway responsible for our Pandemic response. Kafkaesque doesn't begin to describe this madness."
2020-09-14 17:38,"Maybe if he wasn't evil, people wouldn't treat him as such. Bad conduct that harms people and undermines democracy and formerly trusted government agencies charged with protecting our country will be condemned. So while I do not condone threats to his physical safety and that of his family, I am not sorry he is being vilified and condemned for his conduct."
2020-09-14 17:38,"This has absolutely got to stop right now. When public “servants” are undermining the nation’s health, safety and public welfare, they must be held accountable, and fired. 

The Republican Party and national media must do this now, loudly and clearly. Or there will be no country left to return to after Election Day.

It is beyond outrageous both that this is happening, and that it is allowed to happen."
2020-09-14 17:30,"When telling the truth is considered sedition, we are in the realm of authoritarian regimes such as China and all the others we used to think were less democratic.  With each passing day, the coming election becomes more critical.  Every effort must be taken to defend its integrity."
2020-09-14 17:32,"Can we all take a moment to reflect on the fact that this country really needs to invest in mental health services and support? 

Furthermore, I wonder what it would take to guide this person to understand that when he says his mental health has left him, it might mean that it’s time to resign to focus on himself. 

I am concerned about the level of polarization, mistrust, and conspiracy theory rhetoric. We are in an era where opinions are confused as facts. And, it seems, where conspiracy theories are no longer called out as delusions or the machinations of mental illness. 

I still have hope that we can all move together toward a better future. And, I hope that happens soon. This election can’t come soon enough. And, not all of our problems will be solved this way."
2020-09-14 17:33,"Words cannot describe how terrifying this is. If Caputo’s accusations are meant to instill fear and panic, that would be truly reprehensible. It seems like a projection of this administration’s shortcomings."
2020-09-14 17:31,"Mr. Caputo on Sunday complained on Facebook that he was under siege by the media and said that his physical health was in question by the media and ""his mental health has definitely failed"". I would say his MENTAL HEALTH is in question and DEFINITELY failed a long time ago."
2020-09-14 17:36,"Caputo's projecting. When Trump's boog bois gun down innocent civilians at peaceful protests--or those protesting Trump's failure to leave office should he lose--then the phrase ""left-wing hit squads"" are how pro-Trump news outlets will label the victims. The viewers of those outlets will be all fired up and ready for even more action."
2020-09-14 17:38,"He most likely will not be removed by Trump's administration but can he be called in by the house to question his assertions and make it completely clear that this person should not be in the position he is?  If Trump's administration does not fire or remove this person and basically say that it does not share his views, are they not saying then that they do share his views?"
2020-09-14 17:35,"Caputo has a long history of being an agent provocateur for Trump.  

Trump worse than a total failure re pandemic; washed his hands of it months ago, now trying to delegitimize CDC.

we're in for a bumpy ride!"
2020-09-14 17:39,"OK, GOP: This is your moment. You must be part of the effort to save the Republic. 

I may not share your rage and resentment, but I DO get it. I understand fear and I understand feeling like your world is disappearing.

But NOW is the time for us to set all that aside if we still want a country where you and I can still have the luxury of disagreeing and disliking each other. I'll even work hard on the ""disliking"" part.

This kind of voice -- this Caputo -- can, if you allow it to spread, bring the whole wonderful, messy, contentious experiment in democracy down on our heads.

Look, I know that you're mad and I'm mad. But we don't want to lose it all, do we? I don't want your kids hurt and you don't want mine hurt.

Please repudiate this dangerous nonsense from Caputo about insurrection. I've spent my life studying crime and genocide and this is how real catastrophe begins. I mean the ugly, death and dying kind of catastrophe.

Let's not let that happen."
2020-09-14 17:53,I am fully convinced that Trump's end-game (in accordance with Putin's wishes) in an election loss is to launch an armed insurrection. The outcome will ultimately be decided by the US military. The big question mark is what National Guard units will do in different states.
2020-09-14 17:40,"No one seems to have commented that Mr. Caputo confuses ""venial"" sin (like a Catholic misdemeanor) with ""mortal"" sin (the felony). I may be a lapsed Catholic, but that's pretty basic. ""Grievous venial sin"" is an oxymoron. I know, I know, this nonsense is pretty far down on the list of Mr. Caputo's transgressions, but it says something about his intelligence level."
2020-09-14 17:29,"I never, even in my lifetime thought I'd hear this kind of claptrap coming out the mouth of Washington bureaucrat.

Put aside the treasonous, conspiracy-ridden, illegal things he is doing, but the man is obviously disintegrating before our eyes.

He was a wreck during MSNBC interviews with Aril Melber.

Caputo obviously needs help before he hurts himself, his family, and the country.

We know Trump and The Enablers won't step in...but is there anyone reading what we're reading?

I wouldn't be surprised that there aren't people running to his office now to escort him out of his office and to a hospital.

2020-09-14 17:38,"Mr. Caputo is sending an SOS...he says he sees ""shadows on the wall"",  and his ""mental health is definitely suffering."" The White House needs to intervene here.  The guy is obviously under a lot of stress and needs to be removed."
2020-09-14 17:45,"If it weren’t so worrying, this could be described as satiric reality. This is a completely insane death cult lashing out at anyone who is sane and humane."
2020-09-14 17:28,"On top of fabricating conspiracies, he should learn the difference between a mortal and a venial sin."
2020-09-14 17:30,Sounds like Mr. Caputo has some skeletons that will soon come tumbling out of the closet. Not surprising he is so mentally fragile.
2020-09-14 17:38,"Only the best people, right?"
2020-09-14 17:31,"Caputo has always been unstable, but this is completely nuts."
2020-09-14 17:32,"Where’s Seema Verma today? How can she not have quit already or been fired? How much has she spent to date in Medicare-Medicaid funds on CHARM SCHOOL? Poor Seema. She is suffering from that fatal disease, DELUSIONS of IVANKA! Will someone please tell her to turn in HRC badge and keys, clean out her desk and leave CMS premises by close of business today?"
2020-09-14 17:45,"This entire article in two sentences.
The headline.
""Mr. Caputo on Sunday complained on Facebook that he was under siege by the media and said that his physical health was in question and his “mental health has definitely failed.”"
2020-09-14 17:29,Mentally ill people in high U.S. government positions is dangerous for the United States. He needs help.
2020-09-14 17:39,"Recognizing that you have a ""mental health problem"" is the first step towards getting cured.  Please contact his wife and the children to calmly suggest that he resign.  That will be hard as I am sure there is a ""Women for Trump"" banner flying from the front porch."
2020-09-14 17:40,"It is time for the House to subpoena all of Caputo's records and documentation of such sedition and to subpoena him to testify to testify to exactly who these treasonous scientist are within the government. I am sick and tired of this constant barrage of conspiracy theories and lies. It is time to put these folks under oath before congress.

Oh, and just an aside. If there was anything at all to this; William Barr would have assigned a special prosecutor to investigate such dastardly deeds by these scientists. 

Enough is enough is enough."
2020-09-14 17:34,"Mr. Caputo is admitting his mental health is in decline - he needs to be removed from his position immediately.  By the way, he’s most likely a Russian asset also, so there’s that."
2020-09-14 17:35,"This person, trying to lead our health services, Michael Caputo,  lived in Russia and served Boris Yeltsin for years.

Wake up, people."
2020-09-14 17:36,"Every day the insanity in this administration picks up speed.  By tomorrow, something equally bad will come across the wires and we won’t even have time to say “but, but, what about that crazy Caputo story?” We will have moved on. I’m still talking about the suckers and losers but look at what has transpired between that story and this? We are all falling down the rabbit hole."
2020-09-14 17:42,Just more fear mongering from the trump administration.
2020-09-14 17:33,Caputi is a long-time Roger Stone associate and wannabe and traffics in the same paranoid-style crowd pleasers. The nation’s loss has been Western NY’s gain.
2020-09-14 17:36,Dangerous days for scientist or anyone else trying to find the truth.
2020-09-14 17:36,Can't believe I'm reading this.  This is a real person in a real job in a real administration?   Mind boggling.
2020-09-14 17:38,"Well, a non-scientific response (want to be fair, since he seems to be petrified by scientists) is he's completely nuts."
2020-09-14 17:38,Fear mongering and War mongering to foment civil unrest are right of of the Trumpian dictator handbook. Putin is very proud of Donald J Trump.
2020-09-14 17:46,"“If you carry guns, buy ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it’s going to be hard to get.”

Perhaps a wee acknowledgment of how insanely inflammatory this is?  Along with regular old insane?  ""Trump Health Services Appointee Urges Trump Supporters to Buy Ammo for Post-Election Violence?""  I understand that the media ought to be neutral and objective, but this is objectively off-the-charts nuts."
2020-09-14 17:45,"We liberals are such an enterprising bunch! First we plot the murder of 200,000 Americans )because that's what liberals always do!) and invent a ""pandemic"" to blame it on, recruiting scientists and medical professionals from around the world to join our cause in the cover-up. Next we pin the blame on Trump for bungling the response to the non-existent pandemic and we get Bob Woodward to hypnotize him into saying ""I played it down."" Then we all ""buy guns"" (because that's what liberals always do!) in order to sow fear and panic for the purpose of an armed takeover of the government (because that's what liberals always do!) We rock! (Caputo: for the love of god, get some help.)"
2020-09-14 17:33,"This dude is having a mental breakdown, expressing clear delusions and paranoia, and needs to be removed from his position immediately. To be honest he never should have been in this position, but that's par for the course under this sham of an administration. All of these people serve at our pleasure so I'm glad he's feeling the heat. Let's remind them all on November 3rd just how done we are with them."
2020-09-14 17:34,"Mr Caputo is very confused. it is not the left wing that is/will be preparing for armed insurrection. it is the White Nationalists militia men/women who have been called to action by our ""seditious"" president, Donald J Trump. It is Donald J Trump who has perpetrated the biggest ""hoax"" on the white male minority  that he was a successful businessman who could single-handedly run our democracy successfully. Fool us once 2016; fool us twice 2020--shame on us."
2020-09-14 17:38,"Guilty!

There is a 'resistance unit' inside the CDC.  

There's also one inside NASA, the Pentagon, the Bureau of Weights and Measures, and the White House itself which has probably got a few.  

Basically anyplace Americans honor science, credibility, and their place in an advanced society. I'm glad they are 'resisting' the torrent of paranoia, hype and lies that spew from Mr. Caputo and his like.

He's also right about the 'armed insurrection.' That's what they will call it when the Constitutional authorities of the US reassert control over our country. 

That phase will last maybe a few minutes, because these guys are cowards as well as fools."
2020-09-14 17:38,"And we hear another screed against ""the deep state,"" when it's clear that ""the deep state"" refers to any sane person left in government who can actually perform their job."
2020-09-14 17:46,"Caputo lies for a living and now does so for Trump. Very dangerous person similar to Barr, but less power. This is another person who like his boss is stirring up violence."
2020-09-14 17:42,"Other conspiracy theories would not get a platform on NYT, but this person does, in virtue of his government position. This practice gives politicians or those in power undue control over the media narrative. Why risk converting some people into believing these baseless views? What benefits does reporting this bring? Unbiased reporting of whatever the officials say results in an extremely biased output that the readers will see. But isn't it the latter that really makes a difference?"
2020-09-14 17:42,"If anything epitomizes the Trump fiasco, it's the sycophants and grifters that inhabit his administration. Michael Caputo should either be in prison or a mental institution and has zero business serving in a role that informs the public about a deadly pandemic. We really have gone down a dangerous rabbit hole..."
2020-09-14 17:44,"This article, among many other pieces of evidence, suggests that it isn't hyperbole or mere insult to see the Trump Cult as a form of mental illness."
2020-09-14 17:31,"This is the definition of projection. This sounds like it’s directly from Steve Miller. The Trump administration always puts on a statement which accuses the Democrats of doing what the Trump administration has already done.  At this point it appears that Twitter and Facebook should be shut down NOW until two weeks after the election￼￼.
Trump and his sycophants Are using social media to basically overthrow our democracy. All the social media must be shut down temporarily to prevent Trump and sycophants from being able to do this. There is nothing in the constitution Or Bill of Rights￼ that￼ guarantee it’s citizens the use of Facebook and Twitter and Instagram. Our very way of life is not worth having these useless platforms spewing lies and garbage and disinformation 24 hours a day.￼￼"
2020-09-14 17:35,"This is so much like a Russian disinformation plot to create chaos.  I don't believe a word out of the mouths of this administration.  They don't do anything for the public...defund...blackmail...debunk...create fake cures and now it is being blamed on antifa  whoever they are.  The right wing militias don't wear masks, bring their AK47's to city hall and kill protestors.  Outright lunacy."
2020-09-14 17:39,Didn't think anything else in the current Administration could shock me. I was WRONG...
2020-09-14 17:42,"Mr. Caputo stated that he and his family have been: ""harassed by people who have later been prosecuted."" So who are these people who have been prosecuted? Were they found guilty?

No doubt those planning on killing him include presidential candidate Mr. Joe Biden, VP candidate Ms. Kamala Harris, the Obamas, all the Democrats in both the House and Senate, Mr. Soros, antifa, and of course that 400 pound tech wiz in NJ.  Q has alluded to this, so it must be true.

No doubt that President Trump's faithful want a bloody civil war, if their ""god"" doesn't win the 2020 election. If ""Trump's people"" - the bikers, military, and militias are insufficient to keep Trump in power, evidently they will seek the aid of Russia, China, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Philippines, among others, to ensure that the ""will of the people"" is not subverted.

God forbid that Mr. Caputo should die between now and the Second Coming because that would be positive proof that he was assassinated."
2020-09-14 17:40,Caputo needs some time in a safe space. How about Creedmoor?
2020-09-14 17:41,"Caputo, one of Trump's propaganda henchmen, wants us to view this election as a simple choice between a Trump win and civil war."
2020-09-14 17:44,par for the course for a trump administration official including paranoid visions and delusions.  Mental healthcare needs to become a priority starting at the white house
2020-09-14 17:45,The CDC scientists should sue him for slander.
2020-09-14 17:33,"What a truly awful person, to put his fantasies out there in order to stir up violence.  Because he's afraid, he wants to take down our communities with him?  

If whipping up aggression weren't so dangerous, it would simply be laughable that he fears left-wing gun violence when the open-carry folks who storm state capitols and shoot at protestors are almost exclusively right-wing zealots.  

Sorry not sorry that he feels besieged.  Government figures who twist science for their own political ends should expect pushback."
2020-09-14 17:33,"I believe Mr. Caputo’s family has been harassed and threatened, as have many many public figures involved in the fight to combat the corona virus including Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx. Threats to our public servants is despicable and the perpetrators should be prosecuted. 

Mr. Caputo’s charges that there are left-wing hit squads waiting until after the election to kill people like him is either delusional paranoia or despicable lying. There are no other possibilities. Either way, he is not fit to serve in government."
2020-09-14 17:30,"Sharon, you have reported this syndrome so tastefully and so beautifully. Simply put, the lunatics are running the asylum - at 1600, across town, in the GOP, the deep Red States and in Farwell Land. Michael D. Cohen Esq., Mary L. Trump and Anthony Scaramucci Esq. understand perfectly. I commend you, them, and steady Pulitzer Bob Woodward. It’s going to take a village, 200,000,000 strong - I remain optimistic. Till November 3. Vote. Let’s hear it for W. Mark Felt. We put two of three grandsons through school. Love Joan Felt."
2020-09-14 17:34,"I would never hope that someone is mentally ill, but in this case, I do. At least it would explain what is otherwise outrageous, threatening and frankly criminal incitement. I hope Mr. Caputo steps down and gets whatever help he needs."
2020-09-14 17:38,"This person is a US Government employee, not an employee of the Trump campaign or a ""White House Politcal Advisor."" He should be removed from government service IMMEDIATELY."
2020-09-14 17:38,"Pretty much every claim made by Trump and his supporters or administration  is made ""without evidence.""  They are just making this stuff up to cause panic.  They use (or misuse) words like ""sedition"" in order to sound authoritative, but they are clearly intending to incite  hysteria within voters who don't see they lies for what they are - blatant, nonsensical lies."
2020-09-14 17:43,This story is riddled with examples of a man dealing with a mental health breakdown - a terrifying state of affairs given his position. I hope this does not take up any more oxygen in the news cycle....
2020-09-14 17:30,Any Republicans in Congress wish to comment on this? I yield the balance of my time.
2020-09-14 17:34,"He also needs to refresh his knowledge of the cathecism 
A Venial sin will get you a year in purgatory, less if you get a good lawyer."
2020-09-14 17:42,This is flat-out terrifying!
2020-09-14 17:43,"I certainly agree with Caputo; his ""mental health has failed.""  Someone show him the door, please."
2020-09-14 17:34,It’s a shame democrats didn’t control go congress and had the ability to oversee this. Oh wait . . .
2020-09-14 17:42,"Why isn't this guy being shut down? He's obviously not well. Where is the GOP? Where is Facebook?

This makes me ill that someone like this wields so much power."
2020-09-14 17:43,"More completely deluded and incoherent trump followers.  So exactly where in DC are these ""camps?""  Where are they hiding guns and tons of ammunition?  Where are they hiding food for the multitudes?

Why does this Caputo guy seem to think that the police and the army will be on trump's ""side?""  They all swore an oath to the Constitution, and no one has betrayed that oath en masse in the military since 1860.  They will not do so now because this is not a question of keeping a monstrous practice alive, it is a question of keeping the US alive and preserving and improving our way of life for every citizen and immigrant.

In addition, I doubt these localized ""militias"" who swing their assault-style weapons will dare stand up to trained marines and army veterans, even if some of them served themselves.  Plus shooting unarmed civilians will be prosecuted as murder when they lose.

If trump wants to incite civil war, then he will pay dearly for it if he survives, and he will also pay more dearly for it in the history books.  Right now he is a blip of foolishness in America.  If he incites a civil war, he is a treasonous criminal and should be executed.  I sincerely hope that no such thing happens, because even more than 200,000 will die.

So there are two indispensable issues:  GOTV and Do. Your. Census.

A HUGE THANK YOU TO ALL WHO DO THESE!!"
2020-09-14 17:44,"How do these people get hired into top government jobs? Oh, right, sorry I forgot...Trump."
2020-09-14 17:30,"Where is Facebook's commitment to truth in all this? This live event should have been shut down when it first went off the rails. Come on, Zuckerberg. Be responsible!"
2020-09-14 17:30,"This country has tipped into insanity.  This is the stuff of Germany in the 1930's.  And it's dangerous.   

I don't know whether Michael Caputo is merely nuts, or whether this is a deliberate effort to help bring fascism to America.  In either case, we MUST remove these people from the public sphere, and from power, on November 3."
2020-09-14 17:43,This report is deeply disturbing.
2020-09-14 17:40,"If anything, his is saying this to cover up the fact that the extreme right wingers have this planned.  Otherwise, yeah, lost touch with reality."
2020-09-14 17:43,Why give this man a forum by publishing these remarks? They are beneath such dignity and below contempt. Well Trump is pulling out all the stops. Each week it'll get worse.
2020-09-14 17:42,"Trump is a Russian agent, and this man Caputo is a former Putin acolyte who has been installed by the Russians to foment this chaos and civil strife.  We need to stop this threat on Nov. 3 and begin the judicial process against all the Republican enablers who have been complicit in this attack on our democracy."
2020-09-14 17:37,"Gee, and I have the reverse fears should Trump lose. Nice to have something in common for once with this administration."
2020-09-14 17:43,"Trump is at it again, telling us exactly what he is going through by accusing others of it (sometimes through a spokesperson).  Trump had Caputo say the Left is planning a revolt after the election?  ...um, all indicators are that the Democrats, some who are indeed the Left, but some (including Biden) who are definitely not, will be in charge after the election - Trump is telling us that he is planning a revolt.  Caputo said that his (Caputo's) “mental health has definitely failed”.  Again, that would be Trump, exactly describing the state of Trump's mental health.  Caputo wants to keep his job and, NOT be attacked by the POTUS, so he says whatever foolish thing he is told to say."
2020-09-14 17:43,"Well, at least it's only a venial sin (albeit a ""grievous"" one) and not a mortal sin.  That's something."
2020-09-14 17:42,"I’m sorry, but this is ridiculous. Scientists are working too hard to threaten this guy. Not to mention that many or most are non-violent and there are not many leftists among them. Democrats, yes, but not leftists or socialists. This persons views are specious, but on the one hand it is fascinating to see how Trump and his cronies are upping the ante, on the other, it is petrifying."
2020-09-14 17:44,"This man sounds as if he is in the throes of a severe, acute, agitated depression. He is angry, edgy, displays poor impulse controls, and his judgement is deeply impaired. He is not in any position to manage an agency of this magnitude."
2020-09-14 17:44,I guess the trump campaign strategy (and his entire presidency) is to throw a whole bunch of things at the wall and see what sticks.
2020-09-14 17:45,"The folks in the white coats will be coming for him soon, I hope!"
2020-09-14 17:46,"if trump is reelected i'd say a promotion is in store for ""Mad Mike."" you would think that in a sprawling bureaucracy as HHS someone would think to ""Medicate Mike."""
2020-09-14 17:50,"First and foremost, someone please get this man some help before he harms himself or (any) others. Second, Mr. Caputo: If you “don’t want to talk about death anymore,” you need to be working for an administration other than Donald Trump’s. Third, please double-check your sources on the difference between venial and mortal sins. It's the mortal sins that will be—some higher power willing—sending you to hell."
2020-09-14 17:54,Earth to Michael:  You don't go to hell for venial sins.  Just saying.
2020-09-14 17:59,"Reading reports of Caputo’s comments turns my stomach.  What a vile suck-up. It is astonishing to see so many poisonous creatures crawling out from under rocks to serve the most dangerous, nasty and ignorant president in American history.  

If you think Trump and his thugs speak their minds you are foolish.  They are dancing you down the garden path to your own destruction.  Trashing America is fun and profitable for them.  You are just meat in their sausage machine."
2020-09-14 17:51,"Caputo.... Catholic?  You don't go to Hell for venial sins - you go to purgatory.  You go to Hell for mortal sins, like knowingly allowing the deaths of hundreds of thousands before this is all over  This guy probably belongs to the same religion as Trump - the First Church of the Golden Parachute."
2020-09-14 17:50,"The Republican Party, as an institution, is a danger to the rule of law, the integrity of our democracy and survival of life on planet earth.

The problem is not just President No Responsibility; it’s Republicans’ Conservative ideology.

The only hope of defending the country from President No Responsibility and his Republican Congressional collaborators is to vote against Republicans at every opportunity."
2020-09-14 17:52,"The substance of Mr. Caputo’s comments on Facebook provide compelling evidence supporting his public confession that his mental health is failing. Indeed, it seems abundantly clear that such mental failure is complete. In light of his candid admission, it is time that he resign his position so that he can do no more damage to the public interest. 

Steven Tabackman"
2020-09-14 17:54,"Yes, as he himself reports, his mental health does seem to be in decline.  But he does us the service of illustrating the attitude in Trump's circle toward scientific work ."
2020-09-14 17:58,"It's important that we don't stigmatize anyone with mental health issues which Mr. Caputo is clearly experiencing. That being said, what he's saying and doing are extremely dangerous. It only takes another person with the same illness to decide to believe him and go out to hurt someone. The kindest thing this president can do is relieve him of duties so he can seek professional help. Hopefully his family is willing to intervene."
2020-09-14 17:59,"Considering Mr. Caputo spent several years in Russia working for Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin I think we can reasonably assign him to the  category of Russian advance agents seeking to overthrow the United States. Presumably he knows all about the formation of armed units intended to foster insurrection.  Yet I can sympathize with his concern for his own mental health as it has to be hard to act like a sleeper agent imbedded in the United States for years. To be someone with no health background or experience placed in Health and Human Services charged with sowing disinformation and discord has to be a great strain. It is striking how many appointees and consultants for the Trump Administration have Russian credentials, exposure, and connections. One might be forgiven for thinking the Kremlin is seeding the U.S. government with operatives placed to do serious damage to public policy, confidence, and capacity.

Who knew?"
2020-09-14 17:44,"Michael Caputo is the man who is trying to modify scientific reports to support Donald Trump's statements and this is the department that now controls the Covid 19 statistics. When Donald Trump learned how serious Covid 19 is, he did not warn the public. He did not prepare the country. Instead he changed the department where the statistics are reported from the CDC to the HHS. Reread the quotes in this article. This is the department in control of the statistics now."
2020-09-14 17:47,"What is it with these people that don’t seem to understand there isn’t going to be an option for Trump to refuse to “stand down” at the inauguration. Once the Electoral College casts its votes, it’s all over. Nothing Trump can say or do will change that legal outcome."
2020-09-14 17:54,"Having overcome my initial shock and horror at what Michael Caputo had to say as the senior spokesman for a U.S. cabinet department, I think it is pretty clear that he is seriously mentally ill and suffering from paranoid delusions.  His description of what he sees on his apartment walls is straight out of a mental health diagnosis textbook.  If he is not removed from his job for health reasons, then we will know that Trump will stop at nothing, and I mean nothing, to sow poison in his quest for re-election.  This is real ""Dr. Strangelove"" stuff and it can't be allowed to stand."
2020-09-14 17:55,"These daily insights into the Trump administration's statements and actions appear to me to be akin to what evolved over time in Stalinist Russia.  Truth ceases to exist; the sole purpose of the dissemination of governmental pronouncements is to buttress the positions of those in power.

If Trump is remains in power (whether re-elected or not), I fear for what will come next.   For certain, the America beloved by its citizens will perish.  Whether through the constant withering of its democratic institutions (think Rome) or their sudden and utter destruction (think Germany in 1933) will be the only uncertainty."
2020-09-14 17:57,"Scientists at the CDC have loyally served several administrations. The agency that has respect and praise, not only at home, from around the world as well. Simply because, these medical professionals do not tow the line of politicians, they are daily being disparaged. This is more harmful and to be concerned than the COVID - 19 itself."
2020-09-14 18:03,"I don’t think we realize how many Russian assets are probably now sprinkled throughout our government.  I suspect once Putin feels confident that we here in the U.S. are sufficiently embroiled in a civil war, he’ll make his move on Eastern Europe."
2020-09-14 17:50,"Wow.  To say this is a disturbing article would be quite the understatement.  Honestly, if I were to have heard this from a friend about, say, a family member, I would be aiding my friend in locating mental health specialists to help this family member out.  But this is a spokesperson for, arguably, one of the most important departments in our government given that we are in a pandemic.  

I cannot imagine what it is like working in the CDC right now if you aren’t willing to toss science and reality aside.  That Mr. Caputo has faith in the CDC Director and calls him a friend probably will not help the situation for those workers.  But as an American, it horrifies me that somebody this far out from reality is in our government.  And I am more horrified by the knowledge he is one of many."
2020-09-14 17:42,"Now, on the other side, like FACTS, there were militias in 2016 who said they would go into operation if Hillary were elected.

Most sane people know that ""armed insurrection"" would be a Federal crime, and that the military would be justified to respond.

Oh, wait, Trump thinks looting and violence in cities, which indeed are crimes that should be punished, are in that same category."
2020-09-14 17:44,"Mr. Caputo needs ""to spend more time with his family,"" although I don't know whether they deserve it."
2020-09-14 17:45,"Well, he's right about one thing.  His ""mental health has definitely failed.""

This man needs to stop ""being alone in Washington"" and looking at the ""shadows on the ceiling"" of his apartment.  

He needs to be put somewhere he can't hurt himself or others.  And that is most definitely not in an influential office at HHS.

Another Trump victim.  Get the net."
2020-09-14 17:45,any more stories like this and i'm going to start seeing long shadows on the ceilings too.
2020-09-14 18:01,"I'm no expert, but if a friend or family member started talking like this I would seek to get them to a mental health practitioner as soon as possible."
2020-09-14 18:02,I cannot even fathom the dystopian world that this man lives in. He needs  treatment and should be immediately removed from office.
2020-09-14 17:44,"Let’s see, Mr. Caputo, whose mental health, by his own admission, “is shot,” wants Americans to consider his ranting valid, wants Americans to buy guns and ammunition for the coming insurrection, wants to purge the CDC of dedicated scientists whose message doesn’t match Trump’s? How does this guy avoid a straight jacket, or for that matter prison? Why does he still have a job after urging Americans to prepare for civil war?"
2020-09-14 17:44,"Politicizing the CDC has been done before.  President Reagan and Surgeon General Koop suppressed abortion research there the 1980s, because studies showed abortion was safe. 

And there was the effective ban on gun violence research by the CDC beginning in 1996 (which may been walked back a bit last year).  

Interesting that Caputo's work in Russia included promoting Putin, because his rant smacks of Lysenkoism, the Stalinist suppression of the sciences of genetics and agriculture."
2020-09-14 17:48,"From Putin's aides to Trump's aides to our most respected newspaper.  This is the tip of the iceberg of Russian meddling Mueller warned us about.
It is a more bizarre form of the same misinformation campaign we've been dealing with since June 2015.
With 50 days to go, prepare for Trump to motivate his base with even more irrational fear mongering."
2020-09-14 17:52,"I'm sorry that Mr. Caputo feels harassed by people who follow science rather than politics, but to extrapolate from medical professionals being angry at the intervention of people with absolutely no expertise in the field and presume some diabolical plot that actually threatens his well being indicates that his problems are far more likely internal, than external. 

The level of paranoia expressed does not fit into any believable paradigm except perhaps the pressure of working for a completely solipsistic ignorant man, who imagines he can impose his own reality on a fact based science."
2020-09-14 18:04,"The President and members of his administratoin throw out words like ""sedition"" and ""treason"" in ways that suggest they are aiming to incite riots themselves. We must speak against their abuse of our lives and their libelous public accusations of ""treason"" by those who disagree with the presidential biases, preferences, and policies. We Democrats and our representatives have been said to ""hate this country"" in front of crowds of people who are, in turn, called great patriots simply because they attend a rally and shout approval of a preening president. These actions, for me, are clearly made with intention of inciting conflict between the so-called 'patriots,"" and those who supposedly ""hate this country."" 

According to federal law, ""It is a crime when an individual travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, including, but not limited to, the mail, telegraph, telephone, radio, or television, with intent to: Incite a riot; organize, promote, encourage, participate in, or carry on a riot; or commit any act of violence in furtherance of a riot; or aid or abet any person in inciting or participating in or carrying on a riot or committing any act of violence in furtherance of a riot.

Therefore, the president and others, like Michael Caputo, are guilty of another crime: Speaking with the intention of inciting a riot."
2020-09-14 17:41,Talk about projection! Was this guy hand picked to initiate the next escalation of paranoia  by fomented by right wing propaganda. These guys know what they're doing. I'm not the first to say this is only going to get worse as (assuming) Trump's polls fall.
2020-09-14 17:43,"I’d say that Mr. Caputo’s “mental health has definitely failed,” as he acknowledged on Facebook.  The man has absolutely no business being in any position of responsibility. The unhinged right wing is getting more and more dangerous by the day. Innocent people, like scientists he is attacking, are going to die if this continues. I would plead with so-called mainstream Republicans, like my Senator Rob Portman, to reject insanity and conspiracy theories, but, no doubt, Rob will “be late for lunch” and unable to answer any questions."
2020-09-14 17:46,"I suppose it's out of the question to think someone in the Trump administration might actually organize a mental health intervention for Mr. Caputo and get him the help he needs.  Just reading what this man is envisioning and the fact that he has admitted his mental health is suffering should be reason enough to act. God help us, the position he holds is crucial to following the truth about Covid 19 cases and deaths, information our Scientists and Doctor's need to fight the pandemic.  Vote Blue all the way our country is in serious trouble."
2020-09-14 17:47,"I'd ask Caputo to consider if he realizes that he's part of the problem leading to the impending violence he ""warns"" about, but it's rhetorical at this point."
2020-09-14 17:48,"Mr. Caputo is a perfect example of why the U.S. government has been a complete failure in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. He has complete distrust of the science based evidence on combating the virus and the experts at the CDC. He excels at fealty to the president and adherence to the right wing, Qanon fantasies of a deep state conspiracy, left wing militias, persecution by unknown adversaries and other Trump projections to incite fear and rage. He was right about one thing though; his mental health has definitely failed."
2020-09-14 17:57,"Mr. Caputo is a sadly confused and perhaps even deranged man.  First, he should get his sins straight. Venial sins are the less important ones. Mortal sins are the biggies.

Mainly though, the CDC is NOT there to serve the political agenda of any administration. They are there to speak the truth to the American public towards the end of preserving health in times like this.

Given Mr. Trump's recent disclosures to Bob Woodward, it's apparent the president and his minions are not doing this and have no interest in doing this important task. All the more important that the CDC step up. 

It's not really much of a conspiracy if the CDC is doing it in the open. So I suggest he cool it on the conspiracy ranting. The scientists work for the American people, as does the government, even if Mr. Trump would have it otherwise."
2020-09-14 17:59,As a nurse for 50 years and a gero-psych nurse for the last 30 years I find this report deeply troubling.  This man is experiencing a mental health crisis and needs intervention now.
2020-09-14 18:01,"Math and science are hard.  Mr. Caputo probably wasn’t great at either.
Accepting reality is difficult.  Mr. Caputo is having difficulty with reality.
Fantasy and blaming someone else is always easier: Mr. Caputo"
2020-09-14 17:47,"It gets more bizarre and more frightening almost by the hour.  And that ain't easy, because it has been *very* bizarre and *very* frightening for a long time already.

I'm not sure whether Mr. Caputo needs inpatient treatment or not, but he clearly needs treatment in some setting and should definitely not be working in his current position while so dangerously delusional."
2020-09-14 17:56,"""Left  wing"" comes from the revolutionary French parliament: democrats to the left, aristocrats to the right of the speaker.

In that archaic sense, ""the left""--pro democracy citizens--might rebel against aristocrats, neo-feudal moneylords supplanting the old landlords.

But Left/Right are now dated ideological classifications.  Even the aristocrats at least claim to be pro-democracy.  Of course that is pure marketing hypocrisy--a bold face lie.

Progressive/Regressive have updated Left/Right.  Progressives seek change for the better--for commoners--those without great inherited wealth.  That's why the original states were called ""commonwealths"".  That is what democracy--government FOR the common people--was all about.

Progressives base their ideas on science--in the original sense of systematic inquiry based on logic and evidence--a post enlightenment idea, institutionalized as academia.

Regressives seek a return to feudalism with its faith/dogma based beliefs devoid of logic and evidence,  steeped in propaganda--marketing gimmicks and delusions.  They claim their opposition are ""left wing""--as if  that means corrupt.

But it's a cheap marketing trick to charge the competition with your own corruptions.  It's Trump's stock in trade."
2020-09-14 17:58,"Mr. Trump has 6 weeks to whip this country into a dystopian fog capable of intimidating, and terrorizing voters to the point where they will be too afraid to cast a ballot, or too confused to know where to invest their vote. Confidence in the USPS handling vote-by-mail is flagging, Bill Barr and Giuliani are waiting in the wings to promote their theories about the Biden’s, GOP senators and reps hide behind potted plants and in elevators to dodge journalists. Whereas Trump in the past had been able to threaten, intimidate, litigate and settle his way out of sticky situations, this time he knows that leaving the presidency likely means he will be held accountable for his criminality. He is desperate for a narrative that paints him as the victim of this new battle for America. He and his people are foreshadowing a new civil war. 
Here is the America that Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity etc. have laid the groundwork for over a generation. Vote early."
2020-09-14 18:05,"So, basically, get the armed Trump militias ready for street fighting and make sure that Consigliere Barr will not prosecute the militias, only the people  that they attack.
Yeah, I believe that somewhere in the Constitution this is described as the best way of preserving American democracy.
What could go wrong?"
2020-09-14 18:05,"A lifelong public health professional, I am more horrified than ever. This, by Trump and his minions, is the Twin Peaks writ large -- (1) answering the charge that the pandemic has been mishandled with ""Treason!"", and (2) fanning the flames of civil strife into war, using HHS/CDC/NIH as kindling.

Public health is a profession, not a political position. Health recommendations are rooted in best practices, not party affiliation."
2020-09-14 17:46,"Well at least some truth can be gleaned from this sad report,  ""mental health has definitely failed"" and that goes for Trumpism, the covid response and the current re-election campaign. I really hope that this dangerous dog-whistling nonsense leads to a profound defeat of Trumpism in November, which seems a long way off yet."
2020-09-14 18:00,"I think the statement that his ""mental health has failed"" is something we can all agree on."
2020-09-14 18:01,"Particularly because this is coming from an appointed government spokesperson this is extremely concerning.  Predicting a “left wing” violent revolt, encouraging citizens to purchase ammunition in anticipation of imaginary coordinate violence if candidate Biden wins or looses - is priming the pump of fear and internecine bloodshed.  What lunacy.  Have we all gone insane?  When will responsible Republican leaders call this kind of behavior out?  This is not a game.  Good grief!"
2020-09-14 17:41,"The CDC has been around since 1946 and has a strong history and reputation as a professional, apolitical public institution serving Americans and the world with partners with a similar mandate, history, and reputation. Trump drops the ball on Covid in a complete and cowardly failure of governance and leadership, and now after the WHO it looks like he wants to oversee the demise of the CDC. And, if that weren’t enough, people (led by CDC scientists in sweat pants, no less) are plotting to take up arms to country. The only arms to be mobilized are to move levers at the ballot box. These people are not only completely out of their depths, they are totally out of their minds."
2020-09-14 17:46,"His “mental health has definitely failed”--right he is. 

He also cannot read, only react overly emotionally to a single word: ""resistance""-- which he immediately assumed meant ""resistance to Trump"" when it refers to the biology of resistance to disease and infection.

How did such a complete shambles of a person get appointed?"
2020-09-14 17:51,Do the CDC employees have protection?
2020-09-14 17:52,Caputo is not credible.  Political operative.  No background in health science.   Where are the Republicans in Congress who should be objecting to this craziness?
2020-09-14 17:52,"As completely insane as this seems, it is a classic propaganda set up.  Accuse the other side of planning aggression, so that when your side perpetrates aggression it can be cast as a “defense.”   This tactic is being used daily by the president in his saying the election in November will be corrupt, thereby setting up his defying of its outcome as a defense."
2020-09-14 17:59,The Trump administration's war on science and scientists continues.  Very scary and dangerous!
2020-09-14 17:43,"These guys are not only frauds, they’re tedious. The left-wing mob script they’re playing off is transparent and laughable. At this point, why give them a platform? I’ll given them one thing, though they’re good at pounding their message home. It’s emotional and fear-based, and that’s what people respond to. Democrats in the 1970s and 1980s were good at branding Republicans as the radical right; they have to rediscover that type of language to appeal to low-information voters. It would win them more elections."
2020-09-14 17:44,"The problem is not that he said what he said, but no one is going to hold his feet to the fire.

This Administration lies to us daily, makes unsubstantiated statements about everything and they get a pass.

Tomorrow another one of their other toadies will lie about something and he or she too will get a pass.

It has simply become a fact of life and other than some complaints here and there, nothing happens.

No credibility, no responsibility and no one seems to care."
2020-09-14 17:45,"So if you needed any more evidence of the Trump effort to destroy our institutions just add Caputo to the list of singularly unqualified people with malicious intent who have left their mark these last 3  years.  Lest we forget Betsy DeVos, Scott Pruitt, Ben Carson, Ryan Zinke, K.T. McFarland, Mick Mulvaney, Tom Price, Mark Esper, Peter Navarro and countless other inept appointees who populate agencies and commissions charged with serving the people.  That’s not even counting the accomplices and sycophants both appointed and elected. The strategy to destroy the nation from within is succeeding.  This is way beyond partisanship.  Our national identity is at stake."
2020-09-14 17:50,Obviously Mr. Caputo needs to be fired.  We need to get back to facts and evidence.  Such behavior wouldn't be tolerated in any corporation.
2020-09-14 17:54,"To put it kindly, he needs
a mental health intervention.
Someone also wrote about

There are laws that control

check and refuse to run blatant lies,
to govern themselves,"
2020-09-14 17:58,"So Mr. Caputo fears shadows in his D.C. apartment, and Trump warns against Ninja-types lurking in shadows. Sounds like they suffer from serious shadow-phobia. (Do they fear their own shadows?) And Mr. Caputo has it backwards: It’s Trump who’s inciting violence and won’t accept the election results if he loses. Good grief, we’ve got mental health issues  in Trumplandia. We can’t remove these people fast enough."
2020-09-14 18:01,"John Kelly, when he was WH Chief of Staff used the metaphor ""being on the bus to crazytown"" to describe the general mood of chaos on the Oval Office. 

I'd like to suggest that M. Caputo might be qualified to DRIVE that bus."
2020-09-14 18:05,"Has Caputo been drinking, again? I’m serious because if memory serves, he worked for a while on Trump’s campaign, was interviewed by Mueller but ultimately not charged, went quiet for a while then admitted he struggled with mental health and drinking. I thought he was even asked during one interview on CNN a couple years back if he was drunk right then.  It’s possible I’m equating him with another kook from Trumpland but in any case it’s clear he’s decompensating.  Our only consolation is Trump may actually fire him, again, if he proves to be too much of a liability."
2020-09-14 17:47,"His mental health is in question not because of the public's anger at his politically motivated actions, but because anyone that does what he is doing in support of his ""fearless leader"" is mentally unstable. He is just another one of Trump's personally installed cronies. If Biden doesn't win in November, this country is doomed. I think the motto should be Make America Great Again by voting for Biden on a red-white-blue background."
2020-09-14 17:50,"Historians are going to have so much fun with the ""Trump Era"".

Just when you think it can't get any worse, something like this hits the news. 

How'd you like to be in the GOP House, or, Senate and wake up to this mentally unstable comment by a Trump appointee in charge of CV-19 response?

Lindsey and Mitch and the rest must be desperately trying to mitigate this latest insanity from the Trump Administration.

Their honor is now on the line and only a traitors to our Democratic Republic and cowards will chose to do nothing, or, to defend Mr. Caputo. 

I'd say Caputo is Caput but hey, this is the Trump Era, Putin's boy, Donald The Clown, is in charge and the more he destabilizes our country the more money he makes. 

Once again, the vodka glasses in the Kremlin are raised in another toast to Vladimir Putin for placing Donald The Clown in The Oval Office and taking America down once again in the Trump era.

Will gun toting Trump dupes and stooges see the error of their ways? Will they become Patriots instead of loyalists to a demagogue, a tyrant? 

No, they won't. They are far to ignorant to make that transition.  It will take the Armed Forces to intervene and I hope they have their heads screwed on straight.

No, because there will remain in circulation people like Michael Caputo.

Trump is a symptom, not the disease.  (A very bad symptom, but nevertheless a symptom.)  The disease is the rot in the Republican party that leads to people like Michael Caputo thinking that scientists must be wrong because scientists say things Mr. Caputo doesn't want to hear.

Mr. Caputo correctly states that his “mental health has definitely failed.”"
2020-09-14 17:58,"As he notes, clearly his mental health has failed.  But in the circus that passes for the current executive branch of government, that hasn't been a deterrent before.  Sigh, what if we can't get rid of this buffoonery in November?"
2020-09-14 17:43,At one point I literally thought this was an article from the Onion. Caputo is a lunatic.

2020-09-14 17:47,"First and foremost, Facebook is to blame for this tripe. Caputo has openly admitted that his mental health is suffering. For that fact alone he should be removed from his position.

2020-09-14 18:07,"This is alarming news. No left-wing hit squads are preparing for insurrection, and this sounds more like a plot to prepare us for martial law if Trump loses the election."
2020-09-14 18:00,He is not nuts or stressed.  He is lying by saying that left-wingers are already arming themselves and planning to start shooting people when their candidate loses but won't step aside.  This is intended as justification and an alert for right-wingers to do the same when Trump loses.  You will be hearing more of this soon and from Trump himself.
2020-09-14 17:46,"his “mental health has definitely failed.”
As we can see.
In what world is this okay?
In any other civilized nation this man would have been shown the door instantly.
WHEN IS THIS GOING TO END?"
2020-09-14 17:52,"This man needs help immediately. I’ve just left messages of concern for both Senators from Texas. Caputo is a top communications official at HHS. Is what he says official? Like Trump’s tweets - official when he wants them to be; unofficial when they become inconvenient? HHS is responsible for the welfare of incredibly vulnerable people. I don’t want him, or anyone who does not see that he needs help, anywhere near any of my relatives or friends who have disabilities. Be armed and get ammunition? We’ve already had at least 1 mass murder of people in El Paso for the sin of being brown. Caputo is inciting this kind of action. I am a Democrat, brown, liberal, pro-choice, and likely a lot of other things despised by the people who watch Caputo’s Facebook show and think he is preaching the White House marching orders. From now on, those people who come out of nowhere in stores, get in my face, and tell me to go back to my own country will no longer be met with “God bless you.” I have to assume they are initiating an assault, that they have a concealed weapon and that they mean to do me and my children harm. This is insane; like, Caputo insane."
2020-09-14 17:55,"A lot of people are saying that Trump’s mental illness is highly contagious and Caputo has contracted it. Could it be true that Caputo is now mentally ill as well by having such close proximity to Trump? I don’t know, you tell me. But that’s what I keep hearing, believe me."
2020-09-14 17:55,"I've watched Caputo on the cable shows.  Always thought he was a little out there, but to his credit, loyal to his friends (even if they were themselves kooks). But he's obviously lost his mind now (and he admits it). If Trump can't get rid of this guy . . . Oh, never mind."
2020-09-14 18:05,"Caputo's behavior is just another in the string of appalling behavior by the cronies of this corrupt administration. 

We must elect leaders who are committed to evidence-based judgement rather than ideological- or corporate-driven judgement."
2020-09-14 17:50,"It is unconscionable that someone in a position of so much responsibility and power would voice those thoughts publicly. This whole country is having a mental health crisis and to spew garbage conspiracy theories only fans the flames of division, hatred, and paranoia. 
As an official with a public platform, his duty is first and foremost to speak the scientific truth and whenever possible, speak in a way that unifies us as Americans in a common fight against a biological threat. You say what you want to be a reality- i.e. unity, compassion, cooperation. 
Maybe this is not possible under trump but I’m following my own advice and saying what I want to be true— unity, compassion, and cooperation. 
Let’s all focus on this."
2020-09-14 17:59,"I'm trying to see the video for myself, but I can't find it, or even Caputo's Facebook account."
2020-09-14 18:00,"Numerous demonstrators have been killed by Trump supporters/white supremacists while peacefully protesting the unique burden of being Black while one Trump supporter has been killed by a self-proclaimed anti-fascist, and that anti-fascist was later executed by federal officials in a barrage of nearly 35 bullets in what Trump described as rightful ""retribution"".  To make matters worse, one of the Trump's demented soldiers executed two anti-fascists and injured others but has since been lauded by the President as innocent despite being caught on camera committing the murders.  Mr. Caputo is contributing to these horrifying conditions which are deteriorating into a shooting war by convincing his fellow fascists to prepare for more shooting because ""left-wing hit squads were preparing for armed insurrection""."
2020-09-14 18:04,"President No Responsibility unleashes extrajudicial execution  as his brand of ""law and order.""

The Marshals are a branch of the Justice Department. And in a separate statement, Attorney General Bill Barr elaborated on the encounter: “When Reinoehl attempted to escape arrest and produced a firearm, he was shot and killed by law enforcement officers,” Barr insisted.

Barr’s statement was starkly political, applauding the “takedown” of Reinoehl as a victory for Trump’s brand of law-and-order. 

Calling Reinoehl “a dangerous fugitive, admitted Antifa member, and suspected murderer,” Barr insisted his killing was a “significant accomplishment in the ongoing effort to restore law and order to Portland,” adding: “The streets of our cities are safer with this violent agitator removed, and the actions that led to his location are an unmistakable demonstration that the United States will be governed by law, not violent mobs.”"
2020-09-14 17:56,"Putting aside how terrifying all of this is, how did they all find each other so quickly?"
2020-09-14 18:06,"So basically the Department of Health and Human Services is backing their communications director who is calling for the right wing to arm themselves for civil war. Let that sink in...
We worry that our civil society is crumbling? It's gone baby."
2020-09-14 18:07,"I couldn't finish reading this. I tried, but I could not and cannot. This person seems to be inciting armed conflict. He is a government official, presumably with our collective best interests in mind. How can he do this, free of censure?

How did our country come to this?"
2020-09-14 18:07,"Here is another example of a nearly universal track record of Trump-installed cabinet officials not only having no expertise in their respective departments' functions, but making every effort to work in opposition to their very reasons for being.  And, not only is Mr. Caputo delusional and dangerously pandering to the more volatile elements who would listen - left or right - he is an unintentional master of irony:  ""my mental health has definitely failed"" seems to be the understatement of this young week.  To top it off, the guy doesn't know what a venial sin is..."
2020-09-14 17:42,"Well this mentally disturbed man does belong with Trump.  The old peas in a pod thing for sure. 

 The swamp never existed till Trump showed up dragging it with him."
2020-09-14 17:56,This is insane. Insane. What republican will demand he resign?
2020-09-14 17:56,"Michael Caputo is a know-nothing who has no medical and public health education or experience. Zilch. Zero. 

Michael Caputo began his career as Roger Stone’s driver and personal assistant. He has slithered his way up the right-wing food chain to become a full-blown professional dirty trickster, right-wing conspiracy theorist and propagandist in the Roger Stone/Paul Manafort mold.

His job now appears to be to foment distrust and ‘panic’ rather than ‘calm’ in response to the covid-19 pandemic. Who could have expected such a thing from the administration that brought us such reality tv horror stories as an ‘invasion’ at the border with Mexico; the Mooslum ban; and the hordes of ‘left wing radical anarchist Democrat BLM thugs’ about to storm white suburbia? So out of character!

The mere fact that Caputo is now the spokesperson for our federal public health agencies is an indication of how far this country has fallen in less than four years’ time."
2020-09-14 17:58,Looks like the QAnon folks got to Mr. Caputo.
2020-09-14 18:01,"5000 Facebook followers? Wow I am impressed. New York Times has now presented this to the world and watch his followers grow. Anything for a story. It is so exhausting. This low life should have been kept the darkness in his little Facebook page with ""so many followers."" And now Antifa cannot kill him. Give me a break."
2020-09-14 18:01,So Facebook is still playing politics and desinformarían. Who’s sedition?
2020-09-14 18:02,"So  the right wing militias that have been arming and training and showing up in our cities and engaged in terrorist acts of violence go unmentioned by this fascist? 

No surprise.     Who can blame the left for arming themselves, if that is what is happening?"
2020-09-14 18:03,This man is an unhinged threat.
2020-09-14 17:39,"God, where do they find these people?!"
2020-09-14 17:41,"OMG! He said himself his mental health is not good. The man is unhinged and needs to be removed from his position along with his idol, for his safety and the good of the country. These people are dangerous. Their rhetoric inflames their base and spreads their psychosis."
2020-09-14 17:45,"This is totally nuts. What craziness... and it gets worse just when you think it can't.  Rogue scientists, left wing insurrection (much more like to be far right insurrection I fear if the Don is not elected).  These rabid Trump supporters just keep doing their best to discredit the federal government, discredit science and keep a dangerous, inept administration in power. It is beyond disgusting."
2020-09-14 17:53,"Hmm, seems somebody is looking for a promotion..."
2020-09-14 18:03,"Mr. Caputo is proof positive, an eloquent, albeit vile testimony of the way, fat from being drained, the swamp of ignorant, incompetent people, who benefit from the most insidious affirmative action policy, white folks' privilege. This category's denizens have no discernible qualifications; they are the product of a mindset that elevates sycophancy, blind ignorance, malevolence and an adherence to opacity and audacity into State policy. The current administration has elevated this policy to an art form. Yet, from the inception of this republic, the ""election'' of rabid racists and ignorants lile Andrew Jackson, George Wallace, et al, to public office, as well as the reliance on Caputo-like individuals like Bull Connor, the US of A has succumbed to the charms of snake oil salesmen and assorted quacks and mentally ill people, mostly men of European ancestry.
So Caputo is merely the visible part of the immense, submerged part of the iceberg."
2020-09-14 18:05,"Omg.   Worse every minute of every day.  And, I mean this dystopian administration under the murderous monster."
2020-09-14 18:06,"Caputo should look up the definition of ""venial.""  It means ""pardonable."""
2020-09-14 18:07,Where does Trump find so many uninformed sycophants?
2020-09-14 17:40,"THey are going to waste 1/4 billion dollars on propaganda? That needs to be investigated and stopped. He is a nut and dangerous but invoking God in his posts. Facebook, hopefully takes this down as fomenting violence."
2020-09-14 17:49,"He’s not having a breakdown. He is a tool of Putin. Putin has thrown monkey wrench after monkey wrench into us and western democracy. He’s not trying to overthrow the west, but just throw us all off balance so he has an easier time with his goals. For some reason congress and the media are too inept to uncover this."
2020-09-14 17:51,One more piece of evidence that the government is being run by nutcases. I wonder if any of them could face prosecution if Biden wins.
2020-09-14 17:45,"""Venial""? ""Venal?"" Neither is really appropriate in this statement the man is illiterate as well as being a vicious political hack."
2020-09-14 17:47,"Dangerous play by Trump's sycophants, the intent to create panic and chaos by lying about supposed 'squads'...living only in their sicklish brain, all to show support for the unsupportable, a cruel narcissist in-chief demanding unremitting loyalty, however criminal the enterprise. America is in real trouble under Trump, a perverse fabricator of conspiratory theories with no basis in fact whatsoever. Michael Caputo ought to be ashamed of himself, a faithful instigator of lies 'a la Trump', to whom the truth and the facts remain just a pesky nuisance."
2020-09-14 17:48,"This is beyond crazy. 

Us taxpayers are actually paying this nut case?

The only true thing he said was that his “mental health has definitely failed.”"
2020-09-14 17:46,He admits that his mental health has “definitely failed” and he is making these accusations?!! He needs help. His entire diatribe should have been couched with that as the lede.
2020-09-14 17:37,"His mental health is NOT failing; he knows exactly what he’s doing.  He’s being paid to say this by our president and his henchmen. With your tax dollars. Everything is a projection of what is actually being planned by the Republican campaign.  Didn’t Marla Maples, Trump’s second wife, say that he had Mein Kampf on his bedside table?   The question is when will FBook censor him for inciting violence?"
2020-09-14 17:37,More gas lighting.
2020-09-14 17:44,Are my taxes now subsidizing the Department of Health’s house psychopath? Aesop has nothing on this guy. I don’t even want to think about the “What’s Next?”.
2020-09-14 18:06,I hate this administration and what they have done to our country.

Trump-Pence-GOP 2020"
2020-09-14 17:56,Do you become crazy working in the Trump administration or do you have to already be that way in order to get hired?  Like attracts like.
2020-09-14 17:58,"Caputo is Trumpmania in overdrive.  Nothing like Assistant Secretaries spinning out of control like a whirling dervish.  Hopefully, this pathetic creature will get involuntary psychiatric help before he harms himself or others."
2020-09-14 17:40,"Yet another shining example of one of Donald's ""best people"".........."
2020-09-14 17:52,"when someone says their mental health has failed
believe them"
2020-09-14 18:04,This man sounds like he's mentally ill and needs help; I hope someone is watching out for him.
2020-09-14 17:39,"oh brother, as if we need even more reason to vote trump out of office here is one of his well-paid flacks telling us that “If you carry guns, buy ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it’s going to be hard to get.” Seriously folks, there IS a swamp in D.C. and this guy is one of the head alligators! The best thing we can do, whatever your political affiliation, is VOTE this entire administration out of office on Nov 3 and start over from scratch."
2020-09-14 17:46,"If America re-elects Trump, it will completely deserve what ensues."
2020-09-14 17:47,"Kaput-oh!

The man is in way over his head and appears to becoming unglued..."
2020-09-14 17:56,"Yes, scientists and doctors are a dangerous bunch (sarcasm font). Mr. Caputo should switch to decaf."
2020-09-14 17:52,"Maybe Caputo's dreams are filled with righteous and avenging ghosts of all those who have died because of the Trump administration's  radical self-serving, incompetence (how is it that not one of the task force was a supply chain expert?????), lying, and multi-dimensional evil."
2020-09-14 17:54,"This man is clearly deranged, perhaps even more so than 45. Facebook needs to take immediate action to remove his insane rants, just as it has, allegedly, tried to remove trolls who attempt to influence the election. Caputo is quoted as saying his mental health has failed. Given that he acknowledges that, why is he still serving (not) the country?"
2020-09-14 18:06,Oh my! This is brilliant fodder for the entertainment industry. The writing rooms must be going nuts. Get to work on those treatments folks!!!!!
2020-09-14 18:04,"Caputo said his mental health has definitely failed. I agree. He's insane, dangerously so. This is what happens when a crazy man is president."
2020-09-14 18:04,It is now obvious that the rantings of a Mentally unstable Trump appointee are what constitutes News. The shadows on his ceiling are the  same shadows where Trump claims people we have never heard of are. THIS is nothing more than a lunatic who thinks Trump is a Messiah and feels it is his duty to blame the shadows for all the bad Democrats. THIS is More Garbage from Trump supporters who have no idea what they are doing but see making wild crazy accusations get Trump's praise. This shows exactly the mental instability that Trump counts on to help him flimflam the American people so he can be in good standing with PUTIN.  This ALL must stop and Trump Must Be Removed from Office as he is trying to subvert the Constitution and Destroy the Republic.
2020-09-14 18:00,"Of course Caputo is delusional and ignorant. But, for Trump,  Caputo's wild paranoid ramblings are just a useful asset in Trump's scaling up of growing disruptions to the coming election."
2020-09-14 18:06,"I am beyond understanding the ignorance and downright stupidity of the trump mis-administration.   trump seems to have picked appointees who could do the most harm to the agencies they were assigned to run into the ground.

The majority of us will be greatly relieved  when they crawl back to where they came from."
2020-09-14 18:09,"Another one with  failing mental health.  Like the president!
What about we the people."

2020-09-14 18:10,Well he’s right about one thing. His mental health has failed. It’s called paranoia. Poor man.
2020-09-14 17:47,"Readers seem to be taking these histrionics at face value. Try matching Caputo’s breathless, this-is-the-last-redoubt-people bluster to the exact same copybook hysteria in the Qanon drivel. This seems calculated; he’s playing to the rubes. Remember the feigned hysteria behind the wizards’ curtains that were the vital engines for Stalin’s show trials, McCarthyism, Nuremberg rallies...."
2020-09-14 17:53,"Yes, his “mental health has definitely failed.” This guy has flipped! Get him out of there before he comes to work armed."
2020-09-14 17:55,This is terrifying!!!!
2020-09-14 17:58,A review of Mr. Caputo's bio includes a stint at Gazprom media. Why am I not surprised?
2020-09-14 18:01,"Don't believe it -- he is NOT having a mental breakdown.

Caputo is a Putin operative and is playing you.  He knows exactly what he's doing."
2020-09-14 18:03,"""A grievous venial sin...""  I don't think that phrase means what you think it means."
2020-09-14 17:50,"“Mr. Caputo on Sunday complained on Facebook that he was under siege by the media and said that … his ‘mental health has definitely failed.’” 

In the remainder of his Facebook screed he offers definite proof that his “mental health has definitely failed.” The last rant I heard that was that unhinged was by General Jack D. Ripper in the movie Dr. Strangelove.

Please get this man mental help, and for our country’s sake get him out of the government."
2020-09-14 17:56,"Looks like Trump finally found someone nuttier than he is. These folks are so wrapped up in bogus conspiracy theories that they don’t seem to know up from down. 

I would suggest he resign, he clearly lacks the mental capacity to work in a profession as ugly as politics. A profession that for all intent and purpose should be free of politics. He made his own bed and now must lie in it."
2020-09-14 18:07,"This is certifiable madness.  And, it says to me that there are some Republicans who want our democracy to fail and authoritarian rule to begin as long as they are the authoritarians.  These extremists seem to want political violence and are trying to incite it."
2020-09-14 17:54,What else is going on today that Caputo's drawing attention to himself with these ridiculous claims?
2020-09-14 17:54,"And when Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin,” he said. “The drills that you’ve seen are nothing.” He added: “If you carry guns, buy ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it’s going to be hard to get.”
If this is not sick than I will never ever trust the USA

Until than God bless America

With love from Germany"
2020-09-14 17:59,"Holy cow!  This poor man needs help-seriously.  But then, mental healthcare in the country is so terrible, odds are he won't. He is correct that armed insurrection may follow the election results, but my money's on the white supremacists in T's camp being the ones starting the shooting.  It is, truly, very troubling and I hope that doesn't happen and that this guy gets the help he obviously needs."
2020-09-14 17:50,I have to hand it to Trump:  He must have searched for days overturning rocks in the muck for a guy like this.

2020-09-14 17:55,This man is doing his job...which is purely political! He is just turning up the volume on the ridiculous assertions the Trump base believes already. And they will buy into this nonsense.  The Trump administration is desperate particularly in regard to Covid!
2020-09-14 17:57,"And we move further and further into La La Land with the Trump Administration. We risk no longer being a western democracy but an East European autocracy where power is the #1 goal and the values of the people as a whole are trampled. These Covidiots want a civil war, and hope their right wing militias will rally to the call, as well as all the NRA paramaniacs. Is this America or a Hollywood movie?"
2020-09-14 18:09,"Somebody get this man to a doctor immediately before he does any more harm.  We already know there is a sizable lunatic fringe who will believe ANYTHING from this administration, and never even think to ask for proof.

Following that, and for the sake of the country, find a mentally well person to fill this position.  This is deadly serious, and we already know that there are NO Republicans left in Congress with the guts to call off this descent into total madness."
2020-09-14 18:01,"Where do they find these clowns, and how are they allowed to be in government and are given a platform to share their deranged world views?"
2020-09-14 18:03,"Because Trump (most especially) and his cohorts sadly have been shown to be pathological liars one cannot believe anything coming from their camp.  This man, Caputo, is fomenting hate and destruction with his ""get a gun"" rhetoric."
2020-09-14 17:57,"This man, Mr. Caputo, is seriously delusional.   He could be a danger to himself and others.  He needs medical attention - FAST!"
2020-09-14 18:00,The level of insanity permeating everything right now is mindblowing.  Anyone in their right mind who doesn’t feel scared about the fate of this country at this point is hopelessly naive.

What bad movie does he think playing a role in or is this just more awfully bad Trump reality TV?"
2020-09-14 17:57,This man has openly declared his own mental incapacity and should be removed from office. He’s also inciting violence. That applies to a lot of people in the current administration.
2020-09-14 17:47,Here we see Facebook is propagating language designed to ignite violence.  Facebook is a menace.
2020-09-14 18:08,"The shadows on your ceiling, Mr. Caputo, are long indeed. Please get yourself some rest  and humane counsel before putting out more calls for armed sedition. That could get us all in trouble."

2020-09-14 18:03,"Okay, Trump’s people, i.e. Roger Stone and Caputo here, are definitely out of their minds and are becoming dangerously unhinged. All Donald needs is an excuse, and he’s off to the races.
I feel like I’m trapped in the Fox News Universe, being buffeted on all sides by utter nonsense and more dangerous pronouncement crosswinds than I can cope with. 
Please, someone in the White House, call the Doctors and get these people psych appointments. Now."
2020-09-14 18:07,"Caputo needs to be fired, and as soon as possible. This level of paranoia and misinformation is a danger to the USA."

2020-09-14 18:03,"The way things are going, we will be a Soviet Republic soon.  Trump is ready to surrender the US of A to Putin.  He probably has sold us already and now he needs to keep his promise or he knows Putin will come after him.

And this is coming from a conservative!

Ditch Trump!"
2020-09-14 18:11,"Let's take brief look at Michael Caputo's history. From Wikipedia.

Caputo moved to Russia in 1994, after the fall of the Soviet Union, and was an adviser to Boris Yeltsin. He worked for Gazprom Media in 2000 where he worked on improving the image of Vladimir Putin in the U.S. He moved back to the U.S. and founded a public relations company, and then moved to Ukraine to work on a candidate's campaign for parliament.

The candidate he worked for was Volodymyr Lytvyn. This source was a bit harder to find, so here's the link -- <a href=""https://www.dni.gov/files/HPSCI_Transcripts/2019-05-01-MichaelCa-MTR.pdf"" target=""_blank"">https://www.dni.gov/files/HPSCI_Transcripts/2019-05-01-MichaelCa-MTR.pdf</a>.

Paul Manafort was working for an opposing party led by Ukraine's president at that time.

Around the year 2000 when head of the Presidential Administration Volodymyr Lytvyn allegedly recorded on tape discussing the need to silence a news reporter, Georgiy Gongadze, for his reports about high-level corruption. Gogadze's decapitated body was found in November 2000.

There is an old saying, ""Birds of a feather flock together."" Birds in Mr. Caputo's flock have nothing to do with expertise in health, science or disease control. They do display expertise in polishing the image of dictators and possibly making troublesome reporters disappear. It also looks like there is also considerable expertise in creating chaos and destroying our democratic institutions."
2020-09-14 18:10,"Everyone says “someone should do something,” but what should we do about this?"
2020-09-14 17:51,Why is Caputo still in office for his lies and trying to stir up trouble?  Are there any truthful people in the GOP anymore?
2020-09-14 17:55,"There's no other way to describe this except lunacy.  Obviously, Caputo is mentally unstable, and should seek help.  He admits as much.  But in this administration, he is given agency to advance outrageous lies and fabrication, so long as it feeds Trump's right-wing fringe base.  

This is beyond a cry for help.  It's time to cancel the Trump Show and send these clowns to the ash heap of history."
2020-09-14 17:57,"Mr Caputo needs a complete mental health evaluation, RIGHT NOW,  and pending its results he needs to be removed from any position of influence in the public arena."
2020-09-14 17:59,"Talking with a good friend of like minded politics yesterday and he told me he was going to prep and load all his guns for election day ""just in case"". 

I blew off his paranoia, but after reading this, I'm not too sure now."
2020-09-14 17:49,"""Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was harboring a “resistance unit” determined to undermine President Trump.""

So that's what we're calling ""Telling the truth"" these days?"
2020-09-14 17:55,"Just when we thought we would have a break from any outrageous and or irresponsible comments from trump “puppets”,
we get a “pop-up” on our IPads about this.
Removed from office? Absolutely NOT!  
Arrest him, jail him, hold without bail, for inciting violence.  
Coming just days after we learn that trump didn’t want to panic Americans by sharing  information on COVID, here we have an Assistant Secretary of HHS making inflammatory comments which are designed to create PANIC.
HHS Secretary Azar, who is his supervisor and had to sign off on these dangerous statements, needs to be subpoenaed by Congress to explain how he allowed this to happen on his “watch”!
Better yet, Azar needs to resign!"
2020-09-14 17:59,"This is very frightening.  Donald Trump is a seriously disturbed man and his sociopathy continues to be more evident and dangerous with each passing day.  Now we see the mental deterioration of one of his appointees.  I am deeply concerned about the deterioration of law and order in this country because trump and his sycophants increasingly encourage his base to violence.  If nothing is done to stop this very soon we're going to feel like we're living in the wild west.  We're already well on our way and I am, besides being frightened, deeply saddened."
2020-09-14 17:51,"He’s worried about Democrats “with guns” after the election?!?

Seriously, this is the kind of guy who walks in one day with a gun of his own and takes out the “disloyal scientists” for the “good of the country”. 

He needs to be removed before something really bad happens. He is NOT well."
2020-09-14 17:59,"Isn't it terrifying and bad enough when the president spouts such claims as hydroxychloroquine, disinfectant, UV light, blood plasma and the rush for vaccines to be ready 'very soon' but now his own appointed member of the DHHS accused ""career government scientists of “sedition” in their handling of the pandemic and warned that left-wing hit squads were preparing for armed insurrection after the election""?

Enough already with the insane statements, assertions, and predictions erupting on an almost daily basis from this administration.

If I did not know better, I would swear I was reading the latest edition of ""The Onion"".  But even those folks couldn't come up with stuff like this.  At least their ""news"" was funny, satirical and tongue-in-cheek.  This administration is totally serious with the fake news stories they continue to peddle."
2020-09-14 17:51,"Maybe this guy is having a breakdown, maybe he’s always been nuts or maybe he’s just a political stooge. It doesn’ really matter, what matters is the response of Trump and his cronies. If this guy gets any cover it’s an incitement of the base to violence: gin up a paranoid fear of insurrection by the left that can only be quashed by violence.

For fifty years Republican elites have promoted their only value - avoidance of any required contribution to the common good - by stoking racial fears and a sociopathic gun infatuation. In most ways I cannot think of anything worse than Trump winning the election, but in one important sense Trump losing the election might be the most traumatic thing that could happen to this country. It could be the perfect storm - the lunatics will be armed, angry and dangerous.

How have we come to this?"
2020-09-14 17:52,"In any other Administration, Caputo would be fired by the fired by the President immediately.  Here, he will get a promotion."
2020-09-14 18:07,This man needs to resign immediately or be fired. He is unfit to serve in the office he has and is a danger to civil society.￼
2020-09-14 18:09,"Caputo summed up his current status perfectly by stating that his “mental health has definitely failed”.  After reading this article, I must concur.  Should someone who is mentally unstable and unhealthy remain in a position of leadership in the Department of Health and Human Services?  Quelle ironie!"
2020-09-14 17:54,It may be time for Mr. Caputo (and the entire GOP) to take a nice long vacation.
2020-09-14 18:08,"On second read, this looks more like an audition to become a Fox ""news"" commentator, as the ultimate purveyor of victimhood.   But there are so many Trump officials riding the crazy train, it's hard to keep track."
2020-09-14 18:09,"This is very alarming.  They are setting the stage, projecting violence. Armed revolt? Yeah from the gun toting right. They’ve already started by probing fed agents into cities. Armed Militia parading through protests. 17 year old killers with illegal automatic weapons. This is very real folks."
2020-09-14 17:55,"This is the scariest article I've read in a long, long time. If Trump was a decent human being, he would immediately give him a leave of absence and set him up with a therapist to help him with his self-described mental problems."
2020-09-14 18:06,"Trump has placed conspiracy theorist political hacks at the highest levels of our government institutions. Conspiracy theorist political hacks who know nothing whatsoever, and care nothing whatsoever, about the work these institutions exist to perform."
2020-09-14 18:06,"It isn't surprising that Michael Caputo's political mentor was Roger Stone. Don't be surprised when ,rather than firing him, Trump places him in the Trump shrine to “Martyrs and Victims of the Deep State” otherwise know as “Alternative Fact World”."
2020-09-14 18:10,So this is what making America great again looks like.
2020-09-14 18:02,"Mr. Caputo admits that his ""mental health has definitely failed."" Yes, when someone spouts this kind of paranoid, conspiracy-laden pulp, that would suggest a mental health issue. Maybe he should take a leave of absence. While he's away, this administration will just carry on with the destructive game plan."

My former students are working on developing vaccines and novel treatments to combat SARS-CoV-2; others are in health care on the front lines.  Their common enemy is a virus.  I trust the science, not Mr. Trump nor Mr. Caputo.  I sincerely hope others realize that truth; sadly, I am very skeptical."
2020-09-14 18:08,"""Trump Health Aide Alleges Broad Conspiracies and Warns of Armed Revolt""

Oh yeah. That's the Trump administration in a nutshell alright.

That's just the kind of talk this country DOESN'T need soon before a presidential election.

But heck, that's probably why Caputo posted this on his personal Facebook page.

They folks have NOTHING on Nixon's bag of ""dirty tricks""."
2020-09-14 18:10,"This man needs therapy in a big way, or in a less sensitive observation he is nuts.

You know well that people who do not wish this country well - whether domestic or foreign - will repeat that they read in the NY Times that a cabal of sweat-pants wearing CDC scientists, coffee cups in hand, are ready to form ""hit squads.""  Please.  The only people who have taken arms against efforts to control this pandemic are the armed militias who harassed governors over quarantines and mask wearing.  Mr Caputo does not sound like a well person and yet, like Trump, credible newspapers report their yowling at the moon (""...the shadows on my ceiling..."") as if it is news.  It is really time for the nonsense to stop and people of good sense, regardless of party, need to get a grip and make sure our nation survives this nightmare."

2020-09-14 18:16,Mr Caputo is certainly right about on thing:  his “mental health has definitely failed.”

But please be steadfast and conduct yourselves with your usual high standards and integrity."
2020-09-14 18:15,This man is mentally ill and needs to be removed from his post. It should be done out of concern for his health and he should be ushered into professional treatment by the TRUMP administration. Right. How likely is that to happen?
2020-09-14 18:17,"Since Caputo admits his “mental health has definitely failed,” he should be placed on administrative leave until he can demonstrate he has recovered."
2020-09-14 18:12,"I can't decide if he's lost it, or if he's an operative with no conscience manipulating the masses. Either way, if this were a sane administration, he'd either be fired or put on medical leave, immediately."
2020-09-14 17:55,"The reporter needs to research Mr. Caputo in more depth. Just a few months ago, he was responsible for “outing” a private FB conversation between two Buffalo health PR officials. One of the women was fired from her position at Roswell Park Cancer Institute, thanks to Caputo claiming she had “anti-Trump” bias. In Caputo’s former role as a host on a local radio show, he often quoted QAnon conspiracies...I believe the WBEN archives its shows. He is beyond incompetent- he is a detriment to our public health system- formerly the envy of the world."

Nothing will cause panic more than these unfounded statements by a political hack spewing lies and hate. When did we become a third world nation?"
2020-09-14 18:16,"Trump has managed to staff much of the government with orange Kool-Aid drinking, tinfoil hat wearing QAnon types. He and they will do anything, literally anything, to try to hold onto power. November is going to be a very dangerous month when it becomes clear that Trump has lost both the Electoral College and the popular vote by large margins when all votes are counted. Big cities in the US may start looking like Minsk, Belarus, where a corrupt strongman desperately trying to hold onto power is confronted by massive demonstrations against him. But instead of security police confronting the demonstrators, it will be armed right wing vigilante militias that are answerable to no authority."

Just business as usual in this loathsome administration."
2020-09-14 18:05,"Crazy or not, this man is calling for an armed rebellion by the militias and Q fanatics. He's doing exactly what Trump was doing when he told his followers to vote twice - imagine the anti-mask nuts who scream at Walmart clerks screaming at poll workers on Nov. 3, which will cause chaos even if nobody gets killed. They should both be arrested for inciting violence and fomenting rebellion. Unfortunately, the damage is already done. And they'll do everything they can to make it worse."

2020-09-14 17:57,"You would do readers a great service if the newspaper framed this story with a moderately detailed report of Mr. Caputo's work history with Roger Stone, for Russia, and as a conspiracy theorist.   
A good question for a followup story is how much of this is preparation for something that comes next, versus indication of a mental breakdown for someone who has dealt in lies and misleading information for much of his professional life."
2020-09-14 17:58,"Trump and Trumpworld more and more resemble the insane ravings, intentional lies and brutal policies of so many two-bit dictators.

If the American people can't rise to the occasion--either in the Nov. 3 election or with whatever means is necessary to remove Trump and his henchman from power, we will have forfeited the legacy of democracy and good judgment left to us by the Founders.

Is that how we want our children and grandchildren to remember us?"
2020-09-14 17:59,"Mr. Caputo has been a political hack and fringe player in the Trump cult for years.

I'd prefer to think people like Caputo, Stone, and Trump are aberrations in the Limbaugh and Alex Jones mold, but I begin to think we are entering a time of The Wars of the Arrogants. And that it will be ugly."

2020-09-14 18:12,"Michael Caputo is reported to have worked in Russia for Gazprom, Yeltsin and Putin. Before this he was involved with Oliver North in Central America. It seems that anti-communist renegades in and out of the US government decided to go all in with Russian kleptocracy after the fall of the Soviet Union. Everywhere you look in Trump’s orbit there are people down with Russia. Even someone charged with helping Americans stay safe. 

Caputo apparently suppressed a report on COVID-19 at a children’s camp in Georgia. Children and others could have died as a result. How can this man be a friend of America? 

These facebook rantings sound crazy and dangerous. Can state-level law enforcement deal with this?"

2020-09-14 18:13,"Yes, this goes a bit beyond political overzealousness; this is a serious mental health breakdown.

It should be interesting to see how our president reacts. If President Trump's past behavior is any indication, he won't take decisive action to remove Capito. Instead, he will pooh-pooh the whole thing, and worst case somehow agree with him."

2020-09-14 18:17,"Just think about it: a senior administration official in a cabinet-level department is spouting off bizarre conspiracy theories while Republicans choose to ignore it and every other form of conspiracy theories. How far have we fallen since 2016?

Here's the sick irony: while Mr. Caputo and others believe they're aware and ""doing their own research"" (in QAnon parlance), they're actually completely duped by Russia's so-called ""Internet Security Agency,"" which has been enormously successful in creating and pushing inane conspiracy theories. 

Mr. Caputo isn't saving us from left-wing hit squads. Rather, he's an unwitting dupe of Putin."
2020-09-14 18:07,"I cannot believe that Mr. Caputo acted alone or without express permission from Trump. Very obviously, this is part of a plan to totally disrupt the election and dismiss the results if they are not in favor of Trump. We are on a dangerous path that will, unless stopped by the Republicans standing up for the country, lead to the implementation of a dictatorship by Trump and his minions which will lead to a bloody armed civil war. 

I am perhaps being an alarmist, so be it. What we see here is nothing less than the attempted overthrow of the lawfully established government by those in power in order to stay in power. 

We must speak up now or risk what I have stated will come to fruition."

2020-09-14 18:16,"And what in Caputo's background justifies his position as the president's ""health advisor""?

It seems to me he is as qualified to advise on public health as Jared Kushner is qualified to forge peace in the Mid-East, as qualified as Betsy DeVos is to serve as Education Secretary, as qualified as Rick Perry is to serve as Secretary of Energy, as qualified as Ben Carson is to serve as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, etc. etc. . . . which is to say, not qualified at all. And choosing completely incompetent people for these important posts is a recipe for disaster.

But I guess in Trump Administration, as long as you show the requisite loyalty and are willing to debase yourself in order to demonstrate that loyalty, then you'll get your turn at the trough."

No, there is no ""Deep State"" of anti-fascist conspirators inside the Government seeking to defend the Republic through Constitutional means. Would that there were!

In what world did Mr. Caputo discover that the left-wing is arming and forming militias? Has the National Rifle Association suddenly become a nest of Deep-State left-wing anti-fascist militias?

Does Mr. Caputo really believe his life is in danger from these make-believe and counter-factual left-wing Deep State plots? Does he really believe that scientific results showing the US with among the worst COVID performance of any developed nation, are not accurate? And are ginned up due to respected scientists at the pinnacle of their field of expertise, and lifetime civil servants, indulging in inexplicable, sudden, violent antipathy to Mr. Trump?

It behooves Mr. Caputo to seriously consider his position.

Threatening people and their families is not appropriate behavior from anyone no matter how frustrated and emotional things get. Mr. Caputo copies his boss and foments division. Lately I keep wondering should I get a gun, but I don't think I would be able to use it. I hate to see this current incarnation of America."

What happened to ""the best and the brightest""?

Instead, we get a Trump/GOP fascistic criminal corruption cabal?

These clowns have grossly underestimated the rage and pugilistic push back evolving within men and women like myself.  The aforementioned were never capable of competing with individuals like myself; the were outsmarted and talentless to begin with.  So, they lie and cheat.  But, not forever.  The majority doesn't simply disapprove of Trump and his cohorts, we want them in prison and penniless.  We want their lives destroyed.  I am a fighter.  Americans, are fighters.  These are losers and bullies who will soon face the fury of so many.  Sick of them.  I'll never forget, nor forgive.    

They killed tens of thousands, and that's just the choke cherry on top of a fascist coup.  Push back people!  Fight back!  It is ""ok"" to embrace your rage and to fight back in whatever form necessary-from confronting a selfish maskless Covid denier in a coffee shop, to all out war.  

Again, these small and small-minded criminals have underestimated men and women like me.  Rage and fury, focused and unrelenting, until they are all broke and broken."

If you see almost 200, 000 deaths 'on your ceiling', its on you—the American public are supposed to trust the Administration? Does that  number 200, 000 not mean anything to you or your leader? 

Obama and his Staff did due diligence and handed over what they needed for the new Administration to smoothly take the reins.

He's not only spouting conspiracy nonsense, he's sounds like he is actually gone insane and serious needs serious medical attention, now. this is scary.

It would be the first time someone starts hearing voices or gets paranoid someone is following them.

I worked with someone that everyone thought was a little strange making weird accusations, but as time went on, it became quite clear that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.

Michael Caputo has all the signs of someone who is suffering a serious mental illness and needs help."

They all said this was great leadership. But if it had been Obama?—""he should've known better, he's a criminal. Lock him up.""   So predictable and hypocritical.  Except that in this instance, 200 thousand people have died."

2020-09-14 18:21,"Trump should be charged with crimes against humanity for the way he has handled this pandemic.  He has outright lied to the American people, knowing full well the truth about the devastation this virus will cause to life and business.  He was warned in plenty of time to arrest this pandemic and save the lives of Americans.
Instead, he chose to lie and gather people together in places where they can come become infected.  His political gatherings across the country have cost people their lives because they follow nonsense like blind lambs.
There are consequences to this behavior for the people who follow him and for the lives of their families and friends.
Trump knows what he's doing and he is purposefully guiding people to their death.  
If a general led his troops into the line of fire, knowing the outcome, that general would be prosecuted and removed from his post and put in jail.  Most other countries would execute the person responsible for such thoughtless and careless behavior and possibly put to death.     
WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE."
2020-09-14 18:22,"As far as I can tell, ""said without evidence"" is the operative term in LaFraniere's article.  What LaFraniere implies but refuses to say, that Caputo was brought on to DHHS for expressly this reason. He is a liar's liar and propagandist in an administration full of the same.  LaFraniere should be asking why does this administration need such a coterie of liars expounding their unfounded conspiracy theories in each and every federal agency? The onslaught of lies and coordinated propaganda suggesting that Trump's opposition is preparing to take up arms should Trump win can mean only one thing and that is that the Republic is in real danger. Reporters should not just be recording the comments of people like Caputo, but informing readers of the danger posed by them."

If anyone is guilty of sedition, it's Caputo and his ilk. In this time of pandemic, they are undermining the Constitution and all that it stands for.

Enough is enough! Where is the outrage from Republican Senators and Representatives? It seems that it's they who have drunk the kool-aid."
2020-09-14 18:18,"Caputo, like  many other Trump appointees, does not have the background for the job and is not up to the task. Loyalty to Trump is not a positive resume characteristic for serving the citizens of this country. Since Caputo can't tolerate the cognitive dissonance of continuing to support Trump while  helping to control the virus, he has turned to crazy half baked conspiracy theories. Looks like he went down that rabbit hole and can't get out. Time for Caputo to ""spend more time with his family"". His exit will be a relief to the citizens he was supposed to serve."

Morally and ethically this has become a disaster within a disaster."
2020-09-14 18:19,"Judging by his comments, he has diagnosed himself correctly. I can only surmise that his mental health, like mine, has been diminished by overexposure to Donald Trump. There may be a magical cure in November!"

2020-09-14 18:20,"This seems to be in part, the result of rage and frustration that results from the stubborn resistance that scientific facts have to being molded and re-fashioned for political purposes.

They must be the cause, the subversive agents"
2020-09-14 18:22,Michael Caputo's capstone career accomplishment was as adviser to Boris Yeltsin. and Vladimir Putin.  He is apparently striving to match his previous success with authoritarian leadership.

This man is clearly delusional. And dangerous:

“And when Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin,” he said. “The drills that you’ve seen are nothing.” He added: “If you carry guns, buy ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it’s going to be hard to get.”

He is inciting others to riot. This is directed at the most thuggish, ignorant, dangerous among us: the idiots in short pants and helmets, carrying AR-15s and looking for reasons to shoot fellow citizens. 

If there is anyone in Washington with the brains God gave them, get this lunatic to the hospital. ASAP!!!"

And worse,history tells us that this all occurred while Republican President Eisenhower watched passively from the sidelines, when at any time he could have put a stop to this witch hunt by publicly denouncing McCarthy.

 In fact It was only after McCarthy convened the infamous 1953 McCarthy-Army hearings where he attacked the US Army itself as being infiltrated by Communists  and Fellow Travelers was Eisenhower prompted to denounce McCarthy, and begin to actively  work to put a halt to Tail Gunnar Joe's pogrom of loyal Americans.

Faint hope however that this current Republican President Trump will step-in to put a halt to Michael Caputo's reenactment of the McCarthyite insanity of the 50's, since he himself has never shown an ounce of restraint when it comes to denouncing  alleged, ""Traitors and losers""- And apparently  even including our military in his pitiful assessments."

They want power at all costs including the very lives of our citizens and our country's badly damaged democracy.  I've often heard that all the constitutional guardrails have failed and so it seems that is true.  But the ultimate guardrail, the one that matters the most, is the voters.  Ultimately democracy rests with them.  No excuses, no magical thoughts, no evading responsibility with false equivalency arguments.  For God sake just vote and vote these sick depraved tyrants out of power at all levels of government!"

And willful silence when targeted-outrage,volcanic in its expression, is what is needed. In order to neutralize the daily challenges to mutual trust. To mutual respect. To the rape of generalizable facts. The ravishing of Truths; principles of  injured Democracy. Flawed tho’ it be. 
This man’s fear-mongering, conspiracy-lies, and the implications and outcomes of his actions, in his position, serve to divide a divided nation even further.

Imagine the embarrassment a competent leader would feel having a communications manager in a crucial government position during a deadly pandemic warning citizens to stock ammunition for the upcoming war. It is clearly deranged thinking and most certainly illegal. The remarkable thing is that with all the daily madness happening in this administration it quickly becomes a smaller sideline story in the grand scandal of unnecessary death that blankets the nation’s grasp on reality.

Violence never solves anything.  It only brings grief and destruction.  Instead of going about spreading conspiracy theories, without a shred of evidence, if he loves this country he will do everything in his power to quell such talk.

European fascism of the last century produced the most widespread, murderous carnage in human history. The point of Fascism is to create enmity to justify wanton bloodshed for the purpose of intimidation and total control. Fomenting hate and killing is what fascists do for a living.

And they will do it here, given half the chance, putting truth to Edmund Burke's warning, ""When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.""

Trump's tweets usually have a micron-thin veil over their violent rhetoric. This is fully naked, and from a high-level communications position over the agencies that fund  and perform lifesaving research.

I agree.  Indeed, an inability to distinguish truth from falsehoods and an affinity for nonsense over common sense would seem to be prerequisites for service in the Trump Administration.

Mr. Caputo on Sunday complained on Facebook that he was under siege by the media and said that his physical health was in question and his “mental health has definitely failed.”

The last part of the previous paragraph says it all.

“I don’t like being alone in Washington,” he said, describing “shadows on the ceiling in my apartment, there alone, shadows are so long.” He then ran through a series of conspiracy theories, culminating in a prediction that Mr. Trump will win re-election but his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., will refuse to concede.

“And when Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin,” he said. “The drills that you’ve seen are nothing.” He added: “If you carry guns, buy ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it’s going to be hard to get.”"

He'll get ego-stroked and lauded by those who do believe his violence-inciting propaganda, and that, just like his idol Donald Trump, is exactly what he wants.

He mentions the Portland man who killed an alt-right protestor, but he failed to mention the dozens who have been killed by his wonderful alt-right base---from innocent church-goers, to a young woman run over by their car, to three innocent good samaritans stabbed to death on a bus, and many others beaten and attacked.

Caputo was appointed, not to command a proper management strategy of his office, but as an unqualified apparatchik to leverage his position into a propaganda platform to aid his party's reelection--the accompanying lies obviously give him no shame, begging the question, what terrible, low-life, immoral, deceitful act is he likewise capable of?"

No, he impresses me as a very paranoid individual, perhpas psychotic, with delusions.  On the other hand, he seems to seek out an armed rebellion, with the conservatives protecting America from the left wing mobs who have trained for an insurrection.

2020-09-14 18:44,"I had a brilliant psychiatry professor in medical school who started his year long class when we were second year students, saying: “Nothing, and I mean nothing, shocks me when it comes to human behavior.”  Well, I’ve agreed with him throughout my life, but the  “behavior” reported here is very close to crossing that line. My blood pressure surely shot up reading this so deeply distressing article."

2020-09-14 18:43,"Headline: A High Government Official in Washington Starts Babbling Nonsense

In all my years in and around DC and the federal government, I have never heard nor read anything more clearly indicating a public mental breakdown that the words of Michael Caputo. ""I don't like being alone in Washington...(the) shadows on the ceiling of my apartment, there alone, shadows that are so long,"" Is this from a novel or movie?

His ranting about possible violence and shooting seems like he is laying the groundwork for wish fulfillment, begging for violence to come to the nation. One doesn't know whether to feel more sorry for Caputo or for our country that a man such as this has a public forum and can say anything that will be multiplied 10,000 times and repeated. We are in deep trouble and need to hold steady to our own thoughts and emotions to avoid be swayed by public madness."
2020-09-14 18:45,"Mr. Caputo is right only about one thing: His ""mental health has failed"" (his words). What HE is saying is sedition, inciting people to bring down the government--not the made-up conspiracy he is promoting. In addition, why didn't Facebook stop this video and its re-posting?? It is hard to believe, extremely sad, and very dangerous, that administration officials think and behave this way. How can we continue to trust the medical information from the CDC? The pandemic is bad enough, but not having a reliable source of information is a death-knell, in more ways than one."
2020-09-14 18:44,"This is an extremely sad and poignant situation.  The man is having a mental health breakdown, pure and simple.  He really, really needs medical assistance and intervention."
2020-09-14 18:45,"Where is Facebook in all of this?  Has it no responsibility in keeping baseless conspiracy theories off its platform? Bob Woodward revealed the President’s reason for downplaying the virus in order to prevent panic.  You can believe that or not. But,  what Caputo is doing here with the help of Facebook is not only going to create panic, but foster armed insurrection and mayhem in our streets. Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg should be held responsible for any violence that occurs."
2020-09-14 18:47,"Ah yes ... the calming effect of the Trump Administration.  Frighten, scare and misinform the American public to gain politically.  Does the demonizing of anyone who disagrees you seem familiar to anybody?  One only needs to look at the period between WWI and WWII to find these types of tactics employed in Europe.  These times are indeed scary."
2020-09-14 18:48,"I feel so sorry for Michael Caputo. I have no doubt that he is suffering great anguish. I hope he is able to find help before he loses it completely. If he really believes that the scientists at the CDC are really sacrificing American lives to overthrow trump   I suggest he may be beyond the verge. Also,why would anyone need to kill Caputo?  Frankly, to me this whole thing sounds nuts."
2020-09-14 18:48,Caputo really did work for Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin. Now he is a highly ranked supporter of Trump spouting bizarre conspiracy theories. It is so obvious that he is still working for Putin. His primary assignment from Putin is to wreck the credibility of the CDC.
2020-09-14 18:47,"This is a truly alarming, indeed terrifying,  account of the   psychological meltdown of yet another person appointed to the  Trump administration not for his expertise and experience,  but  for his perceived  ""'no matter what"" loyalty to the boss.   Now faced with  the deluge of protests about the  Trump administration's  politicizing and denigrating of  the health and science professionals upon whom our safety depends (and surely his own  painful awareness of the  vast. increasing  number of infected and dying fellow citizens), he is caught between his  veneration for Trump and the realities of the out of control situation  and violence and national uproar that Trump's behavior has caused.    The emotional tone  and Facebook messaging of his comments  are that of a desperate person who has become paranoid himself, fostered by Trump's ""sympathy""  instead of any effort to get him the help he needs.  He should be removed from his job immediately, which should be a  relief to him as he himself has said that his ""mental health has definitely failed."" The source of his problem is not the reason he thinks."
2020-09-14 18:46,"It took me a few minutes, but I figured it out.  He puts out insane nonsense in the hopes that it will cause the usual excitement in TrumpWorld.  But he has already provided his justification for being unhinged:  “mental health has definitely failed"" due to being ""under siege by the media"".  A very familiar chapter in the playbook--say outrageous things, blame someone else.  Ultimately, it's all Hillary's fault."
2020-09-14 18:48,"The frightening thing about Caputo’s FB diatribe is that a fair amount of like-minded people will believe and agree with him. 

A couple of questions: 
He said people who had threatened his family and him had been imprisoned. Who are these people and what were the threats? 
Why didn’t someone at FB stop this rant when Caputo was live? And is this still up? (Knowing FB’s algorithms I’ll be inundated with pro-Trump fringe craziness if I search.)"

Let us remember: THEY ARE THE ONES IN CHARGE! They talk like people who are somehow being persecuted, but they actually are in the offices that are tasked with doing something! 

They are like the man caught in the motel cheating on his wife: ""Who you gonna believe? Me, or your lying eyes?""  

The only thing worse than the fact that people are buying into this obvious set of lies, is how pathetic and lame they all are. 

Conservative America: you are being used! These people don't care about you. They are not on your side. They are lying to you, and they expect you to thank them and salute while they steal your future and laugh about you on their private jets!

“And when Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin,” he said. “The drills that you’ve seen are nothing.” He added: “If you carry guns, buy ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it’s going to be hard to get.”

The fact that Caputo's unsubstantiated claims have gone on without one peep from the GOP speaks volumes.

It's this kind of dangerous and uncorroborated rhetoric that could lead to serious consequences.

The fact that neither Trump or anyone from his administration are denying nor critical of Caputo's claims is extremely alarming and unsettling.

How else can one explain how one cluster within our culture believes so profoundly radical narratives than the other? If this divergence is marked by survival of the fittest, then conservatism must be doomed to extinction, but, terrifyingly, at what cost?

It’s sickening how conservatives can profess faith, a devotion to the sanctity of the unborn foetus, and a strict moral compass when they routinely abandon that foetus at birth and urge people to stock up on ammunition. What kind of animals are these? Surely, they occupy no natural niche in evolution?"
2020-09-14 18:58,Caputo must be doing a great job editing that M and M report because he needs to be sent home from work immediately. Please also stop his access to the federal computer system while he is on sick leave.
2020-09-14 18:49,"The resistance unit is real of course because it is composed of    every person who follows reality  and there are far too many of those types in the CDC for Trumps comfort . Trump is desperate and is demanding that his staff be  more and more removed from reality with every passing day. They in turn for various reasons feel compelled to pass his demands onto others. Trump has developed a talent for sniffing out the weak ones and bending them to his will. 
    What will become of him should he lose the election? He faces endless indictments which could bring decades of prison time. Putin will not accept him in exile but Kim Jong Un might find him useful not so much as a bargaining chip but more as a trophy to exhibit to his people. Trump would of course be glad to tell the North Korean people how terrible everything is in the western workers nightmare and how fortunate they are to be living under Kim."
2020-09-14 18:59,It was already scary; now it's getting terrifying.
2020-09-14 19:00,"Mr. Caputo said that his “mental health has definitely failed.”

I agree.  He was hired  a Trump campaign, then managing director of Zepplin Communications in Buffalo.  No medical or public health experience, yet he is in charge of arguably the most important US report of the pandemic—in charge of air-brushing it to be more in line with the President’s agenda.  In other words, to make it into something it is not.  To make it into a lie.  Yet this is not what he believes is the cause of his problem.  I disagree.

His tribulations occurred during the Mueller investigations, and, I think, the questioning from the House.  He wrote a piece for Politico last year.

<a href=""https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/03/28/mueller-investigation-michael-caputo-trump-first-person-226336"" target=""_blank"">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/03/28/mueller-investigation-michael-caputo-trump-first-person-226336</a>

He came back from working with Zepplin, apparently.  Alone.  I am truly concerned with his mental and spiritual health.  And even more concerned that he is in a position of power."
2020-09-14 18:49,"And where is Facebook on this?  Assuming this report is correct (I don't use Facebook for many very obvious reasons), it certainly seems to violate their rule about spreading misinformation about elections, and probably a few others, namely inciting violence."
2020-09-14 18:54,"Wow. Is this a joke?
 
Some 60 years ago, Bill Buckley understood that for conservatism to remain respectable and grow, it needed to exile the John Birch members and the others on the extreme right, who saw conspiracies and Communists everywhere. Today, those on the far right are now entrenched in power, and there are few views too extreme to warrant exile from the conservative movement. Indeed, when the extreme on the right utter the outrageous, supposedly responsible ""conservatives"" in prominent places--public office and the media--remain silent, and thus complicit, because of fear they will be exiled.
 
I will add that a similar problem has arisen in recent years on the left with too many progressives refusing to condemn  crazy talk on the far left. But this is on a very different level because this is a top official in DHHS talking about conspiracies and preparing for the revolution. Wow."
2020-09-14 18:56,Suggest two things for Mr. Caputo. Do a quick study of public administration ethical standards so he better understands the perspective of CDC employees and how they do their work. Then consult employees of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration for a referral. Seems like he needs to consult a mental health professional.
2020-09-14 18:50,"I object to the characterization of Caputo, who has absolutely no health related credential, as a health aide.  Caputo is a political flack (or hack if you prefer.)  I would challenge him to read any of the data and try to explain the methods, conclusions, etc."

And after this article on Caputo who has no health experience. Let's watch how other swing states start reporting cases or should we say lack of them. If you don't test you don't have the cases or the deaths Trump told us."

2020-09-14 18:59,"We must remember that Caputo is an associate of Roger Stone, the same Roger Stone who is a convicted felon and someone who is linked to the Russian 2016 disinformation campaign. In his heart of hearts, like most Trump allies, there beats an authoritarian. Caputo will do and say anything that will further Trumpism, and indirectly, Putinism. He doesn't care how many Americans will die, just as long as the Trump lies continue unabated. If there is an enemy of the people, as Trump allies claim, it is Michael Caputo and his fellow minions that further deadly lies that threaten the safety of all Americans. But this is not new, Stalin did the same with T. D. Lysenko, with similar results. Remember the words of William Faulkner, ""The past is never dead. It's not even past."""

Don't these people have access to mental health services? Are they not compelled to seek help when they have a public breakdown like this?
At least he can go outside."
2020-09-14 18:52,"In present day America, this fellow's accusations will be given equal respect to those of the scientists he attacks.  The Times reports what he says in a neutral manner.  The scientists can be replaced by other scientists who agree with Donald Trump.  As we discovered recently, Trump added a medical advisor from Stanford, Dr. Atlas, countering Dr. Fauci, who agrees that masks shouldn't be required because evidence they help is lacking; also with social distancing, not needed.  That numerous Stanford faculty wrote a harsh criticism of Atlas, has not been given sufficient notice in the press."
2020-09-14 19:01,This seems like a good time to ask why we have a Canadian involved in messing with the CDC's reports?  Aren't there enough dubious stooges in our own country?  I would have said there were more than enough.

2020-09-14 19:02,"Mr. Caputo needs an intervention, but since nobody has stepped up in four years to intervene with Trump, that’s not going to happen.

As to armed insurrection, I do think we need to be prepared.  Trump has been setting the stage for many months.  Encouraging chants of “Lock him up!” directed at Obama Is just his latest effort to get his delusional followers riled up.  He has said that if he loses, that will prove that the election was rigged.  

Bannon stated it. He said that Trump wants to destroy our entire system of government. “Blow it up” was the phrase, I believe.  I foresee armed and violent Trumpists in the streets.  Four years ago, that would have been impossible to imagine.  Now, it’s ever so plausible, even predictable.  Dear God.  What has happened to our country?"
2020-09-14 19:02,It's sad and alarming when we can't tell whether this senior government official is suffering from ideological extremism or mental illness.
2020-09-14 19:03,"Someone needs to inform Mr. Caputo - preferably as they're leading him away in handcuffs - that we should only expect to see ""hit squads"" in some unimaginable dystopian America of his boss' imagining. Speaking of his boss, they could add that given Trump's kill record to date from COVID alone, his concern for his own welfare is hilariously, unsurprisingly, and tragically misplaced."
2020-09-14 19:03,"Either Mr. Caputo is having a very public mental health crisis and should be on medical leave, or he is still working on contract with Putin...or perhaps both?

2020-09-14 19:04,"I am in solid agreement with Mr. Caputo on at least one assertion he makes.  Indeed, the evidence for it is stated in clear terms in his longer message:  His mental health is in wild disarray."

2020-09-14 19:06,"Is it not relevant to point out that Caputo has deep ties  to both Ukraine and the Kremlin? I know we’re not supposed to notice the symbiotic relationship between the Trump admin and Moscow for fear of being labeled conspiracy theorists, but it seems painfully obvious that they have been employing propaganda/disinformation tactics straight out of Putin’s playbook."
2020-09-14 19:06,"Mr. Caputo acknowledges that his “mental health has definitely failed.” That bit of self-awareness confirms what has been long suspected. Perhaps this public blossoming of his condition will result in his receiving good health treatment aimed at a good recovery, and meanwhile his dangerous and inflammatory paranoia can be removed from the nation's health policy and management arena. It has been a politically and ideologically motivated toxic cancer. I wish him well, I wish our nation well."
2020-09-14 19:01,Why isn't Caputo asking how it is Trump has know for more nearly EIGHT months SARS-CoV-2 is airborne and didn't think it important to warn the world let alone the nation he swore an oath to protect?
2020-09-14 19:05,"A person is online clearly having a serious mental health crisis. He's got the list of symptoms others have mentioned and is in great pain and distress. It's important enough to repeat - his friends and family should work hard to get him skilled care quickly, just like anyone else who is having a severe MH need."
2020-09-14 19:01,The wildfires of lunacy are spreading out of control in the tinder-dry brain-forests of Trump's henchmen.

2020-09-14 19:03,"Another example of Trump’s calming effect and effort not to panic the country! 

Trump is the consummate liar who peddles fear, division and authoritarianism as if they were Trump steaks. As a psychiatrist and student of human behavior, I believe Mary Trump is correct: The Donald has no morality and is totally incapable of experiencing guilt because he has no conscience. Trump’s motivation is limited to how much money and fame he can grab for himself. This explains Trump’s foolish decision to be extensively interviewed by Bob Woodward. He thought it would bring him fame. Instead it confirms that he is a moron, and hopefully will aide in ending his presidency."

2020-09-14 19:02,Caputo should be fired at once and I can't imagine why anybody would hire him in the future.  This Trump inspired insanity has to stop.  When will the Republican party stop turning a blind eye to this president's reign of insanity?  When they're destroyed?

Mr. Caputo continued his social media effort after the Facebook event, retweeting a conspiratorial post that hinted with no evidence that armed camps were being established in Washington, D.C.: “Occupants don’t look like vagrants. Looks like forward basing for militant street ops,” J. Michael Waller, a conservative provocateur, posted.

Our Democracy is doomed IF we do not overwhelmingly DEFEAT trump and republican candidates in November.  Never before in modern American history has an election been more critical.

The Health and Human Services Department should be able to find another spokesperson who would be willing to lie for Trump who is not currently suffering from mental illness. There are at least three former White House press secretaries who fit in quite nicely, although one never actually held a briefing, another enjoys dressing like a demented cucumber while dancing, and the third fancies herself as the next governor of her state.

2020-09-14 19:16,"Like Trump’s rantings grounded in half truths or tiny kernals of truth, Caputo’s disturbed fears do portend the possible chaos which a Trump victory may unleash...particularly if the victory is steeped in voter suppression, discarding of mail in ballots and the cessation of counting ballots via a Bush v, Gore-like Supreme Court decision.
It is Trump and his lackeys like Caputo, who are planting the seeds for post election mayhem by denigrating the electoral process and seeking victory through voter suppression, local legislation and court challenges. Creating doubt about the findings  and statements from non-partisan CDC scientists is in line with Trump’s campaign against our expert bureaucracy and creating doubt on the veracity of inconvenient facts. The most devastating of those inconvenient facts for Trump will be his defeat in November, and he intends to use all means to avoid facing defeat. If he succeeds....Caputo correctly predicts, people will not be happy."

During that time of saving us from panic he spent over two months calling the virus a democratic hoax and fake news. Now his political henchmen are busy trying to tear down the scientist and doctors of the CDC because they aren't agreeing to abide by trump's administration alternative reality. Because they aren't staying quiet and allowing trump's campaign for President to be in control of the virus vaccine or keeping quiet while the President disregards the safety of the American people by holding crowded indoor rallies devoid of masks during this deadly pandemic. Reminds me exactly of the communist party who put representatives in every branch of government as spies and spokesmen for their communist leader!"

Donald Trump is a real menace to the true republican values of freedom and justice FOR ALL.

The fact that Caputo is allowed to make such alarming claims on Facebook while Trump and every Republican law maker remains silent is a clear indication of this administration out of control and running purely on fumes.

Half of me thinks its a classic Trump ploy to garner more distrust and fear towards Democrats while the other half of me honestly believes that Caputo believes what he is saying.

This kind of reckless rhetoric all began when Trump claimed he could ""stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody"" and not be prosecuted.

Just when I thought these times could not become any more dangerous . . .

They would like nothing better if Trump loses the election to have the hate groups, most importantly the militia groups come and surround the White House possibly firing at citizens and starting a conflict to keep Trump physically there. A perfect example to ready the troops is Trump’s open hostility directed toward the military leadership and suggesting the rank & file do not like them. He implies that they might have to do something.  If things look bleak, he will declare victory before all results have been tabulated the night of the election. Trump for his part will scream that he is being wrongfully removed from office. This type of foreshadow has been going on almost since the day Trump assumed power. Of course, Caputo and others have been trying to build their fictional case against the rest of us to justify anything that may happen while negating blame for their actions. Just refer to Mr. Law & Order telling North Carolinians to vote twice, in violation of the law. And Barr supporting this crime by his untrue misrepresentation of voter fraud which is almost nonexistent.  Anyone who still questions whether we have a dictator and his junta in Washington, lives in an alternate universe along with the rest of those who are complicit in the crimes of this so-called “law and order” President."

There is a hysteria out there in far right America beyond Mr. Caputo who seems dark shadows on his ceiling at night. A total disconnect. We are suffering from fires out here in rural Oregon, and we are getting a taste of the craziness first hand as  armed citizens set up road blocks in the burned wilderness, expecting somehow looters from the peaceful urban BLM movement to invade their smoldering towns and steal their ash covered television sets or their supply of elk jerky. 

Some of the citizens of the burnt out areas when interviewed on local tv? 'We stick together, our community will rebuild.' What they fail to acknowledge is that it is the urban tax base that will rebuild their schools, fire departments, fair grounds, power-grid and melted roadways.

I don't have a problem with helping these fellow Oregonians. It would be nice if just one of them acknowledged their blessed leader Trump's complicity with global warming. Or even mentioned global warming.

By the way, Is there still a Secretary of the Interior? Or is David L. Bernhardt also in his bunker staring at the ceiling?"

1) absolute, unquestioning, deaf, dumb, and blind  adherence to trump's every whim, desire, and tweet
2) only the most grossly incompetent need apply lest we make the stable genius look bad in comparison

Now we have a senior trump official finally admit what we've all known for a long time, referring to himself

The November election is a make or break event for America's democratic experiment.  And Biden and the Democrats must not only win the popular vote, but they must also overcome the systemic bias in favor of red states (affecting both the Senate and the Presidency), the inherent advantage of the incumbent, the racist GOP gangsters unquestioning loyalty to their mob boss, the GOP propaganda TV network (Faux Noise), the undermining of the US Postal Service and mail-in voting in general and the incessant cheating by Trump, which started with the extortion of the Ukrainian president and the smearing of Joe Biden.

So it might be reviewing what else he said, to see if it contains any grain of truth. Consider this: ""When Donald Trump refuses to stand down...the shooting will begin."" That may prove to be true as well. Is America ready for that contingency?

It is remarkable that the administration would issue statements backing Mr. Caputo after he said what he did. He threw them a lifeline by admitting he was unstable. He said he didn't want to talk about death any more. He said he doesn't like being alone in Washington. 

But instead of pushing him out, as quietly as possible, citing those comments, the White House lauded him. That shows how far gone the administration is as well.

Finally, what he ran through was most certainly not ""a series of conspiracy theories""--or any sort of theories. It was crazy fantasies with no evidentiary basis whatsoever."

Overthrow the government?  Oppressed people have a right of revolution. In political philosophy, the right of revolution (or right of rebellion) is the right or duty of the people of a nation to overthrow a government that acts against their common interests and/or threatens the safety of the people without cause.

I have watched Trump and his administration for almost four years engaging in conduct I regard as threatening the safety of the people; Mr. Trump’s conduct with respect to the deadly coronavirus is just one example.  No one has risen up to overthrow the government; we have the U.S. Constitution which we hold sacrosanct.  We are willing to wait to vote our disapproval or approval for how Mr. Trump leads our nation.

Sedition?  Really?  Sedition is overt conduct, such as speech and organization, that tends toward insurrection against the established order. Sedition often includes subversion of a constitution and incitement of discontent toward, or resistance against, established authority.

What is going on in Trump’s administration to cause this kind of behavior?"

2020-09-14 19:39,"Then why has he not notified the DOJ of these seditious people as this could be criminal behavior.  If he didn’t then he would not be upholding his oath of office, which is criminal."
2020-09-14 19:33,"When will the media stop tip-toeing around the truth in an attempt to play nice with these people and start calling out the lies? This is not misinformation. This man is inciting deadly violence.  

Fauci, Birx, Redfield - the entire medical community - should loudly demand his resignation or submit theirs.  Caputo and trump are fanning the flames of an America already burning.  It's high time the medical establishment and media yelled fire."
2020-09-14 19:39,"And what happens when all this rhetoric about conspiracies, civil war, and having to shoot crazed, lawless Democrats brought about by a close election does come to pass. Will it be the Democrat's fault. The Democrats have obeyed the laws of the country allowing serious unconstitutional lawbreaking by the Trump administration for 4 years. Why would Democrats turn away from the law to act like the Trump supporters? Trump wants civil war if he loses. And he'll get it."
2020-09-14 19:34,"Wow this the guy in charge of a $250 million public service advertising campaign intended to help America to get back to normal?  Holy moly if his Facebook remarks are intended to reassure us that all is “normal,” does that sound like $250 million well spent?  We are in so deep... 
Gosh.  I feel so much better now we are in such good hands."
2020-09-14 19:36,"Will FOX report on this? If so, what is the spin they will put on it for all those who use FOX as their main source of news?"
2020-09-14 19:40,"“shadows on the ceiling in my apartment, there alone, shadows are so long.”
“If you carry guns, buy ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it’s going to be hard to get.”
sounds like coming out of a ""manifesto"" by a lunatic and not from the assistant secretary of public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services."
2020-09-14 19:45,"Caputo's concession that since coming to Washington his “mental health has definitely failed” is the only reliable statement he  has made. Clearly he is undergoing a mental breakdown.
Under any sane administration, Trump would announce that Caputo was leaving Washington to ""spend more time with his family."" Instead, I fear, Caputo's paranoia could become a Trumpworld pandemic."
2020-09-14 19:32,"I honestly believe that Mr. Caputo and Donald Trump want to provoke an insurrection. It'll help to fire up the base. It'll play well politically for them. There's nothing like a self-fulfilling prophecy to stoke the flames of social chaos and the calls for law and order. It's one of the oldest tricks in the dictator's playbook.The Reichstag Fire comes to mind. In fact, the current Western fires are being cooked up by internet propagandists as a left-wing, anarchist plot against Trump."
2020-09-14 19:34,In any other administration he'd already be out of a job. In the Trump administration he'll probably be promoted.
2020-09-14 19:45,"In Trump's deranged  psyche what he means by ""deep state""  is the cabal of  dedicated, intelligent,  educated and experienced civil servants, military leaders,  scientists, academics, teachers,  doctors, lawyers,  and other professionals from every walk of life who share the dream of a better world, and  meantime hold the country together.    
Yes,  their tentacles are everywhere, and yes,  fortunately, they have  infiltrated every corner of the military industrial complex, and with the complete failure of politicians and religious leaders of every persuasion, who either don't want to or find themselves powerless to do anything about it,  short of military intervention they are the only vanguard between a democratic civilization and a psychotic totalitarian state.
Little wonder he feverishly wants to root them out and destroy them."
2020-09-14 19:32,"""Mr. Caputo said Monday, “Since joining the administration my family and I have been continually threatened” and harassed by people who have later been prosecuted. ""

Have to wonder if there is a reporter out there checking into this. Odds are very good this is a lie.

This guy he is straight out of Putin's camp.

Wonder how many more of Putin's guys Trump has put into our government right under our very noses and it seems with the ""Ok"" of the republicans."
2020-09-14 19:37,"Ms. LaFraniere, without evidence, states that Mr. Caputo neglects to provide evidence for his paranoid claims about a ""deep state"" conspiracy to undermine President Trump. The ""without evidence"" phrase seems to surface in very NYT article about Mr. Trump or his administration, which in turn suggests to readers that anything the administration says is baseless or false or misleading or lacks credibility. However, to my mind it even more potently telegraphs that the journalist is stepping outside the bounds of honest reporting and inserting personal bias/opinion into what is advertised as a straightforward news story. May I politely suggest that the NYT keep the ""without evidence"" phrase in the opinion pages and simply offer the facts elsewhere. Thank you."
2020-09-14 19:39,This is outrageous.  There is no place in federal service for this sort of behavior.  This man needs to resign and then seek medical assistance for his delusions and paranoia.
2020-09-14 19:43,Keep in mind this is this lunacy is not limited to Caputo. It infects the entire Republican party.  The fact that an entire party believes in dangerous falsehoods and delusions is how we got where we are now.
2020-09-14 19:44,"Can someone in DC please call the cops and request a daily wellness check on Caputo? He could be a danger to himself and others, and I'd hate to see him end up pushing a shopping cart around DC fleeing from the long shadows."
2020-09-14 19:45,"If my rural PA town is anything to go by, I proclaim that it is the extreme right who is training for insurgence in case Biden wins.  We have gangs on pick-up trucks with giant flags, from Trump to eagles and the American flag, dressed in army gear, like some American version of ISIS. Together with bikers, and a guy with a vintage army truck, they drive around with the  intent to intimidate and bully. This is 73 miles outside NYC and on the borders of NJ and NY!"
2020-09-14 19:34,I am sorry for the mental break down that Mr. Caputo is now suffering. I suggest he resign or be fired immediately. But both Dems and Reps have to stand up and speak out to get this done.
2020-09-14 19:34,"Another example of puring gasoline upon a fire. Sounds like a cry for help on his part, but as it plays into Trump strategy, I doubt any help will be found within the administration. Sad on so many levels."
2020-09-14 19:41,"One part of this stands out for Caputo's incredible frankness and honesty when he says that his “mental health has definitely failed.”
What more needs to be said?!"
2020-09-14 19:41,He should be forced to resign immediately.  In any....other....administration this wouldn’t have even made it to the press. The headline instead would have been “Trump Health Aid Resigns Following Outlandish Remarks” and the body of the article would have been about the WH apologies to the American people and processes for better vetting of officials.
2020-09-14 19:42,"If indeed this man believes what he says and says what he believes then as a licensed mental health professional I would say (and it is the feeling I had reading this piece) that he is under so much stress that he is delusional and having a psychotic break.  If it's an act then he should be arrested for spreading falsehoods, period."
2020-09-14 19:32,"Caputo needs to be relieved of his job immediately. No public official should be permitted to use their position in government as a megaphone to broadcast unsubstantiated, dangerous rumor mongering."
2020-09-14 19:40,"The most frightening thing is that we don't know how many people actually believe these most bizarre statement from Mr. Caputo.  Are they a minority of true believers? what constitutes a minority of believers anyway?  30 percent?  40? if it is either of those numbers, that's still pretty substantive and down right frightening.  

For that matter, does Mr. Caputo even for himself believe the things he says? or is there some other end game going on  here?  

And yet, the only word I can think of to describe it is frightening."
2020-09-14 19:35,"Yes even Trump officials engage in fear mongering & propaganda, key traits in the formation of dictatorship.
It seems unlikely the 'radical left' would come out armed, and far more likely that despite the outcome of the election, whatever that may be, that the right will come out armed."
2020-09-14 19:40,"Just Theater? Or, fire in a crowded theater?"
2020-09-14 19:43,"Is this a distraction from the pandemic? the fires? 
Is this an election focused strategy?
Is this a mental health crisis in full-view, real-time?

The only honorable, patriotic, and humane response is for his boss to clearly, publicly and loudly disavow Caputo's statements, relieve him of his responsibilities, and encourage him to receive treatment."
2020-09-14 19:46,"Never could I imagine such circus.
At first I thought education was in short supply everywhere I looked, then I thought common sense got lost, now I realise the country has non trivial general mental health issues.
Do we really have Facebook and similar to thank for this involution of mankind?"
2020-09-14 19:46,Caputo sounds like he’s had a very serious breakdown. He needs to be removed as soon as possible. I fear we’ll have to wait until Election Day.
2020-09-14 19:32,Something has come out or will come out today that needs deflection. Otherwise we have little  left of the state of reality if someone working in a high position in our government is inciting to violence.
2020-09-14 19:40,"""Mr. Caputo on Sunday complained on Facebook that he was under siege by the media and said that his ... “mental health has definitely failed.”

And here we have exhibit A for his failing mental health - he is becoming delusional. He should take a leave of absence; he is endangering the country if he cannot tell fantasy from reality."
2020-09-14 19:40,"There  are no words to describe the madness this Trump appointee  is expressing. He needs to take a leave of absence from his job and check himself in or be checked in involuntarily, to a facility that treats people suffering delusions and other dangerous mental conditions. He is clearly a danger to himself and others."
2020-09-14 19:34,"Mr. Caputo is deeply troubled.  And, that is the best case scenario. If he isn't deeply troubled then he is doing this deliberately for the purpose of fomenting conflict and division.

If he is falling apart, then give him a leave from his job and get him some help.  If he is doing this deliberately, then he is a threat do the republic and should be managed as such."
2020-09-14 19:42,"Unfortunately, there is more than a grain of truth with people who feel that people are ""out to get them"". Paranoid people tend to go out of their way alienate others, have very sharp elbows, are often quite hostile. and sadistic.
 Often seen in corporate boardrooms,  political regimes, and leading unpopular causes. They often create a trail of enemies over time. The old adage, ""The high and mighty fall hard"", ""stabbed in the back"",  and many other negative descriptions fit this profile. 
The problem is that they are clueless to to their behaviors, but very aware of others responses to them. Emotions also magnify when they are part of a group that also acts in such a fashion."
2020-09-14 19:39,"OoooKK! Hopefully Caputo will take a vacation and I recommend all State Departments of health publish voluminous statistics about each respective state for everyone to share and learn from as we can't trust the Republican government now. Don't get upset, just shrug your shoulders and move on while finding new techniques to communicate. Remember that all great creatures adapt."
2020-09-14 19:43,"While it’s more than alarming to hear Michael Caputo making such statements, it’s also another sign of the desperation in Trump’s re-election campaign. 

I’ve never doubted Trump would burn the house down to save his own skin, and now we have literal proof in the form of an attempt to ignite a powder keg of insurrection just ahead of the election. 

Not even Richard Nixon fomented such divisions, and he was a very bad guy. 

If Trump somehow manages to win, he’s going to go after all his real and perceived enemies using an unrecognizable DoJ. That will be about all he does besides golf, grift, tweet, and watch TV. At least that’s all until he starts running for a third term..."
2020-09-14 19:34,It's sadly clear that Mr. Caputo's health has suffered and that he is acting out in self-destructive and destabilized and destabilizing ways. Absolutely unacceptable behavior to speculate about armed insurrection.
2020-09-14 19:34,Just another example of Trump's ongoing efforts to completely undermine nonpartisan federal bureaucracies to serve his own interests.
2020-09-14 19:35,The man is so obviously very distressed.  He needs to be relieved of his responsibilities.  There are better places for him to work!
2020-09-14 19:40,"Odd that he tells his friends to wear masks, yet Trump happily and proudly holds rallies and conventions where tons of people proudly don't wear masks.

And it's Trump who says he won't secede the election if he loses, that the election is rigged if he doesn't win; don't believe Biden has ever spoken in those terms.

What are GOP senators and conservatives doing? Do they really support this kind of thing? Is this not the time to stand up for the truth? Do they really believe and does this guy believe that Trump has made no mistakes with covid when we have one of the highest death rates in the world?"
2020-09-14 19:45,"This sort of inflammatory unsubstantiated talk will become the norm if Caputo's handlers are re-elected.  His targets now are scientists, intellectuals and those favorite boogeymen of the Right, ""the left-wing"" but should these dangerous ideologues maintain power the list will extend to all relgious and ethnic minorities.  The time to worry whether or not it can happen here has long since passed."
2020-09-14 19:44,"This is upside down. Scientists are not undermining Mr. Trump. Trump is undermining scientists.  Before now, it was unthinkable for a political appointee to put a political spin on scientific data.  Mr. Caputo and Mr. Trump need to go.  Americans deserve data and health conclusions they can trust."
2020-09-14 19:40,"Institution after institution that we've come to rely on for the continuation of our way of life have been undermined or hollowed out. The question is no longer ""how low will these people go?"" The question is ""how low will they bring America down?"""
2020-09-14 19:46,"It's heart warming to know that our government is being managed by such competent and well trained individuals.  Stable geniuses, all of them."
2020-09-14 19:47,"It's scary when his message resonates with 35% of the electorate. And to think, the Caputos of the world have been among us all the time."
2020-09-14 19:48,"His claim that the media is the reason his ""mental health has definitely failed”  is laughable.   It simply doesn't comport with the facts that this man has continually supported and espoused deep state and radical left-wing fantasies all in an effort to support Trump rather than the health and safety of the public which is his charge."
2020-09-14 19:50,Election Day night is going to be a circus. Regardless of who “wins” the US is heading towards a complete breakdown in its democracy. If Biden wins (and I think vote suppression at the state and federal level will prevent that) he will face armed resistance from the extreme right. Think of what happened in Michigan but crank the dial up full. If Trump wins .....
2020-09-14 19:51,So much wasted resources during unending crises. When we need expertise and cooperation the most...
2020-09-14 19:50,"To say the Trump administration is totally ""off the rails"" would wrongly suggest that, at some point, it wasn't."
2020-09-14 19:47,"Remember when paranoia was part of a diagnosis and not part of a job description? 

I do.

Republicans have broken the social contract around truth and governance. The only way to repair our institutions and protect ourselves from danger is to exclude Republicans from governance. 

In other words, vote them out. That is our right as citizens and our duty as patriotic Americans."
2020-09-14 19:35,"To allow people to die so that you can re-elect the president is a grievous mortal sin, mortal sin."
2020-09-14 19:40,I wonder what his Sunday church confession sounds like. Must be a doozie!
2020-09-14 19:42,"“Whose bright idea was it to make sure that every idiot in the world can get in touch with every other idiot.  Social media polarizes our politics by allowing us all, no matter how wrong we are about a political issue, to find a large enthusiastic group of people who are even “wronger”.  
— P. J. O’Rourke

Folks, the tip of the iceberg is getting bigger.  The large underbelly is getting closer.  This guy has no business being anywhere near Washington, D.C. and actually needs serious immediate therapy.  However, he has a large enthusiastic Trump base who agree with him, many of whom are already heavily armed and ammo’d up.  The Trump administration should immediately censure and replace him.  Fat chance."
2020-09-14 19:45,At least Mr. Caputo was up front about his failing mental health.
2020-09-14 19:45,Just forwarding Russian disinformation. Is that a problem?
2020-09-14 19:54,"Yet another example of an egregiously unqualified hack being smooshed into a position he has no business being in. His only identifiable “qualification “ is being a water carrier for the equally unqualified hack occupying the White House.  

Is Susan Collins “concerned” yet?"
2020-09-14 19:36,"this article has 500 more comments than this guy's video has views.  I realize he's a government employee, but does every idiotic thing one of Trump's appointees say need to be front page news? at some point, this stuff really isn't news any longer. maybe if the times stopped giving these clowns so much oxygen..."
2020-09-14 19:33,The inmates are running the asylum.
2020-09-14 19:34,"Why does the Trump administration have this nut still on staff, someone who clearly ( besides his own diagnosis of failed mental health) should not be in this position?
The president goes around decrying VP Biden's health and he has these loonies running the show?
Enough is enough"
2020-09-14 19:40,What is it with these chickenhawks and their desire for war? Apparently any war will do for these people. This is classic projection at its worst!
2020-09-14 19:43,"Now, common folks, he can not help it if he is mentally unstable and very ill.  Paranoid and delusional shoot right off the page.  This man is crashing and burning right before our eyes. And I am enjoying it immensley.  There are several private psychiatric hospitals near Washington DC.  But he could always go to St. Elizabeths, I understand that it actually a good place."
2020-09-14 19:46,"Sounds like Caputo better avail himself of a reference to a psychiatrist.

And get off the public dole, because paying the salary of one crazy man is already enough for me."
2020-09-14 19:55,"I don't see anything in his rantings that a neoNazi, white supremacist or 'Christian' evangelical would find inappropriate. Why would he be fired?
Now McMaster University, a highly regarded institution in Canada, might not like that their fine name has been associated with this fascist outpouring. What is their response?"
2020-09-14 19:35,"Trump is hurting this country more and more. He's someone who doesn't care about human life. Although he knew about Korona, he took no precautions and gave 200 thousand people to die. Trump is someone who cares about no one but himself. Are you going to vote for someone who calls the soldiers who died for our country ""suckers""?"
2020-09-14 19:36,Another crazy. Is he on drugs? How do these people imagine their existence after the downfall?
2020-09-14 19:42,"I think it is getting close to time for me to arm myself.  So should any sensible person.  

Even if you do not own a firearm you can still be shot, and righties are more trigger happy than ever."
2020-09-14 19:42,Caputo is literally insane.  How can he still hold any position of trust?
2020-09-14 19:45,How does Trump find these guys?
2020-09-14 19:34,"The quiet from Trump and friends in DC over the Navalny poisoning is as loud a warning as the loud lunacy Mr. Caputo is spewing.

I am sure DJT will not criticize either."
2020-09-14 19:50,Why is this guy not in an institution where he can get proper care?  His mental health clearly has failed... if he ever had it.
2020-09-14 19:36,"In every closet, under every bed, behind every curtain, there’s another guy in this administration with deep connections to Russia.  Not a coincidence anymore."
2020-09-14 19:36,Mr. Caputo sounds like a paranoid lunatic. I think it was the president who recently said he doesn't want to create a panic. Maybe he should tell this guy to chill.
2020-09-14 19:39,This man has admitted to the world that his mind has failed. He must be removed from  the CDC and put under psychiatric care. We don't need psychotic conspiracy theorists blocking the American people's access to factual data produced for them by their government agencies.
2020-09-14 19:47,"Apparently this isn't Caputo's first trip to Crazytown. While nosing on the web, I discovered a story featuring a trove of now-deleted tweets about covid that he has sent out in the past.  Unbelievably foul and hateful.  No wonder he deleted them.
I cannot begin to imagine what awaits us between now and the election.  And after."
2020-09-14 19:51,The best people.
2020-09-14 19:49,"If the man's mental health is failing as he admits, why is he on the taxpayer rolls? Get him out, now!"
2020-09-14 19:51,"This takes the many unbelievable sins of the Trump administration to a whole new level—this person needs to be removed from public office. He is an absolute threat to the lives and safety of Americans. He should be brought up on charges of instigating violence against innocent Americans who are members of other political parties. Telling people to kill their fellow countrymen. It’s beyond shocking. No one has done more to allow US citizens to die and suffer from the pandemic than Trump. What craven liars they are. This particular person appears to be mentally and emotionally ill—unbalanced and paranoid—Facebook, please do the right thing and take away his bully pulpit and Americans, demand his immediate resignation."
2020-09-14 19:51,"Just a general question: why does a political operative at the CDC have ANY editorial oversight of medical publishing by the agency?  Shouldn't the doctors and experts handle that?

Frankly, I don't understand why there even IS  a ""political operative"" at the CDC.  This sounds like the Communist Party operatives that were present in all parts of the old Soviet Union bureaucracy: dear leader must ensure that everyone's message fits with his delusions."
2020-09-14 19:51,Mr Caputo and Mr Trump as all of the Republican representatives would like the public to believe their lies about how they and only they are the law and order of this country. They are mistaken because this country is ruled by the people that means they are the deep state and they need to be eliminated because they are liars and lie to the citizens of this country.

2020-09-14 19:52,"The accurate job title for Mister Caputo, as well as other members of the administration, should be Assistant Secretary for Propaganda.  Stop calling it ""communication"" or ""public affairs"".  Be accurate."

  No kidding."

He needs to get a therapist."
2020-09-14 19:56,"If this fellow is not just spouting the realized lies of his Dear Leader, then he is drinking whatever Don Jr.. was imbibing at the RNC Roundup.

2020-09-14 19:56,"Caputo has always been delusional, so this dangerous blather of his comes as no surprise.  Isn't it exactly what we've also come to expect from this administration's so-called expert staff?"
2020-09-14 19:51,"He needs a little rest, as we used to say in England. And God knows, so do we."
2020-09-14 19:51,He’s right about one thing. His mental health has definitely failed. No doubt about it.
2020-09-14 19:47,This is the second BFF of Trump in two days to call for armed insurrection.  The first is Roger Stone whom Trump pardoned just 2-3 weeks ago after his conviction for multiple felonies.
2020-09-14 19:55,This is really alarming and it is open season in the CDC. These scientists risked being hurt or killed by this administration in “defending” this man. I really doubt an election is going to be free and fair. We are a failed country already.
2020-09-14 17:35,"The group of scientists at the CDC that insisted the evidence showed the virus would just disappear, go away with hot weather and can be treated with disinfectant and gamma rays has been stifled by the mainstream media for too long by the deep state of Democratic scientists saying the opposite. Mr. Caputo is the new whistleblower. Let's make sure Congress can get him to testify so the truth can come out."
2020-09-14 17:33,"According to Wikipedia and other sites, Michael Caputo did PR for Putin via Gazprom, was mentored by Roger Stone and was responsible for shady work for Trump before Trump was president.  Caputo has also worked with Oliver North.  It is remarkable that with his background and power that he seems to be fraying at the edges."
2020-09-14 18:57,What evidence do you have that his is wrong?  We see constant push back and insubordination from career bureaucrats.
2020-09-14 19:59,Mr. Caputo is right.  His mental health has suffered.  He has become outright paranoid.  (A not unexpected effect of acting vigorously to support Trump's mentality.)
2020-09-14 19:58,Caputo is as malicious as Trump and any who are associated with him. It is imperative to clean house on November 3.
2020-09-14 20:02,"Apparently, I missed the news article about trump recruiting from mental institutions to staff administration posts."
2020-09-14 20:08,"These insane rants are sadly typical of some of the people trump has surrounded himself with, and has seeded throughout the federal government.

It's tragic.  Not only for the damage they are doing now, but for the integrity of these institutions.  Where in the world do these people come from, and what has made them so delusional?"
2020-09-14 19:58,"Trump and company do nothing but accuse other Americans of the very corrupt, immoral actions they are and have been committing all along! Meanwhile their republican base has their eyes and ears wide shut to it all. After all he has said and done, America will never unite under Trump."
2020-09-14 20:01,"Caputo reminds me of a salesman many of us heard on radio, television, and on print media decades ago, who used to advertise that his prices were insane!  Ditto!"
2020-09-14 20:08,The Public Health Service that ran the Tuskegee experiments eventually became the CDC. No one in their right mind should ever trust the CDC.
2020-09-14 20:03,"Yep, I'm going to have to agree with him: his mental health is definitely suffering"
2020-09-14 20:05,Surely we can expect Ross Douthat to defend his position and explain why the armed insurgency of career government scientists is a serious threat? I just can’t wait.
2020-09-14 19:55,I only have a single response for such outlandish claims. The degree of unfounded paranoia in these statements suggests an unwell state of mind.
2020-09-14 20:05,"I'm older. I remember back before everyone and their uncle was on the internet, this kind of stuff was always somewhere, people would chat about it on our various and sundry message boards and other pre-corporate social media.

Usually under the ""Flames, UFO's, and the Occult"" forum.

You all. I cannot believe this is where we are at. You are not supposed to take this seriously. This was and is a joke. All your base does not, in fact, belong to us. Stop saying we have no chance to survive.

Where else does his get his weird ideas about being killed? Calling scientists as seditious is like calling Putin a harmless pacifist. Trump’s world view is warped by his communist buddies. Trump’s supports bleat about Ist and 2nd amendment rights - but Trump and his cohorts get to speak their lies and distortions while the truth is buried. Like Putin’s opponents.

2020-09-14 19:50,"As if alleging that the scientists are part of a filthy nest of seditious insurrectionists isn’t crazy enough, he feels it adds emphasis to call their behavior “venial sins” when if I’m understanding his fantasy correctly he actually should have used the more serious “venal” sins. Venial sins are minor infractions, but venal sins are mortal ones. Clearly he is making this up as he goes, but it would have suited his purpose to have used the descriptor of the more serious sin to more thoroughly strengthen his attempt at distortion and propaganda.

And it is in fact a serious sin to intentionally perform one’s government job in such a manner as to serve political interests rather than the needs of the task at hand. Given the continual obfuscation of the Trump administration, it strikes me as highly unlikely that the scientists are the ones lying for political gain. In fact it is clear that this strategy is baked into the Trump administration from the top down, not the bottom up."

2020-09-14 19:53,"Michael Caputo was quoted in this article as saying that his “mental health has definitely failed.”  Yup, that sounds about right.  As Maya Angelou once so adroitly observed: ""When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time."""
2020-09-14 20:02,"Caputo has indicated the need for mental health support.  We all need various forms of support, the courage to seek it, and the will to analyze and work on our psychological evolution.  I hope he seeks help, gets it, and wish him well on his journey of mental health.  

Caputo describes hallucinations/dreams with shadows on the ceiling and a growing fear of being alone.  

The ceiling could be a collective unconscious representation of goals that aren't being achieved and the shadows parts of outward actions that do not align with inner moral character.  As his actions move further from his religious mooring, he feels an increasing fear of being alone.  

Internally, he is aware his powerful public platform could be saving many more lives.  Externally, amplifying ambiguity, conspiracy, lies, and misdirection, cause more pain and death.  This conflict of inner morals and outward action causes extreme stress. Conspiracies can allow a mental path (deranged) to bridge this conflict and reduce stress.  Yet, he is (perhaps unconsciously) aware of this, hence the dreams, sharing them, and outward calling for help due to feelings of mental failure.   

The lunacy of Trumpism seems to require ""belief"" in some level of lies, conspiracy, and/or delusion.  Deteriorated mental health is a predictable result.   

Vote, and consider committing to get at least 10 others to vote in battleground States.  Our collective sanity and safety require it.  :)"
2020-09-14 19:56,"I don't want to be conspiratorial myself...So I'll beg the question:

How many times have we watched trump and his cronies make claims about the 'opposition' that are consistent with what they are actually doing or planning?

Is this form of lying and deception consistent with the way trump regularly operates?

For example:  Does trump regularly counter sue the people who he has wronged?

Also, this person he has hired to oversee the medical and scientific professional staffers who actually perform research for us seems more than a little suspicious.  Out of Canada's McMaster University comes Assistant Professor (Part-Time), Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, Paul Alexander to ride roughshod over our professional scientists.  He is not listed as a tenured faculty member, only ""Part-Time"".  Looking at his publication list, it seems that he performs little or no fundamental medical research himself, but merely critiques the work of others.  

He may have a doctorate from Oxford, but the things he has said during this pandemic seem loaded with political opinions, many of which are just plain wrong.  Noteworthy is his position that there is little or no evidence that children are at risk of spreading or contracting the virus or that mask wearing is traumatic for children.

The American public needs to be critically aware of this administration's continuing moves to push aside advice from our professional bureaucratic experts and to substitute ""happy talk"" from implanted political operatives that pleases the president."

It is hard to rank the most outrageous, dangerous, and threatening stories coming out of this Administration, but this report on Caputo might be the most dangerous. 

It reveals the paranoid, deranged, desperate thinking within the Administration - and the extents to which they will go to retain power.

We are witnessing Stalinesque levels of political paranoia, Orwellian-levels of linguistic deception, and Stone-esque use of dirty tricks.

We must face the fact that the US administration is now run as an insurgency against the United States, where a small group - unchecked by the Republican Party - plans to retain power by any means necessary, including incitement of insurrection, unlimited propaganda, and dirty tricks.

I try not to lose faith, but the threat is unlike any we faced in this country, and is more akin to Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia."

If trump is threatening them with the Russian mob, there are too many people cowering down for them to get everyone. 

If the trump cult does not watch it, they will succumb to the same fate of the Jonestown cult members. In this case, their false prophet will water down their Kool-Aid with bleach.

I used to wonder if 45 would start a war somewhere in the world to save his political career but now I am afraid that the war will be against anyone who doesn't vote for him - like me!"
2020-09-14 20:17,"First, Facebook needs to stop this individual from hosting any more live events if he's going to be spewing out conspiracy theories and other such nonsense about the CDC which is not happening and which will never happen. Second, his direct supervisor should order him to take a leave of absence and attend to his mental health. Third, it's individuals like this who claim the left is out to destroy this country when in fact it has been the right who has been doing it all along, health care, climate, immigration, foreign affairs, need I say more!"
2020-09-14 20:19,"This man clearly should not be in any job with major responsibility.  Yet, here he is in the Trump Administration.

If there are any Republican members of Congress with an ounce of care for us ordinary citizens, they would be screaming, not calling, for this guy’s removal."
2020-09-14 20:12,"Why is Caputo, who works for Alex Azar -- head of the Department of Health and Human Services -- talking about far-left ""hit squads""?  Inappropriate.  And fearmongering.   
Plus, where is Azar?   

They should be focused on the SARS-Co-V2 pandemic and upcoming flu season.  And all the other things they should be doing per their mandate."
2020-09-14 20:12,"Frankly, I expect to see this type of paranoid stream of consciousness tirade increase the closer we get to the election. I think the Trumpkins are seeing the handwriting in the wall and are getting increasingly nervous. Hysteria - especially among those so obviously unqualified for their public positions - is mounting.

And this guy definitely needs mental health treatment."
2020-09-14 20:10,I'm surprised that Caputo went outside the US for his science advisor. Weren't there US scientists who he could have tapped for that role? I mean ... sending jobs outside the US isn't something that this Administration should be doing.
2020-09-14 20:12,"Well.

This guy sounds like the perfect Trump appointee."
2020-09-14 20:13,"Let's not even talk about how unqualified this man is to hold such a responsible position. Lets talk about how the supporters around him are manipulating his declining mental health to take the fall for their own agenda. His fear is exactly what Trump and his administration are peddling, and by letting this man continue to spread his delusions about 'the left arming themselves and hunting us all down"", they attempt to garner votes from the terrified public. When the time comes for them to admit that their behavior is unconscionable, they'll let Caputo take the fall, and by then, the damage is done."
2020-09-14 20:13,"Mr. Caputo appears to be in great psychological stress and one hopes he is in the care of a reputable and experienced therapist.    

His statements are dangerous and without merit or factual basis, and the administration should limit his public statements .  

Our country is in the midst of three terrible crises and Mr. Caputo should not be allowed to aggravate these serious events."
2020-09-14 20:11,"I agree with Mr. Caputo's statement that his ""mental health has definitely failed."" I would urge him to resign immediately and go to a quiet isolated place where he can take care of himself."
2020-09-14 20:12,"Caputo is clearly trying to deflect attention from his ""leading efforts to warp C.D.C. weekly bulletins to fit Mr. Trump’s pandemic narrative"".

Caputo is in a position for which his is not qualified. Hopefully, he has at most 4 more months in this role."
2020-09-14 20:16,More projection. Pretty much any criticism Trump’s appointees level at their organizations are based on the things they’re doing themselves.
2020-09-14 20:17,"How can people like Caputo just hire advisors at will, and Canadians to boot?  Is there a budget for this sort of thing -  was it a new position approved by Congress??"
2020-09-14 20:18,"Mr. Caputo -- you better not come into my neighborhood. People are saying it's dangerous. I'm not saying that, but many people are saying it. I heard it on Facebook. There's no evidence for it, but I believe it 100%."
2020-09-14 20:20,"This guy is so off the wall that he can't get his message passed on or even read (see your weak numbers), but he did one better: he got The Times to give him unearned space to reach millions of people. Some things are just too dumb to shine a light on without giving them more of a platform than they deserve. This stuff is not fit to print."
2020-09-14 20:19,Was Caputo holding and using his thumb to maneuver the three steel balls in his hand that Humphrey Bogart used to calm him down on the witness stand in The Caine Mutiny ?
2020-09-14 20:20,"And he is still in this important position  of power affecting the very health of the entire country.  The people he put in power while not involved directly in his Post were obviously put there to carry out his ideas.  They must be investigated.  

5 minutes after this Facebook Post was posted Caputo should have been fired.  Any Administration offers even one made up excuse like hacking must summarily be relieved of duty.  

We have a President who espouses Q’Anon, White Power philosophies, OK’s US Military to rout peaceful  protesting American citizens, thinks he’s a medical genius, ordered the rush push for unproven treatments of COVID-19 and he outright lied about the seriousness of the novel coronavirus from the beginning.  

Trump appointed Caputo.  Caputo was in attendance at the high level COVID-19 Task Force meetings.   Why shouldn’t Caputo think he could say what he said with impunity?

The “Inmates” are truly  in charge of this White House insane asylum.   

How many more of Caputo’s ilk are positioned in places of power? 

Are there so many that  they are now the real “Deep State?“"
2020-09-14 20:21,"Without firing a shot, Putin wins! This man is delusional and some (one) needs to step up. Takers?"
2020-09-14 20:21,The clearly insane have taken control of the asylum.
2020-09-14 20:23,"This guy Caputo should be caught with a butterfly net. He is completely unqualified, inexperienced, not a scientist or doctor. He only worked on trump's campaign, that is all he did, as most trump appointees. He is an extremely dangerous man suggesting violence, and chaos, like trump. Trumpies are starting to foam at the mouth because they realize trump is going to lose. So, like Caputo, they are getting people ready for riots and bloodshed. A cursed is hanging over the US now."
2020-09-14 20:23,"Republicans and human survival are incompatible. 
You can not have both. We will finally address the Republican plague, recognize that there is no possible detente with this lethal mixture of wickedness and stupidity and defeat it or there will be no liveable future for humanity on this planet. Period."
2020-09-14 20:19,"""DR. GOTTLIEB:  Look, I think in this respect, the White House leadership was failed by health officials. We did not have a diagnostic in the field, so we couldn't screen for it."" 

We did have a test developed by the Germans and endorsed by the WHO. But Trump appointees decided to develop their own.

""And we over-relied on a surveillance system that was built for flu.""

Without a test you cannot do trace. 

""the White House did not have the information they need to make decisions""

Perhaps if the president shared what he knew there might have been an earlier response.

Up to now I have thought Gottlieb a square shooter. Most have had a bad day.

2020-09-14 20:21,"""Venial""?  My OED says that's ""trivial, unimportant, pardonable,"" etc.  Clearly, Mr. Caputo doesn't know it's meaning.

Should have expected no less from a Trump appointee."
2020-09-14 20:23,It was revealed today that Michael Caputo has lost his mind. Any capacity for reason that he might have once possessed has left him.
2020-09-14 20:23,"Notice that if Trump said these things - and he did - he got a pass. Teflon gas lighter. Caputo, though, seems overwhelmed, so the cracks in his distortion field are showing. Not Donny's. He just keeps on ticking. Please, please vote to wipe out at every level the red in our nation's ledger."
2020-09-14 20:25,"Capitol admits he has mental health issues, while engaging in paranoic rants.   He needs to be removed from his position immediately"
2020-09-14 20:25,Crazy as a nest of bedbugs. But then the Trump administration is just that - a nest of bedbugs.
2020-09-14 20:24,Everything -- literally everything and everyone -- associated with Donald Trumps shrivels like a grape. Caputo needs emotional counseling in order to return him to a more normal level of paranoia.
2020-09-14 20:25,"Caputo: ""left-wing hit squads were preparing for armed insurrection after the election.""  Caputo must have a learning disability and/or an inability to understand what he is seeing out in middle America----what he meant to say was ""Right wing hit squads.....""

Either way, the role of a senior government official is to do everything possible to stop these armed escalations rather than to fan the flames.  This is the deceitful essence of Trumpism----"
2020-09-14 20:26,"Repubs are always telling us what they are going to do by claiming what Dems will do.  So, we can expect a bunch of repub traitors to try to overthrow our government once trump is tossed out."
2020-09-14 20:26,Are Mr. Caputo’s delusions part of the cause or part of the effect of this administration ?
2020-09-14 20:25,"It's clear that Caputo's mental health has failed, and he should resign."
2020-09-14 20:26,"Wow! If someone made this into a movie I wouldn't finish watching it because it is so unbelievable. This guy, Mr. Caputo, needs to be put into a lock-down mental health facility and get treatment. Doesn't anyone care? He is a danger to himself and others."
2020-09-14 20:26,The best people .. and so much winning !!
2020-09-14 20:27,"It became clear when the Republicans made national heros of people pointing weapons at Black Lives Matter protesters as well as a Trump lunatic who shot 3 people. 

In November, the MAGA zombies will flood the streets and the slaughter will begin. Rwanda II. That's what we're looking at."
2020-09-14 20:28,Only the best crazies! Where does Trump find these folks? Maybe they are all peas in the same pod!
2020-09-14 20:29,I should feel inured to the lunacies some of these Trumpies expound.  Seems I'm not.  This guy is a horror.
2020-09-14 20:29,This man should be removed from office immediately.
2020-09-14 20:29,"IMO, Mr. Caputo could himself use some healthcare... of the mental variety."
2020-09-14 20:29,"In the last quote of the article Mr. Caputo says “allowing people to die .... is a venial sin...” A “venial” sin is a pardonable sin.  I think he means to say it is a mortal sin.  Small point, but I think it shows Mr. Caputo’s lack of qualifications to be a communications director, aside from the fact that he appears to be having a nervous breakdown."
2020-09-14 20:28,"Shadows,huh?

Can ANYONE explain why this fool was not immediately arrested, as you or I surely would be?

Oh that's right. Our entire justice system is a fraud and a cynical joke. I forgot."
2020-09-14 20:30,"""Mr. Caputo said Monday, “Since joining the administration my family and I have been continually threatened” and harassed by people who have later been prosecuted"". The above is a quote from the article. If it is true, why NY Times is saying his claim is false? Provide proof that he is wrong."
2020-09-14 20:30,"Caputo is either fiendishly cynical or a very sick man. Possibly both. If he is sick he should get help. No one who makes such far-fetched lies and paranoid political smears should have a position as a communications director in any government agency, much less the one most instrumental in combatting the coronavirus. He should step down immediately."
2020-09-14 20:27,Mr. Caputo needs to resign or be fired immediately.   This is the last thing we need right now.
2020-09-14 20:27,"This is beyond disturbing.  
The assault on science is blatant. 
Diverting the lack of rigor and the effort to distort the science for political ends, then accusing the scientists of doing this because you see yourself as the keeper of truth..beyond shameful.  
Lets leave the science to the scientists and when we listen to them they will save lives."
2020-09-14 20:28,"Caputo is simply following his master’s lead. 

Say the other guy is doing what you are actually doing. Then lie about it claiming persecution when caught. 

For example: Trump denies the virus is lethal, yet knew it was months ago. 

Trump encourages violence by armed militias and refuses to try to stop it while Biden does neither. 

Denigrate our military leaders and those wounded or killed in battle but skipped his time to serve with heel spurs. Biden’s son volunteered to serve. Anyone think trump’s kids would do the same?  

Wake up America."
2020-09-14 20:29,"Trump asserted this week his remarks to Woodward about lying about the coronavirus was to downplay panic. Well, think of that. 

Now we've got Trump's new mouthpiece, Michael Caputo, doing the exact opposite. He's flaming panic, by saying (with not a shred of evidence) scientists at the CDC are out to get him. Honestly? Why would they bother?  

So which is it Mr. Trump? Do you downplay panic or flame it? We're all getting bored by the contradictions and the effrontery to our intelligence."
2020-09-14 20:30,These people need to be held accountable for their actions once Trump is gone and imprisoned.
2020-09-14 20:26,Everybody is a whistleblower in the CDC  - Caputo is probably right .
2020-09-14 20:29,"Here is what wikipedia has about Michael Caputo:

""is a Republican political strategist, and lobbyist. In April 2020, Caputo was appointed as assistant secretary of public affairs in the Department of Health and Human Services in the Trump administration.""

""Caputo moved to Russia in 1994, after the fall of the Soviet Union, and was an adviser to Boris Yeltsin. He worked for Gazprom Media in 2000 where he worked on improving the image of Vladimir Putin in the U.S. He moved back to the U.S. and founded a public relations company, and then moved to Ukraine to work on a candidate's campaign for parliament.""

and

""While working in a top position in the HHS for the Trump administration, Caputo sought to change, delay, suppress and retroactively edit scientific reports on COVID-19 by the Centers for Disease Control that were deemed unflattering to President Trump""

Do I think he is promoting Russian disinformation or propaganda?  Absolutely!"
2020-09-14 20:32,Is this not the gentleman whose close association to the Russkies has recently been the subject of some reportage?
2020-09-14 20:31,Based on Mr. Caputo's history with Putin he is saying exactly what Mr. Putin would like to foment paranoia in our country. Someone needs to follow the money here.  The Trump team is knee deep in our enemy's swamp of influence and dark money.
2020-09-14 20:31,"Caputo's Wikipedia bio states that he ""moved to Russia in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union, and was an advisor to Boris Yeltsin.  He worked for Gazprom Media in 2000 where he worked on improving the image of Vladimir Putin in the United States.""  Is he now handling disinformation jointly for the Kremlin and Trump campaign?"
2020-09-14 20:31,"Couple this with Roger Stone’s interview last week and his call for Trump to declare martial law if he looses and immediately arrest Mark Zuckerberg, the Clinton’s & Tim Cook.  He also called for federal authorities to confiscate all ballots in Nevada on election night.  Trump, Republicans and their supporters have become so crazed it is truly frightening.  The fact that no Republicans have taken a stand to this rhetoric is despicable.  When are any meaningful restrictions going to be put onto social media platforms?  Social media that amplifies this chaos will be our undoing!

2020-09-14 20:32,"The test for society will be if the usual ‘militia’ types show up to ‘protect’ our democracy - armed to the teeth and threatening law-abiding citizens - what will the police and other state law enforcement agencies do about it?

This IS going to happen; starting with polling places being ‘observed’ and potentially going critical in the manners suggested by Caputo.

State government needs to have all SWAT teams on standby, and national guard troops standing by, to ensure that any such devolution into the law of the jungle is met with superior force from the rule of law.  And this time, our public safety forces need to be the ones who ‘give no quarter’ - armed insurrection is not protected under the constitution."

2020-09-14 20:34,"Given the horrific nature of this man's accusations, given the ""president's"" tendency to pour gasoline on any sparks he can find in order to fan the flames of fear, anger, and hatred that seem to vitalize his base, and given the lamentable capacity of the internet, search engines, and especially social networks like facebook to ensure that we only receive news items from those who already think like us, how exactly are we supposed to prevent this country from descending into civil war in the next few months?"

2020-09-14 20:35,Caputo sounds delusional.  This goes beyond conspiracy theories.  He is having a mental breakdown and needs psychiatric care.
2020-09-14 20:36,"Mr. Caputo on Sunday complained on Facebook that ... his “mental health has definitely failed.”  Ya think?

“I don’t like being alone in Washington,” he said, describing “shadows on the ceiling in my apartment, there alone, shadows are so long.” 

“And when Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin,” he said. 

Mr. Caputo -- get some therapy fast."
2020-09-14 20:36,"The lunatics are not only running the asylum. They own it lock stock and barrel. Caputo is just one Horseman in the Trump Pestilence filled Apocalypse.

This and statements by Mr Caputo suggest that he is mentally unfit for his position.

There are no sedition artist or anarchist or Birch Society members.  They are collectively dull, hardworking and foolishly humanitarian-types throughout.  They do not cheat or fudge data or look under their beds at night. They send contributions to the ASPCA, attend church service and raise smart children.

It sounds as if Caputo sending a warning to America, and telling Trump's supporters to arm up.

Caputo is openly saying that Trump will refuse to step down if he loses, this is the first time it has been openly stated despite being a common thought.

Caputo - along with Tump - is the one inciting insurrection, he is the one who is projecting on the Left what the Right is doing even now. 

Look at the caravans of Trump supporters in Portland, that is an example of what Caputo is accusing the Left of ""going to do"" - much like Trump is accusing Biden of ""going to do's""

It's amazing how Trump and his henchmen have such insight into what Biden and his Administration ""are going to do""."

The fact that Caputo is still an employee -- whose generous salary is paid with Democrats' and independents' tax dollars too -- is all you need.

As if Secretary Azar weren't already swampy enough, Trump gifted him Caputo to keep all of HHS wallowing in Trumpian filth.

Few exit from #Cult45; most who do stay silent about its charismatic religious leader's control over the minds and bodies of his worshipful followers. Even at this moment, #Cult45 insiders are preparing for battle on November 3 -- most figuratively, too many literally. 

With all the cheating Trump and Republicans have done thus far, the show really begins in the early morning of November 4, when Trump will declare the entire election voided because ballot-counting continued after 11:59 p.m. EST on November 3. 

And, no, I'm not prone to exaggerating. The conclusion is rational given the plethora of social media posts and this summer's worst violence being perpetrated not by Antifa (despite Trump's, Pence's, and Barr's lies to the contrary) but white separatists and anarchists like the Boogaloo Bois. They've hitched their wagon to Trump's star, and there's no way they will let the opportunity to advance their causes without trying."

He's been an operative for Putin and Boris Yeltsin and studied under Roger Stone. He has, as this article points out, no administrative or health related experience. His experience is to lay down deception, incite rancor and distrust, and enrage the opposition. This has become the essence of the Trump administration.

And apparently it is even eating at Caputo's mental health, although one has to wonder what it has been all along.

For the sake of his family, he should be put on medical leave and referred to an institution for care."

But Caputo is becoming typical of the lying, hated-filled Trump disciples that are determined to ride Trump's slippery coattails as long as they can.  The CDC is fighting to save the American people from further decimation from this virus, and they are having to do it inspite of Trump and people like Caputo who only care about themselves.

According to Wikipedia, Caputo is a Republican political strategist who moved to Russia in 1994, after the fall of the Soviet Union, and was an adviser to Boris Yeltsin. He worked for Gazprom Media in 2000 where he worked on improving the image of Vladimir Putin in the U.S. He moved back to the U.S. and founded a public relations company, and then moved to Ukraine to work on a candidate's campaign for parliament.
 
His comments, in my opinion, are pure political porn."

Does anybody really think that the professional who work in the federal government's premier healthcare agency are actually intentionally killing Americans because they dislike the current president? Even the most liberal Americans don't think Donald Trump intentionally killed the people who didn't need to die due to his mismanagement of the pandemic. They mostly believe that his arrogance and incompetence, not some malign intent, best explain his failure.

As for the rest of the article, I guess we should be thankful that Caputo doesn't work at DoJ where he might act out his paranoid delusions in ways that would directly kill or injure Americans. It's bad enough that he was hired to lie about policy failures allow people to die or be injured medically."

This is not about Mr Caputo who in normal times may be a capable, level headed person. Mr Caputo can only be echoing what he hears from his colleagues in the administration.   If this is what the administration believes they must be preparing a response to the coming 'insurrection'.     
Possibilities:
Trump begins action against an imaginary insurrection before the election.
Trump loses the election and begins action against an imaginary insurrection. 
Trump wins the election begins action against a real or still imaginary insurrection.

The evident and natural first guess is that it's part of the general effort to amp up the rhetorical lunacy level to help reinforce a militant mindset, required during  the post election insurrection being planned. This  subversion of democratic
processes  could not  work without  there being mobs of well armed and paranoid paramilitary types, primed  to intimidate and shoot the first antifa they can possibly hope to locate,   at your beck and call.  There will be plenty of eager candidates to choose from. Literacy will not be required. 

That will keep most protestors of the electoral farce now being planned very hesitant to come out and protest against that very real  and very concrete abomination. It will also insure violence that only a general clampdown via martial rule will tame. 

Do not think for a moment that any public opposition
from mainstream politicians will have the slightest effect
or weight. 

By then people will be so shocked by the domestic display
of shock and awe they'll be too stunned to object. This will 
insure that the electoral fraud is not challenged, sustaining  the ""result"".  Who really thinks, by then, that  courts will decide  anything that will have any effect on the ground.

His incitement of violence (get your guns and ammo) should get him banned from Facebook, at worst, and fired by Mr. Azar immediately, at best.

He prefers the fantasies of conspiracy theories over CDC scientific, fact-based information.  He harms Americans by editing CDC reports about Covid-19 in the U.S.

He is a danger --  encouraging people to prepare to kill others  and blocking Americans' knowledge about Covid-19.  He's unfit to speak for the CDC, given his catastrophizing, lying and hysteria.

He is now, with Trump’s blessing and on the admin payroll, downplaying and distorting information meant to protect the public in a pandemic. This will cost lives. He is also inciting violent insurrection by urging gun owners to buy ammunition to fight  imagined left winger “hit men” out to get him now, and the rest of us on on Election Day when, he says, Trump will refuse to step down and “civil war” breaks out. He says his mental health has been affected since taking his admin job. 
Amen to that. He should be removed immediately, as Trump should have been after impeachment. The Health and welfare of the population are at stake. So is the constitution."

Mr Caputo is a Federal Employee and like all large employers the Federal Government has an EAP (Employee Assistance Program).

From OPM: ""An EAP is a voluntary, confidential program that helps employees (including management) work through various life challenges that may adversely affect job performance, health, and personal well-being to optimize an organization's success.  EAP services include assessments, counseling, and referrals for additional services to employees with personal and/or work-related concerns, such as stress, financial issues, legal issues, family problems, office conflicts, and alcohol and substance use disorders.""

Between Roger Stone and his diatribe on martial law and Michael Caputo’s deranged Facebook Live speech, and who knows who else on the far edge of sanity (not to mention the President,) the right wing cult has completely lost all semblance of civility and reason.

I thought it really showed how far gone they were when Caputo referred to Leftist “hit squads being trained all over the country.” If anyone has hit squads, it’s not the left, we’re the ones they say are against the 2nd Amendment.

Once again a Trump operative, an apt word considering Caputo’s work on behalf of Putin (look it up), claims that those who do not bend to politicizing are themselves politicizing. What is Caputo to do when Trump claims success in the face of data that proves otherwise, and not a hint of a national plan after 8-9 months. Caputo should just resign, but has instead apparently decided to go full whack, dangerous for a top communications official in these times … all members of Congress should be sounding the alarm. But kudos to the health professionals who remain professional and are a guiding light when the lights are out in the WH."

Mr. Caputo has no background in health care but was installed in HHS regardless.

Mr. Caputo worked for Gazprom Media in 2000 where he worked on improving the image of Vladimir Putin in the U.S.

Caputo worked for the Donald Trump campaign.

Mr. Caputo was investigated as part of the Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.

Unfortunately, we know that the President is not a responsible leader, quite the contrary, and will most likely reinforce or tacitly condone these statements furthering the real danger of civil unrest.  Four years ago our country was a model of democracy and stability. In less than a single term in office he has promoted chaos and divisiveness that threatens the foundations of our nation.  This is a national nightmare."

2020-09-14 21:18,"Michael Caputo is just the latest example of far-right extremists fomenting violence to achieve their goals with the President's approval.  Until Trump took office, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, anti-government militias, QAnon, and other conspiracy theorists were kept on the fringes of acceptable political discourse.  When they committed acts of domestic terrorism (like Timothy McVeigh's Oklahoma City bombing 25 years ago that killed more than 165 people) they were confronted by law enforcement and arrested.

All that has changed under Trump.  Hate speech is not only tolerated, it is commonplace and will soon be the norm.  The President, his administration, and his supporters commit violent crimes but suffer no consequences.  They kidnap children and stuff them in cages; drive their cars into a crowd of protestors; shoot and kill while hiding behind a shield; send storm troopers to the streets of our cities to 
repress free speech; and now, they are preparing to stage a violent coup in November.

What we think of their wild conspiracy theories makes no difference to them as long as Trump adopts them.  We hope our votes will put an end to this madness, but we shouldn't count on it.  In the end, the only force capable of defending our democracy from a Trump dictatorship is the military.  Let's hope they remain loyal to the Constitution and refuse to obey unlawful orders."

2020-09-14 21:20,"It’s wholly remarkable that Caputo hasn’t been fired after making these bizarre statements. He is beyond unhinged, but he is also a Trump acolyte — just one more blisteringly insane member of the most corrupt regime in American history. I have my doubts that America can survive this tsunami of psychosis. Future generations will be absolutely incredulous when they read about this tumultuous era, a time when a deranged autocrat wrested the government from people of sound mind and turned it into a cesspool of sickness, paranoia and abject evil. Lucky us."
2020-09-14 21:18,"After reading the comments attributed to Caputo I really must wonder if this man is mentally stable or not. 

He talks about seeing shadows, dark places, conspiracies, insurrection, etc. These are not comments of a sane person they are reflections from someone with serious mental health issues. 

Caputo needs immediate mental health counseling. My fear is that in his current state of mind he's a danger to himself and his family. I'd like to see someone in the Administration offer this man help before it's too late."
2020-09-14 21:19,"Well he’s obviously having a breakdown - he’s quite literally crying for help in a warped way. I’d say he can’t possibly stay in office, but then this is the Trump administration ..."

2020-09-14 21:20,"This is scary.  To think that this man who is spouting unproven and irrational conspiracy theories has any role in this country’s health care system is frightening.  There is a personal tragedy here because Mr. Caputo himself even states that his mental health has suffered.  But the greater tragedy is that Mr. Caputo is far from being an outlier in this administration.   When a political party has no platform other than the veneration of the person in power, it is fitting that the term, “cult of personality”, has been used so much recently.  In his unfounded ranting about the deep state embedded in our federal health care agencies, Mr. Caputo is repeating the party line that the President and the GOP have promulgated as their universal defense against the Mueller Report, Obamagate, the FBI, the NSC, the military leadership, climate scientists, and even Trump’s own appointees who have spoken out when they could no longer abide this administrations lies.

Now, sadly, we see someone in a position of authority and influence making completely unfounded and absurd accusations that approach the border of paranoia.  This should be a sign for intervention from a caring administration, but in the Trump/GOP cult, it’s probably a ticket to more responsibility for Mr. Caputo."
2020-09-14 21:20,Trump loyalists love this and solidify their supports of that liar. Let’s not be optimistic about the election. We will have to deal with a sad reality that the American democracy has changed to ochlocracy.
2020-09-14 21:20,"It is no mistake that Caputo's friend, Roger Stone,  came out yesterday on Infowars, calling for Trump to declare martial law, calling for the taking up of arms, calling for the arrests of Democrats if Trump loses. 

It also is no mistake that a couple of days ago Seth Abramson's new book came out ""Proof of Corruption"" which had documented information about Caputo's ties to the Kremlin. 

It is no mistake that Trump just named Caputo as the head of the CDC public relations weeks before the election. 

This narrative that Caputo is spreading appears to be a well orchestrated fear mongering tactic."
2020-09-14 21:20,"I’m glad Caputo said this stuff. 

I’ve known Trumpism has been advocating for civil war for the past 3.75 years. 

At least now the greater liberal community is now becoming aware of the very real threat. 

Just came from the Fox News comment sections. Whether or not those posters are grand standing remains to be seen, but I will say that it has become the norm for them to regularly claim they will kill liberals without a second thought."

2020-09-14 21:37,"Caputo talks of shadows on his ceiling and left-wing hit squads...yeah, the guy needs a mental health check. And this is one of the guys in charge of our pandemic response?! No wonder it's going so well."
2020-09-14 21:37,This man is Roger Stone's good buddy.  He was the go-between between Roger and Julian Assange & Wikileaks.  Roger threatened him that if he testified against him he would kidnap his little beloved dog and kill it.  This is the kind of people Trump has working for him.

2020-09-14 21:35,Please let's just be normal. Conspiracy theorists think they are super smart and that's how they know something the rest of us don't know...they figured it all out!
2020-09-14 21:36,"Caputo's is a pure Trump tactic.  He intentionally and malevolently edits important government science documents, gets caught red-handed, lies about it, gets exposed by America's free press, and pleads that he's the wounded one.  Give us a break.  Mr. Caputo, you are an integrity-free flunky in the service of Trump and Azar, and now you are paying the price for your perfidy.  What a fine legacy you are leaving your family."
2020-09-14 21:35,"Despite the criticism of his team’s interference with C.D.C., Mr. Caputo said he expected to remain in his post because Mr. Trump supported him. “I’m not going anywhere,” he said. “I swear to God, as God is my witness, I am not stopping.”

In this case, then, Michael Caputo is the Scarlet O'Hara of the CDC."
2020-09-14 21:36,Any significance that this man lived in Russia for a while and helped Putin win re-election?
2020-09-14 21:37,"Well, I think Caputo is right about one thing -- his mental health has declined."
2020-09-14 21:37,"Caputo is signaling to the nutty right wing militias. Trump’s behavior without exception is tit-for-tat .  You hit me! Well then, I hit you!  If he corrupts the election enough to serve a second term then: “The new ruler must determine all the injuries that he will need to inflict. He must inflict them once and for all.”   said Niccolo Machiavelli  The 2nd term of Trump would be violence, violence, violence while the Treasury is looted, Putin is entertained at a state dinner, immigrants shot at the border and many more black men killed in cities."
2020-09-14 21:37,"Having worked in mental health services my entire career, it is clear that Michael Caputo is in the midst of a psychotic break.  His paranoia is obvious, and he is in need of treatment.  This is not the first time that the president has used a person displaying serious mental illness.  Kanye West's behavior in the Oval Office showed a man in the midst of a manic episode, but our president chose to take advantage of his mental disorganization.  He is now doing the same with Mr. Caputo.  It's hideous to abide, but Donald Trump and Fox News will take advantage of this desperate man.  Shame on the Trump administration."
2020-09-14 21:37,"Mr. Caputo on Sunday complained... his “mental health has definitely failed.”

Sums it up for me."
2020-09-14 21:37,"I do not know how much of this are the ravings of a disturbed mind and how much of it has been carefully planned.  When he talks about ""left-wing hit squads were preparing for armed insurrection after the election"", this is not only psychological projection on his part but also a call to arms to his ""right-wing hit squads"".  When Trump is beaten in the election, his people (the ones with the guns) will be called out to help keep Trump in the White House.  They will argue that they are just protecting the Nation against ""Biden's hordes"".  I fear that this will not be over soon or easily."
2020-09-14 21:50,Mr. Caputo is in dire need of a mental health break.
2020-09-14 21:39,Good thing Facebook allows him free reign to mouth his hateful conspiracy theories.  What’s next?  The Protocols of the Elders of Antifa?
2020-09-14 21:41,This man is clearly having some sort of mental crisis. He needs to be whisked away and treated. (Seems to be a hallmark of  Trump cult members.)
2020-09-14 21:44,"""Venial"" - I do not think that word means what he thinks it means."
2020-09-14 21:44,"Wait, who has the nuclear codes again!

And DJT is no more competent than caputo.

It’s chilling to think this is the gang of “only the best people”  that DJT could muster.

Sad!


Vote- like your life depends on it"
2020-09-14 21:52,"Killing people in order to defeat Trump is a ""venial sin""? I know my Catholicism is rusty, but surely that would qualify as a ""mortal"" sin. A venial sin is eating fish on Fridays (in the old days)."
2020-09-14 21:53,Fire this gy - he cannot take political sides while he is on OUR dime.  Whether true or not.
2020-09-14 21:39,"Mentored by Roger Stone, worked with Oliver Stone in Central America, hired by Putin and friends in the early 2000s...

I have a much better conspiracy theory than the one Caputo is trying to push."
2020-09-14 21:43,I think we can all agree that Mr. Caputo’s mental health has failed.
2020-09-14 21:44,Mr. Caputo's mental health HAS definitely failed. Perhaps before he was appointed.
2020-09-14 21:46,"What is wrong with these people?

We learned in junior high school that the Alien and Sedition Act was later declared unconstitutional.  John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. 

And now scientists at the CDC concerned about creeping politicization at their agency are supposedly committing it. 

Mmm hmmm."
2020-09-14 21:48,How much are WE the taxpayers paying this guy?
2020-09-14 21:52,"Spouting conspiracies is how you build cults, especially in this time of toxic echo chambers called social media, where the lazy and self-righteous get their “news.” 

By the time the truth catches up with everyone, it’s too late. I’m alarmed that my country has so many people who never gained critical thinking skills."
2020-09-14 21:52,He needs to go ASAP and be admitted for a psych evaluation a thorough one. If he’s seeing shadows on the ceiling and thinks people are out to murder him he has some serious mental issues going on this isn’t just a Trump rant and rave. Quite sad doesn’t matter what party he is obviously the man is in trouble hope his family takes care of him.
2020-09-14 21:49,"Small stuff really, this takeover of the government by the catholic church. But look at all the places they're influencing - the SCOTUS, the military, embedded in all sorts of power positions (Attorney General, late night comedy.. it goes on).
And then Caputo peers out from under a rock to make accusations of ""venial"" sins, a catholic trope for sure, except that he's got his catechism scrambled. Venial is the RCC's equivalent of a misdemeanor. ""Mortal"" is the level of sin the real pro's go for."
2020-09-14 21:38,"Mr. Caputo needs to provide proof or be arrested for inciting violence, why do we tolerate a double standard for russian aligned Trumpian Republican politicos? Law and Order starts with representatives of the Administration. Evidence or rwsignation and arrest - these are the only 2 next steps."
2020-09-14 21:38,"Regardless of who wins the election results must be certified by the Senate. With the Senate in the hands of Republicans why does he envision that Trump would need to ""stand down"" at the inauguration if he actually won? Another fascist projecting his own schemes."
2020-09-14 21:42,Instead of everything that Trump touches dies.  You go insane first.  Not only is Trump toxic and affecting the physical health of the usa.  He is also causing a mental health crisis.  Mr Caputo was also involved in the Mueller investigation.  You would think he had gone through enough stress with that process.
2020-09-14 21:46,Is guy needs to study his catechism. Venial sins are considered minor infractions that are never considered grounds for eternal damnation.
2020-09-14 21:48,"The comments about the long shadows and hit squads and buying ammunition in advance, combined with his efforts to distort CDC findings, make me think that Mr. Caputo is suffering from serious paranoia."
2020-09-14 21:45,"Either Trump fires Caputo by morning or House Democrats must impeach our crazy president a 2nd time by Friday.  Let's find out what Senate Republicans think about this latest absurdity.

Let's find out right now if we're headed for civil war.  Why give Trump time to organize his rebellion?"
2020-09-14 21:40,"Don't believe Caputo's wild claims that paint him on the verge of a nervous breakdown or mental illness.  He knows exactly what he is doing.  

Caputo is inciting violence by Trump's followers, calling them to arms, and Facebook is hosting his dangerous rants.

Republicans and Democrats in positions of leadership, especially the Senate, as well as former respected Republicans who are watching from the sidelines, have a deadly serious and urgent responsibility to hold a joint press conference to denounce this individual and to force the President to step down.  

Enough is enough."
2020-09-14 21:50,"A vaccine would be the Republicans worst nightmare. Without a fear of infection we will take to the streets by the millions, a display of peaceful protests never before seen or imagined."
2020-09-14 21:51,"Caputo got one thing right.  This is a drill.  Some on the right are planning violence, which is what all the talk about Antifa is.  When I hear people link BLM with Antifa, I know that they are in the thrall of those who are planning to reject any election result that doesn't comport to their political simulacrum. Heaven help us."
2020-09-14 21:39,"It is a little known fact that when living and working in Russia as an advisor to the Kremlin, Mr. Caputo's final assignment before returning home was to help Vladimir Putin improve his public image in the United States.  Not surprising that Donald Trump appointed a propagandist with this kind of experience to help him undermine the CDC."
2020-09-14 21:47,"Is this SERIOUSLY what our government has devolved to?  Unbelievable.  

We appear to have two common enemeies - Covid-19 and the likes of Mr. Caputo and his cronies.  

Time to work to ensure we elect an administration that is grounded in science."
2020-09-14 21:50,"Our American democratic capitalist experiment will be at stake in November.  If DJT wins we will lose what millions of men and woman have given their life for.  The constitution.  The shining city on the hill. Law and order, opportunity for all, justice. Trump cannot destroy it alone.  He must have the Republican elected officials on his side.  Are they willing to betray this country.  We will see.  The world is waiting and watching."
2020-09-14 21:39,This story misses one important point.  The reporter presumably has access to police records.  She should have confirmed or dispelled the claims that people have been prosecuted for threatening Caputo.  This would constitute evidence to falsify his claim as totally delusional.
2020-09-14 21:45,"Mr. Caputo seems to have  admitted that he is under extreme pressure from Donald Trump and others in the administration to fashion a narrative that tries to justify the almost wonton level of deceit and deception indicative of the folks around Trump. To be sure, Mr. Bob Woodward has managed to get Trump on tape literally bragging about misleading the entire nation while almost 200,000 people have loss their lives and tens of thousands of others have suffered illness directly related to the malfeasance and hubris of the President of the United States. Mr. Caputo complains of being alone, seeing shadows, that people are coming to ""kill"" (him)? And clearly, he is holding on to tight to the dubious right wing ethos that the ""Boogie Man"" is somehow on his way? That left wing hit and or kill squad are coming after him and his family? If there is any truth to Mr. Caputo's claims and allegations, the FBI and Secret Service should come forward and issue a statement of clarification. Absenting that, if it is proven that Mr. Caputo has in fact loss touch with reality, then a petition should be filed with the Federal Courts requesting an immediate and complete mental evaluation so he can receive the appropriate mental health treatment. And this is where things have digressed to. All of the lying must be confronted now, especially given these type of serious accusations."
2020-09-14 21:48,"With the wealth of expertise in the U.S. I hope a journalist is asking why Caputo hires a Canadian, not tenured, in a part-tmie (i.e., adjunct) university position, 5 years out of his Ph.D., not trained as a physician, and gives them this kind of authority? Just what's the connection here?"
2020-09-14 21:49,This story and man are horrifying and yet nearly 40 percent of the country’s citizens think he speaks the truth and Republican elected and appointed officials do nothing to stop him. He needs help for his failing mental health and yet Trump will continue to keep him in this influential public health position during a global pandemic. God bless the USA.
2020-09-14 21:41,"Just before the 2016 election, I vividly recall Trump looking straight into the nationally broadcasting cameras in front of him at a rally, as he said there might be trouble if he wasn't elected. 

Now again Mr. Caputo; who is trying to start a civil war?"
2020-09-14 21:43,"The statements made by Caputo must be brought up to Trump and he has to condemn them publicly.

There are no ""good people on both sides"" here just as there were no good people driving cars into protesters then or as in Sacramento while Trump was telling us ""it's gonna cool down soon"".

I've got news for Trump. The smoke has dropped the temperature here in Redmond Wa by 25 deg F since last week, but the wildfire season in S. California is all year now.  And longer everywhere else.

That's not going to change seasonally, it will continue to get worse.

FYI ""In California state, the federal government owns nearly 58% of the 33 million acres of forest, according to the state governor's office."" 

And ""40% of California's forestland is owned by families, Native American tribes, or companies. Industrial timber companies own 5 million acres (14%). 9 million acres are owned by individuals with nearly 90% of these owners having less than 50 acres of forest land""

The tree farms on private and public lands burn faster and hotter than old growth, plus old growth often survives fires so that helps with erosion, the reseeding burnt land, and moderating temperature changes while the tree farms require reseeding by hand.

Trump's failure to address the pandemic, the hurricanes, and the wildfires has harmed the US economy more than any raise in taxes ever could."
2020-09-14 21:56,Basket of deplorables....she was right
2020-09-14 21:54,Why does this man still have a job?
2020-09-14 21:56,"Gaslighting. Big Lie propaganda laying the groundwork for unleashing the “militias” and other second amendment solutions on Democrats, “liberals,” and opponents of Trump, and then declaring martial law. They’re traitors to America, every one of them. Putin wants to cause America’s collapse to avenge the Soviet Union’s after 1989. Trump is helping him. 

The bigger question is how did the entire Republican party turn traitor to the Constitution and the rule of law?"
2020-09-14 21:56,Dr Fauci;  Please respond to the assistant secretary’s remarks.  We need Your calm and sense and most of all science to prevail here.

2020-09-14 21:54,"America, we’re in big trouble and it’s not from the left.  This is a call to arms for right wing death squats by Caputo and needs to be taken seriously."
2020-09-14 21:55,This is a man that has lost touch with reality and is showing signs of paranoid schizophrenia. That he holds a position of such consequence to the lives of millions is criminal. He needs to be removed and treated.
2020-09-14 21:56,"Here is a guy with no medical or scientific training spouting totally irrational nonsense and lies...pushing absurd conspiracy theories, denigrating top scientists and stoking violence and insurrection.

And nothing but silence from the GOP. Tells you what you already knew, they have zero integrity or principles.

Clearly they are as corrupt and insane as trump and his toads.
Utterly beyond comprehension.

It's up to those of us who are sane and have integrity to vote accordingly and do what is needed. Or the country is likely done for. 
And I do hope Caputo gets medical help, he's clearly mentally ill."
2020-09-14 21:57,"5000 Facebook followers and 44 likes.  It not like this guy is Kanye West.  Unfortunately NYT, this would have died on its own and now you gave him more coverage than it deserved."

2020-09-14 21:54,"Initally, I felt outrage over Caputo's outrageous, paranoid rants as reported. Upon reflection, I feel concern that his mental and emotional health are seriously deranged, possibly because of the stress he is under. BTW, he has no more expertise in theology than he has in science or medicine. At the very least, this man should take a long, leave of absence for treatment, if not replaced immediately."
2020-09-14 21:55,"Only a short while  for Trump to say. tweet ""Many are saying  he's a very fine gentleman, though I barely know him."""
2020-09-14 21:56,"First, I do hope Mr Caputo receives the care that he truly requires. No one ought take pleasure from his plight.

We are living through an American tragedy: the inmates are running the asylum. Why hasn't the media brought in experts in mental health to explain what has been happening with the president, many of those in his administration along with his most fervent fanatical supporters? The ""Goldwater Rule"" has been distorted and does not apply to this situation. Additionally the APA (American Psychiatric Association) further unethically muzzled its members in order to prevent them from saying anything observational about public figures' behavior. This is ridiculous and unconscionable. Why did the APA do this? They receive money from the federal government and do not wish to jeopardize this funding. 

Mental health professionals have a ""duty to warn"" as part of their ethical obligation to society whenever dangerous people/situations arise. 

For further information on the above, search out the writings and interviews of Dr Bandy Lee, a forensic psychiatrist, assistant professor at Yale, and a highly intelligent courageous woman greatly respected in her field of expertise: violence. She has been blacklisted by most major media outlets and has had numerous interviews cancelled at the last minute. Watch her/read interviews with her to gain understanding of the dynamics that been unfolding since Donald Trump was elected. Do your due diligence.  You will learn a good deal."
2020-09-14 21:56,"This kind of stuff is really dangerous for democracy. I am truly shocked that Trump supporters aren't more outraged when lies like this are propagated. Come on people, election year politics is politics but this goes beyond that."
2020-09-14 21:58,"Um, isn’t advocating violent overthrow of the government a crime? Get the boys in the white coats, fellas"
2020-09-14 21:58,"Did anyone at the NYT bother to look up Caputo's biography or c.v.?
Report what he said but report his background.
He has been a Russian ""troll"" since the Clinton administration when he was at USAID.
Pick a political scandal in the last thirty or more years and you will find Caputo."
2020-09-14 22:00,"Your daily reminder that when the New York Times says some Republican ""falsely"" said something, it doesn't mean it's established as false, just that the New York Times in its biased wisdom has simply declared it not to be so."

Why is this statement of fact buried in paragraph 24?  This weasel, who is the cause of the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports being falsified, has no medical background?  Caputo's only function, as a Trump lickspittle, is to falsify medical reports and make up conspiracy theories?   Why isn't Mr. Caputo in prison, for all the American deaths that he is causing?"

We haven’t heard from Ross Perot after that ( i know he is dead now).￼

But every time such a person comes up through the Democrat party￼ they get laughed away and shown for the charlatan that they are. Look at Michael Bloomberg. All the Democrat voters knew that he was a charlatan because right now he did not keep his promise that even if he does not win the primary he would still spend millions of dollars to fight Donald Trump. And now he has disappeared.

The Democratic Party never lets any of these fools and manipulators advance. NYC did But it’s only for a city. Not a nation not even a state. It’s always the GOP! Arnold Schwarzenegger. Ronald Reagan. The GOP voters are so impressed by D grade movie stars or TV hosts. Why?!￼￼￼"

2020-09-14 22:04,"Throughout reporting on pretty much everything Trump related, the aspersion “without evidence” is constantly used to disparage claims and allegations from Trump et al.  Oddly enough, I cannot remember seeing here in the NYTimes any use of that same descriptor “without evidence” when discussing and reporting the anonymously sourced Woodward allegations.  I don’t think that anonymously sourced sniping and mudflinging was ever considered “evidence” before Trump Derangement Syndrome led to the partisan rot we see infesting media these days"
2020-09-14 22:01,"This guy isn't only a ""religious fanatic"" and 
""right-wing idealogue"" (though I admit there isn't much difference between those descriptions and outright mental illness). He is clearly mentally ill, delusional and in need of immediate medical intervention. 

Someone needs to intervene NOW and get him the treatment he so desperately needs, before he harms himself or someone else physically. Sounds like he's already done his best to harm our democracy by his baseless lies and wild conspiracies."

I grew up in an evangelical Christian tradition during the Cold War era and had lots of childhood nightmares about being hunted and killed by ""commies."" And now it turns out that, because I believe in a loving compassionate God who loves truth (including scientific truth) and values each and every one of us,  it's the fear-mongering religious right that's coming to get me."

trump supporter: Woodward was wrong for withholding trump’s February statements re: how deadly Covid-19 was. It’s all his fault. The blood is on his hands. 

Rational person: Wait...What?!? First off, trump is pOTUS, not Woodward. It was trump’s duty and moral obligation, not Woodward’s, to be forthcoming and give the American people the correct information (and any other pOTUS in history has been able to give dire information straight and without histrionics). That trump willfully chose not to is on trump alone. 

Also (Rational person continues), if anything, trump and his supporters should be thanking Woodward for not saying anything. That allowed trump to continue with his “policies,” wrong-headed and evil though they were, with no interference. Besides, if Woodward would have released the tapes, trump would simply have denied saying what he said, accused yet another “hoax” (yawn... trump needs to learn a new tune) perpetrated upon him, and created another media storm (a la, drink bleach) to distract.

Vote November 3. No more years."

These are the people Trump trusts and puts in charge of our health and well-being.  And he dares mention his war on politically motivated scientists even though any other motivation than blind adoration of Trump is unacceptable to him .... and this is a man who has direct power over our lives through his manipulation of the reports put out by the C.D.C."
2020-09-14 22:07,"Between what Caputo and his twisted mentor, Roger Stone, have said recently, Trump and his supporters are the ones fomenting armed insurrection. As usual, they project their own aims and desires on others. Notice too, how this deflects from the lies and dereliction of this president, so I have no doubt Trump approves of what he said. This is serious, people. This kind of inflammatory rhetoric goes way beyond whether you believe in lower taxes or changes to immigration policy. The very survival of this country and its Constitutional form of government are at stake. November is our last chance to save it."

""The assistant secretary of health for public affairs told a Facebook audience without evidence that left-wing hit squads were being trained for insurrection, and he accused C.D.C. scientists of “sedition.”

And yet Americans and the world are expected to believe, trust and accept the recommendations and approvals for COVID-19 vaccines which come from this department.

Yeah, sure.  Don't mind me while I turn blue from holding my breath on this one . . .

This is probably the dumbest and equally scariest remark I've heard from this administration - this month.

And yet the Republicans remain eerily silent in the background.  Not sure if they are cowards or party to this bizarre assumption of Caputo."

2020-09-14 22:11,"He seems not to know what a venial sin is.  ""Venial"" means ""forgivable""--capable of receiving grace (VENIA in Latin).  Mr. Caputo--who, I think, should be getting therapy right now--means a ""mortal"" sin.  A sin which is unforgivable.  

What has this country come to that such a man is in high office?  

Dumb question!  Sorry.  This is Trump's America.  A land of shadows and conspiracies and wicked men tiptoeing around in cloaks and hats pulled down over their faces--so that only the eyes show.  Eyes glittering with satanic malice as they contemplate the overthrow, the subversion of--

--Sir Donald J. Trump--

--the Galahad of twentieth century America--

--""My good sword carves the casques of men,
    My tough lance thrusteth sure.
    My strength is as the strength of ten
    Because my heart is pure.. . . .""

That so utterly corrupt, so incorrigibly mendacious a President should be described in virtually the same terms as Lord Tennyson's Galahad (vide supra)--

--what in Heaven's name is our country coming to?

To repeat--

--the man should be getting therapy.  

(Along with some millions of obdurate Trump supporters.  Meaning no offense, New York Times.  None in the world.  Sorry.)"
2020-09-14 22:11,Paranoia is obviously contagious.
2020-09-14 22:11,"Here in Western New York, where Caputo resides, he's a local embarrassment. A loud, obnoxious, opinionated, trumpster right-wing braggart, like our former Congressman, Chris Collins (who continues to evade prison time, allegedly due to Covid-19 concerns), no one will be surprised when Caputo shares the same felony-conviction fate as Collins. 

Trump continually surrounds himself with people like Caputo. Sycophants, loudmouths, and compromised con artists & grifters."
2020-09-14 22:11,"Not that this is an excuse, but it is obvious that Mr. Caputo is under a lot of stress and is definitely not managing it well. He should take medical leave and get mental health help ASAP.  Although obviously, he is another of Trump's sycophants, there is something else very wrong with him. 

Having said that, why Facebook has not deleted that content and banned this man? Even though he is sick, he is also dangerous."

All hail Q! is "" where this is going"" if we don't turn this around at the election."
2020-09-14 22:12,Caputo is in the throes of a psychotic break. He is paranoid and needs psychiatric care. What is frightening is that Trump’s supporters will believe everything he says about “leftist armed insurrection.”
2020-09-14 22:12,Caputo’s rhetoric is terrifying! Sounds like this admin is the one who is forward thinking a military street war! Maybe scientists only coming out for occasional meetings is because they are heeding their own advice!

2020-09-14 22:14,Just edit that last sentence a bit; to allow people to die just to remain president is a sin.... wouldn’t the prudent thing have been - trump knowing how deadly the virus is- to have called for caution and unity by distancing and wearing masks? We could have businesses open by now! Schools! Pubs!

Your 44  followers are somewhat counterbalanced by the 144,000 dead in this country alone, most of whom could have been saved had we  an honest president in office.  As for your threats of armed uprising if trump is not re-elected, well, I guess I consider the source.  Threats of civil uprising, let alone threats to start a civil war, are exactly what our government (other than djt) are committed to stopping and if you think that federal troops will enforce a military takeover by a ""somewhat of a man"" who has dodged military service and demeaned those who serve (of which I am one) I think you grossly underestimate the seriousness of our troops when they swear to uphold the constitution of our country against all enemies ""foreign and domestic"".  Trump""s threats to not honor a legal election if it goes against him, along with threats to attempt to take a third spin at the wheel are meaningless because those of us who have served and are serving our country will not allow some rich aristocrat to overtake our government and establish an aristocracy ."

 He then spoke of “hit squads being trained all over this country”

We, from the Shadow group in our black clothes and black unmarked planes confirm Mr. Caputo's alternate fact.

We are responsible for the dark shadows in his apartment, forcing him to flee. It was simple to slip in a few pieces of chocolate cake infused with marijuana, some of the good stuff. Then we let nature takes its course.

Our hit squads are practicing day and night with bags and cans of soup, and cans of Goya beans donated by our friends and followers who cannot bear to open those cans. We will use these during the election to battle against armed groups. Be warned, these cans tend to make dents in heads, usually not a problem for Trumpistas, there's nothing in there."

He probably thinks he is just assuring Republicans will vote in November, and ignores the massacres which unstable who listen to nonsense like his to heart and try to go out and kill those who they think are threatening them."

2020-09-14 22:20,"Shortly before he died, the dictator Josef Stalin accused ""doctor saboteurs"" of a conspiracy to assassinate the Soviet leaders. Many doctors were fired from their jobs, arrested, and tortured until they confessed to being part of the ""Doctors' Plot.""

Many of the doctors were Jewish, so the purge assumed an anti-Semitic character.

After Stalin died, the leadership immediately dropped the case against the doctor-saboteurs for lack of evidence. 

I don't think America will be as lucky as the post-Stalin U.S.S.R. 

Even if Trump loses the election and Biden becomes President, Trump's agents and his crazed cult will still be spreading insane conspiracy theories. 

I think that is the doing of many Republican politicians. They needed to lie to win. They also needed the Russians, who are very good at updating anti-Semitic blood libels. 

I now understand why The U.S. Army made the Germans walk through the extermination camps and bury the bodies. They wouldn't believe it unless they had to carry those dead Jews to a mass grave.

The Trumpists should have to work in the COVID wards and dig graves for the bodies so they get a big dose of reality. 

I bet they will at least start wearing masks."

He is correct about one thing: “mental health has definitely failed.” This man's statements deserve all the condemnation that is flooding this comments forum, but he also urgently needs psychiatric attention. He needs to be relieved of duties before his looney ravings inspire some equally disturbed person with an assault weapon."

Think this guy may have lived in Russia too long. And speaking of that, what is it with Trump and clowns like Caputo with direct ties to Russia and Putin.

He then ran through a series of conspiracy theories, culminating in a prediction that Mr. Trump will win re-election but his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., will refuse to concede.

“And when Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin,” he said. “The drills that you’ve seen are nothing.” He added: “If you carry guns, buy ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it’s going to be hard to get.”

There's something seriously wrong with this picture. And with the players in it. Time to lose Trump. These people are really trying to hijack our democracy."

As a primary care physician providing direct care to my community, I am insulted and angered that incompetence and malevolence are rewarded at the highest levels of our national health care administration.   The response to COVID-19 has been mismanaged from the beginning by this administration.  A government official calling for armed insurrection as a response to a democratic election is unfathomable. 

Caputo sounds like he's calling for help - he should be removed from his position immediately. 
 
Every health care worker, researcher, and organization should stand together in opposition to Caputo's endorsement of fascism."
2020-09-14 22:25,"Caputo is going to be relieved of his official duties, right?

I mean, any functioning democracy has to remove public servants once they start displaying obvious signs of mental instability, paranoia, and delusion. This has to be especially true if the office holder was obviously inadequate for the job prior to the self-confessed revelations of his mental state.

The great country of America, beacon of liberty, and champion of democracy, will purge it's ranks of people like Caputo and get back to the business of responsible governance, won't it?

If there are any more individuals in government who were so obviously ill-suited and inadequate for their jobs, and displaying symptoms of paranoia, mental instability and delusion, or worse, having all that and inciting armed domestic conflict, and even worse, all that and having horrible hair, they should be removed as well.

Shouldn't they?

In a functioning democracy?

What's the hold-up?"
2020-09-14 22:25,"The president holds rallies and events where people do not socially distance and where few wear masks. How can he say he is doing or did everything. He is encouraging people to do nothing. It is interesting that the science tweaker in this article at least tells people to wear masks. Presumably, he sees the real death numbers."
2020-09-14 22:27,This is projection at its most extreme.  Caputo’s rantings will be added to Qanon’s delusional platform and Trump’s crazied base will rejoice; for having more reasons to hate scientists and Democrats.  Trump’s unhinged appointees very much want to steer this election to a violent end.

Those who kept voting for Republicans anyway for the simple reason that they wanted a few more grubby pennies in their pocket just decided to ignore the increasingly open insanity, bigotry, racism, and anti-intellectualism of Republicans.

Dr. Scott has walked the line thus far not jumping down on one side or the other until that statement when he blamed China for lying about the severity of the disease and that as a result, the medical experts, though they knew it was a serious, airborne, highly contagious and virulent disease, didn’t have the data to think that it had come to the US!

2020-09-14 22:39,The HHS spokesman seems to have some mental health problems.
2020-09-14 22:41,"Yes, Caputo is most likely mentally ill. Unfortunately, it appears some of what Caputo is spouting comes from a big wig televangelist’s 2019 book that was advocating for violence in 2020.  One of the saddest things about this particular Evangelical is that he too is actually mentally ill. 

His daughter had made various public appeals to him to discontinue his hateful rhetoric— apparently to no avail.  In one of his books he shared his belief that his mother’s schizophrenia was “cured by God.” He has also ranted about the need for “Christians to prepare for a second civil war ... with the Canadians and Mexicans.” 

SMH! I have no understanding of Evangelicals who hold the Bible in one hand while preaching violence. 

How did the Republicans allow so many seriously mentally ill individuals to take over their party?"
2020-09-14 22:42,"This is how democracy dies. Praise right-wing, white supremacist/neo-fascist demonstrators. tell your followers it's OK to respond to protesters with violence (wink, wink). Invent dark forces, robbing his supporters of their right to total power. Claim election fraud before the fact, if he doesn't win. Spin fantasies of imaginary ""antifa"" and ""far left"" insurrection, to justify right-wing violence and insurrection. There will be blood."
2020-09-14 22:42,One word. YIKES.
2020-09-14 22:44,It appears as if Pol Pot regime is here.
2020-09-14 22:44,"Dear Mr. Caputo,
Get a hold of yourself man. You are clearly losing your grip. A calm level head and clear thinking is what is needed in these trying times. You appear to need time away from the fray to regain some perspective and equilibrium."
2020-09-14 22:41,this is Murdoch's mess. That guy needs to be publically tried for sedition and stripped of his citizenship.
2020-09-14 22:38,Mental illness is a very sad thing. Here is hoping Mr. Caputo gets the help he so obviously needs.
2020-09-14 22:39,"Where does Trump find these people?  He's seeing shadows on his ceiling and is afraid to be alone.  He needs to be given psychiatric treatment, not a government job and a forum to spout his nonsense."
2020-09-14 22:42,"This is why Trump has no fear of the 25th Amendment.

Every person in his Cabinet is exactly like this poor, deluded cultist.

The 25th Amendment requires the Vice-President and over half of the Cabinet to sign the letter that the president is unfit to serve.

This man, Caputo, gets a good laugh every day because he knows that not one of the Cabinet is qualified and also, not one of the members will ever sign a letter to get rid of Trump.
After all, where else could he get a cushy job with all of the benefits?
No where.
No one would even hirer him to be their used-car salesman.

Yup.
This is just how low that Trump and his Republicans have dragged this government down. 

It's a cult."
2020-09-14 22:44,Caputo is just another in a long line of Trump hacks with a lot of Russian and Ukrainian entries on their resumes. Notice a pattern? Anyone?
2020-09-14 22:45,Caputo is Trump's official gaslighter on the taxpayers payroll.
2020-09-14 22:38,"With fully half the nation still supporting Trump and his kind in Congress and throughout the nation, we are at the end of nation. There is no point in remaining in the nation any longer. When a political crony of Trump's tries to lay the fantasy story of anti-gun Democrats wanting to revolt, you know the propaganda is now meant to set the stage for their insane revolution under false pretenses. It always was this way. Leave the nation. There is danger here. At least be fully prepared to do so if you question me."
2020-09-14 22:42,"'Michael Caputo, the assistant secretary of health for public affairs, told a Facebook audience without evidence that left-wing hit squads were being trained for insurrection, and he accused C.D.C. scientists of “sedition.”'

There's virtually no chance of armed insurrection by Democrats. Depending on how rigged Trump's re-election effort proves to be, there could easily be mass demonstrations and strikes similar to those seen after the illegitimate re-election of the president in Belarus.

The real threat from Michael Caputo comes from right wing nuts who take him seriously. Many are already armed and some are unstable enough to act out on unsubstantiated claims. 

As I've written before, Trump and his minions will risk burning the place down in their efforts to win re-election. Men like Trump and Caputo are already dangerous but there's still nearly two months left until election day. 

Buckle up."
2020-09-14 22:42,"It is clear that Trump and his men are prepping their base, telling them to prepare, to arm themselves. Would be interesting to see some statistics of firearm purchases over the last few months. I think we all could see this scenario last year when Trump said ""I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough—until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.”

He has pointed out the enemies for a long time and now he wants his base to know that his, theirs, enemies are armed.  

Do we really need to guess how this will end?"
2020-09-14 22:48,Those of us who were smart enough to see the dangers of a trump presidency purchased our ammo long ago!
2020-09-14 22:48,"The Russians know that the next two months are their best chance ever to continue with their influence over America. They have installed their puppet regime and their only fear is losing that to Biden. They will pull out all the stops from now until Inauguration Day to keep Trump in tandem power with Putin. Their disinformation campaign is full speed ahead, employing the ""useful idiot"" Caputo, who sees shadows on his ceilings, and who holds some mysterious credibility with the Trumpistas. This will be a troubling few weeks but will seem like the good old days if the disinformation campaign is successful. Oh, is there a pandemic now?"
2020-09-14 22:48,"So it’s ok for Trump to put politically motivated people in office, but not democrats.  Ok"
2020-09-14 22:49,Are we sure that isn’t James Spader punking us? I hope it’s James Spader punking us.
2020-09-14 22:49,"Maybe the D.C. Police should find Mr. Cavuto and take him to the hospital. He is really paranoid. He thinks people are going to kill him, but this is probably projection. I think he is suicidal."
2020-09-14 22:49,Is there a competition to see which member of the administration can act the craziest?
2020-09-14 22:50,Id ask mr caputo if hes not going to take his little pills to send them to me. I really need something right now— stories like this are making me see things when I look up and I dont like it a bit.
2020-09-14 22:46,"Two things occur to me after reading this poor man's words:

He is deeply distressed by the pressures of the job he has undertaken. His dark paranoid feelings of persecution he correctly identifies as emanating from the trauma of daily dealing with death statistics. He needs help and should resign from this job he is not mentally equipped to perform.

Alternatively, the flight of ideas and paranoic delusions of conspiracy may well be an artifice. Perhaps he sees a future as President for life of Belarus. Because that is where we see other such mad thoughrs being floated."
2020-09-14 22:46,"Trump, et. al are dangerous people. America is in a frightening place, and falling. Assuming he does not win, it is four months until inauguration day. Look at the damage he has done in the last four months. Look at the last month. It is accelerating. The idea that someone with these beliefs can be ""the top communications official at the Department of Health and Human Services"" in the USA is unfathomable. 

I hope for all of us that there is no chance this maniac can win a second term."
2020-09-14 22:49,"I find this beyond disturbing. He should be removed from his post, absolutely. But he also needs help; he's clearly having an episode of some kind."
2020-09-14 22:54,"I must ask seriously, is this man on drugs? That's the only ""logic"" I can think of for this Trump mouthpiece's ravings. It is nauseating to think that he is paid to fabricate bogus conspiracy theories with our tax dollars - and worse, that some gullible sick citizens will believe his lies."
2020-09-14 22:54,"And here we are, not only dying under his Hoax-Virus Diversion, but unable to shelter him in an asylum.
The tale of Persecution is hilarious. Straight, unadorned Lives of the Saints."
2020-09-14 22:55,"You can always tell what nefarious what nefarious things Republicans are cooking up, because they accuse the “radical left” of them.  He tells us that the left is plotting violence, and then tells his followers to buy ammunition."
2020-09-14 22:58,This guy would be right at home at the psychiatric facility I work at for the past 26 years.  While these dangerous knuckleheads are trying to bring down the democracy real Americans are going to work everyday taking care of others.  Working to fuel a fire that leads to violence makes him a dangerous person who has no business working in government.  What if my trumpy neighbors decide my husband and I are the enemy?  Will they decide we need to be taken into custody?  I will go to bed tonight more frightened than usual.
2020-09-14 22:55,"Again, where is the Republican leadership? Where is their sense of duty to stop the madness? 
Are they that terrified of the 35% that belong to the Trump Cult? 
The GOP has taken  NRA lobby money and donations for decades and in return got  part of this country all worked up about owning as many guns as possible and fearing "" the libs"" were out to get them. 
Is the GOP actually afraid of their own base..what will happen if they don't go along with madness?  

I cannot explain how half of elected officials have completely abdicated their  responsibility to uphold the constitution and protect our democracy...for this guy?  We are being ruled by a minority, its armed mob, and a mob boss.

Who in the current Republican Party will be brave, speak up  and break away publicly?"
2020-09-14 22:56,"New Reality TV Show:  MAGA Gone Crazy !  Will they be Fired, Institutionalized or Promoted ???   Viewers will decide."
2020-09-14 22:55,"My head shakes. I am so ashamed as I think about Donald Trump and his minions, leading us.....forward?

And yet, the solution may be at hand. From the Democrats, I want it all. Economic. Environmental. Restore the U.S. as a leader for good. I could go on.

From Donald Trump, I ask for only one thing:

Be gone and stay gone."
2020-09-14 22:53,"My compassion for the mentally ill stops at the point where they've become deadly dangers to people. Hitler was probably mentally ill too, but his salient behavioral trait, the one requiring the world's immediate and full attention, was that he was a mass murderer.

This guy should seek professional psychiatric help, but first he needs to be fired."
2020-09-14 22:56,"“To allow people to die so that you can replace the president is a grievous venial sin, venial sin.”

Venial? Not only is he plumb crazy, his theology's off, too."
2020-09-14 22:57,"Is this real life? Am I actually reading something this insane in the New York Times?

I posted a comment on another story here a few days ago, saying that much of the news coming out of the US these days feels like a cross between a David Lynch film and an issue of The Onion.

But wow. Yeah, this particular article is more like something out of a bad acid trip.

I really feel for those of you south of our border who are still inhabiting the same reality as I am. Those who have the means should strongly consider getting out while you still can. It looks like post-November 3rd America is probably going to be pretty nightmarish for a while, regardless of who wins the election."
2020-09-14 22:59,"The only person who is a seditionist is Caputo. He is attempting to sound reasonable but he sounding more like a QAnon member.   This is all a game to them with their deep-state conspiracy theories. They tell the same lie over and over until people start to wonder what the truth is anymore. This is called ""gaslighting."" They prey on the insecure and the vulnerable and make them believe that, ""if you only follow us you will be empowered. You will get to shoot your gun and killed some bad guys which we will identify for you."" And of course these enemies are the ones controlling ""Antifa"" and ""Black Lives Matter."" They then just include the Democrats into this amorphous , enemies list. Caputo should be asked to leave government immediately. He is a ""Clear and Present Danger!"""
2020-09-14 23:00,"Good grief, we've live in a banana republic.

VOTE!!!!!!!"
2020-09-14 23:01,I suggest an emergent psychiatric evaluation for Mr. Caput(o)
2020-09-14 23:02,"A CALL TO PROTEST--PLEASE SHARE

Our original intention with this call was to get the signatures of academics, political activists, organizers and others known to various elements of the US public. However, given the urgency of the moment, it seems best just to put it out there in the hope that it will inspire people in the United States to begin organizing among their friends and acquaintances to protest any potential Trumpist theft of the upcoming US election. So, please read this, share it far and wide, and get a group together to protest if/when the need arises.—Peter Bohmer and Ron Jacobs

******************************************************

This is a call to the people of the United States who believe in fair elections, wish to preserve what remains of our democratic process and want to join the struggle for a nation where democracy and justice come before profits.

It is becoming clearer with each passing day that the Trump administration and its supporters in Congress, the government bureaucracy and certain state capitals do not intend to let all eligible voters in the US vote in the November presidential elections. They are tampering with the mail, lying about mail-in ballots, practicing various types of voter suppression, and generally laying the foundation for a rejection of any outcome that does not give Donald Trump a popular and electoral victory.

Understanding the high stakes involved, it is time for those in the US to act. It is imperative we protest in"
2020-09-14 22:58,This smells of Stephen miller’s style of inciting violence pure and simple. Caputo’s  mentor is roger stone - and that’s all we need to know about this kind of garbage.
2020-09-14 22:59,49 days to the election. Vote these clowns out.
2020-09-14 22:59,"I pay taxes to employ Michael Caputo & want my money back. Well, maybe I'd donate it to pay for a straitjacket, padded cell and horse tranquilizer to calm him down. He is wildly demented. Or else -- just a thought -- he's perfectly sane, if not too bright, and working to whip up the locked and loaded ""base."" God help us."
2020-09-14 23:04,He is right.  He has suffered a complete mental breakdown.   He needs to be hospitalized.
2020-09-14 22:59,"Yeah, I'd say his mental health has definitely gone downhill if this is his current level of reasoning."
2020-09-14 23:01,"What Caputo should be focusing on...


""China’s legion of rogue scientists is certainly a worry. But gene-editing technology has become so accessible that we could conceivably see teenagers experimenting with viruses. 

""In the United States, anyone who wants to start modifying the genome in their garage can order a do-it-yourself CRISPR kit online for $169, for example. 

""This comes with “everything you need to make precision genome edits in bacteria at home.” For $349, the same company is also offering a human engineering kit, which comes with embryonic kidney cells from a tissue culture originally taken from an aborted female human fetus. 

""Shipment is advertised to take no longer than three days—no special couriers or ice packs needed.""

2020-09-14 23:03,"Well, at least now you know, and at the next press conference you'll have your hip boots on... 

""A longtime Trump loyalist with no background in health care""
That pretty much explains the whole ridiculous outburst, and shows Mr. Caputo has absolutely no business being at a senior-level position at the DHHS. 

Trumpian kakistocracy at it's finest!"
2020-09-14 23:04,"And to think, even this likely isn't the bottom."
2020-09-14 23:00,"Gee, I am shocked. republicans have no interest in truth. Since they own the country, we are doomed."
2020-09-14 23:03,For almost 48 months this has just been crazy. Now it's getting dangerous. Trump does not believe in the law. He believes the law is for chumps and that the only thing that matters is what he can get away with. He has filled out government with those who are either conspiracy theorists or people who have no problem using conspiracies to incite violence. Never in my very lucky life did I ever think I would witness the US implode. And all because of a pathological reality show host and his enablers. I'm sure the founders thought of a million ways the country could fail. I'm sure they never thought it would be this easy.
2020-09-14 22:59,"I was stunned but hardly surprised by the revelation from Mr Caputo. This inanity from a high level Executive Branch public servant yet chilled me to the bone.  Why he hasn't been asked to step down and/or to seek psychiatric care is utterly beyond me. The sad truth though appears to be that this is the norm for many in the trump administration as well as his endlessly fawning syconphants(think Cotton, Graham, McConnell, Pence and a host of others). How this is allowed to stand in 2020 is nothing short of baffling. Still, what can any of us do. Voting, of course, will be a necessary step, but I am not at all certain that there will be not violence regardless of the outcome, all the worse should the abomination currently occupying the white house lose to a far better, but still, so very wanting opponent. Never in my life as an American have I felt so much to be at risk, and with people like Mr Caputo fouling the levers of power with their delusions while at the same moment receiving tacit support for those delusions, how can we possibly right the ship at this late juncture. Keep your eyes open, pay attention, the enemy is not only at the gates, he is widely populating the castle."
2020-09-14 23:04,"Is there not a doctor, or a family member, or a friend, or a priest, or even a Republican politician, who can step in to help Mr. Caputo, who clearly is having a major mental health failing.

Allowing him to remain in his current communications role is dangerous to Mr. Caputo and to our country..

This seems obvious."
2020-09-14 23:05,"This NYT article only touches on Caputo's Russian affiliated bio and ties. His name sounded familiar but I had to go elsewhere to read about him. I know there's a rush to publish, but providing more background on Caputo would shed light on his serious threat to our democracy. This is a disservice to readers."
2020-09-14 23:07,Why does that Trump cult attract so many crackpots?
2020-09-14 23:07,"Michael Caputo was a long-time Republican operative, an associate of Roger Stone who had worked for Russia’s Gasprom Media to improve the image of Vladimir Putin in the U.S."
2020-09-14 23:07,"Funny how Michael Caputo hasn’t made it to any of Gail’s “Whose the Worst” columns but today he has risen in the rankings to certainly hit a top ten slot.  That is a pretty amazing accomplishment given all the competition .  Kudos Mr Caputo, I am sure Putin will reward you."
2020-09-14 23:07,"Mr. Caputo is trafficking in propaganda that causes death on a massive scale -- as a side-effect of Donald Trump's short-term political messaging.

There should be a warning label."
2020-09-14 23:05,It is not the left that wants armed insurrection.
2020-09-14 23:06,"A lot of the commenters here are justly alarmed at Caputo’s calls to insurrection.  I agree but think the main story is his psychotic break, probably not the 1st in his life, but maybe his 1st during a Facebook event.  The delusions of the mentally ill still borrow from the idiom and culture at large, hence the particulars of Caputo’s ravings.  If he were in the Duterte administration he’d probably be foaming about drug dealers.  What I’m trying to say is please do not conflate Caputo’s particulars with intent on his part."
2020-09-14 23:06,And let's remember to thank Facebook for its principled stand against misinformation on its site.
2020-09-14 23:06,"Caputo: '“there are hit squads being trained all over this country” to mount armed opposition to a second term for Mr. Trump. “You understand that they’re going to have to kill me, and unfortunately, I think that’s where this is going,” Mr. Caputo added""'

This person is sick. Admittedly, there are ""militias"" all over the United States. But they were formed to protect us against our government. Lately they have been reconfigured to protect us against people of color moving to the suburbs and to protect our 45th president's incompetent tenure.
In an earlier day they would have been dressed in white sheets  and conical helmets with eye holes armed with tar and feathers and pistols. Trading their sheets for flak vests and AR-15s they won't even were a simple face mask to protect  themselves from each other and not to mention us, if they have a job the requires public contact when not in militia dress.

I would urge Mr. Caputo to seek psychiatric help. Working for the government he must have health insurance that will cover the cost."
2020-09-14 23:07,Far-Right playbook alert: Throw out wild claims against the Left that are in fact what you are planning to do. I hope those in power are listening. The far right is in the House and is signaling its armed followers to prepare to take over after the election.
2020-09-14 23:07,"It is clear that Mr. Caputo's mental health has deteriorated to the extent that he needs emergency psychiatric care.  His wild, paranoid statements, recommendations for ammunition purchase, and visual hallucinations (long shadows) need urgent evaluation in the ER.  He will likely be eligible for a psych admission since he clearly seems to be a danger to himself or others.   The last thing he should be trusted with is the health of the American people."
2020-09-14 23:06,"This article only touches on Caputo's Russian affiliated bio and ties. His name sounded familiar but I had to go elsewhere to read about him. I know there's a rush to publish, but providing more background on Caputo would shed light on his serious threat to our democracy. This is a disservice to readers."
2020-09-14 23:07,"Well, taking on board what Caputo is saying, logic tells me there are only two possibilities.  Either Caputo is completely insane and presently in a florid delusional state, in which case he should clearly not continue in office.  Or he is sane, or at least still marginally attached to reality, and is deliberately putting out these whacko conspiracy theories in the hope that they will be believed by some of the more delusional Trump supporters.

The second alternative is really the most disturbing.  The absolute moral bankruptcy of it all is difficult to fathom.  Especially with his urging of those people to arm themselves and stock up on ammunition in preparation for when Biden tries to take office.  If I was tending to the paranoid myself, I could say that it sounds like Caputo is ""setting up"" a scenario where Trump refuses to concede a loss in a democratic election and calls on his armed supporters to come to his aid.

The Trump crew has already trashed so many of the traditional conventions of government and so many of the great traditional institutions of US life (including the CDC).  Are they moving to try to usher in a new post-democratic USA?  There is no doubt that much of the Trump strategy is to appeal to a certain authoritarian, even proto-fascist, personality type.  It just staggers me that so many Americans find this despicable man appealing."
2020-09-14 23:17,"“If you carry guns, buy ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it’s going to be hard to get,” he urged his followers.
...
C.D.C. scientists “haven’t gotten out of their sweatpants except for meetings at coffee shops” to plot “how they’re going to attack Donald Trump next,” Mr. Caputo said. “There are scientists who work for this government who do not want America to get well, not until after Joe Biden is president.”
...
“And when Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin,” he said. “The drills that you’ve seen are nothing.”
...
“there are hit squads being trained all over this country” to mount armed opposition to a second term for Mr. Trump. “You understand that they’re going to have to kill me, and unfortunately, I think that’s where this is going,” Mr. Caputo added.

Michael ""Long Shadows"" Caputo's political musings as an assistant nut job at HHS are not appreciated.

baa-naa-NAAS!!! boat off the premises."
2020-09-14 23:21,"Poor Caputo, a man with a BA being the top communication official at the HHS agency, is complaining that his mental health is failing because the mean press is attacking him.

Caputo's has as few grey cells under his short hair as does his Lord and Master under his orange fox.

Logical and abstract thinking escapes them, making both of them completely mentally unfit to even teach a class of 1st graders."

From the lying ""press secretary"" telling the nation that FBI agents often complained to her about Comey and then had to deny it under oath to the Special Counsel, to the Alternate Reality Queen, now to the Assistant Secretary whatever.

All these cronies of the hump view any opportunity to deal with the US public as merely a forum to openly lie."
2020-09-14 23:17,"*This* is what those of us who live in NY 27th congressional district have had to deal with.  Now all of America gets to see how Michael Caputo acts.  

After our now convicted felon Republican ex-congressman Chris Collins proudly said that he would never hold a town meeting with his constituents, some people in the Buffalo area banded together and put up a billboard (like Where's Waldo) asking ""Where's Chris?""  Michael Caputo responded by putting up his own billboard claiming that poor Collins was being attacked by people who had ulterior motives - yeah the constituents who were being ignored.  

Michael Caputo was also involved in Donald Trump's shady dealings in his failed attempt to buy the Buffalo Bills.

I think he actually understated it. It's way beyond incompetence and general awfulness. They are trying to destroy the government that they work for."
2020-09-14 23:17,This extremist diatribe is reminiscent of supporters of past and existing fascist/authoritarian regimes.  Wake up America!  Democracy is fragile.  What we have taken for granted can disappear - the edges of our Republic have been fraying in the Trump world.  Now we are seeing huge holes that will be harder to mend.

How can the left wing-so sissified and desirous of allowing boys to weardresses to school, be training a giant black or brown shirt militia, and still be the left? If any such group was buying up guns and bullets, training it's members to shoot civilians from skyscrapers and doing all the awful things to which humans are prone-then they would have become Republicans or libertarians and probably have changed their voter registration.

Trump is desperately hoping he can get just this: either to hijack the election - or punish the nation for not electing him.

It’s his kingdom, and he’s made it clear he will destroy it if he can’t keep it. He’s even gunning for “eight more years,” a Putin like takeover of the presidency.

It’s all part of the narrative that Trump has pushed ever harder, which is now openly supported by his administration - even against overwhelming signs of the counter forces of hard reality: All forces, voices, polls, that indicate that he’s profoundly unpopular, always has been, and is not likely to win - are false, and   part of some secret Left wing conspiracy.

Tragically, as we have seen with the Post Office destruction, and Trump’s obsession with voter fraud... even as he calls for his followers to vote twice, their is extensive fraud being planned - but it’s all being done by Trump.

I believe Trump really wants his followers to vote twice - AND be caught at it! That way he can shriek “Voter Fraud!” - and attempt to invalidate the election. The fact that it’s his campaign doing the fraud, and his supporters that will face prison, matters not at all to him.

Trump believes he needs the fire of fraud and chaos to win. If he has to set it himself, he will!"

Am I alone in thinking Caputo's madness, focused on armed anti Trump troops, is an invitation to armed pro Trump militias?
Has Caputo have violated the Constitution? Article I, Section 8, Clause 15:The Congress shall have Power . . . To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; . . .  

Well, just because I think he's inciting insurrection doesn't mean that will wash with a judge.

Let's conjure ourselves up a dark deep state,
And proclaim it must all be rot.

But these to tell what's true.

2020-09-15 2:40,"OK Mr. Caputo, repeat after me: person, woman, man, camera, TV. 

Apparently the covfefe has finally hit the fan."
2020-09-15 2:31,Our government has rotted from the top down.  The states with the largest health departments should band together to form a “CDC in exile” and hire away the CDC scientists in order to preserve the essential talent that we so badly need right now.
2020-09-15 2:59,"It’s not surprising that Caputo’s mental health is under great duress. Caputo has spent most of his career being a propagandist — starting with Reagan, to sell his support of the contra rebels’ cause against liberation movements in Central America. He also advised Putin on how to cleanse his public image. So he’s used to contorting what really is true, to conform to his clients’ worldviews and to make their image appear as if they are in control.  

This is not working with the coronavirus - his attempts to massage the perception of its supposed management by Trump is running too much into hard science. Not being able to move the needle, he’s beginning to come unglued because the intersection of the sphere of reality and that of his perceptive worldview is a tiny sliver.  This is one species of insanity. It’s resulting in his demonizing scientists with stellar reputations of integrity."
2020-09-15 3:07,"If THIS isn't enough to get SOME Republicans who STILL retain some sanity and/or decency and respect for our nation and our constitution to demand that Michael R. Caputo step down from his position IMMEDIATELY, then I truly have no idea what would be enough. 

Are there ANY Republican elected officials, anywhere, who can look at this and still stay silent? I hope not. We'll soon see."
2020-09-15 2:48,"Caputo sounds a lot like the insane general played by Sterling Hayden in ""Dr. Strangelove."" His character was all in on starting a nuclear war, and his rationale was ""to protect his own personal bodily fluids."" If Caputo's ""thinking"" is representative of the current logic in the Trump administration, we are in a very deep world of hurt."
2020-09-15 2:52,"We had a somber remembrance of the events on 9/11.  It’s the right thing to do.  However, I consider the administration’s response to the pandemic to be an act of domestic terrorism.  Unconscionable ignorance has pervaded our highest levels of government.  Over sixty times the number of fatalities that occurred on 9/11 are due to COV-19, yet at this moment we look at that through the lens of partisan nostalgia."
2020-09-15 0:33,"In a psychiatric evaluation, his ideas (and governing) would best be described as paranoid and persecutory delusions. The CDC's reports are being influenced by someone who appears to be in a very public psychiatric decompensation."
2020-09-15 2:58,"All, please vote! This is so crazy, how do these folks continue to represent us or our great nation?"
2020-09-15 3:22,The silence from Republicans is deafening.  Vote against all of them.
2020-09-15 2:00,this administration is frightening. either way the election goes... november will be insane.
2020-09-15 2:21,"This is the height of insanity and danger to our citizens and our country.  Caputo must go. Trump must go.  It’s time for the GOP to stand up and say ‘Enough!’  
Save our democracy for all Americans and for your children."
2020-09-15 2:51,"I say this as a mental health professional: This man needs help, and he needs it quickly."
2020-09-15 0:31,"Thank you to all the dedicated scientists and medical professionals who have worked to keep all of us safe and informed about COVID-19 and what we can and should do to contain this contagion.  Thank you, again!  Michael Caputo is, apparently, a troubled and delusional person who is not competent to do the job he currently holds.  This is, unfortunately, the state of our federal government under Donald Trump. Such a shame!"
2020-09-15 3:40,Where do they find people like Caputo? Mental health in the US must be in a real crisis when they let people like him out of clinics.
2020-09-15 2:40,"Isn't it just as possible, more so than he's gone completely mad, that he feels staging a nervous breakdown is his only way out of a position that, if he stays, will in the end put him behind bars for a very long time."
2020-09-15 3:14,Over the last couple of days I have finally come to the realization that we are in a civil war.  Literally.
2020-09-15 3:12,These conspiracy theories are not far from what many supposed mainstream republicans think- that democrats are instituting lockdowns just to hurt Trump. It’s a scary echo chamber motivated by fear of “identity politics” which challenge white supremacy.
2020-09-15 1:49,There are two ominous takeaways from this piece.  The call to gather ammunition by Caputo and the Roger Stone quote on declaration of marital law if Trump loses.
2020-09-15 2:28,"""In the Spring when it gets warmer it will go away.  It will magically disappear.""  Trump on COVID-19.

""It will start getting cooler.  Just watch.""  Trump on Global warming and climate change.

Well, yes, it is autumn and winter is coming, but....

Now we have Caputo and his delirious predictions, along with people who trust he and Trump are not only serious, but worthy of belief.

Far more likely than Trump's predictions is a right-wing militia terrorizing this country and engaging with the military if Trump is not re-elected.  And that should scare everyone, not just the suburbanites that Trump has been trying to frighten."
2020-09-15 3:28,It seems likely that NO high ranking person in the administration can avoid some form of the nervous break down this man obviously is having. Up is down. True is false. Paranoia is rampant. ‘Shadows on the walls’?  They are all projecting. They see plots because this administration is a plot.
2020-09-15 2:23,"Sadly, Caputo is a moderate Trump supporter compared to some."
2020-09-15 1:31,"Michael Caputo must be removed from our Government.  I just watched a report on Rachel Maddow’s show.  No one at the CDC should have to report to Mr. Caputo.  He is clearly out of his element, and possibly in need of  a psychiatrist. And that is the best I can say about this man.  The CDC must not be politicized.  We must be able to count on their reports as accurate and true.
We must also consider the mental health of a President who allows Mr. Caputo to be in this position."
2020-09-15 1:44,"As a former Army Infantry leader, both enlisted and officer, I know of no trained squads that will mount an armed insurrection. What should concern everyone is the fact that we have elected a terribly unqualified Commander-In Chief and enabled him to surround himself with equally incompetent leaders who create their own narrative. Trump did not “drain the swamp”, he made it worse. As a soldier, I swore to defend the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. We need to end partisan politics for partisan purposes nowe! The time for change is now; get out and vote “Country Over Party”."
2020-09-15 1:50,"""Trump Health Aide Pushes Bizarre Conspiracies and Warns of Armed Revolt"". If Caputo has information and supported by evidence, to all what he is saying, why does he not report them to the F.B.I.?
What is appalling is that, as expected, we do not see questions from any of the GOP members in the House."
2020-09-15 2:09,"Trump is desparate; at this point he will do ANYTHING  to remain in office.  It is imperative that every thinking American finds a way to vote in the upcoming election.  Get your absentee ballot and send it in early, or get to the voting place in the morning after a good breakfast (in case it's a long wait).  We MUST ELECT BIDEN and HARRIS for the good of our nation!"
2020-09-15 2:20,"Remember that the incompetence and inappropriateness of this administration’s appointees is no accident. They are each intended to fail miserably, to bring the walls down around them and utterly destroy the public’s faith in government programs and institutions. Enough of that plan has been explicitly stated by Trump’s handlers for us to have no doubts. They mean to end the democratic experiment. The revolution is already happening."
2020-09-15 3:25,"If a friend shared his paranoid fears about evil medical doctors and researchers plotting to kill Americans, how he's haunted by long shadows on the ceiling and opened up about his deteriorating mental health, I would strongly encourage him to get counseling. But since it's just one of the people appointed by President Trump to run our country, I'll do nothing and read the next story, as I've done so often the past few years."
2020-09-15 3:13,Caputo's right; his “mental health has definitely failed.”
2020-09-15 3:15,This is what is meant by the banality of evil
2020-09-15 1:08,"Future generations will record that 2020 was the year the Republican Party flushed the United States of America down the toilet. Caputo is just a symptom of the greater problem; sycophancy, complicity, and a surrender to tyranny and autocracy. RIP USA."
2020-09-15 3:44,"The worst part is that MAGA Trump supporters will believe all this, if they don’t already.  And they’re well-armed, between NRA supporters, militias (which are all right-wing and somehow ‘patriotic’) and neo-nazis already implanted in law and order (as revealed over the past year).

This is the sad (and terrifying) state of this Trumpocracy (a direct descendant of the GOP, which has trafficked lies, conspiracy theories and gerrymandered well beyond usual politics), taking our democracy in its descent.

For now the only safe heaven is the liberal community I am fortunate to live in.  But should Trump win, how much longer can the remnants of democracy hold on?

It should no longer surprise anyone that Nazis came to power in Germany.  They also brought it to its ulterior downfall."
2020-09-15 3:22,The scientists should sue him for slander.   Class action. They’ve got it in the bag.
2020-09-15 3:53,"Okay. I’ve had enough of this ride. Can someone please stop it now and let me off? Seriously, I need to get off before I puke or pass out.

(At this very moment, I’m actually feeling fatigued, have a headache, and maybe the start of a sore throat. I’m not kidding about this. I don’t have an elevated temp (yet), but I don’t feel quite right. I hope it’s because I haven’t been sleeping well for the past few days, but I fear that it’s early symptoms of COVID. My wife will be sleeping in another bedroom until I get tested.)

Take Care, everyone."
2020-09-15 3:24,"Caputo is being driven around the bend by Covid-19s' refusal to engage in partisan politics...and now, bereft and alone, he exorcises his demons and excorciates his enemies...then deletes his account.
(The Salt Must Flow! meme goes here.)"
2020-09-15 1:34,Michael Caputo is essentially making terroristic threats against the CDC.  I do not want my tax dollars employing this person.
2020-09-15 3:38,"Oh my goodness, this man needs help. More proof that trumpism has serious mental health effects."
2020-09-15 3:57,"Good GOD! This particular “communications” person has suffered an obvious break with sanity. Why is he still on the job? This whole administration is becoming increasingly unstable—will we survive until the election? At long last, after almost a full term, I am sincerely concerned for our future. 

November 3rd can’t get here soon enough."
2020-09-15 4:27,"Clearly, we have seen evidence that there is nothing Republicans won't do to put their thumb on the scales of democracy. Including not-so-subtly coded language encouraging outright intimidation and violence. As if life wasn't scary enough right now. To reiterate the points made in recent op-eds, our only hope now is an irrefutable landslide even in states that don't normally matter. Let's do this."
2020-09-15 4:27,"Respectfully, Mr. Caputo needs to be put on medical leave and undergo psychiatric and general medical
evaluations.

If Mr. Caputo has a medical or psychiatric disorder, he should be treated while on medical leave.

If Mr, Caputo is given a clean bill of health, he should resign for having advocated armed insurrection."
2020-09-15 3:52,"Caputo also added, ""I watched a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor. That's my dream; that's my nightmare. Crawling, slithering, along the edge of a straight razor... and surviving."""
2020-09-15 4:26,"The key qualifications of scientists do not include loyalty to any person. Scientists must be loyal to the facts, not to their bosses. My 35  years in research chemistry proved to me that bosses come and go, but science moves on."
2020-09-15 4:07,"“A longtime Trump loyalist with no background in health care,” who imagines cabals plotting against him, dreads the long shadows on his ceiling, and exhorts his followers to arm themselves to the teeth. It has been almost four years of this, day after day after day, yet this guy heralds a whole new low."
2020-09-15 4:38,"My first inclination was, and I thought I watched too many episodes of the X-Files. But then there was this:
. . . He then ran through a series of conspiracy theories, culminating in a prediction that Mr. Trump will win re-election but his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., will refuse to concede.
“And when Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin,” he said. “The drills that you’ve seen are nothing.” He added: “If you carry guns, buy ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it’s going to be hard to get.”
A public call to armed insurrection. Another instance of mental instability in this administration or a shrewd gambit to consolidate power and reliable extra-military forces around Trump? I know General Milley said the election will be decided at the polls and/or in the courts, but that was before high ranking administration officials were issuing calls to supporters to arm themselves and prepare to go to civil war. Who is it that took the oath to protect the Constitution against all enemies, foreign AND domestic? Not him, someone who takes it seriously."
2020-09-15 4:41,"My mouth is still open over this one.  I mean, I had heard there was some ""sugar coating"" of reports, manipulation of numbers, etc. coming out of CDC to make things a bit more positive than they actually were.  But in my non-scientific layperson thought,  I have assumed the CDC was this vast, world-renowned institution of smart scientists and their understudies who have fairly common goals based on tedious and boring science that's the source of info that health care professionals/networks rely on to make treatment decisions, among lots of other things CDC does. Basically, an apolitical clearinghouse of health info. I still feel that way. Don't most of us feel that way?

What is Caputo's endgame here?  This is insane. Jonestown, anyone?"
2020-09-15 2:21,"Can someone please, I’m begging, tell me how this man and his administration expresses anything close to what the majority of our country believes. I don’t see it.."
2020-09-15 0:56,"Here's fervently hoping that on January 20, 2021, we will hear Biden taking the oath of office. And I don't think the following line would be inappropriate as the first sentence: By dint of the vote not only of the Electoral College, but of the majority of Americans [we can hope & dream, can't we], today our Republic returns to full democratic rule."
2020-09-15 2:51,"Another very stable genius. Trump must be like a magnet to them - with the stable genius in chief attracting other stable geniuses. Otherwise, where does Trump keep finding these geniuses?"
2020-09-15 2:23,It's time for Mr. Caputo to resign. Past time.
2020-09-15 2:06,He needs to resign immediately...send some time with his family. The pressure of the inexorably lying to the public has broken this man.
2020-09-15 2:43,People!  People!  Now is the time.  It is upon us.  The threat to our Republic is grave.  Will we rise to the occasion?  Will we slide into authoritarianism?  It is still up to the citizenry.  Maybe for the last time.
2020-09-15 4:02,"You could have played this story straight. I mean, you don't need to use words like ""outlandish"" and ""antipathy"" when they are so obviously the case to any reader of clear mind. Use of this kind of language leaves you open to claims (or really, pretty clear evidence) of bias. Just share the story without over-doing it; your understated-ness will speak more loudly to the reader."
2020-09-15 2:07,How much US taxpayers pays this delusional guy a month? He may file for work-comp after Nov 03.
2020-09-15 2:14,Yes. I definitely agree that Caputo’s mental health has failed.
2020-09-15 3:17,Wait.  The guy claims that he and his family have been continually threatened and harassed yet he posts on Facebook Live.  Brilliant.
2020-09-15 2:34,"Is it me, or has the Trump campaign got absolutely nothing to take to the people before the election?"
2020-09-14 17:20,Is this what it means to make sure citizens don't panic?
2020-09-14 17:35,"I've commented this before: if Facebook and Twitter care about the USA at all, they need to turn off for the next few months. Take care of the employees, don't do layoffs, but stop the services temporarily, at the least. It is way too easy to spread lies - and far too many people believe them."
2020-09-15 5:19,"I had predicted in the end Trump would have a nervous breakdown. I didn’t think he’d have a surrogate. 
And still the Republicans keep silent. 
I’m going to read thru all my Freud books. There must be some explanation. 
There is a book written a few years ago , “The Allure of Toxic Leaders”. Maybe there’s an answer there. Will check Amazon for review."
2020-09-15 5:32,"Urging people to buy up ammunition because shadowy leftwingers are planning a takeover (with vague remarks from others in this 'administration' suggesting the Democrats are part of this). Sorry, but if this is how Trump supporters are heading into the election, it's really worrying. I'm not going to suggest they want civil war, but they are definitely scaring their voters into thinking that way. Those even considering voting for Biden must do so- for the democratic wellbeing of the country."
2020-09-15 5:23,"Terrifying that such people as he have ascended to the halls of power.

If should be remembered that trump, favored student of Roy Cohn, was trained to accuse others, sometimes preemptively, of the very sins and wrong-doing that he intended to commit or already had.  It’s reasonable to be concerned that trumps’ favored associates and appointees are, consciously or not, doing he same.

Sounds like it is he of the new, authoritarianism-bent GOP (it’s no longer accurate to call them Republican) is issuing a thinly-veiled call to    actual armed revolt.
Again, terribly disturbing, indeed."
2020-09-15 5:27,"Michael Caputo is now one more person caught within Trump's orbit who has become toxic. 
The stain is a permanent one.
The list of names is very long.
The American people cannot continue to endure the chaos, insecurity, and ongoing loss of trust."
2020-09-15 4:12,Neat.  It’s Glenn Beck meets Steve Bannon in a QAnon wrapper.
2020-09-15 4:50,"This really sounds like someone on the verge of a psychotic breakdown. Regardless of politics, shadows on the ceiling, get your guns, “they” are coming for you?  He even said that he was having mental problems. Get him some help. Please."
2020-09-15 5:21,The only accurate thing this guy said is that his mental health has suffered. Poor man.  Get help.
2020-09-15 4:17,"Mr. Caputo very accurately assesses his state of mind, his ""mental health has definitely failed"". His unfounded and bizarre call for people to arm themselves and stock ammunition for some imagined revolt connected to protecting lives in a pandemic indicates a serious and immediate need for psychiatric evaluation."
2020-09-15 2:39,"Mr. Caputo needs to reevaluate his delusional though process. The only person in his circle who is actively causing COVID-19 to passed among Americans is his boss, the president. Trump profligates the virus through not wearing a mask and having rallies where his supporters eschew even minimal protection."
2020-09-15 1:57,What is the word for something that is both shocking and completely unsurprising?
2020-09-15 4:52,"In an even moderately sane country, Mr Caputo would be quietly ushered aside, sedated and referred for psychiatric assessment.

Trump appointed him because; they either share the same delusions, or Caputo will be made the 'fall guy' for any bloodshed.

Even if you do not want to be armed, wear Kevlar on the streets on November 4.  The MAGA cultists will be roaming, wild-eyed, seeking the ""left-wing hit squads""."
2020-09-15 4:37,"This is unbelievable, one very delusional man supporting another. How  can GOP stand by and not do anything about this? Both Trump and Caputo need long term intense therapy, and I’m not talking as outpatients. There is nothing wrong with suffering from mental illnesses, but when they are in charge of running this country and not receiving therapy, that is criminal, no 2 way about it."
2020-09-15 2:25,He’s grasping at straws in a free-fall. I would feel sorry for him if his rhetoric wasn’t so dangerous.
2020-09-15 3:56,The catastrophe and chaos that our nation is experiencing Is the direct consequence of how US voters behaved in 2016.

2020-09-15 8:56,"Actually, I'd like to thank Mr. Caputo.  Previously, I hadn't understood the term ""Deep State"".  But now that Mr. Caputo has identified scientists at the C.D.C. as members of the Deep State, it's clear that Trump and his minions mean members of the Deep State have deep understanding – of infectious diseases, climate science, environmental science, ecology, foreign affairs, economics… In contrast are members of the ""Shallow State"", such as Trump and his supporters. This November, I trust members of the better state will prevail."
2020-09-15 9:02,"The level of conspiracy this guy portrays would be be impossible to reach or maintain. BTW I’m a fed and most of the folks I work with are radical centrists trying to find a blame on both sides path. 

And this is very important keep doing your job as directed because fulfilling your mission is your job.
The fact that CDC scientists are openly angry is a huge deal, bc some much of being in government is about not rocking the boat.

2020-09-15 6:02,"As an infectious disease (ID) specialist working at Swedens largest clinic for ID I must say that I am deeply worried of the demise of the CDC. It has taken decades of hard work and exceptional scientific work by so many briliant scientist and their combined effort has made it possible to build the the World renowned ”CDC brand”. 
In a matter of months it has been partly destroyed. 

I Do not trust the CDC anymore. 

It will take a looong time to fix this."
2020-09-15 5:59,"This behavior by a top department spokesperson is unacceptable.  I demand Mr. Caputo's immediate resignation.  If he does not do so, his direct supervisor must fire him and repudiate his comments.  If this does not occur, i will be holding the Administration directly accountable when in the voting both in November.

Can any reader cite a case of any prior administration's official making public pronouncements like this during a President's seeking of re-election?  If there are any cases, what were their resolution?"

Poor United States so close to Qanon so far from science..."
2020-09-15 8:54,"I'm just going to call it out, how incompetent does the United States Government levels, the political parties and the systems behind them, have to be to allow people that are clearly not mentally stable run their establishments. The people of the United States are going to have to wake up one day at their crumbling country and look in the mirror and say we could have prevented this by creating a proper centralized government system, instead of pushing conspiracy theories and distrust of the system that is meant to be in place to protect them."
2020-09-15 8:39,"Maybe following orders to lie about the pandemic is affecting his mental health. That means somewhere in there, he has a conscience that is bothered by all the deaths, and knows he is guilty of making it worse. 

Maybe he should resign. He's not a doctor or scientist, so why is he running the CDC (into the ground)?"
2020-09-15 5:53,Surely - as he says - his mental health has deteriorated.  This is a man with a serious mental health issue and someone should be helping him to get the treatment he so obviously needs.

Instead of trying to combat the raging coronavirus, the focus of Trump's HHS is on discrediting career scientists and using social media to incite armed violence in the streets."
2020-09-15 8:29,"It looks like the struggle between the left and right for power is slowly but surely shifting from debating to fighting on the streets. The leaders on both sides must open a dialogue to calm the differences down. The sale of arms is at the maximum. There is a shortage of arms and ammunition for sale. The weapons are becoming more deadly. It loos like America is preparing for another civil war.  

We are already in such a mess on so many fronts. Instead of trying to solve problems through peaceful means Trump is trying to win through chaos. It is the Republican leadership that is to blame as they are supporting his every insane move. They too must be punished at the polls along with Trump."

Trump's 2020 reelection bid will be used by those trying to bring about the destabilization and destruction of our democratic institutions as a front to further inject conspiracies aimed at dividing this country even more. And keep in mind that Trump appointed these people to their positions in our government."

You have media planting the seeds of violence in the heads of millions of people (Fox News, right-wing radio shows, Facebook and other internet sites). Then you have laws that allow people to show up to demonstrations armed to the hilt with automatic weapons. You even have laws that allow such people to carry these arms around in their daily lives. You have groups that are avidly seeking what they call ""Civil War 2: Electric Boogaloo"" (no kidding). And now you have government officials influencers calling for right-wing people to arm themselves in preparation for the election results and for the president to declare martial law after the results come in, the president calling the results of mail-in voting into question, the opposing candidate gearing up for a legal battle over the election results, and now this delusional character concocting stories about left-wing groups being trained as hit squads. 

A great pile of kindling has been made, and now it will just take a few sparks to set the country on fire, metaphorically speaking. You've all got to start dismantling this bonfire before it gets started. Cancel your Facebook and other social media accounts (or at least go on strike and cease to use them for a few months), and take journalists, pundits, and other stokers of the flames of hate and of conspiracy theories to court for inciting violence (and sedition in some cases)."

Congress is impotent, the courts appear to be unable or unwilling to deal with these law breakers and the secret service and military have not made up their minds. So yelling fire in a crowded theater is not a crime, even when people get killed during the stampede. So now only Bill Barr and Trump can create and destroy laws at will without conscience. Something needs to be fixed and very soon or we will lose this country to the Trumps of the world."

Send all you pals who are Trump fans this definition of a demagogue:

 ""A demagogue is a popular leader, a leader of a mob, or rabble-rouser. A demagogue is leader who gains popularity in a democracy by exploiting emotions, prejudice, and ignorance to arouse some against others, whipping up the passions of the crowd and shutting down reasoned deliberation. Demagogues overturn established norms of political conduct, or promise or threaten to do so."" 

""He is a politician skilled in flattery and invective; evasive in discussing vital issues; promising everything to everybody; appealing to the passions rather than the reason of the public; and arousing racial, religious, and class prejudices—a man whose lust for power without recourse to principle leads him to seek to become a master of the masses."" 

""Demagogues exploit a fundamental weakness in democracy: because ultimate power is held by the people, it is possible for the people to give that power to someone who appeals to the lowest common denominator of a large segment of the population and attempt to convert their democracy to dictatorship.""

Mr. Caputo urged people to attend Trump rallies, but only with masks.""

Our Russian Asset tapeworm has installed legions of people with dangerous mental problems like the above. Some of them have their fingers on weapons of mass destruction, which includes the fire hose of disinformation washing over our gullible population. 

And yet, none of our leaders--particularly the Republican ones--want to lift a finger to head off the unmitigated disaster  unfolding month by month. We are sitting ducks for all manner of attacks, from foreign enemies, and we don't have the wherewithal to stop this assault on our nation.

Azar II, of protecting his public image instead of Mr. Trump’s. Mr. Caputo coordinates the messaging of an 80,000-employee department that is at the center of the pandemic response...”

Has there ever been an American presidential administration where so many completely inexperienced, unqualified people have been appointed to positions of power and responsibility?
This unfortunately is in keeping with Trump’s absolute lack of any political or diplomatic experience, and a nearly complete absence of manners, when he was inaugurated. Trump hadn’t so much as served on a school board or town council. Perhaps Trump prefers to appoint the unqualified in order to avoid being shown up.

Problem: One of the principal duties assigned to the U.S. Senate is “the confirmation of ALL presidential appointments.”
What’s up with that?
If Trump nominated a golfing buddy, a man who’d barely managed to graduate from high school, to be Secretary of the Treasury or Director of the EPA —
do the senate Reublicans even bother to hold hearings anymore? How do the Trumpists justify the abandonment of established federal government traditions?
Jared Kushner? Trump’s daughter?

There are differing points of view which must be heard. For example, sane citizens should be allowed to own guns but not extreme weaponry, our borders should not be wide open but controlled immigration should be welcome, corporations should have a voice but not be the predominant voice in our democratic society, nobody should get a free ride on the backs of taxpayers."

The Tea Party blogs were rife with the idea in the years after 2010.  Trump & his allies are now stoking that belief. They are also building the resentment that segment of society already feels that what is rightfully theirs is being taken from them by the hated left/elites/Democrats. 

So, the Trump administration is stoking the likelihood of violence if Trump loses the election. The belief is that he MUST win unless the election is ""stolen"" by nefarious means. If he loses, his followers are being primed to take to the streets with all those guns in order to take ""take back our country."""

Unlike John the Baptist, he's been tasked with the job of being canary in the coal mine, an early indicator of the rot and chaos Trump is plotting with his minions day and night.

The entire administration hasbeen brazen than usual, as the days march towards November 3.  The way things are accelerating, it seems that Trump is bound and determined to simply negate the election unless it keeps him in office.

He's moving so fast, the media can't cover him, and voices of reason are letting Trump be Trump.

That's what got us into trouble in the first place.  Nobody has checked him, even from ordering extrajudicial killings, and he's fulfilling his prophecy, ""I can do whatever I want to."""
2020-09-15 10:54,"The scary part of this, for me at least, is that after reading coverage of Mr. Caputo I was not in the least surprised. I had always assumed, I guess, that the Trumpites were all at least a little insane. It appears that Caputo is simply at the far end of the bell curve. One can only hope that the long shadows on his ceiling finally have their way with this man, for the good of the country. An alternative might be medical treatment for his obvious problems but I'm sure he would never submit to treatment by 'them.'"

He refers to anyone who disagrees with trump as a ""seditionist"".  He seems obsessed with having the last word. It's bad enough that he's horrible, petty and immature, but to think that he's been hired by Trump into a senior level, public position just goes to show how much work it'll be to restore the damage that's being caused.

Disrespectfully, if this is the the best that Trump and his administration could find, with Caputo's Roger Stone background, and hanging out with a Russian spy, this man is not fit to hold a position in our federal or any similar position.

As for his troubling statement re: “shadows on the ceiling in my apartment, there alone, shadows are so long?” A least he has not become so detached from reality that he is still cognizant of and admitted to the fact that his “mental health has definitely failed.”  Now, if only those who care about him can convince him to see the treatment he so desperately to require.  And while at it, perhaps his ""boss"" should insist he take a leave of absence from his position rather than savaging the CDC and everything else over which he has “responsibility.”  Consider it not wishing to ""panic"" the public."

In 2004, he  work with Paul Manafort to play footsie with the Russian oligarchs.  Then he turns up in the Trump campaign in 2016  along with Manafort (who is now a convicted felon). And in the middle of that, there is a guy named ... Roger Stone.

Rachel Maddow spelled it all out Monday night on her show.  She connected the dots.

This man Caputo seems to have a mental issue.  And then he ropes in a guy called Paul Alexander, a part time Associate Prof at McMaster University who sounds like a hydroxychloroquine pusher, from his papers.

Alexander and Caputo are demanding that any press releases from CDC get approved by them, when Caputo has no medical background at all.

My opinions is that this is yet another Trump ""arm twisting activity"" to make the news conform to his desires.

I think it is going to fail, because people are wise to the scam."

2020-09-15 4:55,"If you want to understand the mindset of Caputo and the others who believe the entire world is out to get them, you have to go beyond Fox News and OANN and listen to the Alex Jones podcast, which still has a devoted following among the wingnut right. Just the first 15 minute segment of hour one of the September 14th podcast will lay out the worldview for you, and give you all the evidence you need to understand that these folks no longer live in the reality-based world. 

They are fighting a cabal of Rockefellers and Rothschilds who are leading the charge to turn America into a supplier of mindless automatons to feed the globalist corporate machine. The cabal, based in the United Nations but expressing their will in America through the ""Democrat"" party and George Soros, is barely one step away from destroying the America Jones and his followers all revere. Only Trump and his right (and righteous) people with guns stand in their way.

If you wonder what would cause a government official to claim that his political opponents are seditious traitors out to kill him, or a 17 year old in Kenosha to bring out his gun and end the lives of two people he had never met, that time spent listening to Jones will give you the answer. It will also make you realize that there are many other Michael Caputos and Kyle Rittenhouses and William Barrs out there, just waiting for the call to action.

We need to restore sanity in this country, and soon. After four years of Trump, it won't be easy."

2020-09-15 11:41,"Another grifter appointed by Grifter #1....this stupidity cannot be further tolerated by anyone, especially the GOP if they do not want the kind of political backlash they can expect at the polls.

Caputo is nowhere near any level of competence for this job.  All Trump is doing is placing his grifters 3 to 4 levels down from the top of every agency to try to block government data from reaching  the public.

After watching this incompetence and corruption that started at Trump's inauguration, a Biden administration must pass a law to enshrine that notion that leaders of governmental science agencies must have tenures for 12 years like the Fed and can only be removed for cause.  The CDC, EPA, NOAA, NIH have been seriously compromised by Trump's  putrid power grab.  I want honest data (we pay for it) and these agencies must be strengthened from the likes of autocratic wannabes like Don the Con and the GOP.

Caputo's big miscalculation is that the vast majority of Americans are not stupid and will not fall for this kind of irrational incitement. Pox on him and this administration for stepping into this horrific place.  The GOP should get him some mental health counseling ASAP along with Trump."

It seems Michael Caputo definitely has mental health problems. A perfect fit for Trump’s Administration.

His comments should be immediately rejected and condemned by the administration including the Sec of HHS.  The fact they have not is telling how pervasive the politicization of the agencies to create a false trump narrative has become.  It puts the entire US public health at risk.

The ""surprise"" is going to come from white supremacists who understand this is their last chance for survival into the future. It will be unexpected, but will be violent. It may come in the form of a ""false flag""  operation or operations (as was already attempted by a couple of supremacists in Oregon) that targets the police or civilians.  It may be a series of small attacks, or more likely a big spectacular and shocking operation a la 9/11. Subsequently, it may be found that the Justice Department, Department of Homeland Security and the FBI 'missed the signs', and that the police were too underfunded to respond. 
Just as the Russians goals and Trumps goals were aligned in 2016, so are the goals of the supremacists and Trump. Trump is just begging for them to provide him an opening."

2020-09-15 13:24,"He sounds quite unhinged, but then most of the Trump followers sound unhinged.  However, he’s enjoys a fairly high position in the administration and has a platform. Even if he resigned, he’d be replaced with another unhinged loyalist."
2020-09-15 13:17,"That a political hack like Michael Caputo should: a) be put in a position of any importance at any public agency, especially during a pandemic; and b) be allowed to remain in that position when he clearly has lost his mind defies explanation or understanding. 

It feels these days as if all of rational America has been cast in some bizarro political satire. I can only hope for a “Dallas” ending — that I’ll wake up one morning to find that I’ve just had the weirdest dream ever."

Trump cronies inciting violence and an outright coup if he loses in November .
Trump showing no concern for his adoring fans  at his indoor rally as long as he himself is safe.
Horrendous fires and hurricanes , Antarctica ice shelf ready to cause catastrophic sea level rise while the self professed genius snickers at climate science.
Not to mention the dismissal of out of control Covid19 infections and rising deaths in many states .
 And still 43% approval rating? This is descending into a terrifying Jonestown territory of mass craziness.

And still 43% approval rating."
2020-09-15 13:18,This guy actually WORKED for Putin. Do we really need more evidence that Trump and Caputo are NOT working in America's best inerests.
2020-09-15 13:40,"How is Mr. Caputo still in ANY federal role? He is protected by no immunity. He is not elected by anyone.

How does even the most loyal Republican allow an unbalanced crank like this to have ANY role in our vital pandemic response?"
2020-09-15 13:24,"As a communications professional, I
shudder at the power in Caputo’s hands. This unstable and panicked man is charged with directing national messaging about how to defeat Covid. Are you kidding me? This is a frightening travesty! 

For the first time ever, I’m not sure we can come out whole on the other side. That has always been my go-to: America can withstand any storm because we are fundamentally strong and ultimate United (e.g. our response to 9-11). The election is too far away to get through this sick quagmire unscathed. I am now officially afraid for all of us."
2020-09-15 13:09,"I just wonder whether this is really news, or enabling, emboldening, and legitimization of hate by the news media when they present such stories. It seems to me more like that latter. There’s plenty of people who say outrageous things everyday and they’re left to the oblivion that they deserve. Is this kind of rhetoric really news or helping hate?"
2020-09-15 13:14,"And this man has a security clearance?

This man has guns?

This man has power?"
2020-09-15 13:35,"Is Caputo speaking in an official capacity? After all
he has a very responsible, powerful position. He has made very serious accusations. Has he checked his so called facts? Has he done his homework? Is he acting like a leader? If he is acting in an official capacity, it is irresponsible, provocative mayhem.
If he is acting as a private citizen, actually you can't separate the two in this age of social networking."
2020-09-15 13:10,This man needs immediate medical help.  I don’t write that as a sarcastic remark but with genuine concern that he is experiencing mental fatigue and moving into deep psychological problems.  The administration owes it to him to get him that help.  Now.
2020-09-15 13:08,"Caputo is clearly in over his head. He has zero knowledge of how scientific research is done or the rigorous reviewing process that weeds out biased or flawed work. The 'deep state' he rails against is the scientific process itself. It's bigger than this small man. It is the centuries old foundation of our modern conveniences and life saving medical treatments. Undermine and politicize rigorous scientific research in the US and just watch the brain drain to other countries, along with lost innovation, technology, and intellectual property."

  Dr. Redfield has stabbed people in the back by allowing the CDC to become non-political. Especially if Scientists are resigning,
    Why isn't Congress doing something about this?  Am I the only one who sees it is time for us to restructure the whole system.  Our Founding Fathers would weep."
2020-09-15 13:11,Caputo is clearly unstable and needs help immediately.  I hope he gets it before he hurts himself or someone else!

Bizarre is when an unknown gunman drives from North Carolina to Washington, DC to self investigate a pedophile ring in a pizzeria run by Democrats.
Coming from a member of the administration makes these comments beyond bizarre. It is downright frightening for our country."
2020-09-15 13:49,"Really? People are gonna arm themselves to potentially kill fellow Americans because they believe Democrats are gonna do, ....... exactly what? Now, that's just insane."

She quoted him as saying that his “mental health has definitely failed.” For all his faults, Mr. Caputo deserves kudos for being the first member of the current admission’s staff to admit to the obvious."
2020-09-15 13:45,"Sadly, from his bizarre rantings, it is obvious that Michael Caputo should not be a government appointee but a resident in a mental health facility."
2020-09-15 13:46,It’s telling that Mr Caputo had to go to Canada and dig up an assistant professor to agree to and validate his insanity!
2020-09-15 13:48,"Everyone needs to Google MIchael Caputo. His biography is full of dubious connections to Russian and Ukrainian people, including Putin.  (Another Trump/Russia connection.)  His wives were Russian and Ukrainian.  His connections in the U.S. included some of our worst political advisors.  Roger Stone was one close connection and he seems every bit as cuckoo as Stone."
2020-09-15 13:09,"Russians don't need anymore to waste their time corrupting American election fairness, Republicans are doing a much better job!"
2020-09-15 13:49,"Mr Caputo has given the most accurate diagnosis of himself: His mental health has failed. This would be a sad commentary on the tragedy of mental illness if it weren't so frightening. Trump has moved beyond installing loyalist lapdogs into positions of importance, and is now appointing people --- such as Caputo --- who are obviously unbalanced and delusional. Anyone this paranoid about people coming to kill him presents a text book case of someone eventually ending up barricaded in his home, armed to teeth.

In any normal world a member of an administration who displayed this kind of mental instability would be removed and offered counseling. In this world, he is given the authority to corrupt important medical information. 

The irony is that in demonizing the researchers at the CDC as part of a conspiracy to destroy Donald Trump, doing ""rotten science"", he also discredits any research they are doing to come up with a vaccine, thus undermining Trump's desperate desire to have a cure for the pandemic before the election. Should we trust anything this cabal of deep-staters say about the efficacy of a vaccine if they are as corrupt as Caputo claims?

We not only have a man of questionable mental stability leading the country, he's now bringing aboard like-minded lunatics."
2020-09-15 13:43,"People are talking about Caputo's comments as if they are aberrant. But they are the norm. Trump himself has talked about black-clad mystery men flying around on planes to foment violence. Matt Gaetz says that MS-13 will move in to the house next door to you if Biden is elected.

The crazy is a feature, not a bug."
2020-09-15 13:49,"If your uncle, or any relative began saying even a portion of what we’re hearing from Mr. Caputo, in addition to calling a behavioral heath hotline you would be confiscating his car keys and anything else potentially lethal within his grasp. Instead, Caputo is being enabled to reshape the vital information coming from the dedicated scientists at the CDC. Another wake-up call, America."
2020-09-15 13:43,"It's going to be a refreshing lifeline to have not only competent people at all levels of government, but also people with a firm grasp on reality. 

Vote Blue down the line or we get more kooks like Caputo with his hands on a very important wheel."
2020-09-15 13:45,"Only Trump gives people like Michael Caputo a chance to hold high office in the administration. Those who serve him usually lack what it takes to earn respect and admiration, because Trump doesn’t care about  merits and qualifications, as long as the person is loyal, going to great lengths to defend him personally and his policies. 
No wonder these people do everything to keep him in office. Where else could they have another chance to make themselves relevant?  
Caputo’s book, titled The Ukraine Hoax: How Decades of Corruption in the Former Soviet Republic Led to Trump’s Phony Impeachment, hardly made any headlines, because Trump never discredited it in public. Books only sell when Trump makes a fuss about them."
2020-09-15 13:48,"If Mr. Caputo truly represents this administration and the 30 something percent of Americans that support tRump and company, we are truly in deep deep trouble in this country, even if Mr. Biden should win."
2020-09-15 13:48,"We should all be taking this very seriously.  Whenever Trump, his minions, and The Trump Talking Machine incite fear about something, it is precisely what THEY are planning to do. 

It's so outlandish that reasonable people don't want to believe it, but this won't be the first time you hear a suggestion of armed conflict occurring around the presidential transition.

Trump's actions have proved him to be an autocrat. He is already laying out his argument for not leaving office regardless of election results--a rigged election, election fraud,  claiming career government employees are undermining him and now suggesting there will be armed conflict. 

The Trump Talking Machine is feeding voters ideas that will make many of them accept it when Trump declares martial law and refuses to leave office. Since the US Attorney General has proven himself to be corrupt and the US Senate Republicans have stood by idly while Trump burned the Constitution, there may be no one left to save our democracy when Trump incites Civil War II."

If the right wing militias come in shooting, I wouldn't be surprised if someone shoots back.

Yes, I know that negativity wins elections but you also need to try and mitigate the negative response from the other side if you want a peaceful transfer of power.  

If you are holding protests and they are being cooped by radical elements on either side(even if it's later in the day), consider stopping until after the election.  You have a right to protest, but you also have a right to not let others use your message as cover for their interests.

I guess for some, there actually is a high enough price for that."

2020-09-15 14:51,"Selection of CDC and FDA leadership, and probably NIH, should be removed from the political sphere where they now reside. I have no doubt that the ""seditious"" scientists at CDC could identify highly qualified leadership from within their own ranks or from the ranks of academe. 
We have been blessed with morally responsible leadership in the past (well, mostly). Their appointees have not done anything to disable their institutions but in fact they haven't done much to rock the proverbial boat by departing from historically accepted practice of gathering information on known diseases, reporting them, focusing on ""known knowns"" as it were. And not doing much at all to look into the abyss for emerging risks, and I would argue that lack of progress in preparing for comeback of SARS, or further emergence of Zika, name your poison. Arguing for a more adequate national stockpile or building surge capacity in hospitals and vaccine production. Perhaps going so far as to try to move some of our healthcare/pharma away from the profit-world where vaccines only follow after the disease makes it abundantly clear that we need them. Because, as we're seeing, that doesn't always work. Lots of meds available for the heartbreak of psoriasis, but not much for new viruses. 
Why is that? Because CDC and FDA are led by political appointees more interested in keeping their jobs than actually doing them. Sadly, that appears to rule our business and political leadership philosophy."
2020-09-15 14:56,"Caputo went further, saying his physical health was in question, and his “mental health has definitely failed.”

For sure. He would have had no mental health in the first place to accept the HHS public affairs spokesman for Trump.  

He does a disservice to public information and the HHS mission by supporting a false and misleading narrative."
2020-09-15 15:22,"Mr. Caputo who handles ""messaging"" about bulletins coming from science trained professionals at the CDC needs medical leave of absence immediately!  Under DT it seems we are basically at the mercy the virus. We have only destructive leadership in our handling of this pandemic emergency.

I fail to understand how any sane functioning American can vote for Donald Trump or anyone in his party.

This is not about policy positions or politics. This is about sanity vs. insanity. This is about right vs. wrong.

===
There are thoughtful conservatives who believe in low taxes, deregulation, and conservative judges. Some people are opposed to abortion. I may disagree with all or part of these policy positions, but we used to be able to have a respectful dialogue. 

Today's Trump Republicans are not even conservatives. They are right-wing radical reactionaries, living in an alternative reality with a tenuous grip on sanity."

As usual, it a messy set of nonsense that, if needed, could be changed, made more terrifying, less so, or completely erased. The hottest thing going today is Caputo's ""stock up on ammunition"" advice. Thus far the White House has made claims of chaos that could make it the attacker or the attacked.  This thinking only means ""keep everyone off-balance"" and which favors any sitting President almost always.  Mr. Caputo may have made a mistake going as far as he has because some of his expressed public opinions also alert FBI and CIA staff trained to look for such at these types of times.  Remember ""words don't kill, people do."" However, to be on the safe side you might trade-in the idea of stocking up on ammo and instead adopt a huge loving nasty looking VERY BIG dog or two and hide in the open if you hear gunfire - not tapes of it - but real gunfire!  Whichever the case - do not forget to vote for Trump or Biden - the most that could happen is that neither would win and the United States becomes something less than a Democracy, which is 87% accomplished already.  Keep in mind Russia, the Soviet Union, and Russia 2,3, and 4.  Nothing changed much over that few hundred years, and nothing much will change in America no matter who or what takes the helm."
2020-09-15 16:28,"Don't you think that if such ""insurrections"" were going on, they'd have to recruit an army of followers and there would be messages to that effect on the Internet? There's no hint of any such activity. People have talked about what would happen if Trump refused to leave when voted out. The military would make sure that he goes. That isn't insurrection. That's their job. Trump has alienated nearly all federal employees, the military and pretty much everybody else in the government. The celebrations after Trump is gone are not an insurrection. Its a relief. There will be a huge collective sigh when Trump and his appointees are shown the door and the government can start repairing the damage. If we are rid of Mitch McConnell, there will be jubilation. Church bells will ring and the ships at sea will sound their horns. Then, we start tarring and feathering."

There are many reports of people receiving up to three unsolicited voting ballots in several states. If only a fraction of these ballots end up being fraudulently filled, it could very well change the electoral map in a dramatic way.  After seeing the unrest and riots in many cities, it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that this type voter fraud could lead to civil unrest and even a possible civil war."

I don’t think science knows, actually.” ' is misleading imo, and is too easily held up by the President's supporters to support their case of the day."

Trump Health Aide pushing his followers to armed insurrection compelling them to action if Trump loses the election by convincing them of conspiracy theories grounded in lies. 

You can bet that Trump has plans to create armed revolts which he will try to make believe started from the left and he must get his followers to ""protect and defend their country"".  Even if in the end all they are doing is destroying the very thing they think they are fighting for - our very democracy.

- social distancing? Nah. Schools reopened on Monday and for example I saw parents and children crowding in front of a school’s gate before its opening. Like it was 2019. 
Of course, once they entered the school, children were required to social distance but they weren’t social distancing just 2 mins before outside school. Where’s the sense in that? 

- testing? Very hard to do. I recently had all the most common covid symptoms and they told me I had to wait 4 days before making an appointment to get tested with the public health system. Read carefully: making an appointment, not doing the actual test. 
I could’ve gone private, sure. For 150€ per person and I had to wait anyhow (at least a week) since a private companies are not testing people with symptoms. Yeah, you read it right. 

- contact tracing? Nah, again. In restaurants you have to leave your cell number before entering. Great! The problem? Many leave a fake cell number so that they’re untraceable.

Almost all COVID-19 mortality models focused on number of deaths, without considering age structure and co-morbidities. This can give very misleading inferences about the burden of disease in terms of quality-adjusted life-years lost, which is far more important than simple death count. For example, the Spanish flu killed young people with average age of 28 and its burden in terms of number of quality-adjusted person-years lost was about 700-fold higher than the COVID-19 (at least as of September 1, 2020). The majority of covid fatalities are in their 80s and 90s.  The problem in the U.S. is half the country thinks we can ignore the virus and the other half thinks we can hide from the virus.  A balanced approach to living with the reality of the  virus is needed."

Here in Germany, there is a constant war between those who refuse to use a mask and the normal people. That's why not wearing a mask in trains and buses comes with a fine of 60-500+€ depending on the state, Saxony- Anhalt excluded. Wearing a mask in stores and other public places is mandatory but many wear it as a chin ornament or let their noses stick our, as if their noses were immune against corona. Schools are stuck in a never-ending cycle of quarantine and reopening. Nothing really is normal. People are angry and frustrated.

Sure enough, a few weeks later, fatalities caught up with the case surge.

Meanwhile the American economic numbers are significantly better than in Europe and while ours continue to improve, Europe’s are continuing their decline as government supports wither.

At one point, police tape appeared on the gates to the courts; it was of course ignored. Finally, the gates were locked (but only for about a week).

In short, there's nothing quite so frustrating as the desperation of your average NYT reader, to which, alas, the paper often caters, to believe that Europe is superior to the U.S. in every way."
2020-09-15 21:32,"Watching the ongoing Tour de France shows why their schools are opening successfully.  The many thousands of spectators all appear to be wearing masks.  They  have not been influenced by a hard to fathom rejection of proper pandemic protocols led here by our President.  Did the fact a mask would mess up his face makeup drive Trump's  decisions?  His sheep could have been led in a different direction, and they would have followed.  Or did he follow the sheep?"

2020-09-15 22:02,"I am originally from France and i follow very closely what happens since I have family over there. I live north of Seattle and the high school my daughter graduated from in June was the first one in the country with a confirmed case of covid-19  so i have seen from the beginning how the virus has been handled in both countries. 
The message has obviously been more responsible from the leadership in France but it doesn't mean that the population and specially the youngest one has been much more responsible at listening to guidelines when they had a chance to socialize after the lock down. Almost all french schools have reopened but i watch the French national news everyday and i have already seen schools closing again because of Covid-19 cases and parents having to keep children at home.  
The seemingly peace that countries like France has experienced this summer against the virus has more to do with antibodies than any real measures the french government has taken. The rise and fall in cases in Europe has more to do with nature doing it's job in our bodies than any real decisions governments are taking. Cases are rising again.
Of course wearing masks indoor and washing hands on a constant basis helps , but the virus doesn't travel from people's lung to their skin pores and jumps on someone else to infect them, no wings there to help them against the wind when people are at the beach or the park. 
Masks and rapid test result are the real solution until we get a vaccine"
2020-09-15 21:49,"That Trump did not insist in his idea to isolate NY and metropolitan areas from the rest of the country is a fatal flaw that allowed the rest of the country to be seeded; we here in NC were also seeded from the corporate meeting that some attended in Boston; NC, my home state as well as Louisiana should have been quarantined to prevent a nationwide dissemination of the covid19 virus, but Trump was intimidated by Cuomo’s dissent. 
Trump wishes desperately to be liked, especially by his former NY/ NJ fellow citizens. 
Too bad we were not quarantined by a more forceful leader, although it would have lead to calls, already voiced by those who say Trump was a dictator. 
Leadership is not about doing what will necessarily be liked, but by what is necessary, FDR knew this and so did Churchill."

We only listen to opinions which valdate our own fears and beliefs and constantly reinforce those fears and beliefs without question or critical thinking.
Based upon my personal observations among friends and acquaintances, people who watch Fox news tend to minimize the risk, and people who watch MSNBC  are terrified. Both are very misguided. 
The virus isn't going anywhere, and right now and for the foreseeable future, there is no vaccine. We can neither ignore that, nor have it force us into indefinite paralysis. 
If we are to have a functioning society, we must find out a way to responsibly live with it. We must be cautious in our social interactions, but be willing to balance the risks if we to function. In many instances, it may come down to personal choices. Some people are more comfortable accepting risks others are not. Some will go to restaurants, others will not. Some will go back into the office. Othes will continue to go work remotely. Some parents  will be comfortable with in person classes for their children. Others will want children to learn at home.
That's all OK. What we can't do is fall into extremes, by disregarding responsible behavior or by prohibiting any behavior which might pose any risk.
The virus is here. It lurks. We can neither retreat from it nor defy it. We have to fgure out how to lve with it."

It's been alot easier to live with the preventive measures outside. Wait until next spring to judge.

Europe is divided about mask-wearing.  it is not that the United States is divided and Europe is united.   just not true.  look at the UK and the Netherlands which are major parts that the author just kind of sweeps aside.   also there were boundary barriers within Europe go contain the velocity of people that are just not acceptable to the Americans.  that contributed materially to the ability to control.  Europe is not one country and there were border controls internally like in Australia.  I wish the NY Times would be more honest in its coverage of this issue, then maybe readers like me who benefit from many sources would learn more."

For example, Poland has only had 59 fatalities per 1 million population, and Czechia - 44 deaths per 1M. This is, on the average, 10 times fewer than the rich countries of Western Europe. One lesson from the Covid-19 pandemic is that wealth has offered little protection from the ravages of the coronavirus. On the other hand, cohesive countries like Japan, S. Korea, and Poland have done remarkably well so far"

Of course, it is not possible if you are not doing anything for it. There is no “equilibrium” with this virus. It is simply mathematically impossible. You either eliminate it or let it run rampant until almost all were infected and herd immunity takes hold. Such is the nature of exponential growth. The herd immunity is not even close and the number of deaths will increase at least tenfold before it is reached. If that is what they call “equilibrium” shame on them."
2020-09-15 23:26,"The arrogant dismissal of a biological threat, by governments, corporations,  the media,  and experts, was a global failure of leadership to prepare for and manage the largest public health risk of our lifetimes. Like dominos nation after nation would fall, first ignoring the exponential spread of a novel virus at their doorsteps, despite frantic warnings by their badly hit neighbors, finally to be toppled when realization hit that their own hospitals would soon to be overwhelmed. The lockdowns were a last ditch attempt to buy time to prepare; not an indefinite measure used until a vaccine would found - all economic systems would collapse without active markets. Of course governments would plug the gap in production with trillions of dollars of debt to be paid off by younger generations. Generations who suffer an insignificant chance of morbidity or mortality; but were locked in their homes, fired from service industry jobs they rely on, and had their education disrupted. The answer to the crisis has been, and remains: shield the vulnerable - the elderly,  particularly in care homes, and others at risk and enact health measures such as social distancing. This was the approach Sweden took, and they were castigated by lockdown fanatics, and media outlets, as an example of catastrophic failure. However, Sweden's approach now vindicated, has been adopted globally as the only sustainable way going forward. Except for Australia and New Zealand who now slide towards totalitarianism."

According to Worldometers as of today the USA has 200,109 Covid 19 related deaths, so far.  A very grim milestone and with the continued anti-science approach undertaken by the Trump-Pence administration many more Covid 19 deaths are sure to come.  The US has 4% of the worlds populations and 25% of the Covid 19 deaths.  If Trump-Pence did just an average job of handling the virus there would be less than 35,000 deaths in the US so far so by that measure Trump-Pence have accounted for 165,000 Covid 19 deaths so far.  But since when does the US aspire to be just 'average'? With our financial resources and educational superiority an average President would have kept the US death toll under 10,000."

My family has been fine since the beginning of the pandemic but the reopening of schools has started a major 2nd wave in the city where my family lives.

My brother's 3 kids all got infected during their first week at school and my 3 year old niece's class was closed after 4 kids in her class tested positive. Her sister who is 14 also has 8 infected kids in her class. My brother is a teacher at the same school and he is also infected, as well as his wife.

The reopening of school combined with colder weather will probably be the cause of the 2nd wave in the US."

It's a private business on private property, so one would think that everyone would abide by such a simple request of the property and business owner, or not enter. But no, the clearly defensive and very bitter Trumpists flatly refuse and are allowed entry anyway.

We have come to the point where the ignorant, and the unhappy bitter dregs of society, have full-rein to do as they please. And it pleases them to make other peoples' life unhealthy. It also pleases them to see America slide to being a pitiable country devoid of all common sense and human decency.

Upon entering all shops, restaurants and public places, you are required to sanitize your hands, the vendors are required to provide this at the entrance.

Social distancing is generally respected, something that I would have never imagined before the pandemic."

I've been traveling in the EU for the past several months, stopping in over a dozen countries now, and mask wearing and social distancing measures are definitely not the norm. Masking seems rather universal on public transport, but its hit or miss in other public places (shops, hotels, restaurants, etc). And I have yet to visit a place where masking wearing outdoors is common. Social distancing is also basically non-existent. There may be signs or stickers on the floor to maintain distance, but in practice, no one is distancing in queues or at bars or restaurants, etc. 

Of course there is an odd country here or there with stricter measures than others, but the NYT's european coverage is generally a terrible misrepresent the situation. For the daily pictures flashed on the main page in particular, I feel like the photography staff must be waiting around for hours to snap a photo of the rare large group of masked people walking around outside just to make people think everyone, everywhere in the world is doing it. This is journalism at its worst. And its proving our godawful president right in that we are starting to actually have a fake news problem. Stop twisting the truth to fit a narrative NYT!"

While the NYT would like us to believe the French were amazing at adhering to their first lockdown, while all Americans are anti-maskers, the truth is the French lockdown wasn't all that strict, at least compared to the SF Bay Area where I live now. And the lockdown in France was just two months and then simply declared over during ""le grand deconfinement"" on May 15. France did very, very little testing during the summer and encouraged peole to travel. Here in SF, we have had one of longest and strictest lockdowns in the world (still no school, still no indoor dining, all bars closed, libraries and playgrounds still closed, mask mandate at all times when not at home since April 17, and now we must meet extremely low case numbers--under 7 per 100K for two weeks, while also meeting high test numbers--to even consider opening schools part way. I've been seeing photos of my friends in Paris at indoor crowded concerts and eating indoors for months. Bars are packed. Schools are back in full force with no masks required under age 11. Of course the virus didn't disappear in France on May 15. Of course cases would rise again. Maybe France didn't get it so right afer all?"

I and my spouse are older, and we’ve chosen the latter. It is indeed very hard to stay in lockdown for so long. We have food and any needed medications delivered, anything else that is needed is delivered (I spend a lot on delivery charges), ebooks and audiobooks and the ‘net provide entertainment and contact with friends and family, and we cope. But I do feel abandoned. Everyone else is willing to take risks to “get on with life”, but I won’t, and hopefully will be able to enjoy some good years when this is over.

No masks anywhere (except on public transport) and unenforced distancing. And we’re fine. Some folks love to see the world shut down, and most of us here cannot fathom why. We have the equipment for the hospitals should the beds fill up again. We have more knowledge than we did in March. Now it’s time to move on. Although I live here temporarily, you can bet I’ll apply for permanent residence once I’m eligible. Why would I ever return to a place where folks would rather destroy all businesses than go on with their lives?

NYT once again gets it right: the EU is superior in every way to the United States. I see some US commenters here living in Europe, shocked at how things are approached in their locality. Okay, well why don’t you go back to the US where folks are shot over both wearing a mask or not wearing one. Where maskless protests are accepted, but indoor dining is not. Where you can’t order a drink unless it’s with food. Where you can’t send your kids back to school because teachers don’t think they’re essential.

Yes, some US citizens have reacted with astounding idiocy (as have some Europeans, such as those 38,000 anti-mask protesters in Berlin).

Then there are the stubborn ones who advertise their limited intellectual capacities by wearing the mask below the nose, an act of defiance which forces me to remain as stoic as possible in the face of such idiocy posing a real sanitary threat.

All of this indicates that this virus is indeed extremely stubborn, contagious and lethal, which has direct implications for control measures and economic impacts.

Compared to other countries, the US has high obesity rates, has the highest prevalence rates of diabetes, and has the second highest death rate from ischemic heart disease. In addition, lung disease is more prevalent and associated with higher mortality in the United States than in the United Kingdom and other European countries.

But why choose a path that was sure to put him at odds with a lot of people who were already beginning to doubt his competence? Why throw everyone to the wolves when it would have been just as easy to lead a good fight? I don't think anyone can accurately answer these questions other than Trump.

Health care doesn't begin or end with having health insurance.

ONLY the Federal government can marshal and coordinate the massive resources and logistics necessary to make testing universal enough to get control of the pandemic.

California had business and scientific consultants. The business consultants recommended against it, because of the risk of security and commercial competition.

As California raced to expand coronavirus testing this spring, advisers to the state noticed one company pitching particularly hard to assist: China’s BGI Group.

Meanwhile the economy is in tatters, hundreds of thousand have died, and our children are denied vital educational opportunities. All because of the selfish antics of a deranged incompetent whose only care is that he be reelected so that he can continue his maniacal ways."

And, disconcertingly, the polls tighten to show that, much as Americans tell pollsters that they lay the blame for everything Covid-19 at the doorstep of the White House, they blue the fact that the president’s polling numbers now are in the range of statistical doubt.

This president has the blood of hundreds of thousands on his hands. Even if he’s defeated, it will be years before the final toll is known.

Of course, behind his show of masculine bravado, Trump will make sure he is personally protected from exposure at these rallies. But he obviously does not care what happens to his supporters, or his staff or the secret service teams that must protect him. Every Trump rally is a reminder of who he is. A savage egomaniac with an insatiable need for adulation and a total disregard for his responsibilities as the ""leader"" of this country.

And that puts people like me - a believer in vaccines - steadfastly saying, 'Nope, will not take what The Donald is pushing'.  There are millions of us who have NO trust in this man and will not take a vaccine until we are absolutely sure it is safe.

I have a group of friends, elderly women who absolutely need a vaccine from this deadly virus.  One of those women keeps sending conspiracy theories about all of this.  I'm the odd one out, meaning I will take a vaccine when one is proven safe.  How am I going to know?  Simple.  I am watching Angela Merkel very closely.  What she takes, I will try to take.  She is who I'm looking to for the truth.

It is so very sad that an evil man, a selfish man, sits in the White House during this time.  Sad for America. Sad for the world.

Perhaps if there were leadership from the top and a president who was willing to say “some things just aren’t political” WE would’ve not only stayed calm, but also been able to follow a few simple guidelines with a shared sense of sacrifice and unity.

It's a matter of decency, not politics, to hand this guy his pink slip in November (he actually should have been removed by the Senate hoax of an Impeachment trial).  As for his having the indoor rally, well, when has he not been depraved?  As for people attending?  There's nothing to say, except I guess it's true that there's one born every minute.

They were of dozens of different national origins, spoke many different languages and had a wide range of skin colors.  I am certain they also adhered to a variety of different religions. I was temporarily deluded into thinking there was hope for the nation.

I heard Dan Rather’s recent take on our current SAD affairs - unfortunately my aging mind is such that I can’t quote him. However, to paraphrase, he said November’s election is basically about racism. Either it is acceptable or not.

If Americans are missing anything or deluding themselves it is on this fact! While there are Blacks and other misguided minorities in trump’s groups of trumpets, keep in mind, throughout history there have always been enslaved people who were loyal to their masters as well as men who have sold their souls for silver."
2020-09-14 14:03,"Why can’t we simply focus on how the US seemingly cannot do as well as Germany in managing the coronavirus?
We have huge natural advantages (far wider dispersed population, easier control of travel, etc.) and massive resource advantages over Germany, a similarly structured federal republic.
And yet our per capita death rate is far higher and continues to trend even higher, where theirs is under control.

This is all the nation needs to know about making their decision in November.  Forget the fraud, mental illness, and treason; focus on just one thing.
Incompetence that has killed at least 100,000 more Americans than if any other person was President."

Recently, Mr. Trump has put an exclamation point on his selfishness.  Since March, most Americans have made big sacrifices- both socially and financially - too keep Coronavirus from spreading. But Mr. Trump snubs his nose at us by hosting events where people do not socially distance and by making fun of his opponent’s willingness to be responsible by wearing a mask.  Since the conventions last month, 24,000 Americans have died from Coronavirus.  At what point will the Republican Party stand up to him?  So far there is only deafening silence.  Voters will remember all of this in November when they cast their ballots."

Nevadans voted against him in 2016 and we are about to do it again.  Now if anyone else who really gives a hoot about states rights would just do the same.
2020-09-14 14:48,"All those Trump rally attendees are nothing more than ""props"" for the campaign -- using them for television news coverage and campaign ads, just like he uses Air Force One, the White House, American flags, etc.

Trump has learned the power of imagery to turn himself from a frog into a prince. Everything is a prop, including his trophy wife and Ivanka.

And he knows the power of emotions to reinforce his fake persona, injecting the violence, drama and phoniness of world wrestling into usually staid politics and attracting forgotten voters who bask in his ""temporary"" attention. No wonder the Republicans embrace him.

This is about winning at any cost, what Michael Cohen warned us about. Believe him."
2020-09-14 13:56,"The GOP’s indoor rally is notable for 2 main things:

1. It exposes the Republican Party’s hypocrisy in claiming to stand for “states’ rights.” In holding the rally, the GOP violated Nevada state rules. They don’t care. The GOP is happy to trample the rights of states to limit the spread of Covid, control automobile admissions, insure women’s control over their own bodies, protect the health of their waterways, etc. They are all in for states’ rights, though, when it comes to issues of voter suppression, police culture, and denying women the right to control reproduction. For the GOP, states’ rights is a smokescreen. The real issue is trying to find ways to support far right wing policies.

2. The timing of the rally pretty much insures a lower vote total for Trump in Nevada. It is very difficult to vote when you’re in the ICU. Or from the grave."
2020-09-14 14:23,"Trump's rallies show what everyone should realize: He continues to ""downplay"" the real life-threatening danger of the Covid-19 virus as he willfully engages in conning others to risk their lives by gathering indoors without masks and social distancing. This amounts to the intentional, unlawful ""reckless endangerment"" of others who lives he's more than willing to sacrifice to retain power."
2020-09-14 14:23,"Nevada’s Governor Sisolak seems rightly outraged by Trump’s flouting state requirements, to say nothing of science, regarding the indoor rally, but aren’t there any local ordinance requiring a permit of some kind that would have put the kabosh on the whole thing? Or failing that, why weren’t these people, including Trump himself, arrested for willful non-compliance? A little jail time and a hefty fine can be very persuasive."
2020-09-14 14:42,"I don't understand why the Nevada governor did not exercise
his executive authority and prevent the indoor meeting from
happening. Essentially ogre simply stood his ground,
and the governor capitulated without even a whimper after the song and dance  routine over the search for a  ""suitable"" outdoor venue ended. 

Ogre clearly was looking for a fight to exude his authority, show who he is, and to show the cult of maga he's still their heroic dude in chief. 

To do so, he simply squashed the authority of the governor without even provoking a fight. The least the governor could have done was cut power and water  to the venue rather than ring the periphery with state troops. 

Why didn't he do this? Could someone closer to the state 
please explain this?"
2020-09-14 15:13,I guess Trump is not realizing that he might be causing some voter suppression amongst his base. There’s a good chance a surge of cases amongst the Trump base and their families will prevent them from being able to vote in person.

If ever there was a time to hold people accountable, it’s now.  That would include - trump (significant fine for hosting based on total number of attendees, the host venue (fine based on number of attendees and pull licensing), and attendees (fine).  Perhaps when everyone has a sizable fine and the host site loses it ability to operate, maybe then people will think twice.  Obviously the idea of getting sick, making others sick, or dying is not quite enough...  But based on the attendees, a $1000.00 will sting."

Notwithstanding his ludicrous claims of creating calm, Trump is at once mocking and fanning the flames of both existential threats, daring Mother Nature, who does not like to be fooled with, to strike us all, as well as our country, dead. While he hysterically rails against the occasional urban fire set in protest, both his actions and neglect are doing more to simultaneously burn down the houses of our institutions, environment, health, economy and future than any single individual—#1 or otherwise—in our history. Not only is Trump, as Bob Woodward said, “not the man for the job,” he is a literal and figurative plague on our collective house.

Four of these Covid patients are in their 20's and early 50's. Two of them are very ill. It's my belief that as long as Trump is in office, it will take many many more ill and dying patients to convince Trump's slavishly devoted followers to take action to protect themselves and others from this lethal virus.

Anyone who comes within a few feet of the president at any time gets tested for the virus. The president I heard also get tested at least weekly. 
All this is done to protect his health and to prevent him from catching the virus (as should be done)
And yet he decides to hold an indoor rally with scores of maskless supporters and it’s totally okay with them?

Selfishness is king and there are a lot of people who want the same and don’t want to be ashamed of it anymore. I’m not going to force anyone to wear a mask.

2020-09-14 17:06,"I feel mystified about the lack of upticks in NY and Italy and, for that matter Wuhan.  Spain is an exception, but their reopening was reckless compared to other countries.  My idea is this.  I don't believe that a virus transmitted somehow from the Asian horseshoe bat to humans in Wuhan late last year.  I think the bat to human transmission happened much earlier, probably somewhere in Asia.  All we reasonably know is that a mutation or mutations happened that greatly increased contagion and virulence and hence caused a NOTICEABLE and fairly serious respiratory disease in Wuhan.  I suspect that strains of virus ancestral to the virulent strain that hit Wuhan and subsequently infected the world had already traveled to many parts of the world causing unusual ""colds"" and ""flus"".  If my idea is right, than many of us have already been exposed to viruses closely related to the novel coronavirus.  If so, such individuals would probably have considerable partial immunity to the virulent strains troubling the world.  Maybe the lack of resurgence in NY and other places is because the bad waves of covid earlier this year together with my hypothetical earlier waves of ancestral  viruses have already hit a large fraction of the population and there aren't so many vulnerable people left to be infected.  Maybe we are close to herd immunity.  It would be great if this idea is correct."

2020-09-14 16:46,"I am going to keep writing this no matter if the Times posts it or not: Covid was an ""avoidable"" natural disaster. This was not a hurricane, this was not a volcanic eruption.

The Chinese had everything in their power to avoid another corona-virus outbreak after SARS. As everyone from Bill Gates to Tom Friedman to Anthony Fauci has pointed out, China needed to 1. close its fetid wet markets, and 2. outlaw the consumption of wild animals that are known coronavirus carriers such as bats and pangolins.

They did neither and should be held accountable by the world. If any of you have ever been to the Wuhan wet market and watched the blood flying in many directions as live animals are butchered, you would know what I am talking about.

This was completely, utterly, and, assuredly avoidable."

Now the attendees have been told about the danger.  But the don't believe it. It is a hoax, some say. And the attendees know that Trump himself knows the danger, but refused to say so.

My personal view is the following for those who knowingly are careless regarding safety when out in the public, and pass on the COVID virus, there should be some form of retribution a major fine would be very appropriate. no one should be at risk due to someone else's negligence!"

The vice president of Taiwan Mr. Chen happens to have epidemiology training in Johns Hopkins University. He was interviewed by Fareed Zakaria GPS yesterday. Mr. Chen explained he basically emphasized public health measures on extensive contact tracing, isolation ,quarantine and facial masks etc. There is no economy lock down or even city lock down.

I don't think HHS Azar brought these lessons home to the current administration. Trump knew the novel virus threat as early as Jan 28 which was revealed from the phone conversation with Bob Woodward on Feb 7. He continues to downplay the viral pandemic and engages in reckless ,self aggrandizing behaviors in his political rally of over 5,000 indoor attendees in Nevada ( most of them have no facial mask ).

In dollar terms, small business is almost half the economic activity in America, supports a large majority of jobs.

It supports people and communities in ways our BIG ECONOMY, the one Mnuchin and Trump and Old McConnell take seriously, will not do.

The BIG ECONOMY...global corporations, insanely rich individuals?  The socialist division of American Capitalism, people given government handouts, special breaks, out-right gifts of trillions of dollars annually. People who choke on the word ""enough"".

There is a coming vogue among economist/pundits to note two separate economies in America.

The one of common people: small business, retail (barring Amazon, bloated JCPenny with computers), services, small manufacturers, local tourism, all that.  The only economy that impacts the life of the American street, here people live, work, buy, and die.

The one that will save the country, families, communities, schools, small government.

The one the Mnuchin/Trump syndicate refuse to support in any way.  Though it appears they're beginning to feel the electoral pinch.

Are they lazy?  Remember in 2019, there was no enhanced unemployment to fall back on. Fourth, the incentives for businesses to hire and make money ASAP were increased.  Remember that the recent tax package rewarded big companies as well as reduced their environmental penalties and attempted to protect US businesses from certain foreign goods.

It allows us to lie to ourselves by keeping the numbers artificially low.

The brilliant Mollie Orshansky calculated the poverty level for the Social Security Administration in the early 60's. A thrifty food budget then was 1/4 of the total minimum monthly expenses at that time - and because housing, healthcare, education and other costs have skyrocketed as compared to food costs, the same thrifty food budget is now 1/8th of those total expenses. 

Simply put, a minimum wage would need to be somewhere between $25 and $30 now to keep a family of 3 out of poverty, if politicians didn't shamefully keep these indeces artificially low. Indefensibly low. We are creating a serf class. 

The minimum wage must be raised - for there to be any relation between wages and self-sufficiency in our country."
2020-09-15 19:44,"This headline is truly absurd.

This is precisely why people are suspicious of quantitative data. Qualitative data would paint a very different picture. 

The poverty level has not changed in many years and is a relic. In 2016 if you made more than $24,339 for a family of four you were technically not a family living in poverty.

Most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.

Quality of life for middle class Americans has decreased significantly for several decades.

US life expectancy has declined three years in a row.

Are people working more and more hours and this is why income levels are up?

 It is estimated that 47% of Americans make so little they don't even file federal income taxes!

While Trump can claim continuance of the employment increases in the Obama administration, I have heard nary a word from him about increasing the minimum wage.

Do you suppose Bezos' $13,000,000,000 day had any impact on the ""average American salary""?  Would 365 of them?

How do Bezoses sleep?

Here's a question: do you include unemployed, homeless, ill and injured non-earners in your glorified national income average?  What would that do?

You worry about skewed results.  How much skewing do you incur when you count only working people?

-- even with 75% effectiveness, everyone has to continue wearing masks through 2021

Because of the Trump, 

-- fewer than 50% plan to take the vaccine;
-- fewer than 45% are wearing masks.

Dr Adams, the surgeon general, clearly stated in the last hearings that the democratic senators should not make claims that treatments are being politicized due to the confusion it would create among the public sector that  blindly aligns democratic, and could hinder acceptance of the vaccine, delaying the herd immunity generated by it.  Those familiar with scientific review will understand the urgency that the Trump administration is taking to accelerate review and make treatments available that demonstrate with an abundance of information that they are relatively safe and potentially effective, because they are needed now.   Hindering release of a treatment because a full scale clinical trial has not been performed is negligent in many cases.

The number of deaths continue to increase and yet, there is no viable vaccine or solid, credible promise of one any time soon, especially NOT before November 3rd.

The tone and headline of this article are inappropriate and possibly dangerous.

500 to 1000 people, In the US alone, are dying each day of Covid.  Worldwide, as a consequence of the pandemic and the lockdowns, millions are at risk of dying of hunger.  The economic consequences of the coronavirus are catastrophic, and very likely to continue for years or decades.

The only way to end the pandemic is likely a vaccine.

The good news is that medical science seems close to developing a safe and effective vaccine. Yet, the highly influential New York Times is politicizing this process. It is true that Trump is a flawed politician who might, if he had his way, release a vaccine before it was proved safe.  But it is not Trump who has the authority to approve a vaccine; it is the FDA, in conjunction with the CDC, aided and overseen by perhaps the largest army of medical scientists and epidemiologists ever assembled. There is no such thing as absolute certainty in medicine, but there is no way a vaccine will be released in Western countries before there is a consensus that it is safe and effective.

The  Times continues to publish articles that may well delay a vaccine in the US, and may also contribute to a calamitous “anti-vax” movement, such as the one which has interfered with childhood vaccination in America, resulting much entirely preventable death and disease in our children.

Back off, NYT. Headlines like this may cause real and lasting harm."

I don't know which is worse and I don't think it matters since either way, presidents act despicably when they do it.

THE CUTTER INCIDENT

On April 12, 1955, following the announcement of the success of the polio vaccine trial, Cutter Laboratories became one of several companies recommended to be given a license by the United States government to produce Salk's polio vaccine. In anticipation of the demand for vaccine, the companies had already produced stocks of the vaccine and these were issued once the licenses were signed.
In what became known as the Cutter incident, some lots of the Cutter vaccine—despite passing required safety tests—contained live polio virus in what was supposed to be an inactivated-virus vaccine. Cutter withdrew its vaccine from the market on April 27 after vaccine-associated cases were reported.
The mistake produced 120,000 doses of polio vaccine that contained live poliovirus. Of children who received the vaccine, 40,000 developed abortive poliomyelitis (a form of the disease that does not involve the central nervous system), 56 developed paralytic poliomyelitis—and of these, five children died from polio. The exposures led to an epidemic of polio in the families and communities of the affected children, resulting in a further 113 people paralyzed and 5 deaths."

Since then, I've tested negative on two occasions and these remedies have gone unused. I've stowed away in my cleaning closet in should I ever get sick and need to rely on them in the future.  I should check the expiration date on the Lysol, however.

Now I'm waiting with bated breath for a vaccine to be ready by or around Election Day because the president has tenaciously to fast-tracked its development. I'll be among the first to roll up my sleeves once it becomes available and fully trust Mr. Trump to assure its safety and effectiveness.  He has been far more forthcoming with the public than has Dr. Fauci who uses phony scare tactics to show how much smarter he is than the president. Well, maybe he is, but so what? I still love my president!"
2020-09-12 19:01,"I am 70 years old and presumably at risk for severe complications from SARS-CoV-2. I will not be taking the [Trump] vaccine or any vaccine that has not been subjected to the accepted clinical trial protocols, even if approved by the FDA. I will wait until a vaccine is approved by the World Health Organization or credible body apart from the US government."
2020-09-12 19:32,"Here is my recommendation to the FDA scientific staff.   

I am a biomedical researcher with more than 35 years of R&D experience.  Twice in my career I worked for supervisors who treated science in an untruthful and unethical manner.  In one case my boss took control of the R&D program to impress and ingratiate himself with the commercial staff.  As a result much valuable work on the development of new therapies was lost.  In the other I learned that my boss was altering my data to make my results appear more favorable before he presented them to the board.  

In both instances I resigned and took personal financial penalties.   

If the FDA staff does not like the way their scientific processes are being handled I say resign.  If not, they are culpable in maintaining the status quo."
2020-09-12 18:22,Trump is a lethal threat to all of humanity as is the Republican Senate.
2020-09-12 19:39,More gaslighting from trump. More crimes against nature and humanity.
2020-09-12 19:51,"Plasma therapy, heat lamps, bleach, and hydroxychloroquine have all been touted by this President as potential ""cures"" for COVID. 

If you trust anything that comes out of Trumps mouth or anyone in his administration then you deserve the consequences you get."
2020-09-12 19:49,"""Is An Unvetted Vaccine Next?""
Absolutely !

Trump will promote an untested, unproven, dangerous vaccine, right before the November 3rd election. 
Trump has absolutely no interest whatsoever, in how many people get sick and die from his recklessness.
Death tolls and unemployment roles are of no concern to Trump.

The only thing that matters to Trump, is getting re-elected.
He does not care, what he has to do to get re-elected."
2020-09-12 19:47,"At this point, there is only one way to improve on Trump's management of the pandemic. Only one.

Biden/Harris"
2020-09-12 19:34,"Two thoughts:

Trump doesn't care if it kills people or doesn't work as long as he can say he got a vaccine to the nation by election day.

To the FDA, the CDC, NIH, if you participate in this, it will mark the end of your credibility, it will also mark the end of the vaccination program in the US.  No one will trust any vaccine if you rush this to please Trump."
2020-09-12 19:56,"Between about 500 and 1,000 people die from COVID-19 in the US every day. 

While Trump clearly wants a vaccine available as early as possible, and before the election, to help his re-election chances, it is equally clear that the Democrats want any vaccine to not be ready and approved before the election, so as to help their election chances.

Of the two positions, I see the Democrats position as most ugly and hypocritical.

Given the pain and suffering caused by the disease, any responsible leader should be pushing the bureaucracy to move as quickly as possible.  Given the growing and irrational anti-vaccine movement already present in the US, no responsible leader should attempt to cast doubt on vaccinations (looking at you Kamala Harris).

Between the armies of scientists at the big pharmaceutical companies who will actually develop and produce the vaccines, the large numbers of government scientists and bureaucrats who will oversee and pass judgement on the approval process, and many, many academic researchers also involved, the notion that any President could push something through without a scientific consensus is ludicrous. Whistleblowers would show up instantaneously.

Every thinking and decent person should hope for a safe and effective vaccine as soon as possible.  Even if that is next month."
2020-09-12 19:27,"It is not calming to snark at the states while dumping management of a national catastrophe to governors. What if after Pearl Harbor was attacked, FDR insisted the national defense must be relegated to local governments??
Trump both misled the public, pressed to open the economy (justified lest people commit suicide!) despite clear warnings from experts as new data increasingly heightened alarm. “Hoax” does not give Americans sound guidance."
2020-09-12 19:41,"Would one, just one, media person ask Trump what plasma is? The answer would be instructive."
2020-09-12 19:22,"I must say, I don’t understand this rush-the-vaccine strategy on the part of the Current Man.  Much of his base is made up of militant anti-vaccine people.  I know a few.  They fervently believe vaccines are not only deadly, but are instruments of the deep state to keep the world under surveillance (they believe microchips which track our movements will be implanted in the vaccines).  They also believe vaccines are created  by one-world liberals like Bill Gates to exploit the world for wealth and to take away freedom.  

If the Current Man aligns himself with the science-based vaccine world, how will his anti-science, conspiracy-minded followers make sense of that?  One of them, who hosts a YouTube channel that I keep an eye on, YouAreFreeTV, was dismayed when the man showed up in a mask some months ago.  She said it had been proven that masks were unhealthy, and she was upset that her hero had capitulated to the tyranny of mask wearing.  What will she say when the Man starts pushing a vaccine?"
2020-09-12 19:54,"I am sure the October ""surprise"" will be a covid-19 vaccine said by the CDC and FDA to be safe.  Absolutely no one should believe this or take the vaccine.  We can no longer trust these agencies and this of their own making.  They have refused to stand up for what is right and have allowed Trump and his minions to lie repeatedly to the American people.   I am tired of hearing they ""watched helplessly"" while the Administration lied and bullied. 

I have to call Bob Woodward out here as well for knowing Trump was lying since February but saying nothing about it until now because he wanted to profit from his book.  Woodward has a hand in the nearly 200,000 deaths.  People everywhere should refuse to purchase his book."
2020-09-12 19:55,"While Trump is fixated on a vaccine, and drawing all attention to it, he is mocking the simple, cheap Covid-killer that could make a huge difference.

I don’t get it.  

Simulations and analyses of case transmission events have show that if everyone wears a mask, the virus has very little chance of spreading. It seems that that step alone could end the pandemic.

Why not try it? Wouldn’t that outcome vastly improve Trump’s chance of being re-elected?"
2020-09-12 19:46,"There won't be an accelerated vaccine in the US.  Trump can't beat an adversary like Collins.  There's a reason Francis has been head of the NIH for 11 years- he is a consumate politician/scientist.  He knows how to play Trump and stonewall him and slow down any process by manipulating his own levers of power.  And if Trump tried to fire him, there would be an outright revolt at the NIH."
2020-09-12 19:40,"The answer is unequivocably 'yes'. 
Premature emergency use authorizations (EUA) were granted for hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma, which corrupted the ongoing clinical trials and helped keep the US in the pandemic response slow lane. These therapeutics have real scientific potential, but now we'll never know the true benefit vs. harm without a proper clinical trial. Enrolling or keeping participants in a trial where they may get a placebo is a hard sell moving forward when you now can get a prescription for the real thing. EUAs, by the way, are approved by the FDA. Consider getting a vaccine with an FDA EUA well after November 3, and until then, wash your hands, wear a mask, and socially distance. It's all we've got right now that we know really works..."
2020-09-12 19:43,Even if a vaccine is harmless but ineffective it could encourage people to do risky behavior thinking their protected.
2020-09-12 20:11,What do we know about the vaccines?  My understanding of the trials is that we are trying to find out if they are both safe and effective.  How big are the trials?  Are they large enough to evaluate both safety and effectiveness?  How long do they need to run to make a judgement?  Can someone report on the design of these trials?
2020-09-12 20:19,"Let's assume for the moment that the alleged but vastly overhyped plasma treatment's 35% effectiveness was valid in preventing deaths. That number is reported to be representative of a small subset of hospitalized patients not on ventilators. From that figure one would assume that once on a  ventilator the mortality rate would be considerable higher, even with the plasma treatment, yet still assuming that sufficient plasma is around to treat all hospitalized patients, a highly unlikely case. Under these idealized conditions the 2% death rate among US infected people potentially would  be reduced to about 1.3% of those infected.  Even under these circumstances the plasma treatments do not instill confidence in me or presumably other circumspect individuals to lower one's guard, shed the masks, congregate and go to bars, sports events or what ever.
In perspective of odds, I would not fly with an airline with a crash record of 1 in  2 million (0.00005% - an average of the world's worst), let alone one with a record of 13 in a 1000.

We need an effective and safe vaccine, as well as an acceptable therapeutic treatment for those who get infected even after immunization, before we can rid ourselves from this virus.  Trump's ineffective patchwork cures are political gimmicks, not viable or even modestly effective treatments."
2020-09-12 20:33,"The haphazard way this is being handled gives me very little faith that a Trump vaccine will be safe or effective. 

I'm not anti vaccine whatsoever but my family and I will be the last on line to get Trump's ""agent orange"""
2020-09-12 20:53,"I do not trust this administration at all and I trust its handpicked drug manufacturers even less. So, I will not even remotely consider taking any COVID-19 vaccine that hasn’t been approved for use in the UK and the EU. When it comes to political and shareholder driven medicine, I’ll pass."
2020-09-12 20:58,Keep big Pharma liable for the vaccines they produce.  The threat of multi-billion dollars lawsuits MAY have an effect on rushing products to market.
2020-09-12 21:05,"Plasma therapy is being used now and is helping in convalescence by adding antibodies to the covid-19 virus. Experts it has little chance if harming.That is according  to the Mayo Clinic not the White House. It would be unethical to not  make it available. They are continuing to evaluate where it helps the most. It may very politically motivated to try to delay use or cast doubt on its effectiveness. but that would prevent people getting it who could benefit. But it will be the doctor and other health workers who will use it, not White House or news papers"
2020-09-12 20:12,"Well, reading about the interference of political appointees (read: guys with no explicit knowledge of the discipline they’re working in) into highly critical issues, it came into my mind whether one can still identify any difference between the Chinese government and the Trump administration? Both are not interested in facts and reality, instead both are focusing on image and public opinion. The world already knows not to trust anymore into anything which comes out of that failed administration in Washington, D.C. (and of course the Chinese government), but that these sycophants still betray their fellow citizens up to potentially deadly decisions is unprecedented in a democracy. It‘s up to each citizen to vote in the upcoming election and by doing so to show what they thing about these guys and their ongoing efforts. At least currently you can still vote in the U.S. although your system is not very democratic given the attempts to obstruct voting rights, mail-in balloting and the widespread gerrymandering. So there is at least for the time being a difference to the dictatorship in China."
2020-09-12 20:27,"I must admit that I don't understand the reasoning behind the ""by election day"" rhetoric. Do they really think that will make voters who aren't Trump supporters now suddenly think that he's the second coming? Doubtful."
2020-09-12 20:17,"Here’s my advice for safe protection against the virus: Physical fitness. Starting with not being obese. There is sufficient proof that your risk of death or severe disease is far greater if you’re obese. Plus, if you lose weight you may very well eliminate or improve the other comorbidities that put you at risk, starting with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. 

In addition, if and when a safe vaccine is available, 42% of the USA are in for a rude awakening: Vaccines are far less effective in the obese. Some experts are surprised that this is not getting more attention."
2020-09-12 20:25,"I know that in countries like El Salvador, the country I emigrated from 38 years ago, Convalescent Plasma  has been used routinely to treat patients with Covid -19 and the results have been dubious, to put it mildly. As a matter of fact, five friends of mine contracted the disease and were treated with the plasma. Four of them died and one survived. So I was flabbergasted when President Trump touted it as a cure. I could not fathom that a first world country, like ours, would pin the lives of so many of us to a ""cure"" that has not been really proven to work. By mixing politics with science Mr. Trump has made a tremendous disservice to the American people and I hope we all remember this on election day."
2020-09-12 20:36,"And is anybody surprised by this?  The CDC and the FDA used to be the envy of the world, and their analyses and medical proclamations were gospel.  It will take years if not decades for them to regain any semblance of their former credibility.

Trump destroys everyone and everything he touches."
2020-09-12 20:20,"I'm a science major.

But I don't understand the so-called experts who require us to follow the same, normal procedure for approving vaccines.

Normal vaccines address viruses like the flu.  But the flu hasn't killed 200,000 Americans in half a year and put tens of millions into poverty and food stamps.

We're dealing with a much more deadly virus here.  Seems to me the scientists are too cautious.  If a vaccine for COVID looks promising, I think it's reasonable to authorize emergency use and shortcut the normal process somewhat."
2020-09-12 20:53,"I propose that we do experimental plasma and vaccine trials on specific high risk individuals.  I can think of one obese 74 year old (at least two risk factors right there, but there are likely several others).  Let Trump submit to the experiments and then expose him to COVID-19 by having one of his infected, unmasked supporters sneeze on him.  If he publicly submits to this, I’ll promise him my vote.  

But then again, I might be lying...."
2020-09-12 20:38,"NO!

I’m a RN who has made sure that my children and I have ALWAYS had the required vaccines and even some optional ones. 

BUT under no circumstance would I get Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed” Vaccine.  The Warp is for Warp Data.

Remember this one “F.D.A. ‘Grossly Misrepresented’ Blood Plasma Data”? That’s what you will risk taking this Warp Data Vaccine

It breaks my heart that I can no longer trust the FDA, CDC or NIH. I never thought Trump could corrupt these institutions but he has."
2020-09-12 20:15,"Based on evidence, both written, oral, personal and observational, there is very little if anything for which this administration can be trusted. I would trust the big pharma companies way before the Trump government, knowing their goal is profit, whereas the current power structure's aim is...well it just seems to be evil. Nobody wants a vaccine more than I, but unless and until experts are helming the trials, then it's not going to work for me."

2020-09-12 20:09,"The first to test any Trump-promoted vaccine must be Trump himself, Pence, every Cabinet member, and every member of Congress, regardless of political affiliation. They all have super-duper health plans, so if something goes amiss, no problem, right?"
2020-09-12 20:30,"There's a simple way for Trump to build confidence in his super-vaccine:  announce that he'll be the first to take it, a month before it becomes publicly available to allow time for any unfortunate side effects, which he has assured us are a hoax, to reveal themselves."
2020-09-12 20:52,"If Trump were a drug manufacturer, with his documented model of doing business, does anyone doubt Trump would push to release a not-ready-for-public-consumption vaccine?

If vaccine trials showed significant adverse effects, would Trump conceal them to prevent public ’panic?’  He’s already confessed he concealed the severity of the virus, a death rate 5 x greater than the flu, with air borne transmission.  To make matters worse, to kill more people, he conducted an anti-mask, anti-social distancing campaign. 

Someone who could do that would have no problem releasing a vaccine that either wasn’t effective or safe."
2020-09-12 21:16,"It seems obvious that the desire to find a treatment for covid-19 and political pressure has led to premature emergency use approvals in three cases. 1. Hydroxychloroquine. The decision to approve it for the treatment of covid-19 needed to be reversed in the light of missing evidence.       2. Remdesivir. Although there is some indication for efficacy, the data base for the decision was too small, and the effect size to tiny in order to jeopardize further treatment studies. 3. Plasma therapy. No clinical trial has been performed as a base for the decision. Instead a retrospective evaluation of a small subgroup of a subgroup of a bigger Mayo Clinic data base was taken as an ersatz for a proper study. It may be the base for a hypothesis, but is far from a proof. (Cf Open letter from Dr Eric Topol to Stephen M. Hahn). There are 2 major downsides of early approvals like these:            1. Further clinical studies to identify effective treatments are more difficult to implement as the informed consent may not be given by patients in face of an approved ""effective"" therapy
2. The trust in approved therapies may erode by making decisions in a haste under pressure. The openness to be vaccinated may decrease in an already skeptic population."
2020-09-12 20:23,"If Trump's voters believe that covid-19 is just a bad cold, or a democrat hoax, an idea fostered by FOX, the main source of devotee information, why would a vaccine be important to these folks? Maybe, deep down inside, they now understand what it means to buy into snake oil. But will they take the vaccine? It appears not. The impact of the Presidential deceit will be felt by all Americans for a long time to come."
2020-09-12 20:57,"Shrill.
  The vaccine hype, the off shore drilling reversal.
Desperate times for trump."
2020-09-12 20:43,"All Trump had to do was show some real and early leadership on masking and distancing, and shame the people refusing to mask and distance, and we wouldn't be in such a panic with such a high death toll now. I'm still seeing people claiming that the CDC is saying masking is useless, and I have to literally find pages on the CDC site where they say otherwise and rub these people's noses in it. If this were about them protecting themselves, as hatefully as they are behaving I could just bite my tongue and let natural consequences take their course. But these people are killing other people, to the tune of 190,000-plus since the beginning of the year in the USA alone. And Trump carries some responsibility for that. Remember on Election Day.

Also keep in mind that deaths aren't the only problem.  It is sometimes a nightmare to LIVE with the effects of this, too, and we may have sacrificed as many as hundreds of thousands of Americans' livelihoods to disability because we couldn't handle staying home for a few months.  I hope the ""skeptics"" are pleased with themselves."
2020-09-12 20:31,"The thing to do may be to take the vaccine(s) the Canadians do, when the Canadians do.  I’m very wary of a rushed into production Trump vaccine.  This guy hasn’t got a great track record on COVID truthfulness."

2020-09-12 20:46,"Trump “noted with pleasure a prominent [WSJ] article stating that he had forever changed the Republican Party.” True. The GOP’s 50-year racist and anti-science dog whistles are now openly asserted Republican policies, which means that Republicans can no longer pretend to be decent human beings. It seems ironic, but this is an improvement."
2020-09-12 20:47,"Hopefully, Hahn, Azar, Trump and Pence will be held accountable for their reckless decision making. Administering a vaccine without an efficacy rate high in the 90's is akin to poisoning.  This would be a crime that transcends politics."

2020-09-12 21:29,"The extreme politicalization of the COVID-19 pandemic and response has hampered effective science and effective policy in the U.S. Meanwhile, countries as politically diverse as Germany and Vietnam have had a better response and better public health outcomes than the U.S., which claims to have the world's best healthcare system.  Why?  

In the US no common ground or goals are allowed in this toxic political climate. Not even for the scientists and regulators we rely on to make the right decisions for all of us, not just the politicians in charge, are allowed to be apolitical.  Read the article on Paul Anderson's attacks on CDC, and that is clear. 

Trump and his administration cannot fix this chasm.  They rely and thrive on it.  There is a chance -- hope -- that Biden can reclaim some of that common ground.  However our problems (pandemic and otherwise) will not evaporate with a Biden victory. A Biden administration will face the monumental task of getting a very large majority of US residents across all states (red, blue and purple) on board with any vaccines that may be developed, and sticking with the behavioral changes that can help contain outbreaks. 

Even a safe vaccine is not a magical cure. I believe Dr. Fauci that we are looking at the end of 2021 for significant progress towards ""normal"" activities, and years more for economic recovery.  Without unity and common purpose, the path will be harder, longer, and the end point much worse for most of us."

Any first year graduate student would know how to interpret the data from the study of the mayo clinic.  The right interpretation is not even remotely closed to what Dr. Hahn said in the WH briefing.

I can't be more pro-vaccine, but I will not take a vaccine if it comes out before the election.  i will strongly suggest that my family and friends not to take one.  I will take the one that EU and canada approve.  

How sad is this? The US health and regulatory institutes once was the most respected one in the world, and now their reputation is completely tattered.  Truly, everything Trump touches dies!"
2020-09-12 21:48,"This is a prime example of politicizing the science process for safe vaccines and pushing for a treatment that ongoing research is demonstrating does not work as hoped. As a results health care systems across the nation have halted its use until further evidenced based research is available. The same thing with the vaccine, as a public health clinician, I ask colleagues who are enabling poor and dangerous public health policies: where is the professional oath of ethics? To prescribe only beneficial treatments? Refrain from causing harm or hurt? how can such important process be altered, manipulated just because of a political agenda by a person who has consciously ignored all the information/advise provided? If this person feels that COVID-19 acts like the flu, why is every person meeting with him submitted to a C-19 test? Why is he getting tested so often?  Why did it take so long to use a mask? Where is the accountability? The questions are many, the harm to humanity would be tremendous, are these the consequences the nation wants to deal with? Is this what we want to teach in healthcare programs, that politics trumps our duty to our patients? Communities? That it is ok to look the other way for political gains? Not for this healthcare professional."

2020-09-12 22:18,"President Trump has a host of PR problems. But the image problem he has at the moment that “trumps” the rest is the accurate perception that he totally failed to manage the Covid-19 pandemic, and in an Emperor Nero-like way he fiddled around while tens of thousands needlessly died. This perception was fortified by the recent Bob Woodward disclosures, where he strangely went on the record to in effect admit to this.

So, he’s got a big problem he needs to remedy, and less than eight weeks to do it. This article asks, “Is an Unvetted Vaccine Next?” That question has a relatively easy answer. The answer is that between now and election day President Trump will move heaven and earth to push some sort of vaccine out the door in some way. This might mean it’s administered to one person. This might only mean it’s announced. But he’ll try to do something.

However, he may be thwarted by our conscientious health professionals. If so, no biggie. As the days to the election tick down he will then make the best announcement he can that a vaccine is ready-to-go, that this war is won, and that we’re now all saved due to his wonderful leadership and brilliance.

That at least this much will happen is a certainty. The only uncertainly is to what extent any voters will be dumb enough to buy this, and how it might affect the election. But I still have enough confidence left in the people of our country to believe this won’t work very well, and it hopefully will work against him."

2020-09-12 22:13,"I wish we could leave Trump out of the picture, but I guess I am asking for the impossible.  In May there was a mad rush for blood plasma with antibodies.  In addition to being a possible treatment for the seriously ill, it was thought to confer immunity on essential health care workers.  There was even talk of a ""safety"" certificate for workers who had gotten the plasma.  If I had a close relative who was dying from Covid and everything had been done except giving convalescent plasma, and convalescent plasma were available, would I agree to the treatment?  You bet."

All vaccines go through a special process of oversight within the FDA that is intended to be scientific, not political.  

It is bad enough that so many people these days are expressing hesitancy regarding a vaccine, with concerns about side effects.  If Trump breaks the standards in his rush to a political show, the vaccine will lose support from the physicians and nurses who need to administer it.  No doctor with any moral compass is going to recommend a vaccine that comes with spurious credentials.

He has turned into (or maybe always was) a Trump sycophant, because a real scientist would never come to that conclusion based on that data.  He talks the talk, but does not walk the talk.

It seems, also, that there was some disagreement between the FDA and several other agencies (and the politicals in the White House). And the head of the executive branch resolved the issue somewhat arbitrariely and arguably on grounds that bore little relation to the interagency scientific dispute.

That sort of thing happens with some frequency in large organizations;  I observed it quite a few times during 40 years of federal service, often as a participant on one side of a technical issue. In many cases, if not most, the issue was resolved with little reference to the technical issues on grounds fundamentally similar to those attributed to Trump. Most commonly, it came down to the fact that a system roll-out date had been published, and missing it would cause managers to lose face/credibility/follow-on program funding.

This sort of behavior certainly bears careful watching but, as with much of the reporting about President Trump and his actions, certainly is not worthy of the hysterical reaction described here."

It certainly isn't because of his re-election, after all his base think they don't need to wear masks, social distance as several have put it, they have God on their side, or in this case, the self-anointed second coming of Christ.
For everyone else please vote this incredulous person and his enablers out of office, if you can do mail-in votes please do so, if you go to the advance polling or regular Nov 3, 2020 polls, please stay safe, use your masks, your social distancing, and any other preventative measures as given by reputable scientists/medical professionals.

Those familiar with scientific review will understand the correct rationale that the Trump administration is taking to accelerate review and make treatments available where there is an abundance of information pointing to safety and potentially effecticacy.   Hindering release of a treatment because a full scale clinical trial has not yet been performed is negligent in many cases.  Trump should be commended for his approach:  it will save far more lives than mindlessly following so called scientific protocol.

That oath is still binding."

If it can be proved that the Trump administration, and/ or drug companies rushed through the the approval of mass use of a vaccine, that is later proven to be ineffective or damaging, will either of both be open to a legal class action? Will individuals in the administration, including Trump be open to individual law suits.? Thank you."
2020-09-13 10:40,Every CEO of every company currently working on a vaccine has stated emphatically that no steps will be skipped no matter the pressure from anyone. The FDA has echoed this commitment so why the continued suggestion otherwise?
2020-09-13 12:18,"There is a balance between speed, safety, and efficacy that must be met. The longer you wait for complete confidence in safety and efficacy, the more lives may be lost. Drug trials normally take years to complete. Do Americans really want to wait that long before knowing for sure that a vaccine is 100% safe and effective? How many lives might be saved by expediting the process? I do not blame Trump for wanting to move the process along as quickly as possible."
2020-09-13 12:22,"Maybe now truer than ever, ""the most exercise some people get is jumping to conclusions"". 

Believing that science is real, and following science methodology - involve gathering and reviewing data, testing hypothesis to explain observations, evaluating underlying causes, etc 

While science has never been perfect, there is no doubt it has shaped all of our lives.   ""science"" is not, however, consistent with preselected notions, cherry-picking of data, or use of filters to align an explanation with biased outcomes.

My hope is that each of us will in fact ""follow the science"" when it comes to considering the use of vaccines -please, check the efficacy data when it becomes available, weigh merits vs risks, factor in degree of confidence, then decide. Be rigorous in your examination of key items - do not rush your own analysis. And avoid rejecting solutions ""out of hand"" without weighing data - this is not what believing in science is about."

I had three vaccines injected in me in September, 2008. One was a flu shot which I have never had.   Eight hours later I had a seizer that lasted 8 minutes.  A month or so later I looked up what the CDC had to say on their site and all three could cause a seizer.  A couple of months later I wanted to print out of the CDC info to give to my doctor and the information was no longer to be found on their site.  I wonder why?"

It would be significant if it were simply a timely well proven option and not an election ploy. But he is what he is, and true to form remains a delusional  narcissist. A dangerous combination in a position of power. I am an MD, and am hopeful that a safe vaccine will be proven and become available  soon.  I will not recommend it for family , friends and patients until the science backs up the efficacy and safety. No one should trust Trump’s word for its safety. He has proven he doesn’t care about the “it is what it is” people that have been buried due to COVID-19, but also because of significant issues with denial , misdirection and frank negligence on our Executive branch of government.  He just wants to continue with his position as as Commander and Chief snake oil salesman . Get out the to vote. Make Trump a bad memory."
2020-09-13 3:37,"I would never believe one word that comes out of Trump’s mouth.  A SAFE vaccine coming before November 3rd, 2020 seems completely unlikely because Trump appointees like Dr. Birx, Dr. Redfield, Dr. Hahn, former pharmaceutical lobbyist Alex Azar, and others have been afraid to be honest with the American public.  They have deferred to Trump rather than contradict his lies and lunacy.  Dr. Birx has lately found a tad bit of spine, but too little and too late.  Dr. Fauci is the only one who has any credibility, although it even took him a while to directly contradict Trump.  

I will not submit to a COVID19 vaccine unless Joe Biden is president.  I trust him completely.  He has suffered enough personal tragedy to understand that promoting a SAFE vaccine, which might take more time, is more important than politicizing the early arrival of the vaccine as Trump wants to do so that he can win an election.

We have gone through dozens of quack cures-from Pay for Pray Christian Science to magnetic earrings. They don't work and are soon forgotten. What bothers me is that far too often, doctors refuse to assert  professional authority as the arbiters of final resort in issues specific to medicine. 
Of Course, perhaps the GOP can set up it's own hospitals and invite the last few medical practitioners from Mary Baker Eddy's Christian Scientists, and use the money thus raised to pump up Mr ""T""s bank accounts-for his candidacy, or to pass along to his kids.

And, as support for that assertion, we need only to look at his past position with regard to this pandemic.

Just like Justice, Homeland Security and even the Postal Service in this jaw-dropping kakistocracy, public health has been fully politicized. If credible information is what we seek during this life-threatening crisis, we need to look elsewhere.

Until that kind of reassurance is given to the American people, I agree with the commenter who suggested waiting until other more reputable nations approve a vaccine. The reason Trump can’t bully Dr. Francis Collins is that Dr. Collins is a man of integrity. Mr. Trump continues to play a form of medical Russian Roulette with American lives. The man lacks a conscience."

Any hint of a failure in step one will make step three just about impossible. It is hard enough with even vaccines that have been used for many years - measles?
Politicians - leave step one to the experts and concentrate steps two and three. A needle shot would make a great photo op. Better then holding up a bible."

I did not have any side effects months earlier when I got the first of the 2 part vaccine.

The Shingrix vaccine is considered very safe and effective yet for me, the side effects were quite unpleasant.

I can't imagine rolling the dice on a Trump vaccine rushed through for political reasons with little to no reliable information on safety, side effects or efficacy.

Trump can't be trusted.

I'm hoping Biden will be elected.  I would trust Biden on a safe effective vaccine.

When I taught as an adjunct professor, I used this “cooking the books” in the ethics section of the chapter of income recognition. Condensing the example, the accountant is being pressured to recognize a pending a sale as a sale in the books. The pressure to do this would come the owner of business who will explain the sale is a sure thing. And if it is booked, we get the needed loan. This is unethical, but what it does is transfer the risk to the accountant. For if the sale does not go through it was the accountant’s entry, not the president of the company. You are responsible for the forth coming events.

In my example we continue to discuss loss credibility, and the effect of this on your future. Then how to handle this pressure.

Here the risk moves from Trump to the Dr. Hahn, & Dr Collins. It appears the reward is for the Dr. is a cupcake in the Oval office.

Worst, it gives false hope to a family, and let us say it is given and does not work,  and because the plasma therapy was used, a another alternative was not, & the other alternative could have worked.

My husband and myself who eagerly approached retirement, grateful for our good health and modest financial security, eager to travel, and longing for the hugs of our socially distanced grandchildren, have suffered the consequences of Trump’s malfeasance.

2020-09-13 12:32,"These NYT articles are as confusing as Trump's tweets sometimes.  They do not help to reassure the public.

The issue with the vaccine is two-fold: Safety and effectiveness.

These are totally different things.  

All the vaccine frontrunners that are currently in large trials have been shown to be effective in challenge trials in non-human primates.  Therefore, I have little doubt that they will also be effective in humans, where effective means being at least disease modifying, perhaps not preventing illness entirely, but dramatically reducing mortality rate.  Basically what the flu vaccine does.  Reimmunization may be necessary, as immunity will wane faster.

When it comes to safety, there are different considerations to be made for each vaccine.  RNA vaccines are inherently safer, since there are no infectious viral particles.  An immune response will only be mounted against a synthetic partial viral protein. 

By contrast, the Oxford vaccine uses a replication deficient adenovirus.  That virus is geared to infecting the cells in comes in contact with, but it will no replicate. However, if it accidentally infects a peripheral nerve, it can move into the spinal cord and elicit an immune response there.  That may have been the case in the volunteer who developed transverse myelitis. How often that happens is important here, as the risk needs to be weighed against the dangers of encountering the real coronavirus.

In sum, I would volunteer right now for the Moderna vaccine."

2020-09-13 11:55,"Very disappointed in Dr. Francis Collins! We already know that Dr. Hahn at FDA is a political hack who has sold his soul to President Trump. Let's hope Dr. Collins does a better job of maintaining his integrity.
The best test for any vaccine will be for Dr. Tony Fauci to administer it to President Trump, Baron Trump, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Ivanka's children, and Donald Trump Jr. Then we may have a better idea about its safety and effectivness. Maybe they could do it publicly at a Trump rally"
2020-09-13 13:01,"Maybe dismantling the pandemic team and firing all its members so that money can be funneled to the donor class might not be such a good idea but what say you, Republicans? Four more years? Maybe twelve?"
2020-09-12 22:11,"This is called leadership. Thousands of people around the Country were receiving convalescence plasma therapy under research protocols. Results were good. Trump pressured the FDA to allow it to be used more widely. Leadership. 

Same goes with vaccine. Trump paused for the development of multiple vaccine efforts under Operation Warp Speed. Now, we are on the cusp of having two effective vaccines to begin to administer in mass. Leadership. 

The only reason to be critical of these efforts is if your partisan hatred of Trump is greater then your desire to save lives."

2020-09-13 5:36,"We now know what Mr. Trump knew and when he knew it. 
This detailed article outlines yet another episode in Mr. Trump's growing list of high crimes in office. 
The US Constitution states that the president ""shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed"". He has obstructed the law by blocking the mission of the NIH and CDC as passed by congress and signed into law long ago. 
The law demanded that Mr. Trump keep Americans informed of the danger posed by the Novel Coronavirus and promote their safety. No different than hurricane or terrorist warnings.
He was knowingly derelict in that duty in violation of his oath of office. 
Mr. Trump has caused untold death and misery by knowingly misleading Americans, as proven by the Woodward tapes, and withholding life saving aid and information. 
The stupid defense of plausible deniability is unavailable. 
Increasing damage to the economy and deaths will be our fate barring a miracle for which we have no guarantee unless we replace the president and congress with leaders who support medical science."

Good lord the limits of American democracy are being tested. It’s only as strong as it’s weakest element that is now found in the Whitehouse. Where are all those checks and balances we hear about? The man is out-of-control! In most other functioning democracies the Parliament or House would have expelled this clown a long time ago."

The “deep state” is working against him he will tell his supporters.  The court jesters, Azar and others, will attempt to mollify the tweeter toddler and release a vaccine, or some other snake oil remedy, against the advice of those “deep state” scientists.  And many will suffer the consequences as those before them due to the tepid reaction and lies concerning covid-19.

I have never has as much distrust in a presidential administration  since Nixon as I do now.  Will I believe vaccines to be safe if Trump is pushing slip-shod approval.  Nope.  Will I be willing to be injected with one of those vaccines?  Again, no.
If Trump and his merry band of snake oil salesmen get out of the way of scientists and quit politicizing the efforts to find a viable vaccine rather than pushing approval for political gain, then, I will consider it.

For the time being, my trust in Trump’s regime is still where it was almost four years ago-in the toilet."

After all these false claims, any vaccine that is not fully vetted by EVERY reputable scientist and doctor stands no chance of being widely accepted. There is absolutely no credibility left in any of the agencies in this administration. They are all defective due to Trump’s influence."
2020-09-13 13:12,"I had great regard for FDA and CDC. Some of my students worked at the FDA a while ago. But no longer. I will not take the vaccine even if my life depended on it.

I no longer trust Trump's doctors or health officials at the WH."

He lied and treated every citizen with contempt about their ability to manage facts.  

Turns out, it’s his supporters who not only can’t manage facts now, but couldn’t be bothered to seek facts in March while he peddled sunshine, bleach injections and magic.

He peddled eerything but the truth about its transmission and effectiveness of masks.

You can lead his supporters to facts, but you cannot make them think."

2020-09-13 13:26,"I am very concerned about the possibility that rushed vaccines will pose safety problems that will not manifest themselves until substantial time has passed after one has been vaccinated.  That would result in millions, perhaps tens of millions of people already having been vaccinated with it.

Trump is a source of the corrupting influence that would cause a vaccine to be approved before proper vetting.  But Trump is not the only source of such corrupt influence.  Certainly China's dictatorship and Russia's dictator are sources.  

But there is also a source that few people regard as such....the so-called ""medical experts"" themselves.  We should not by default place 100% confidence in them (remember that the CDC ""experts"" told us not to wear masks back when the virus was raging in March, only changing their mind several months later).  We should always maintain some skepticism at their recommendations and demand explanation from them with some evidentiary support. 

Just in the past few days we have seen the Oxford/AstraZenica large phase 3 trial halted because of a serious adverse event in a patient.  But now the trial has been resumed.  That decision was been made in secret and anonymously by the ""experts"".  Those ""experts"" even refuse to explain the basis for their judgement to resume the large phase 3 trial.  The ""experts"" use patient confidentiality as their excuse to keep the public ignorant of the facts and basis for their ""expert"" decision."

Earlier in the Trump Pandemic Year Dr. Birx spoke these words:

“He’s been so attentive to the scientific literature and the details and the data,” Birx said in a Christian Broadcasting Network interview in late March, praising Trump’s “ability to analyze and integrate data.”  I’m nobody but along with many brighter than I called for her to step down then.  Dr. Birx is no longer useful to the American people’s safety and health in by her remaining in her current position.  

Now she is witness to Trump’s behind the scenes evil manipulation of the science standards she claims she holds allegiance.  

Trump and his cabal and some strange media people are now saying that Woodward has now and back then had a amoral responsibility to reveal his information.  I 100% disagree with that assumption.  

I’ve stated on these NYT Comment Sections that it’s the advisors, The Cabinet Secretaries and people who assist them who were witness to this (O’Brien being #1 as he informed Trump in January) who should have then and should now come forward.  

This is because because Trump has given himself absolution from his sin of omission he committed by lying about the serious danger of COVID-19 to the people he took an oath to protect."

There is a colossal difference between giving doctors and scientists all the resources they need to complete the scientific process as quickly as possible (that’s fine), and putting the public at risk by demanding that professionals short-circuit the process for political expediency.

In turn, the professionals need to have the integrity to Just Say No when pressed to take scientifically inappropriate actions.  Trump can huff and puff all he wants, but he can’t force them to sign off on stupidity."

Using his presidency as a way to protect him from prosecution is bad enough but it is what he is doing while he remains president that is reprehensible, unacceptable, and times illegal . 
His capitulation to Russia and Vladimir Putin is tantamount to a betrayal of America. His cavalier and careless attitude toward the pandemic when he knew that this was a lethal deadly disease is not only unforgivable but should be punishable by law ; he should be arrested for criminal negligence and reckless endangerment on a massive scale. This is not somebody you reelect -this is someone that you indict arrest, and convict."

Religion is godstory marketing --selling dogmatic beliefs based on propaganda. it often sells false hope.

Politics is ideology marketing--visions of a better polity. It can be based on science--that is progressive politics. But it can also be based on dogma and false hope-- that is regressive politics. 

Not all politics is Trumpie politics. It was already the subject of cynicism. , But Trumpies make it a cesspool. And not just in Trump's mind."

Trump has NEVER, to my knowledge, done something simply because it's the right thing to do - something with no transaction attached.

2020-09-13 14:47,"45 has compromised every institution. Nothing he, or his sycophants, say, can be trusted. It is mind-boggling, a sign of the depravity of the GOP and the current populist conservative movement raising their ugly heads worldwide, that a man this vacant could be President of the US. The worst is yet to come."
2020-09-13 14:14,"Everything with which Donald Trump comes into contact is diminished thereby. A Covid19 vaccine that may actually be vetted by a panel of true experts as both effective and safe will be viewed with skepticism and fear by many who have seen Trump lie about everything during his almost 4 yrs in office. Everything is sullied by Trump. Some are made to fear the fictional ""Deep State"" conjured up by Trump and his supporters. But a majority of Americans now fear the Trump State as conjured up by Donald J. Trump himself.The Republican Party has been so badly polluted by Trump's behavior and the fawning sycophantic behavior of Republican politicians bending over backwards to flatter this foolish narcissistic president. The Republicans of 2020 are like the Whigs of 1860."
2020-09-13 15:31,"The danger is that a lot of public health spokespeople, including Dr. Fauci, will feel obliged to approve any vaccine that gets released even if they privately aren’t convinced of its safety and efficacy because they won’t want to erode trust in the medical profession or encourage anti-vaxxers - or lose their jobs. We really can’t trust anyone connected to the U.S. government at this point. I will be seeing how the vaccine succeeds in other countries like Germany and Canada before I take it myself."
2020-09-13 15:45,"With both the CDC and the FDA politicized, any proclamation from either can only be taken with a grain of salt.  I won't argue whether or not it was deliberate, but Trump has damaged the reputation of both organization to the point where it will take decades to repair.   Any recommendation that a Covid-19 vaccine is ""safe"" can thus only be taken with great skepticism. 

 For my wife and I, elderly and with preexisting conditions, we'll wait and see,  We've been homebound for six months: we can do six more.  Or even twelve."
2020-09-13 16:27,"Like many of Trump's great ideas rushing a vaccine out before election day will harm him, not help him. 

People already distrust Trump when it comes to COVID.  65% don't trust compared to the 35% that do.   

A vaccine that is suddenly released without the proper amount of testing and without the support of respected scientists will cause him to lose votes, not gain votes."
2020-09-13 16:33,"Like the story of the little boy who cried wolf, now very few people will be comfortable taking a vaccine that has Trump’s stamp of approval.￼ Most people will correctly assume that he put political pressure on those individuals who say that the vaccine is safe and effective."
2020-09-13 16:09,"We can readily understand the concerns that this President will attempt to speed up a vaccine's release without proper vetting,

'It's not a question of if but when'."
2020-09-13 16:14,"I think the trumpian call of ""get it done"" could equally apply to all blue voters on November 3rd.  ""Get it done"" folks by voting this guy out of office.  PERIOD.  Our very lives depend upon it."
2020-09-13 15:20,"Trump ruins absolutely everything he touches.  In the case of the CDC, by monkeying with the numbers and pushing ineffective treatments, he is destroying the credibility of a world-class agency that took decades and incredible effort and expertise to build.

It will take this country decades to undo the damage inflicted by this man and his GOP enablers.  And that process can only begin once we evict them en masse in November."
2020-09-13 16:14,"When Trump signs up for Plasma Therapy and the Coronavirus vaccine, I will believe that he is a man of his words. 

In fact Trump should go on national television live and show the American people, how he supports both of these programs by getting the Plasma Therapy and the vaccine injection. 

The man loves a large audience. 

I’m sure this event would get his largest audience ever."
2020-09-13 15:01,"Trump cannot force the early release of a vaccine.   He simply has no constitutional power to do so.  So please stop suggesting that approval is susceptible to political pressure from the White House.  It’s not true—and what The NY Times and other progressive media outlets accomplishes is to drive down the inoculation rate once a safe and effective vaccine is ready.  

The first line of approval rests with the pharmaceutical companies.  They are not inclined to release a vaccine until they know it’s safe.   In fact, two of them have suspended trials because of adverse reactions.  

The second line of defense is government approval.   And as much as Trump
may benefit the early release of a vaccine—before the November election—he simply does not possess the ability to force an early release.  So please stop suggesting it.   The suggestion is disingenuous and dishonest—and not in the best interest of the country."
2020-09-13 15:50,"I'm not an anti-vaxxer but I will not be 1st in line or even 10 millionth in line to be injected with a sketchy, inadequately tested Moderna/Trump vaccine.  Moderna has never brought a product to market, or gotten any of its vaccine candidates approved for use by the FDA. 

Stéphane Bancel of Moderna sold Trump on how quickly Moderna could churn out vaccines and Trump responded by betting all of his (taxpayer-funded) chips on Moderna. Trump did not like hearing the head of R&D for Sanofi Pasteur saying it would take a few years to have a safe, effective vaccine ready for the public.  

Moderna executives, board members and a venture capital fund run by Moderna's chairman have sold hundreds of millions worth of company stock this year.  Bancel and two other execs became overnight billionaires because of Trump's (taxpayer-funded) largesse. Their laser-focus is on stock options and executive trading plans."
2020-09-13 16:08,"When Biden wins in November, the entire senior management at the NIH and the CDC should be replaced.

2020-09-13 15:48,"After reading about epidemics I’ve come to realize that we have been able to eradicate only one. Smallpox, a human infection was an easy one, if you got it once you couldn’t get it again. 
 Think about poliomyelitis and how by desperately trying to rid the world of it we have created a monster. In our hubris we just make viruses more resilient. 
 We should continue to sequester ourselves if we want to survive and those of us that want to believe those in charge should do so with the understanding that they don’t actually know much more than you do. But it wouldn’t be the first time a leader sent thousands to die for an ideal."
2020-09-13 15:19,"Another cases of conservative politics trumping science (pun intended).

How do these “officials” who head government agencies, e.g. NIH, CDC, etc, allow themselves to be so easily manipulated. 

Are they afraid if they don’t go along with the President’s demands that they will lose their jobs?

Are these people that insecure?

Can anyone explain this to me?

These are supposed people of science. 

By the way - in the articles closing paragraph, Trump was celebrating the Wall Street Journal article about how he had changed the face of the Republican Party.  The article doesn’t indicate if the change was for the the better or worse."
2020-09-13 15:14,"""But on the preceding Thursday, they were told that was too late: The decision had to be announced on Sunday, the day before the start of the Republican National Convention, ostensibly because making the announcement during the gathering would appear to be politically driven.""

Who do Trump and the people working for him think they are fooling? Every single thing these people are doing is politically driven. Trump himself has hyper-politicized all aspects of governing like no president before him. Clearly Trump & Co. are betting voters are too dense and clueless to see this."
2020-09-13 15:50,"There will be no vaccine distributed before the election. If problems occurred because the vaccine being sold to the public did not meet long established drug trial testing for efficacy and safety, the company and government agency responsible would be liable for massive law suits. 
Beyond that, there as yet are no manufacturing facilities, no tooling, no established protocols, and no plan on how to distribute 330, 000,000
vaccines. 
Also, no one how complicated this rushed through vaccine would  take to manufacture. 

No. As everything else Trump says, he’s lying. And just as he does when he gets caught lying, he’ll lie again. This is just another example of how the sickness and death of Americans are simply collateral damage in his quest for another term."
2020-09-13 14:52,"I used to trust the CDC, but now that it's been politicized I no longer do. It is unnerving that the nation's supposed health authority has allowed itself to be bullied by Trump. I feel that in a way, all Americans are being bullied by Trump, as he takes over every aspect of the government. With a  mostly non-existent Congress we are really on our own. It's impossible to believe any information that comes from his government. I just have to decide for myself what to do, and that is to not take Trump's vaccine. We can't even be sure that we'll be told about any side effects the vaccine causes. I suspect Trump could be aware of harmful side effects, but deny them and still order the vaccine to be given. I trust nothing."
2020-09-13 16:04,You folks don’t get it. No company is going to approve a vaccine for sale unless they have the data . There isn’t enough money in the world available to cover liability lawsuits if something goes wrong. Their whole company will be at risk.
2020-09-13 15:53,What about the physician’s Hippocratic oath? Is it just tossed aside? Far as I know it has nothing to do with politics. Physicians and scientists should stand their ground and ignore the influence from no-nothings. They know better and should be getting more backup from Congress—all members.
2020-09-13 16:23,"Trump is searching desperately for a silver bullet to end this thing, and therein lies the problem. There is nothing to indicate that even a thoroughly vetted and approved vaccine guarantees long-term immunity. But this is not Trump's goal in any case. His goal is to have something, anything that he can announce as an absolute cure before the election --- injectable bleach, infrared light, hydroxychloroquine, convalescent plasma, a vaccine. It would not surprise me in the least if he announced a partnership with Russia to use their vaccine. This is his only hope, and now that he's announced to the world that he deliberately lied about the severity of the pandemic, it's more critical than ever that he makes this go away.

In the meantime, I am searching for a reason to believe that the NIH, the CDC and the FDA are not already deeply compromised. Aside from Dr Fauci --- who only recently has stopped walking on eggs when disputing Trump --- I have yet to see one of the leaders of these organizations offer real resistance. They say all the right things, promise to adhere to strict scientific rigor with the vaccine, but they have said nothing about long-term efficacy and nothing about necessary vaccination rates. Everything revolves around Trump pushing them, and they've made numerous missteps in response.

What we are moving toward is a vaccine that no one will trust, with no evidence that it will sustain immunity."
2020-09-13 14:55,"What bothers me the most is that there are appointed and elected officials who believe that they ""work for the president."" That is not correct, while the appointed serve at the pleasure of the president, they work for We-the-People.

Additionally, where does Trump get the idea that he can direct the actions of individual citizens, groups of citizens, business owners, et al? Trump doesn't have the understanding that he works for us and we tell him what to do. 

Laboratories and companies will research, test and deploy a vaccine. While they will be paid, perhaps by the government, that is We-the-People's money, not Trump's private accounts. 

The POTUS will do what We-the-People want or we shall remove him from office. He is not the boss - we are!"
2020-09-13 15:09,When did we give the president - any president - the right to override medical science?  And when did the scientists start caving to political pressure?  Are they that afraid of losing their jobs?
2020-09-13 15:44,"Despite efforts from the government scientists and pharmaceutical companies this week to say they would not ""sacrifice public safety to political expediency"" for a Covid-19 vaccine, the mainstream press continues to post articles casting doubt on the process within the U.S government for its approval.  When it comes to public safety and confidence in a vaccine, should it be successfully developed, this line is extremely dangerous.  The President oversteps his authority all the time, but unless it can reported that he has done so in approving the Covid-19 vaccine, these articles that cite side issues like the back and forth over the approval of the plasma treatment should be stopped. There is enough skepticism about vaccines, not just in the U.S., but also worldwide; does the press really want to contribute to that just because they want to do everything possible to hurt the Trump administration?"
2020-09-13 16:21,"Welcome to Trump's America. The message matters far more than the reality, no matter the consequences. 

In some respects, it looks remarkably like Soviet Russia.  No wonder Trump admires Putin so much."

Are none of them aware that we do not have a king in the U.S.?

I'm so disgusted with these people who resign, allegedly in protest, and then remain loyally silent.  Peter Strozk, Col. Vindman, Sally Yates, even that former loyalist Comey who helped give us this monster, they all stood up; they're still with us, they survived.  trump doesn't have enough flying monkeys on his side, YET, to rule this country like a king.

Stanford University medical staff have distanced themselves and denounced the likes of Dr. Atlas.  But there are more of Trump's quack doctors showing up on Fox News, Breitbart and Alex Jones.  Hopefully, if a Beta vaccine does show up, all the Trump cult shills will take his Kool-Aid en masse.

Had we fought hard enough for those who's death were made worse by this administration's lies earlier, then perhaps this administration would have thought twice before putting our lives at greater risk now with their lies.

Heather Hayer was killed by a white nationalist movement, but there was blame on both sides?
The loved ones of Khashoggi suffered after our own government covered for his murderers and continued to do business with them. 
Imagine the pain of the family of Warmbier, who was so tortured that he died days after being released from captivity in North Korea as Trump bragged about being in love with the dictator responsible for the death. 
Black Lives Matter repeatedly states that it is an organization dedicated to making sure that Black Americans get treated equally under the law. But, the lies persist. Their struggle is twisted into a 'Law and Order' gimmick to gain re-election for the current administration as more and more Black Americans die from police brutality.

Death made worse by lies is closer to each of us now as we are forced to hide in our homes month after month reaching for a truth that will allow us to resume our lives safely, a truth that is out there but choked, twisted, and hidden by the megaphone of a POTUS who couldn't care less about us."

I'm not taking a Trump vaccine for the Trump virus. That would be like taking Trump Tutorials for a Trump University class. I'm not a born sucker. I'm not now, nor have I ever been in the target audience for Trump. I do overlap it somewhat (male, blue-collar - but that's it, and I never would have been wistful for daddy's factory job, had he had one) and I lack the sucker gene. 

What's both hilarious and sad, is that many Trumplodites are also anti-Vaxers, wholly fearful. Be they propagandized by celebrity anti-vax campaigns, or QAnon, or Alex Jones. Or those possessing deep distrust and hate of any Gov't ""health"" programs. People steeped in a level of conspiracies that few people realize exist. More numerous and disturbing then any of those being covered in the current news cycles. 

So out of the gate, there will be hundreds of thousands of Trumplodites refusing vaccines. People that not even his forked tongue can otherwise convince. Hundreds of thousands of ""normal"" Moms, convinced by Jenny McCarthy and/or Goop, that they pose health risks for their children. 

Add the rushed to market nature of a Trump vaccine...and you have a ready made failure.

Now he wants an inappropriately early announcement for a vaccine that will deal with a problem that was going to magically disappear.

The untoward Trump Administration pressures (“Get it done by Friday!) on scientists struggling to “get it done” rapidly but competently and reliably are disgraceful and harmful.  Now, when a Covid-19 vaccine is released, we will be even more skeptical, fearful, and suspicious than before.  Moreover, we’ll probably wait and see, rather than be inoculated, waiting for more revelations and more detailed, reliable information.  So far, the omens don’t seem good."

In a Twitter post three days later, he accused “deep state” officials at the agency of slow-walking approvals of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments to harm him politically.’

Trump doesn’t care if there really is a vaccine breakthrough before the election. He just wants the appearance of one or someone to blame for ‘maliciously’ holding back approval. 

And Trump has already put so much time and energy into building expectations of a new vaccine that there’s no way he won’t follow through one way or the other. 

The absolute last thing Trump will do, if an electoral college victory remains within striking distance, is to give up and accept the lack of scientific evidence for a Project Warp Speed breakthrough before November 3rd."
2020-09-11 13:17,"China seems to have to be more global in the late stage trials in number of countries. So there is a need for China to work with other countries to find an effective vaccine. Countries mentioned in this report including Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, even the Philippines (through 1500 Philippinos in USE), involved in the late stage trails of Chinese made vaccines. Instead of seen as a coordinated efforts of increasing soft power, the original intention was mush simpler: China has few infection cases and all Chinese vaccines that are in Phase 3 trial have to rely on foreign countries. The countries agreed to hosting the trials would require something in return. It is transactional on both sides. What's so unigue about it?"

If they don't feel ashamed, and responsible, then it shows how immature their country is. 

Their actions have caused enormous suffering and close to 1 million dead, most of whom died alone in isolation without their loved ones, and I am frankly surprised the world has been so soft with China. If this carries on much longer I don't think it will continue to be so accommodating.

""Saving face"" is the governing mantra of Chinese culture. If they do find an effective vaccine and mass produce it and get it out to all the peoples the world over they have harmed, then they will begin the process of saving face."
2020-09-11 13:36,"All countries, including the US and China, should pledge to make their vaccines, when and if they are approved, available to frontline healthcare workers in global viral hotspots, provided that local distribution networks are already set up and functional. Such availabilities would greatly help to prevent the total collapses of the local health systems in viral hotspots and would probably be the most cost-effective uses of the early production runs of such vaccines in terms of lives they may save."

China does not undertake these actions out of the goodness of its heart.  All of its ""generous"" efforts are designed to expand its sphere of influence, and so far those efforts have been very successful.  The U.S. has been outgunned and outplayed by China for a while now, and of course things have gotten infinitely worse under Trump, whose idea of international diplomacy is to bludgeon (or attempt to bludgeon) other countries, and to withdraw the U.S. from critical treaties and agreements that would have maintained or increased U.S. influence in critical geographic areas."

2020-09-11 15:26,"The billion dollar ‘loan’ means nothing to those countries because (1) it requires purchasing China’s own vaccine (2) which can be marked up at any price they wish to cover the value of the loan since it’s their own product and (3) the loan will surely be unpayable in cash, and instead be turned into valuable access to resources - material, ports, geopolitical power. 

Thus China, after being responsible for the viral outbreak (I say this as no fan of Trump), destroys other economies as a result and further preys on their desperate need for vaccines.

This is where either China gives free doses to ALL needy countries (not just a limited number to Bangladesh), or the WHO is given sufficient resources to do the same."
2020-09-11 15:45,"China is ahead of the world in pretty much every respect.  Their GDP is 28% larger than the US (using correct PPP accounting).

In medical science they're way ahead with many more researchers working around the clock on this Virus and they have the world's best manufacturing labs.  Note that manufacturing mistakes cause quality lapses, so manufacturing is an important aspect of vaccine safety.  All vaccines have to meet WHO's international standards before they can be distributed, so that's good.

China will likely get there first with the safest and most effective and cheapest vaccine.  

And you really need to go with the leader because these coronavirus vaccines are a tricky business.  The problem with mRNA vaccines and coronavirus vaccines in particular is these vaccines create a very robust antibody response, but when the patient encounters the wild virus, they become severely ill and often die — a reaction known as paradoxical immune response or paradoxical immune enhancement or antibody-dependent enhancement.

They look good in P3 antibody trials but blow up in the real world.  

There is also another problem - virus interference.  Ten studies have found if you get the flu vaccine, you're much more likely to get a coronavirus infection.  The risk goes up, in some of those studies, about 600%.  In other studies, less than that — 200%, 300%, 400%.

This is why it usually takes over ten years to develop a vaccine, and why a politically motivated vaccine is dangerous."
2020-09-11 15:07,"Chinese almost never do anything just to help or benefit someone else. In Chinese we say, Chinese are always ‘seeking our own profit’. When Bill Gates and Warren Buffet held a philanthropy conference for China’s billionaires and millionaires, literally not 1 person showed up. China’s first modern hospital was built by a foreigner (John D Rockefeller). China’s MIT (Tsinghua) was built by a foreigner (Teddy Roosevelt). Charity in China is a one way street. When El Niño devastated their neighbor, neither China nor Taiwan did anything. Taiwan later helped, buy only in reaction to a humiliating story that Germany on the other side of the world was the Leading source of relief funds. If the Kitty Genovese story happened in Chinese society (in or out of China), it would not be news. Bystander effect has always been the norm. There’s no Good Samaritan story in 5000 years of China culture. China’s offer to help nonChinese respond to COVID should be viewed with some healthy suspicion — the same as you would view generosity from Russia."
2020-09-11 15:05,"There is actually a long standing in China for the ""wealthy"" to help the poor.  When there is a drought or famine, the well to do is expected t open their grain storage  to provide food to the poor.  It is really more of a implicit social contract expected of people with high social standing.   The same applies with  friends and families-- you help out your family member when they are in trouble. ( just add another pair of chopsticks at the dinner table).

It is understandable that the NYT  reporters feels the need to put a negative spin on all items related to China ( to pass editorial review?)  because their reporters have been kicked out of China due at least in part to Trump's policy.   However, spinning this strictly as a PR campaign and as a way for China to make amends is also misleading.
Instead, NYT should encourage the United  States government  to become  more forward looking by running a new global Marshall Plan  that would not only help out State and local governments, but also to offer assistance  to other countries in need.  A pledge to allocate a portion of its vaccine purchase already paid in advance to Astra Seneca/ Cambridge  or Moderna vaccines would also be made available to medical personnel in  other countries would go a long way to get some PR credit of its own."

He came by to every household in the neighborhood - just prior to festival seasons.  He knew that virtually everyone was delaying even the purchase of cigarettes, had nothing really saved up, but was eager for some money to pay for the ceremonies and rituals in which we engaged.  He offered, so politely, whether we needed money.

It was just a loan.

We were afraid of him.  We did not want his money.  We had seen him give money to people on day, come back in two weeks, and throw them out of their house using an assortment of thuggery, cops, and local politicians.  We had seen his goons beat up old people who had taken money from him.

There were likely times when the thug's lending saved someone's life.  Sometimes, it went to pay for food and medicine. There were new suckers every day, so the thug had takers for a long time.  No matter what the money did in the short term for the borrower, he lost everything in the longer term.  Homeless, penniless, friendless.  

That thug is China.  It is strange, no one seems to want Chinese help.  What a pity."

It is clear to me that we should NOT trust any vaccine produced by this country. I am basing that opinion upon a PBS documentary I watched two nights ago about the ethics of editing human genes. Where is the respect for life, for one's faith in a power greater than ourselves? Where is the respect for humanity when one Chinese scientist, Dr. He Jiankui, broke the rules to create the first gene-edited babies in 2018? He kept his experiment secret, ignored peer warnings and violated a code of scientific ethics."

I believe that this has been part of the reason that our response has been so delayed and inadequate. Remember the ""relief"" when this hit Italy because then we would get some ""real"" information and see how a modern Western nation could successfully deal with Covid without resorting to the ""draconian"", ""totalitarian"" and ""Maoist"" strategies employed by China. Then to our astonishment and horror, we saw this thing literally steamroll Italy. Oops. It really doesn't matter what China publicly said, they gave us a step by step playbook of how to handle this. What they did to contain and mitigate was literally visible by satellite and based on sound reasoning and science. If we did not see them as ""other"" we would have appreciated the severity of the threat sooner and would have followed their, now proven, strategies. We are blaming them for our own failures and continuing to do so will jeopardize the global cooperation that is required to deal with this and future pandemics."

I say we should never forget or forgive China for this global calamity. I for one will not be persuaded by their “goodwill” gestures to earn back respect.

    Why did the US not include the simpler proven vaccine types as parallel tracks of development?  It's an obvious fact that a vaccine needn't be 100% effective to squash COVID, it only needs to get the R0 number below 1 (e.g., 0.8) and then (decreasing) exponential growth will take care of the rest.  The Russian trick of using two types of human adenovirus, the second as a booster, to overcome pre existing adenovirus immunity -- such a simple strategy yet it was completely overlooked (or ignored) in all expert opinions printed in the mass media up to the Russian announcement.
    There is such a thing as technical overkill, where more complicated solutions are preferred over simpler ones just because (period).   Ideally, urgent problems are solved with the fastest most direct means possible, with bleeding edge research and development focused on those pernicious problems that can't be solved with existing methods.  (We'll never out of pernicious problems.)     
    Maybe my analysis is wrong and the Chinese/Russsian vaccines will turn out to be duds, but it looks to me now that ""simple+sufficient"" is likely to win the day.  A form of Occam's Razor.  (Hopefully the more novel vaccines won't be far behind.)"

That’s where the blame really exists.

So China creates the circumstances for deadly pandemics- then buy friends by promising a vaccine to the disease that China essentially brought into the planet.

Now we already see that AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine test has been halted because one person was found with very severe side effect. The Moderna company's manage team all selling their stocks now. But we all know if Moderna's vaccine works, their stock price will be at least doubled, which makes their actions highly suspicious. Also, Moderna has never succesfully made any vaccine before. Also, the MRNA vaccine has to be stored in a cold environment below -4 F, otherwise it will start to decompose. This will cause problem in the future for the storage and transportation of the vaccines.

2020-09-11 12:09,"RE: Hunger in Afghanistan:

I repeat my refrain--everyone I know has heard it from me many times; I have written it hundreds of times. Is anybody listening?

To die from lack of food is a slow and painful way to die, a horrible death. It takes weeks. To hear your children cry from hunger, watch them suffer, and watch them die is a fate worse than death.

More than 9 million fellow humans, more than 3 million of them children, die from hunger each year, year after year. Some years it is 11 or 12 million. 

There is more than enough food in the world to nourish each and every human, and the transportation and logistics are easily accomplished, more so today than ever. The cost would be small compared to most policy initiatives, even compared to the amount that one rich western country spends on dog food. One tenth of the amount spent on professional sports in America--that's what it would take each year to eliminate the horror of starvation. What is lacking is the political will. 

In other words, it is the policy of rich western countries to starve millions of children annually. It serves rich Western countries' ""self interest.""  Starvation of millions is a political choice; the policies serve many functions, none of them morally defensible.

Setting the sensitivity at the level recommended by independent virologists eliminates most of these positive results.

That correlation is higher than for the percentage of elderly and the percentage with high BMI. Containment measures are critical when and where transmission rates are high.

Until we have a vaccine or better therapeutics, stabilizing the epidemic requires either 63% immunity in the population as a whole, or a combination of reduced contacts and shared infective airspace that produces the same effect.

This doesn’t even require hard “lockdown” or economic disruptions. It just requires enough common sense to use a combination of efforts to reduce infective contact by about 62% in order to substitute for immunity. That combination of measures includes setting gatherings outdoors when possible, keeping some social distance, maximizing fresh airflow, limiting group size, and wearing a mask in confined indoor locations like stores, elevators, offices, and shared transportation. It’s the combination of containment actions that matters. Not what Trump says."

1. There have been 88,000 ""cases"" discovered on campuses.

2. The ""60 deaths"" involved college employees (most likely old employees with an average of 2.6 comorbidities)......Not students.

3. The NYTimes ""Survey"" conveniently fails to report how many of the 88,000 cases led to hospitalization. Why? Perhaps because the number is close to zero.

4. The NYTimes ""Survey"" conveniently fails to report how many of the 88,000 cases were asymptomatic. Why? Perhaps because the number is close to 88,000.

Yet, students are being subjected to testing and tracing and enduring a complete loss of freedom and privacy. They are being forced under risk of expulsion to live under an authoritarian and totalitarian system and most Americans and mainstream media are cheerleading this absudity."

It's going to get worse.  Much.

As others here point out, there's plenty of food in this old world.  The problem is greed, and logistics.  And idiot economic theory that says we need to starve people, send them to the street, humiliate and abuse them in order to save their capitalist souls.

Somehow Republican legislators, probably the wealthiest demographic outside our 1%, imagine a single check for $1,200, which is all millions of American ever saw, or a measly $600 raise in unemployment is a gift of plenty.

They swear if they grant one penny more millions of people will refuse ever to back to work again.  Which is a lie, of course, and vastly disprove by research and experience on the ground.

Before COVID we had hundreds of thousands of children regularly going to bed without meals, and hundreds of thousands of adults.

Now, faced with the worst crisis in a century, Republicans refuse even to consider help.  Except of course for almost ten trillion dollars in socialist handouts to the wealthy and global proportions.

In an age when we go into national mourning for a few thousand people murdered en masse yet refuse to consider 200,000 dead worthy of comment (if we're Republicans that is) this piling of tragedy on tragedy for political gain is beyond obscene."

No, that's not correct. The virus doesn't cause hunger. The lockdowns do.

This is what so much of the reporting on the pandemic ignores: the lockdowns and consequent collapse in the world economy  causes substantial, and lethal, collateral damage. This is the major reason why a minority of voices caution against indefinite continuation of Draconian lockdowns.

The novel corona virus is a bad actor. The virus is responsible for all the deaths. Our leaders, as they try to manage the pandemic, and caught between a rock and a hard place. There are no correct or easy answers; our leaders must balance the benefits of lockdowns with the very real damage, including hunger and starvation, that the lockdowns cause.

Even if the Democrats had won in 2016 we would still have an impossible situation.  We need to do the best we can, try to achieve the best balance, and hope for a vaccine.

Well, perhaps it provides China with a wedge to achieve economic dominance in a future trade war with the US.

But the US is on an unsustainable path because of population growth.

And although there is no government preventing the discussion of the impact of population growth, the media, including the NY Times, characterize people who are concerned about population growth as racists and bigots.

Whereas China introduced a one-child policy which enabled it to raise living standards for a more slowiy growing population.

The one-child policy is desperately needed in the third world.  The population of Africa is projected to double AGAIN by 2050.  That will cause immense suffering as the world warms up making large slums in Kinshasa, Johannesburg and Nairobi into killing fields.

The Republicans deny global warming altogether, while Democrats seem to characterize Margaret Sanger as a ""eugenics-sympathizer,"" hence subject to removal from a position of honor in Planned Parenthood which she founded.  (See NY Times article of July 21.)

2020-09-11 23:59,"""China Uses the Promise of a Vaccine as a Diplomatic Carrot""

Early in the pandemic, China like other countries facing the onslaught of Coronavirus for the first time, knew very little about it.  As Chinese scientists learned about it, they made their information available to the world’s scientific bodies. In fact, on January 11, they published the full sequence of the Coronavirus genome, sharing that consequential data with everyone (please see 1). Those working on viral diseases know how critical the sequencing information is in developing specific diagnostic tests and in identifying potential treatment options.

Now, according to Bob Woodward's book, Mr. Trump got the information about severity of Covid-19 and the fact that it can be airborne from president Xi Jinping.  Thus, Mr. Trump blaming China for secrecy about the virus - given the fact that Mr. Xi was educating him about it - should be seen as it is: another act of an unscrupulous con man.

Whatever Mr. Trump accuses China of doing to the US, China must have done that also to South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany.  Then the question is, how come these countries, and many others, have managed to handle the pandemic much better than the US? What does differentiate these countries from the US?

Sometimes physically, such as their ongoing plan in Tibet and Hong Kong, to migrate their people there thus weakening the local resistance to their rule, or economically, so countries find themselves totally dependent on their trade. Here in Hong Kong we are just past half time in their very long game that kicked off in 97.
They have bought up nearly all media, they have brought in their own education heads of colleges and universities, they have suffocated free speech with the national security law and their game is playing out nicely. 
They have even managed somehow to avoid being blamed for starting this pandemic! Whatever way you look at it China is responsible for the carnage this virus has wrecked up on the world. Either through their negligence of continuing to allow their society to 
consume wild animals that we know were linked to SARS. 
And/or by the massive coverup of the initial outbreak in Wuhan. 
A coverup that delayed the rest of the world’s response and that allowed thousands of China people to travel and spread the virus to Europe and beyond to the US. 
They even have the WHO as a complicit ally in this coverup. 
So, in respect to their supposed vaccine, it’s like the arsonist offering water!"
2020-09-12 2:46,"Dr. Fauci’s prediction seems optimistic. Since this never country seems perpetually unwilling to take necessary measures, it’s hard to see any realistic near-future timeline for this country to  return to normal. 

In fact, it’s doubtful a vaccine will do much. Given the popularity of conspiracy theories and the prominence of the anti-vaxer movement in recent years, I’m not sure people will be willing to be vaccinated. And if vaccine distribution will be anything like test distribution, even people wanting to be vaccinated may not get a chance."
2020-09-12 2:25,"Doctor here. 

The headline on Fauci's comments was misleading.  He did say that getting back to normal could take a year, but by that he meant 100%, going to a crowded theater without a mask, for example.

He said it will take a while to get and administer the vaccine and then do all the public health stuff like testing and tracing. I agree. 

However, what is important to note is that things will get better between now and a year from now ( if his forecast is correct, of course).  Total cases will decrease, deaths will decrease, ability to socialize will increase, ability to go to school will increase, and so on.

Watch his interview and see for yourself.  And wear your mask and separate by 6 feet. 

Disclaimer: I admire Fauci; he is an intelligent and good man.  But remember that no one knows the future."

Maybe it's better for all to see."

The same goes for the CDC and Redfield's obeisance to the Trump lies and misinformation.  

As a physician, I am sure the career scientists at FDA are sincere. I am also sure that Hahn, as the FDA commissioner is nothing more than a political hack and will overrule any objections from his staff. He will approve an EUA for a vaccine, any vaccine, regardless of the safety or efficacy, just to please his audience of one. SHAME ON HIM."
2020-09-11 16:33,"Had the FDA not overtly manipulated the data on blood plasma while simultaneously authorizing its use before the trials were ended, and all in response to pressure by Trump, this might be credible. 

Had the FDA conducted rigorous trials on HCQ before advocating its use, bowing to pressure from Trump, this might be credible. The evidence for HCQ was based on a flagrantly poorly-conducted pseudo-study  (Raoult et al, 2020), so we can rest assured that the scientists and doctors at the FDA knew it was bogus, but they authorized widespread use of HCQ anyway.

Had the FDA acknowledged that there is no way there will be enough data to demonstrate both safety and efficacy of a COVID19 vaccine before the elections, the protestations of independence and integrity by FDA administrators might be credible.

Remember the 1976 Swine Flu vaccine rapid rollout with resultant GBS side effects and discontinuation of the vaccination program.

We now have industry moles in the FDA being pressured by financial incentives as well as political concerns.  There may well be well-meaning scientists within the bowels of the FDA but their jobs are on the line by the murderous republican liars that are presently in charge.

I am afraid that ship has already sailed. It is clear to me, at least, that the FDA has been making politically motivated decisions - the approval of Hydroxychloroquine for example. There was exactly one person who was interested in that sham.

It is hard to see how the FDA's reputation can be recovered. It will probably take years."
2020-09-11 16:40,"Please folks read the article on the 1976 swine flu vaccine. If a huge population is susceptible to Guillain Barre, it is because of that hurried vaccine. The FDA has given common citizens no reassurance with it’s bizarre and uncoordinated moves. First it was unconditionally slow, then it approved the useless and coronavirus contaminated test made by NIH, then it approved the ill thought out hydroxychloroquine treatment, then it reiterated, now it approves vaccines made not by universities but by private companies with billions to lose. Trust the FDA? Not a chance. Especially in the wake of the tragic and terrible adverse effect with Chadox, which at least was a thoughtful, conventionally constructed vaccine, quite similar to both the Chinese and Russian vaccines. And unfortunately similar to the terrible HIV vaccine. The mRNA vaccines, never been tried on humans before, and now being touted by the FDA as safe? I’d rather take precautions to minimize covid with masks and hygiene than risk my long term health. 

Please note it would be lovely if Moderna would explain to the common public why they are using a full length transcript of the spike protein in their vaccine and why it will not be used by sars cov2 in reconstituting it’s replicants should a human be infected and be given the vaccine."
2020-09-11 16:43,"With Trump in charge, there is no way there won't be overriding political pressure.  As has happened in many other departments and agencies overseen by this administration, the senior staff will resign in protest or be fired, but it will not matter with as long as Corrupt Trump is our President."
2020-09-11 16:45,"I sincerely wish the CDC scientists would generate a similar statement.  Other agencies also.

Useful, in multiple ways: one of them may be less obvious to outsiders is in bolstering agency morale- knowing many colleagues share such commitment can help.  

It would be tricky to do - but it would also be helpful to include the word ""resignations"" in such statements; not as a ""threat"", but a plain statement of fact.  ""If it becomes impossible to conduct our work with full integrity, scientific and otherwise, many of us are prepared to resign.  Non-scientists need to fully comprehend, that for committed scientists, ""integrity"" is the exact equivalent of ""food"".  It is not possible to exist without it.  If we can't find it here, we must go elsewhere.""

If Mr. Musk, or Bezos, Gates, Buffett, or others of that ilk were smart, they would publicly state that ""We will hire any such resigning scientists immediately, and create private laboratories where they can pursue their work.""  And do it.  Preferably as a joint enterprise, but any path would do."
2020-09-11 16:46,The hydroxochloroquine and convalescent plasma debacles have already undermined the FDA. This is a desperate plea to ignore that recent history. I'll stick to judging the FDA's actions rather than their hollow words.

Anyone still in the Trump administration is a morally bankrupt, ethically challenged, and mentally diminished toady who’ll forever be tarnished with their association with Trump.

2020-09-11 17:07,"Last week Dr. Hahn, a political appointee and FDA commissioner, misrepresented the benefits of plasma treatments for Covid-19. Don't have to ask who was, at that time, shilling for plasma treatments in the name of reelection. Either Hahn doesn't understand the science and its statistics, or he was passing on falsehoods on behalf of you know who. Either is serious, since Hahn is permitted to override the career professionals on the minor matter of approving or rejecting vaccines. The rhetorical question being, Are any of the present batch of White House political appointees competent, ethical public servants? 

By the way, say Hi to the new member of the Covid-19 task force, Dr. Atlas. Virtually all of Atlas's colleagues who are experts in epidemiology or infectious diseases signed a public letter warning the nation that Atlas was not qualified. They went on to give us a point by point rebuttal of pretty much everything Atlas was promoting. Anybody else see a pattern here?"

P.S. - I work in healthcare. Tranverse myelitis is a very big deal as an adverse effect."
2020-09-11 17:16,"It feels like too great an emphasis is being placed on a vaccine and too little on how to keep each other safer now.  The fastest a vaccine has ever gone through the regulatory process was 4 years.  There is no Sars vaccine and 40 years on, no HIV vaccine.  False hope of a vaccine this fall, could produce despair or rage, when none is forthcoming.   Wear a mask, social distance, do not attend gatherings of 5 or more. If you are over 65 or have underlying health problems, stay home."
2020-09-11 17:22,"This manufactured divide between science and public policy is incredibly frustrating and damaging to our nation. As usual, there is truth on both sides of the issue, but neither side will acknowledge any good coming from the other side. Yes, we all want a vaccine that is safe AND effective. Historically, it takes many years and millions of dollars to achieve the level of ""proof"" that the FDA requires. Therefore, politicians should not promise a vaccine too soon. Any such quick fix will probably not meet the rigorous standards of other FDA approved vaccines so the American people will be wary. On the other hand, tens of thousands of people are dying of Covid-19; many more are suffering long-term or permanent disability. It would be a public service to introduce a vaccine is definitely safe but that might (just might) also be effective. Even if the vaccine has not jumped through all the FDA hoops, it could well save many lives and reduce the pressure on our healthcare system. So why not approve a ""fast track"" vaccine and probably save many lives? Why can't the scientific and policy wonks in our country respect, talk to and compromise with each other for the good of the country?"
2020-09-11 17:55,We know that the FDA is a respectable and reliable entity. We think that they will not approve a vaccine without the certainty that the formula contents is safe. We know how they work since 1973. The process of launching foods or remedies into the market is very professional and based on scientific methods. They can't take into account money or political pressure. We love the FDA. Working during long years in American multinationals helps us to defend FDA's criteria and values.

Americans would be well advised to view any department or agency within the Trump administration as being totally corrupt. Better safe than sorry.

As for me, I will not take any vaccine that is produced while Trump is in office. We have learned this week that Trump had no problem with lying to America about the virus and then mocking preventative measures, so what would make anyone think he'd be straight forward and honest regarding a vaccine.

The scientists and analysts at FDA during my time were very dedicated, well educated, highly proficient in their specialties. Same with CDC and DOD. They occasionally made errors but were honest in correcting themselves. After the implosion at State I thought we were done.

If you have the susceptibility could you then be given something like an ACE inhibitor to help prevent it?

2020-09-12 23:31,"While some symptoms are the direct result of the body's failure to fight the virus off, e.g. pneumonia, cytokine storm, I suggest that many if not most of the symptoms being ascribed to COVID, including those described in this story, are actually those of  thiamine deficiency.

The known symptoms of mild thiamine deficiency include chronic fatigue, brain fog, anxiety, breathing difficulty, racing heart, radiation sensitivity, gastrointestinal issues, vertigo. Why might this be the case? In fighting the infection, the body's cells require energy, which is supplied by their mitochondria. In producing chemical energy from glucose the mitochondria use and consume thiamine. If you happened to be low on thiamine when you encountered the infection, perhaps due to a poor diet, you might end up being thiamine deficient, opening you up to poor mitochondrial function and these symptoms. Remarkably, I keep hearing stories like this but I never hear thiamine deficiency being posited as the cause, or thiamine supplementation being suggested as the treatment. 

Dr Derrick Lonsdale worked on the subject of thiamine deficiency for many years (he is now 96), documenting symptoms which are now being rediscovered due to COVID. He and Dr Chandler Marrs have been documenting their work on a website called Hormones Matter. Unfortunately, it seems that their ideas have been rejected by the medical establishment and largely ignored. I would suggest that they are now long overdue for a renaissance."

2020-09-13 2:59,"Viral neurological symptoms are more widespread than generally acknowledged. Dr. Karl Menninger, a founding member of American psychiatry, wrote ""Psychoses Associated with Influenza""  after the 1918 pandemic which symptoms ranged from delirium to dementia praecox which was the term at that time for schizophrenia. Some recovered, some not. The epidemic of encephalitis lethargica after 1918, linked to the flu, was treated in the book (and movie) ""Awakenings"" by Oliver Sacks. Katherine Anne Porter, author of ""Ship of Fools"" describes her own flu experience graphically. Post viral syndrome is quite real and thought to be a cause/factor in chronic fatigue syndrome. 
The 1918 pandemic kick-started virology, and we're hoping if any good comes out of this one it will include wider understanding of all the nuances that may attend viral infections. Some hypothesize leukemia, MS and others are viral in origin. Some cancers definitely are. Oh, and build more predictive healthcare systems. 
There are such things called human endogenous retroviruses which thru some mechansm I'll never understand, have over the millennia, embedded themselves, viruses, within our own genome. Part of our genes were once viral materials. 
Viruses never go away. They may retreat as does Ebola, for awhile, more often they mutate to become less deadly, more resistant to the immune system, and easily transmitted... to insure they survive.

In the stem cells that were made to differentiate into brain organoid in the test tube, if there were 1 million cells, 1 million viruses were added to them. This is not human brain, and infection success with this overwhelming number of viruses is not surprising in the test tube. Altogether, reporters should wait for published peer reviewed articles.

Schumer's headline screams:
SCHUMER & NYC HOUSE MEMBERS ANNOUNCE: WE WILL NOT SUPPORT ANY BILL THAT DOES NOT HAVE ADEQUATE STATE & LOCAL OR MASS TRANSIT AID; PROPOSED GOP BILL DOESN’T INCLUDE IT & IT WON’T PASS SENATE OR HOUSE
Pulling incompetent politicians' chestnuts out of the fire (including Cuomo who ran up billions in debt long before the virus hit) is no reason to use desperate people as a political football. That's a whole 'nother issue.
Extending the suffering of people simply as leverage for delivering pork to his cronies reveals Schumer as cruel, and out of touch. People need that money. This is not the time to deal with gubernatorial malfeasance, misfeasance, and nonfeasance.

Clearly, the senator and the Congressmembers who joined in the press release (Hakeem Jeffries, Adriano Espaillat, Gregory Meeks, Jerry Nadler, and Nydia Velázquez) just don't care.

At some point he offers a stark contrast between the GOP/Market view of the economy- Markets are perfect and know everything so that is all we need to guide the economy vs. the Keynesian idea of government stimulus and spending to get over the rough spots.  The problem with the first view is that it assumes people are honest who run the markets, or they manipulate the government to manipulate the market in their favor.   Power and greed usually trump honesty has we have seen over and over again.

The Keynesian idea assumes everyone will naturally want to  find a job and work- that isn't always true either.  There is a lot of anecdotal evidence in this article that people at taking the money and staying home.  

The idea of the $600/week is a good one, it keeps money pumping through the economy, and doesn't ask a lot of questions of those receiving it.  However, if it does keep people from working it will be a detriment, it will just drive up prices as the economy won't be able to supply enough to meet demand."

The bigger, longer term issue is obsolescence of the manual/ unskilled laborer. We have tens of millions of unemployed service workers. It doesn't look like these jobs are coming back, at least not for some time. How long until the fabricator jobs mentioned in this article are unnecessary? 

The point of the stipend is to keep the economy moving, not to just give out free money.  It's not like the recipients are hoarding their $600 like little dragons on a pile of gold.

Where's the evidence for this leap in reasoning?  Maybe dental assistants weren't as eager to go back to work because they spend their entire day within inches of people's faces.  Higher risk than food prep workers for sure.
Purely anecdotal, but as a phone triage nurse, I spoke with many pregnant women over the summer who worked low wage jobs facing the public that were terrified to go back to work and wanted the providers to write letters excusing them from having to do so.  We couldn't do that because there was no evidence, until very recently - unsurprisingly - that pregnant women were at higher risk for contracting the virus or for suffering more serious consequences.  Sadly, we know now that that is indeed the case and we have begun supporting these women in not returning to their jobs or asking for accomodations to their jobs so they are not as exposed.  
My main point being that for those in low wage jobs but with high potential for exposure - grocery and department store clerks, restaurant servers/bussers, essentially the people the make the nation run - the risk is hardly worth their usual pay.  In such a situation, who wouldn't stay home, especially with schools and daycares closed, if they could receive a benefit that allowed them to stay safe and pay the bills?  I would!"

How can we even be talking about the benefit like it’s a moral hazard, like it’s encouraging laziness? 

I know the pandemic has been hard on small businesses, but they received their own emergency benefits, and like the ones offered to workers they were inadequate. So why aren’t they blaming the government for that inadequate response instead of blaming workers for not wanting to risk their lives by working?

He will continue on the same path of destruction regarding the coronavirus, so I will probably be looking for a low-paying ""essential"" job in a climate of rising illnesses that could put me in jeopardy of getting sick.

Also, I fear that I will get a job, only to be laid off when the next wave of illness hits. At that point I would not be eligible for ANY unemployment benefits because I would not have worked enough hours. 

And one more thing: the company that laid me off paid a lot of lip service to shareholders, saying that they took a lot of safety precautions, but in reality, all they did was set out hand sanitizer and that's it. What am I going to say to an employer when I go in to an interview and the employer tells me to remove my mask? How am I going to be received if I ask this employer what safety measures they are taking now? If I get the job, what's going to happen if I start there and nobody is wearing masks or following protocol? If I quit, then I surely won't get unemployment.

2020-09-10 15:51,"An easy change could be made to jobless benefits to reduce the chance they discourage employment. Right now they are usually triggered based on whether you are employed and are time-based (valid for X weeks maximum). This discourages people from taking temporary employment at a much lower salary because they’d lose their benefits. Instead, if jobless benefits were capped at a dollar amount and protected income, rather than employment, this disincentive wouldn’t exist. For example, rather than being told I am eligible for 24 weeks at $600 per week, state that I am eligible for up to $14,400 at a maximum of of $600 per week, not to exceed my previous income. If I previously made $1200 per week, I could take the $600 per week benefit for up 24 weeks. But say I can find a job that pays $500 per week, part time. Today it would not make sense for me to take that job and lose my benefits. But under a revised system, I could combine that with my benefits to net $1,100 per week, because I am still making less than the job I lost. If I could find a job for $800 per week, I could take $400 in benefits per week (capped at my old weekly earnings), but get income protection for 36 weeks rather than 24 (since I’m limited by the $14,400 number, not a specific time frame). Income protection would also help many working families who may be in a precarious financial position even with jobless benefits."

The bottom line is if you have a job that’s a career then generally the extra unemployment is not a deterrent from working. But if you’re a dishwasher in a restaurant then the extra money might make a difference. Why? Because the career job tends to have benefits and a future which the employee does not want to risk. But if you have just a ‘job’ then what are you really losing by taking the extra unemployment? It’s not like you’re losing benefits. Like anything, the answer to this question is far more complicated than the GOP concept that everyone wants to be a leech on social welfare which is ridiculous."
2020-09-10 15:56,"Perhaps some employers are offering jobs based on their historical approach versus being adaptive to today’s employment environment. 

Child care is a big concern in my area.  All schools are teaching remotely.  IF one can find In-home child care, how on earth could someone afford it with a $12-15/ hr wage?
No way.   The suggested ‘living wage’ in my area is $19/hr for a single person, no children. 

Many families are multi-generational in one home.  Workers may decide returning for $18/hr while risking bringing COVID home to at-risk family members is not worth it.

There are many contributors effecting people’s decisions on whether to return to work during this pandemic which has turned many, many people’s lives upside down. 

Typical of legislators to vastly oversimplify their analysis to something derogatory of workers.

The employer who does well and attracts workers, will be the agile one who recognizes, hence adapts to, the current environment by offering potential employees solution partnerships. These may address transportation, higher wages, full ppe, safer work stations, assistance w child care, etc.

These are real-life issues that are now critical for many people to return to work.

A.  What America's most famous economists taught his students, when he was still an excellent researcher, winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize, and wrote his own text books, to make sure that his students would understand him correctly. 

 Macroeconomics,   5th Edition, page 210

“Public policy designed to help workers who lose their jobs can lead to structural unemployment as an unintended side effects. In other countries, particularly in Europe, benefits are more generous and last longer.. 

The drawback to this generosity is that it reduces a worker’s incentive to quickly find a new job. Generous unemployment benefits in some European countries are widely believed to be one of the main causes of ‘Eurosclerosis,’ the persistent high unemployment that affects a number of European countries.”

2020-09-10 15:58,"Personally I know a number of people who received the $600 supplementary unemployment through PUA who earned more monthly than they would have working their normal hours and therefore did not look for work, and who've saved thousands as a result of this assistance. I don't think this is a bad thing and shows the need for a universal basic income."
2020-09-10 15:59,"My company let me go after 25 years and 5 months of furlough with an email and a 5 minute chat with an HR Rep I never had met. I was under a year to reaching 65 years old.  I had never taken a sick day since the year 2000 and routinely missed vacations out of loyalty to get the job done. In March I was performing at a high level by every benchmark and was highly respected within my company. I noticed those that kept their jobs skewed heavily to the younger side...I believe the company used covid19 to try to limit their perceived liability by using the pandemic as a justification for clearing out older workers using lower work hours as the justification..though I was a 65 hour a week worker with plenty to do even given the circumstances. 
Do I want to work..yes!!!  is there work out there for me?  Not that I can find.  The wealthy are profiting handsomely during this crisis but as usual always resent what they perceive as undeserved assistance to those they feel are not worthy..the lower class. I would go back to work this very moment if I could..the stress of the financial unknown is causing me far more stress than worry about covid19 and will most likely be what destroys me..not the virus. BTW way..yes I am very angry.  If Trump would have dealt with this crisis professionally and honestly we all would have been back to work in May I have no doubt.  His total ineptness and self interest have destroyed the lives of many like me and ruined the nations recovery."
2020-09-10 16:01,"This does illustrate why a universal basic income could help: the UBI benefit would not change when one takes a job, so there would never be a disincentive to work. Working would always raise income."
2020-09-10 16:01,"Why can't folks who toil for so little take a relatively short break from monotonous work?

This group of workers aren't getting stock options, free meals, ping pong, massages, yoga lunch hours (though offering Uber rides was generous), etc. Why should or would they kill themselves for a low-wage job during a pandemic?"
2020-09-10 16:08,"There are two major issues with the jobless benefits in my mind, which I hope Congress addresses if they pass a second round.

1) Any flat dollar figure across the US is foolishness. $600 is too low on the coasts and too high in the middle. I'd love to see if the economic studies referenced show disparity by region. I'm not surprised at all that the examples given are from Ohio and Michigan, where median income is below $600 per week. My own company's experience mirrors that of Clips and Clamps - we couldn't fill our many open positions until the stimulus went away. Any unemployment benefits should be proportional to the amount earned before unemployment. High enough to cover your expenses, but low enough to provide some incentive to get back to work.

2) The program punishes workers who stayed at work or went back! If you are going to provide stimulus, do it for everyone below a certain income level, and remove any impetus not to go to back to work. Why even create the internal debate in the mind of the employee whether or not to return to work?"
2020-09-10 16:09,"Instead of blaming the workers who lost their jobs, we need to blame the corporations who set the system up. Companies have been paying poor wages for decades while skimming millions off for executives. 
Most people are willing and able to work but they must be paid living wages."
2020-09-10 16:12,"In the calculus for fair wages, it seems that only labor/operating costs and price of product get taken into account.  Thus the wailing begins that if workers were paid more, they would have to raise prices.  How about all the money skimmed off to go to shareholders, why can that piece not be adjusted?  There is a quick turn to 'well, you can't be paid all that much for running a cash register' but no thought to the person getting money for nothing more than having disposable wealth and a stockbroker.  If no one is working and things are not open, why is the stock market rising as it is?  isn't it supposedly reflecting the value of these businesses that then turn around and beg for bailouts?  
It does not nor does it ever seem like the discussion on unemployment benefits and raising the minimum wage broaches the cruel reality that it is very purposeful to keep people struggling and desperate, and that now the shareholders are getting anxious that their enslaved workforce might be having their first chance to truly assess their value.  The increased unemployment benefit was only helping that process, thus the strong push to shut it down."
2020-09-10 16:14,"The premise that the unemployment supplement deters folks from working is spot-on. However, the solution is not to Dicksensianly reduce the benefit, but rather to implement Andrew Yang's idea of income supplements to everyone below a certain income threshhold that is high enough so that such folks north of that level are already incentivized to work because they have good jobs.  In such a schema, lower-income folks are not disincentivized from earning more income, while folks who really can't work are not left to the wolves."
2020-09-10 16:24,"It seems once again that the same coin, government money, has two sides. The very same businesses who clamored for government money to keep their businesses solvent are the ones complaining about government money given to individuals to keep their families solvent. 

Businesses have happily (some might say greedily) taken any and all government handouts (tax credits, tax rate reductions, low- or no-cost government backed loans, etc...) and then asked for (some might say demanded) more. 

But give that same benefit to individuals, and they start chirping and complaining about “handouts” and “welfare” and how the American worker is no more than a scam artist, looking to fleece the government. 

These business owners have a very low and cynical opinion of the very individuals who work for, and buy from, their establishments."
2020-09-10 16:24,"The unsaid assumption made by people who argue that an additional $600/week motivates people to stay home is that these people are inherently lazy, otherwise they would have better employment options, right? 
Because we all know that we live in a rational, linear meritocracy where talent, skills and diligence are always rewarded and things like, oh, who you know or how much you were able to spend on your interview clothes never play a role. 
But perhaps the most galling thing is that the hypocrites who argue that $600/week is too much wouldn’t take ANY job at those wages, even the incredibly privileged they currently hold. 
In other words, It’s not good enough for me, but it’s too good for you. 
I’m sorry? 
This is how you think about the people you’re supposed to represent? 
All humans need safe and healthy food, water, air, and shelter, and the full measure of a person isn’t what they can command in the employment market. The cashier at my local grocery store in whose line I try to end up is worth more as a person than any of the folks who argue against providing an extra $600 in unemployment, and how do I know this? 

Because she treats every single person in her line with respect and kindness and all without even knowing how much they make. 
Imagine. 
Would that she and others like her were our representatives."
2020-09-10 16:28,"On the one hand, you have multiple research studies that demonstrate that the extended unemployment benefits do not deter unemployed workers from going back to work.

On the other hand, you have exactly two small business owners who claim to be having difficulty finding workers, who “are guessing” that it is because of the extra benefit— but who fail to provide a single concrete example to support their argument.

Why is this even a question?"
2020-09-10 16:29,"Anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but two of the largest supermarket chains in my area have reported that they have more applicants than jobs now that the extended benefits have ended, while before they stopped getting workers, especially in the warehouse, was much more difficult. 

That is not to say the benefits were the cause of this, as there are many other factors to consider, nor even if the benefits did cause it that they were bad, but I suspect that they were a factor, if not the determining one."
2020-09-10 16:43,"I think most mentally healthy people want to work. Staying at home day after day, losing your sense of community with fellow workers, probably gets very depressing. I think most people have a sense of dignity and want to contribute. I don't see this acknowledgement nearly enough. I'm not sure why supporters of right-wing policy are so sure that all people are naturally lazy. I think the studies you point out here help make the case that they are not. More people that resent these emergency payments should ask themselves if they would really be happy with no job even if they kept their salary. I think, after you really think about it, most people want their job."
2020-09-10 17:14,"This story is an example of what’s wrong with the way the media covers so many issues. The key take away from the story is that increased benefits DO NOT generally keep workers from accepting a job, the exceptions being workers in marginal, part-time employment and workers with child care or other constraints. However, the author gives over eight paragraphs to one business owner with the opposite point of view, the most space given to any one perspective in the entire story. The end result is that the story feels like it’s saying the opposite of what is actually written. That business owner must have a point if they are given so much space, right? There are only two conclusions to be draw, either the journalist and her editors are incompetent and don’t know how to write a story that actually conforms to the evidence, or they really believe that the supplemental benefits hurt employment, sine as the author writes, that’s just common sense, even though all the actual data point in the opposite direction. You decide."
2020-09-10 15:49,"In my extensive study of 2 workers, my wife and myself, we found that the jobless benefits kept a roof over our heads. And when we were able to work again we did, even when the money was less than the UI benefit check would have been. BUT- only when we could make sure it was safe. We are both freelance, and we turned down work when we saw a big health risk, like when one job would have required my wife to fly to Georgia in May when cases there were skyrocketing. What good is a job if it gives you Covid?

Something the article doesn't really touch in here is: maybe people didn't want to get sick! 

If you do the math, a $12 or $15/hour job doesn't even come close to covering basic expenses if you have to pay for your own healthcare. And the $22/hour job with benefits doesn't do anything for you if you at all if you get sick. And who the heck wants to put their kids in childcare during this time for the sake of a temporary or entry level job? 

Maybe if you have no other option. Who wants to risk their life or the lives of their family for the sake of a clamp business? (We can talk more about respecting and expanding the skilled labor force after the pandemic)

I'm sure that when job applications tripled after the UI benefits stopped, it was because people are desperate. People are actually starving without those adddd UI benefits, and some who have jobs, because, as Matthew Desmond said: the rent eats first. Even in a pandemic. 

It's not philosophical. It's survival."
2020-09-10 15:10,I disagree with the article’s assertion that the lack of job applicants due to unemployment benefits makes sense “on a gut level.” My own gut tells me people just don’t want to risk their lives—and the lives of their loved ones—for a low wage retail job.

2020-09-10 18:00,"An overwhelming majority of workers prefer going to work. A temporary relief is welcome, because they know that the pandemic is not their fault, and their families need to eat. The American worker is, in most of cases, a person with a spouse, sons, daughters, and they want to own a home and a car. Who wants a mortgage or a loan if they don't know if in just a few months the money will stop coming, and they don't have any possibility of controlling their own income? When the A.C.A. was created, the same guys said that the healthcare law will generate the destruction of millions of jobs. But exactly the opposite happened.

$600 Federal unemployment supplement ended in July. In Rhode Island it was replaced by a one time payment of $900. There has been no additional unemployment supplement and I am willing to bet none will be forthcoming. As we can see the stock market and millionaire class is doing very well, and that is what matters to politicians in America.

Adding insult to injury, or perhaps the other way around, millions of Americans have lost their health insurance, in many cases going on months now.

My advice to rich business owners complaining about workers not jumping on $12 an hour pay in 2020- prepare yourselves for a violent fall / winter."

2020-09-10 18:23,"It's strange how economic analysis seems to obsess over a single side of the two sided equations of their models.  
If the labor market is a market, then it would seem that the answer to the new market conditions created by the pandemic (lest we forget that displaced workers did not choose to leave their jobs) and the minimal stimulus provided to keep them spending is that employers just have to accept that the cost of labor has increased under these conditions.  Want your old employees back, raise their wage.  $15.00/hr happens to yield $600/week.  Go figure.
But wait!, what about inflation? Well Jerome Powell is worried that inflation is too low, so he zeros out interest rates for the forseeable future.  For many decades, we have treated rising inflation as being driven by rising wages; now that it's  too low, we've decided that the only way to respond is to lower interest rates.  (Forget that other lever, over there, we only adjust that when things get too hot.)
Note, as well, that low interest rates have a substantial penalty for small investors, those whose savings (such as they are) are almost 100% in interest bearing (such as _they_ are) accounts -- the only safe investment for those who cannot weather any downside risk.
Short answer to whining employers, ""Can't get applicants? Up the wage"".  Works for the fast food industry.  ""Won't that cut return-on-investment?"" Share the cuts in proportion to how you share the profits."

2020-09-10 18:56,"The narrative that employees will choose short term benefits over long term job security is based on a belief that workers are essentially immoral, unmotivated and lazy. While employers. sacred ""job creators"", have the gumption, desire, and intelligence necessary to continue civilization. Essentially, employers are virtuous and workers lack virtue. 

But the real underlying motive behind the narrative us that workers should be grateful for any job that permits them the most barest existence. Creating any possible alternative that workers could even possibly consider is an outrage that would coddle the shiftless rabble(cue banker Potter of It's A Wonderful Life). Why else is it that incentivizing workers requires giving them less money while incentivizing employers requires giving them more money?"
2020-09-10 19:03,"The reasoning of business owners is flawed. Why would someone not accept a job that would last rather than continue with accepting UI that everyone know will eventually end (even if the UI was paying higher)?

There may also be other factors. Some of the older workers may have decided to simply retire and collect SS/Medicare. Others may have alternative income from a spouse. Others may have responsibilities they did not have before the pandemic.

If there is a reason behind it, it has nothing to do with UI (remember that our fragmented UI system ended delaying payments for so long that millions of people did not received anything until as much MONTHS after they applied).

It has everything to do with the consequences of the pandemic and the uneven way the U.S. has managed it. If you want someone to blame, look to D.C. Their misaligned priorities (protecting the country vs. politics and short-term financial considerations) created your problems.

It is neither personally nor socially. The policy makers are still viewing the world through the lens of slavery and colonialism. That is, something must be wrong with the person or population.

Why, NYT?

Why do you do this?

Why do you keep doing this?

Frame this idiotic notion as a viable question?

As you know well, or ought to, the answer is a resounding, echoing, undeniable, hugely supported by data and experience over a century or more ""No!"".

Support from the government, let alone niggardly, mean-spirited programs, soul-crushing, time-sucking, as is the American tradition in such things, does not discourage people from working.

Even where benefits are fair-to-generous, given with what appears to be good will, recipients would rather work.

They will accept earning less than the benefits they receive in order to get and keep a full time job.

Americans are notable in their drive to find work, even at financial and, certainly at a logistical cost to themselves.

This Conservative/Republican (not to leave anybody out) myth is the cornerstone of their approach to governing.

It's the lace hankie they twist publicly as they tearfully explain the need to ruin families, starve children, refuse health and education, to save them.

It's hard (It is hard, dammit) to be a rich legislator unconnected to American life in any meaningful way.

The opinions that are relevant here are as follows:

1.  Americans are shirkers. They would rather be lazy at home than earn an income through work.  The Republicans are this unwilling to pay benefits to the suffering. 

2.  Americans are stupid. They cannot be trusted with accurate information about life and death matters lest they panic inappropriately. Thus, it is important to lie to them so that they cannot make their own decisions about the threats facing them—whether Covid, climate change, or Russia.

I am a professional musician, on track for my best financial year in years, when cancelled in the middle of a tour in March. I watched $40k disappear overnight. My wife is in wardrobe on Broadway; lost $100k overnight. We live in NYC where our monthly outlay is upwards of $5k. Even eliminating all possible extra expenses etc, it’s damned expensive to live here. 

She fortunately qualifies for full NY unemployment insurance. A paltry $504/week. As an independent contractor I’m getting a whopping $182/week. Combined, our unemployment insurance barely covers HALF our monthly expenses. With that extra $600, we were able to pay our bills and still have food on the table and the occasional takeout dinner. Now, we’re eating through our savings at a horrifying rate and desperate for our do-nothing congress and senate “leaders” (I’m looking at you, you stingy, hateful Republicans) to actually do SOMETHING to help people like us and the huge number of people who are WAY WORSE OFF than we are.

Tens of millions are suddenly unemployed through no fault of their own; tens of thousands small businesses are out of business.  And the GOP Senate is worried about enabling — as Reagan put it — welfare queens.
This disgusting slander of American workers is smoke to hide the gross and deadly incompetence of our government and the dereliction of duty of our elected officials.  Hard to believe that once again, the NYT offers “analysis” based on false equivalencies and unproven anecdotes.

It makes me sick that a bunch of rich, privileged, elected officials, who never missed a meal can deprive working folks a measly $600.

LOL!  Why does that appear high up in the article, with the lede about an employer blaming unemployment supplements for his hiring troubles, while the reality shows up way under the “fold”, buried late in the article?  There, we find most studies show no disincentive effects; that many would like full-time work, but can’t find it; and that many have not returned to work because of family caretaking responsibilities and health concerns. 

That one study?  Done by researchers at the Becker-Friedman Institute!  It's a University of Chicago research center — and U-Chicago economists and Friedman have been well known for their libertarian, free market advocacy and anti-government propaganda.  Such economists are against minimum wages, and repeatedly claim raising them would lead to massive unemployment, something that sensible, mainstream economists have refuted in study after study.  Is it any wonder Becker Friedman economists would blame unemployment supplements for hiring problems?

—> The problem of a company not being able to hire is easily rectified by raising its wages and benefits.  

The sad thing in the U.S. is that wages are far too low for far too many people.  Let's give workers more power and make unemployment supplements permanent.  And, provide them with single-payer, universal health insurance."

The two sets of studies are in fact not comparable! The variables are totally different! There is no discussion or stratification of data of regional differences where cost of living will be very different. New York/California is more expensive than the Midwest or south!

Instead, greed and the desire to avoid disruption has led to this predictable outcome - the failure to get the disease truly under control means people are afraid to take lifet-threatening risks on public transit.

For example, in order to maintain the 1.5 m safe distance you can only have 1 person in an elevator at a time.   You simply cannot realistically move 7,000 people in and out of an office 3 times a day with that kind of restriction.  That is to say nothing about efficient seating configurations lose 2 out of every 3 seats to maintain 1.5m distance.  

I'm told the maximum number of employees that could be brought back under current safety guidelines is ~30% with some pretty significant workarounds including staggered start times and alternating in-office days.

Parts of NY, like London, are starting to look like ghost towns (e.g. take a walk along Madison Avenue on a weekday afternoon.) We are deluding ourselves if we think this will 'snap' back to normal anytime soon.

All that commuting does wonders for traffic and the environment. Those restaurant and pub owners must be serving far healthier and cheaper items than can be prepared at home. I am sure all those small children are sick of seeing their parents so much. 

Banks and corporate headquarters would be nothing without delis, gyms, convenience stores and dry cleaners. Apparently office workers need to show their gratitude by spending at the pubs because if such places are allowed to close they would be oh-so-hard to replace.

Small businesses like these are common because they are not that hard to start up and can exercise flexibility - including the flexibility to downsize or close - as markets change. Maybe, just maybe, people actually like eating healthier, drinking less and exercising outside or at home?

It takes a while for the downside of WFH to manifest.  The most obvious is the lack of social interaction with colleagues, which takes a toll.  If you have other family members, WFH means very little ""alone time"".  Every relationship needs a little break regularly and WFH means those breaks have to be planned.  And WFH often becomes SAW, or sleep-at-work, where the work squeezes out the home.

Having to endure rush hour commute 2x a day 5 days a week isn't appealing.  Neither is 100% WFH.  Hopefully we can find an arrangement in between the two extremes."

Cuomo was giving daily detailed briefings that did not at all sugarcoat the truth about COVID-19. No panic ensued, just a determined city-wide march toward flattening the curve and minimizing the virus's deadly potential.

No evidence exists that the truth would panic the populace, while we knew exactly what the plethora of lies and contradictory messaging did and continues to do. Our idiotic approach, fully embraced by the Trump minions, has divided us into maskers vs. anti-maskers, crowders vs. distancers, and realists vs. fantasists.

The only panic has been caused by Trump yachtsmen sinking each other's boats."

For months after that he ridicules people wearing masks and dismisses health officials recommendations for containment of the virus.
In normal times this would end with a massive win in November for the Biden Harris ticket. In the age of the Trump cult these are not normal times. It's imperative for reason, not lies, to prevail in November."

Our economy is failing and lines at food pantries are growing.  And the prevaricator in chief natters on . I am truly in despair.

The willful blindness of Republicans to this horror is just too much for me.  You should all be held legally accountable for this tragedy."
2020-09-10 12:09,"Trump did not want to rattle the stock market. That is why he minimized the danger of the virus even though he and his buddies knew full well how dangerous it is. And Trump is still acting as though it’s no big deal even as almost 200,000 and counting Americans have died. Leaders lead by example. Trumps’s disdain for masks, even telling people to endanger their own lives and not wear masks, is tantamount to murder. Trump does not care about other people’s lives."
2020-09-10 12:12,"I'm curious as to why, considering the gravity of Trump's lies about the virus, his active campaign of denial that put all Americans in danger,  The New York Times did not place this article at the top of the first page in at least 16 point print.  Trump's enablers are many and have much guilt to atone for in failing to speak out publicly about what they knew privately on the many matters relating to the security of U.S. Citizens.  By not giving this issue the attention it deserves, isn't the Times helping Trump to try to spin this story to show he was acting responsibly?  It is not enough to leave criticism of this president and his enablers in Congress to the op-ed columnists."
2020-09-10 12:13,"No, we would not want to scare people into wearing masks, social distancing, sheltering in place, would we? “Right to life” is a twisted joke. “Death panels”at least implies some deliberation about who dies. Trump and his Republican enablers are directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans. They own this, and it will be their historical legacy. With life being so cheap, God only knows what a second term could bring. 

The fact that such a significant number of Americans believe anything this man says is for me a bitter disappointment. It’s difficult to feel optimistic about our country’s future. But let’s each do everything we can over the next two months to change the narrative. Our lives literally depend on it."

Maybe depending how you parse his words, but then you tell us that he lies all the time so we should assume he's lying. Would anyone with serious health concerns about the virus follow the advice of Donald Trump? No! At the time, the media widely reported the disconnect between his words and what ""experts"" were saying about the virus and now the tape more or less confirms that reporting, but did we really learn anything new here? No!"
2020-09-10 12:21,"Trump regarded the Covid as a political threat that would derail the booming economy.  He was not interested in calming or giving hope to the public.  He was consciously deceiving the public into ignoring the threat and keeping the economy humming for his own political benefit. 

On February 28, 2020 Trump told a rally audience that the Democrats were politicizing Covid to sabotage the economy and make him look bad by promoting a ""Coronavirus Hoax"", when, in fact, calling the pandemic a ""Hoax"" was his hoax against the American People. 

The Republican Senate had the opportunity to rid themselves of their blight in the White House by impeachment, not doing so  has made them accessories to his crimes.  Jail time for the quislings and their corrupt leader would be cleansing for our Democracy."

On the other hand, if people had been made aware of the virus earlier, regardless of its severity, some people would have taken precautions and inevitably there would have been less sickness and death. That's not panic. That's caution. 

Then again there are those like the Sturgis-types who think of themselves as invulnerable and would have gone about their routines, gotten sick, and died.

Bad call President Trump!"

In fact, in the absence of information to explain what you see happening with your own eyes, panic is the result. So many of his actions have helped infect the nation, not protect it.  Who is he working for? I really do wonder."

2020-09-10 12:20,"This goes wasaaaaayyyyy beyond lies.

This is an extremely arrogant and sick, demented way to treat the American people. trump claims he didn’t want to cause a panic. So...no panic. And nearly 200,000 dead.

The spread of Covid-19, a deadly pandemic is something that should never be downplayed and a panic, an organized one, is what is called for to deal with it. Lacking a treatment or vaccine, drastic measures were needed to slow or stop the spread. It’s the only thing that works, so far.

Covid-19 should have been an all hands on deck situation from the first second, and the facts were known from the news where the virus had already struck.

Reckless endangerment is not a severe enough charge. This is public endangerment and active depraved negligence because trump’s supporters believe his words as if they are gospel. Eschewing masks, attending public and private gatherings and the continued effort to do things that will result in spread, not stop it mean we are far from the end of the pandemic and more people will suffer and die needlessly.

Epidemiologists suggest that seventy-five percent of the deaths could have been avoided had proper steps been taken early.

Face it. trump is a mass murderer."
2020-09-10 12:18,"Trump's giving interviews to someone writing a book just before the election and allowing them to be taped was monumentally stupid and reeks of hubris. It will hurt him politically, how can it not? Any objective person would have known Woodward is smarter than Trump and should have known his motivation is readership. All that said I doubt it affected peoples actions. I was in Brooklyn over the weekend and there was massive ignoring of masking, including by protesters, all this despite pleas by the Mayor and Governor to mask up and distance and continuous TV ads blaring the necessity of masking. It makes one think, and I know this is ghoulish, that only bodies piled in the street might persuade people of the risk. People still smoke although the risks of lung, laryngeal, bladder (yes!), esophageal and oro-pharyngeal cancer along with emphysema are well known."
2020-09-10 12:24,"Senator Graham.  Why is is that the reddest Trump states are the states most inclined to call the virus a hoax and flout all the precautionary behaviors recommended by medical science?

Answer:  It’s because (throughout the crisis) Trump’s “tone” and messaging has been dismissive of the medical facts and recommendations he’s known about since February 7th.   He buried the facts and explicitly encouraged medically risky behavior as a show of political fealty to the president. 

With an appropriate response, a large number of the 400,000 who will be dead by year end might have lived.  

Trump’s “tonality” (and your rationalization thereof) was and is a national disgrace."

The main responsibility of ANY POTUS is to keep its people safe and secure. Trump has failed to do this. What makes that even worse is that he DELIBERATELY did this to his own country. 

-He knew, as is evident by the tapes, the severity of COVID-19. 
-He knew how easily it could be spread. 
-He knew it was more deadly than the flu. 
-He knew you should wear a mask. 
-He knew that people should keep distant from one another. 
-He knew all of this and he [continued] to lie to the American people calling it a ""hoax"" and mocking people who wear face masks; the latter as recently as Monday. 

He continued to hold his Third Reich-like rallies, virtually superspreader events. He had people remove the ""Please wear face masks"" tapes from the seats at his Tulsa rally. What rational human being does this given what he knew. 

That tapping you hear is the final nail being hammered into his coffin.

Cast your eyes upon the entirety of the Republican Party and the elected Republicans that serve in local and national offices.  They have met all of Trump's transgressions with no more than a shrug.  Had they been doing their jobs, Trump would have been out of office as early as 2017.

I would hope that with every news cycle concerning Trump their insides would twist and turn knowing that they had the power to end this, but they didn't. They should be haunted continually by their complicity.  In for a penny, in for a pound - that's the new Republican motto in the days of Trump."

Lying to the citizens of this country about the pandemic comes as no surprise. His White House task force was essentially a machine to abdicate responsibility for the Administration and turn the pandemic into an opportunity zone for profiteering.  The irony is what he pretends was benevolence  on his part to avoid panic over the pandemic, he has created panic over the electoral process, the legitimacy and a dystopian future should the monsters and scary people on the left win.

And the senate republicans will, as usual, look the other way in the face of yet another national crisis.  Nothing sticks to this guy.  Nothing."
2020-09-10 12:34,"I am sickened. Trump admits to lying to the American people about the Corona virus. It is typical of narcissistic sociopaths to cover themselves by telling a lie that has a semblance of truth. Trump uses that strategy here. He stated he lied to prevent a panic. It would be possible to warn people in such a way as to bolster hope. He could wear a mask to encourage others to do so. He could encourage people to wear masks instead of denigrating those who do. He could require people to wear masks at his speeches and rallies. He could have prepared for the ""battle"" by making sure the medical community had all the supplies they needed. He could have let his medical experts speak to and handle the questions on the pandemic instead of pushing a false narrative. That would have been leadership. In his speech asking Congress to declare War after Pearl Harbor, FDR said ""No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory...
There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger.with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph—so help us God."" That was leadership. According to Ronald Cohen Churchill's  oratory played such a major role in keeping spirits alive and keeping the British confident in the fact that they could withstand whatever it was they had to meet. That was leadership. #45 just plain lied"
2020-09-10 12:38,"In February and March, the President considered the threat of Covid-19 “deadly.” We should not forget that the White House, shortly thereafter, determined blue states to be especially, if not uniquely, vulnerable.

Utter, utter depravity. A national humiliation."

It’s possible to explain the need to downplay the seriousness of Covid-19 to maintain confidence.  On the other hand, it’s very hard to justify the support for states reopening early, lack of support for masks etc if you acknowledge that you understand the seriousness of disease.

With 190,000 deaths and counting, this book, on top of the disparaging remarks about the military, sacrifice etc, is going to push more support away from him just as he’s trying to close the gap with Joe Biden.  

Is incompetence grounds for impeachment?"

Yet doing everything he can to protect us from a deadly virus is not in his political playbook. Let's call him what he truly is - not a protector but an enemy of the people."

•   Millions unemployed

Is this a repeat?  Could, for example, the Times not print every photo pf Trump that comes its way? We know what he looks like. What we would like is indepth coverage of the dreadful, illegal things he is doing.

Denigrating our fallen soldiers, hiding the dangers of the pandemic and corrupting our elections--and that has just been the revelations of the past few weeks. Could it be any clearer that Trump is an incompetent liar? 

After 4 years of giving Trump voters the benefit of the doubt, one can only conclude that many of Trump's supporters simply hate the concept of a diverse and decent America of equal opportunity. They share Stephen Miller's perverse and self-loathing view of society, and they are not bothered by separation of families. 

There is a reason that Miller is one of the only people left in the White House who is not a Trump relative, and it explains why Trump may win a second term. And that reason is ugly and disgusting."

The answer to that Watergate question then as applied to the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States is: President Donald J. Trump knew how grave and dangerous Covid-19 was when he was informed in early February.  He admits on the Bob Woodward recording every piece of incriminating evidence to prosecute him for treason and his criminal behavior - 190,000 people in the US dead and counting -because Donald Trump withheld this information to America -the ultimate hostile act of betrayal to every American.

Worse than rapidly growing homelessness and widespread hunger?  Worse than a significant portion of the population being afraid to leave their houses, afraid to be around people, afraid to vote in person?  Worse than no funerals, no weddings, no birthday parties?  And I'd like to hear why Trump, knowing what he did about the virus, decided not to use his power to order the manufacturing of PPE equipment and massive amounts testing.  Why are we still lacking these things?  And why has he refused to recommend wearing masks when he knew all along that ""you just breathe the air and that's how it's passed""?

So the final lesson of 1918, a simple one yet one most difficult to execute, is that those who occupy positions of authority must lessen the panic that can alienate all within a society. Society cannot function if it is every man for himself. By definition, society cannot survive that.  

Those in authority must retain the public's trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one. Lincoln said that first, and best.

After receiving classified briefings on the severity of the virus in January and February, why didn't the Trump administration take immediate action?
Why did the administration pass off the responsibilities of procuring PPEs, tests, and ventilators to the states? (Why did they cherry-pick which states should get priority in purchasing said equipment?)
Why did Trump downplay wearing masks?
Why did he call the virus a hoax?
Why did the CDC insist on creating their own test, instead of the one WHO was immediately dispensing? (And when they did send out their own test kits, they were faulty and unusable.)
Why would Trump say in early March that anybody who wants a test can get it? Why did he keep saying he had ""inherited a bad test"" when Covid was a viral strain that had never existed before now. 
Why did he promote treatments like hydroxychloraquine and plasma as potential cure-alls?
And why did Trump's ""tone"" change in July after his advisors warned him that ""our people""--voters in Republican strongholds and swing states--were now becoming victims of Covid, not just groups like the elderly and minorities who were dying in disproportionate numbers of the virus. 
Incompetence meets venality."

Thus, it might not necessarily be ready to distribute to the population when the current trials are done if results are negative. Comments about vaccination by Biden, and medical experts, show they focus on science and not political implications.

It's quite another thing to publically, continually, and knowingly lie about the danger of a deadly virus where people could get sick and die. Even if there were only one fatality, that's STILL one too many. 
Now it's 190,000 fatalities.

All of these people had families and friends and futures lost because of trump's inaction. Some of these people were Republicans, or Independance, or Democrats.

We know that his dismissal of the consequences accompanied by his feckless abdication of responsible leadership has put the nation on a sure path beyond 200,000 deaths and the loss of millions of jobs, much of it preventable. These things have been widely reported. 

What should scare us witless is that such knowledge will not make a whit of difference to the president's voting base. This callous, negligent, incompetent, lawless, soul-destroying, blame-deflecting president still stands a viable chance of re-election in today's America.

Meanwhile, the Pacific Coast burns to a crisp as the president trashes whatever climate change abatement measures more insightful figures have put in place."

Instead he focused on discrediting science and scientists.  These are the headlines going to stay with me ten years from now.  One has to remember viruses just don’t go away; mask is the least expensive and most safe option- no long term safety concerns.

The fact that neither Trump nor his pals chose to be honest and tell America what it was up against does not bode well in my mind.  I see these people as cowards rather than leaders.

The bigger question is why and how would anyone trust their judgment again?  Their actions or inactions only exacerbated the situation.  

If there was ever a single reason why Trump should NOT be re-elected, his botched response to this pandemic is it in a nutshell.

This is not leadership it is a willful dereliction of duty and his oath to protect the American people.
True leaders tell their people about the danger, inspire them to be resolute and come up with a plan to combat the crisis.
Trump claims to be a Churchill admirer , imagine if Churchill had told the British people not to worry the Nazis will soon go away.

If Trump knew, his administration knew. Not only did they not sound the alarm, but they did not prepare PPE, develop and manufacture tests, and otherwise prepare for the oncoming pandemic. They encouraged states to reopen and people go out, knowing the virus would spread easily and was deadly. Trump still discourages people from wearing masks.

Based on what I heard at a meeting that was attended by top Wall Street executives and investors, real estate developers and others in the financial industry, including a friend of Kushner who was on Kushner’s secret committee, I have been posting for months that the administration knew that the virus was spreading and was doing little to stop it, hoping to avoid the economic effects of a shut down and rapidly achieve herd immunity.

Woodward’s tapes confirm what I heard. My question now is - why did Woodward wait so long to make this information and his tapes public? He says he was trying to confirm what Trump had admitted. I don’t believe that. If he was merely trying to drop this bomb closer to the election, then he, too, is complicit in these needless deaths.

The Trump Covid policy is a crime on the scale of genocide. I want to know who will stop these murders  and punish the perpetrators. 1300 died yesterday. Don’t say you didn’t know, GOP -because now all of us, not just some of us, know that you did."

Did he not ask his various cabinet secretaries - Health and Human Services, Commerce, Homeland Security - to come to him with a plan?  No revelation to Woodward that he did that.  He only boasts about the China  travel ban - his only definitive action early on in the pandemic.  And now he wants everyone to believe he didn’t want panic people.   The truth is that despite the dire warnings given to him he had no clear, real understanding of what a “pandemic” is. The man may have had all the right information but no real understanding of its full implication."

For a guy who has a penchant for lying, he suddenly becomes extremely candid with information many assumed was true which has been verified via this tape recording.

Of course Trump will deny he ever said those things or the tape was edited or doctored to frame him.  That's Trump.

What caught my eye was Trump's simple justification for NOT being truthful - he didn't ""want to create a panic"".  What the heck does he think has been happening on Wall Street, in the job market, people standing in lines waiting for food because they have no money?  What about all of the food/paper/disinfectant shortages for months?  If those reactions weren't panic driven, then what was that?

Frankly, that simple ""explanation"" clearly demonstrated Trump having NO faith or trust in the American people nor in his own ability to lead the country in its worst crisis in a century.  However, instead of looking inward at his own inabilities and shortcomings as an effective leader,  he created the simple statement of a ""preventative"" measure - not wanting to create a panic.

When people have accurate, honest and timely information, decisions can and will be made.  It's the not knowing or the misinformation or continual falsehoods or contradictions that make people worry, panic and become frightened.

Trump's cause for concern to not create a panic resulted in 185K deaths from this virus."

He deliberated cleared the foundation for anti-maskers and virus deniers to make us the nation with the highest case number in the world and has only hindered getting aid to those in need while we have watched almost 200,000 of our fellow Americans die while the lockdowns persisted. One would think this would be the straw that broke the camels back, but at this point the camel is lying under a 10 foot pile of straw and nothing seems to break the hold on the large minority that resiliently defends his every morally bankrupt move."

The Obama administration did so with studies and simulations of pandemics and created an office of pandemic awareness and a response plan-Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents. The Trump administration needed only to use the tools given them to respond to the Covid threat. Trump's claim that dismissed the treat because he wanted to avoid panic is nonsense. He was binge watching TV and tweeting, not doing his job. He and his administration are guilty of criminal negligence!"

Because you just know that if Hillary Clinton had been president, and immediately in January went about the task of encouraging masks, social distancing, and a temporary shutdown of the economy to nip the virus in the bed, the Republicans would have fought her every step of the way. The uprisings against Governor Witmer in Michigan would have been repeated one hundred fold all over the country. So in that regard, it's just as well that Trump was his usual self.

Then, Woodward will write another book, sort of epilogue and will be published as soon as he finds a name for it. That may leave the opportunity for Biden to walk laughing all the way to the White House. Then, when he seats in the Oval Office, he will stop laughing and say to his VP: Where do we start now? And she will answer, You tell me, you are the President now! And from that moment on, the President will proclaim a National Prayer Hour for each day of the week, at 8 pm from the Oval Office, preferably a rosary."
2020-09-10 13:50,"When Trump lied to the American people about the severity and lethality of the Covid-19 pandemic,  was he trying to calm people -- or calm the stock markets?   

When Sen. Burr had to step down as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee as he investigated for insider trading in those early days, was he alone in that?  When politicians spoke to their funders, what did thet tell them?  

Trump did not diverst himself of his many businesses.  He didn't even put his holdings into a blind trust.   What financial transactions were made by the Trumps, while the presdient was trying to lull people into a state of false security?   

Any candidate for office MUST be completely transparent with the public when running for office in November.  Incumbents particularly.  The press must spotlight all with access to intelligence.  #NoTaxRreturnsNoVotes."

It's time for every newspaper and media outlet in the U.S. to call for his immediate removal from office. This is beyond the pale. Any other president would have been removed three years ago. We can't tolerate this agony any longer. Just do it!"
2020-09-10 13:32,"None of our leadership, government, or health care experts, thought the virus was a big risk for the US in the initial outbreaks, in other parts of the world. 
Trump clearly hoped to avoid any slow down in the economy, a predictable bias by any person in his role, he was joined by most politicians in New York and California, and even Dr. Fauci got it wrong.
The world wide spread of this virus was caused by the leadership in China, not Trump.
There are lots of reasons to dislike Trump but the incessant efforts to blame him for everything is not credible. His ego is his own worst enemy! He is bringing himself down, he doesn’t need your help!😏"

I had to cobble together home-made face masks for my essential worker husband and myself out of old t-shirts and underwear elastic.

This all could have been avoided or lessened had there been anything resembling leadership at the Federal level and a rationing system put in place.

No one likes to send money to the Nigerian prince only to discover that he wasn’t a prince, after all. In short, once you’ve goofed it’s very hard to admit it and correct course, and this is just human nature. I get it. It’s easier, psychologically, to send more money to the prince.

But real talk time. We are on the ropes as a nation, our social fabric is tearing apart, our institutions failing, and our President here — your guy — he’s just not up to the job. He’s a liar. As for the excuse that he was merely seeking to quell any possible panic, remember this is the fellow who spent months hyping the threat of a looming invasion by a caravan of migrants hiding ISIS members intent on destroying America. This is a guy who won’t shut up about graffiti in Portland and wants “suburban housewives” to ponder the imminent danger posed by (hot) Corey Booker. I dare say that Trump has never met a panic he didn’t love at first sight. Sometimes it only takes a second, they say..

He’s a phoney and you’ve been conned but here’s the good news: it’s not too late, and the DNC bent over backwards to make sure our candidate would be as middle of the road as, well, Joe Biden. Please come back to your senses and help out."

In his inaugural speech he ranted about ""American carnage"" in the streets. During the protests over police violence he has warned repeatedly and apocalyptically about ""anarchy"" and dark conspiracies bent on destroying the country. But while acknowledging in private that a devastating pandemic loomed, he  told the nation the lethal lie that it was facing  an outbreak a ""little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for."" ff this doesn't shake the Trump base's blind trust in him, nothing will.

Did Donald Trump inquire from his Attorney General or his White House counsel, if he could be held responsible for the
infections and deaths? Trump is very savvy in lawsuits. 
In most countries, governments cannot be sued due to lack of competence or due to harm done to both the Country and the citizens. 
Therefore if Trump knew he would not legally be held responsible, we know he is immoral and cares about the
Stock Market and what is in it for him so not releasing pertinent information and downplaying the severity of this
disease would be of no concern to him."

2020-09-10 14:13,"Trump's February 7 private admission ""this is deadly stuff"" that he publicly stated as a hoax is the greatest betrayal of the people he pledged to protect. Trump's sole mission was to get Woodward to write a book that showed him in a positive light. But he overestimated his ability to persuade a revered, straight-shooting journalist and ended up committing what should be political suicide.  Trump cannot argue the damning statements he made in these recordings are ""fake news"" or a ""hoax."" Team Trump can only hope to limit the damage but these tapes are concrete proof that thousands of people have died as a direct result of Trump's lies. How is that not criminally negligent homicide?"

2020-09-10 14:16,"Here's what struck me upon hearing the taped conversation. 

It sounds like there are two Donald Trumps.

The one on the tape is fairly lucid and articulate. If you listen to him do back and forth with Woodward, perhaps not realizing he's being recorded, he converses in a tone that sounds normal and, for Trump, strangely rational. 

Like he really understands the truth and is mouthing it. That's weird.  That's the Trump we never see behind the curtain. A man who just might fathom reality. 

What he shows the world is quite different. 

We all see and hear ""public Trump.""
We know it by heart. 
Swagger, bravado, pointed, Ill-mannered, wild. Making statements that would make even a corrupt used car salesman pause. 
A man putting on a show. A barker. 
Hoping it goes over with his crowd. 

Lucid, taped, private Trump knew the truth.
He's not that dumb. 

Public, huckster Trump is an actor. 
Not a ""politician"" but rather a facade which he shows just days after the tape. 

A self-interested, calculating, stone-cold, poker bluff. Not stupid. Fully in control, fully committed to his bluff… and bluster. 

What I glean?

This guy is even bluffing himself. 
Desperate to preserve his standing and any advantage. Hoping, always, that he can con his way to his goal… just one more time. 

That goal is Donald J. Trump uber alles. 

And, knowing better, as we hear, he shut off reality and any semblance of conscience, went into his act and allowed death to rain on a nation. 

How sick. 

11/3."
2020-09-10 14:17,"Trump has boasted that he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and his base wouldn’t care.

2020-09-10 14:08,"It amazes me how narcissistic Trump is. Surely he thought that he could outwit Woodward or else why speak to him. 
190,000 deaths later we are confronted with the fact that we are being led by a president who still cannot acknowledge the terrible harm this virus has done. Nor can his minions who turn a blind eye to his incompetence in order maintain their hold on “power”. Their legacy, as well as his, will be the disservice they have done to their country."

He downplayed the seriousness of the coming pandemic, when he knew, HE KNEW, what was coming our way.   He knew that the virus was deadly.  He admitted it to Bob Woodward.  As a result of this President's INTENTIONAL acts and failures to act, over 195,000 Americans are now dead.  Think of it.  195,000 American families are now grieving the loss of a loved one because this President did not do what he should have done to protect us.  It borders on absolute criminality.  And to my Catholic and evangelical friends, your support for this President is despicable.  If you believe in the sanctity of life, then human life is human life, whether born or unborn.   The elderly deserve respect for their lives as much as an in utero being.  Your continued support of this President is astoundingly obtuse and confoundingly disgusting."

2020-09-10 14:16,"The time has come to impeach and remove both Donald Trump and Michael Pence from their offices. Using their Russian link is not the real problem today. They have both lied to and then indirectly killed Americans. Hence, the impeachment must be followed by having both charged for murder. It they had simply warned the American public that this virus would be deadly and therefore the nation could lock itself up for a few weeks the number of deaths would have been reduced to a small number. This would have been the correct decision. Instead they both decided to take control of Americans to the point where they would highlight protecting their images to their supporters while at the same time murdering so many. Without question both are guilty, but they are not alone. Every Republican in office today must also be charged as being accomplices. They are co-conspirators. Taking this approach would not eliminate this type of political power-based crime but at least it would give us another 50 years or so before our government sets itself above the nation, illegally, again. Remember Watergate?"

The same issues, people not wanting to wear masks, not spacing properly, and rushing to open up the nation which eventually perpetrated (4) waves of the pandemic with horrendous results. There were over 650,000 deaths in total. Wilson washed his hands of national responsibility for management of the health crisis."

But I continue to be confused as to why the media and others think this is a big deal politically.  He openly bragged about sexually assaulting women and was elected president a short time later.  People don't care. Period. It's a cult of personality.

Let's stop fooling ourselves into thinking this stuff will hurt him and start making phone calls to get democrats out to vote."
2020-09-10 14:32,"just ridiculous

Didn't want to create a panic? This guy's entire presidential ""strategy"" is to create chaos and disruption, apparently in the hope of stepping in later to solve the problem. (I think psychologists call this Toxic Hero Syndrome).

What were those with medical and scientific backgrounds like Fauci, Birks, Azar, Hahn, Adams and Carson saying and doing in attempts to counter the President's misinformation and insistence on holding large events with no masks or social distancing precautions?  They should speak out if for nothing else than to salvage their reputations."
2020-09-10 14:36,"It is time to say what is really going on. We are living in the middle of a genocide by default. The refusal to directly confront this pandemic is not ignorance and different opinions. The interviews, the words directly from Trump, prove it is systematic and deliberate. The group of people targeted? Black and Brown people. People who live in cities. People who voted blue. States that have Democratic governors. It is time to hold not only Trump but all of his enablers and collaborators responsible for crimes against humanity - crimes against HIS OWN PEOPLE. Post WWII, Nazi collaborators were forced shave their heads and walk through the streets as symbols. The enabling and collaboration by Trump's cronies and the entire Republican establishment is no less egregious and deserves a high level of public response and shame. We cannot shave their heads but we can vote them out then use all the tools of our legal system to hold them responsible."

2. A person who provokes trouble, causes dissension, or the like; agitator."
2020-09-10 14:52,Telling the truth has never been a priority or done with ease for this President. It's the very definition of being a pathological liar and sociopath. He puts his spin on it to create the image he wants. He never had any thoughts that we couldn't handle the truth--HE didn't prefer the truth.
2020-09-10 14:26,"HE KNEW! Then he called it a hoax and some, if not all, of his supporters still believe this. He POLITICIZED masks. The one simple thing that would prevent spread. He didn’t use the government to make PPE for our frontline workers.  How many doctors and nurses have died??? His whole staff stood by the LIE.  He pushed to reopen.  He encouraged his supporters to “Liberate Michigan” and heavily armed they went to government buildings to threaten lawmakers.  All this time stating what a great job he was doing.

People cannot seem to get it through their thick skulls that Trump does not care if people get sick and die.  He actually has no human feeling about what death of a loved one does to a family member or friend of the deceased!  I understand that it’s difficult to believe that someone could not have empathy.  It seems impossible that a person would be lacking in something so basic.  But empathy is not in Trump’s toolbox.  And in some instances, he’s a downright sadist.  Think children in cages.  Think wounded and dead soldiers.

Trump was a huge mistake.  I get that a large segment of the population fell for his con.  But to elect him again would be pure madness.  He cares nothing for anyone but himself.  He is a destroyer.  He will destroy The United States of America."

He did not want to  alienate his base, he was counting on  ""swinging it"", treating the pandemic like the Trump University or Casino disaster- where others paid the price for his action and he and his family ware un-scuttered(even made money on e.g. the helicopter rides...) - nothing happened really to his ""empire"" and then he bacame a president.
But this time the whole nation was, is and will be paying the price of this lie, some with their lives, some with stress and depression, unable to support their families. 
This is not just "" a lie"".... it is negligence at best, criminal conduct at worst."
2020-09-10 14:40,Let me see if I understand this.   Trump claimed that if Woodward would have come forward with trumps lies about minimizing the covid virus; Woodward could have saved thousands of lives.  It would take a mind like trumps to make this kind of assertion.
2020-09-10 14:43,"Trump didn't want to cause a panic over the pandemic but has not problem causing panic over protesters, rioters, mobs going into suburbs, etc.  His campaign is relying on fear and panic.  Imagine how many would have died in the German Blitzkrieg if Winston Churchill had downplayed that and not given UK citizens all the information.  Trump is no leader, he is a coward who's only thought is about poll numbers and Nielsen ratings."
2020-09-10 14:32,"it seems as if trump is implying that we the citizens can't accept serious health warnings because we're too mentally and emotionally 'fragile' to receive it without panicking. perhaps if he ever comported himself with authentic composure, as opposed to one with the deportment of a immature, divisive, serial liar reality t.v. personality, he would have been able to relay this pandemic alert in a timely manner. now, his enablers are also conveying his 'warped' logic for initially lying about the severity of covid - 19. after 190, 000 deaths, they're a little late with the truth."

Standing by, doing nothing, with the power to save human lives.  To the benefit of what?  The markets?  The economy?  Does the public health count for anything?  

I can only imagine if a house down the street caught fire and the blaze started ravaging one house after the next, working its way towards my end of the block.  But the fire department didn't want to 'panic' me, so says nothing.   
Rather, they say (or lie), it's just one house.  Yours will be fine.  Any report to the contrary is a hoax, so stay put.

2020-09-10 14:55,"Thank God Woodward was smart enough to record his conversations, otherwise Trump and the GOP would be going with their standard operating procedure of Lying. 


So not only did Trump know of the dangers coming from COVID and flagrantly lie to the America people, he did something even worse in my opinion. He went out of his way to dismiss and mock preventative practices like masks, social distancing and temporary shutdowns all of which would have saved lives and help prevent the spread.  This is beyond irresponsible, it is criminal. 

How many Trump supporters have died as a result of his actions? We know of one...Herman Cain who took his lead from  Trump and mocked the virus while attending one of his rallies where masks were not promoted. 10 days later he was in the hospital with COVID and less than three weeks after that he was dead. For Trump supporters reading my post, ask yourself this. Trump knew at that rally the truth, yet said nothing. He put everyone at risk with his lies and it shows what he thinks of you. 

I've said for the last 3 1/2 years where is the bottom with this President and today I think we've reached it. Trump deliberately and consciously put Americans in harms way in his desperate attempt to be reelected. Americans have died as a result and this is a fact. He can not remain in office. He wont resign, so we must remove him at the ballot box."
2020-09-10 14:53,"By rejecting masks, he knowingly committed the greatest possible betrayal of his followers. From a safe distance, he watched as those who came close to him, as well as himself, had to test intensively as his followers went to the dead.
 He even intentionally lured her into the Tulsa gas chamber-like situation.
With his precise knowledge of the danger:
 Attempted murder of thousands in public."
2020-09-10 14:51,"So Trump wanted to “give people hope”?
I’ certain even his most ardent supporters would have preferred to have been given life."
2020-09-10 14:46,"I am very disappointed in the deliberate minimization of the danger of Covid-19 because it impairs the individual's ability to make sound decisions. As a liberatarian leaning fiscal conservative I put my faith in individuals over government.    

I have a friend who greatly dismissed the significant of Covid-19 and I suspect claims like President Trump's were a driver.  I wonder how many people, particularly Trump supporters got sick who wouldn't have had their president accurately communicated the danger.  I don't want the government changing individual behaviors through deception even if it argues it is for the greater good.

I would still vote for President Trump as the lesser of two evils.  I can also understand how someone else would see Biden as the lesser of two evils..  It is a shame that outside of ideology, our Presidential candidates are often quite flawed in one way or another.

I do believe Trump has performed well, overall, in policy achievements but not in demeanor, decorum, and words.  The economy was good before the Pandemic, and the President had shut down travel, and is supporting rapid vaccine and therapeutics development.  I like the trade improvements and the recognition of the CCPs responsibility for exporting Covid-19.  I personally wonder if more responsibe virology and wet market regulation would have avoided the jump of the virus to humans.

When we compare the honesty of Biden and Trump, we must consider Biden's past position on fracking."
2020-09-10 15:04,"Only Donald Trump and his perverse crew of sycophants (looking at you Lindsey Graham) would even attempt to make the case that lying about the severity of the pandemic, and thereby limiting the ""panic"", was a more proper and effective way of addressing it than by telling the truth and implementing measures that acknowledged that severity.

In other words, Trump and Graham are saying that letting hundreds of thousands of people die by pretending nothing was wrong and doing nothing to address the pandemic, was the better approach. Apparently they think there would have been far more deaths had they been honest with us.

Trump has fashioned himself as a ""War-time President"". In this role, with his mendacity now fully uncloaked, he is responsible for nearly 200,000 dead Americans. In any other war, this many dead as a result of this level of deliberate disregard for human life would be considered genocide; when do we prosecute this War-time President for this war crime?"
2020-09-10 14:49,"The writer's use of the word ""admits"" strikes me as naive. Sure Trump knew Covid-19 was deadly, but he's not ""admitting"" anything. He's reframing it to make it sound like what he did was responsible. What he was really doing was attempting to keep the stock market from dropping. Period. And because that was his focus, the virus was able to get a foothold in this country like in no other that cost us the lives of tens of thousands of people who would still be alive if Trump had responded as he should have."
2020-09-10 15:05,I also remember when trump said he didn’t want the cruise ship to land because “the numbers will make me look bad.”
2020-09-10 14:29,"I'm concerned that there isn't a lot of transparency. People know things and suppress sharing for political reasons all the time, apparently.
However, when I found out there was some mystery virus coming from the same birthplace as SARS, I didn't think ""oh, my government will protect me"", I tried to take precautions. I used scarves until I could get face masks, extra care to wash my hands. 
I also try to watch out for exposure to flu and colds and get a flu shot. The government was not to blame when I got the flu a couple of years ago - it's still very much up to nature 
There are simple things to do which we should follow to keep ourselves healthy and reduce transmission.
We all knew many people were sick and dying of covid at that same time as this interview. 
The contrived outrage is silly. 
Stirring up more panic would not have helped - as it was there were shortages panic buying and attempted profiteering."
2020-09-10 14:45,"Imagine if there were a category 5 hurricane on route to hit somewhere in the coastal U.S. that would result in massive loss of life unless people were warned in advance so they could take precautions and prepare, and the National Hurricane Center deliberately downplayed the coming disaster saying it would only be mild rain storm.  Then, thousands hit by the hurricane die, and the National Hurricane Center said, well, we knew it was going to be bad, but we did not want to alarm the people in the storm’s path and have them get worried, so we told them that the storm was nothing to worry about.  How would we react to that?

An editorial in the Boston Globe as far back as early April accused Trump of having “blood on his hands” for the way in which Trump handled the coronavirus.  At the time, many thought that the Globe had gone too far, but Woodward’s interview with Trump is the proof of that Boston Globe editor’s bold accusation being spot on."
2020-09-10 14:49,"His base - the gullible, the illiterate, the evangelical - will not be deterred by these facts any more than by previous proofs of 45's mendacity & cruelty. I've given them up for lost. (Among their emerging justifications is this gem, from a man I've known for decades: ""There are too many people in the world anyway - it's best if some of them die."") But these revelations are another layer of ghastliness that the undecided voter - if any are left - can hardly ignore. Biden is no perfect candidate, but he owns a working conscience, and we're witnessing what happens when that's missing from a president."
2020-09-10 14:29,Shocking! This revelation has changed everything I thought. I was undecided until now but with this new piece of information I've decided to change my vote. Dream on.
2020-09-10 14:38,"The problem is that this same information on more conservative news outlets is just downplayed. There is unfortunately a certain amount of apathy for that the President does. Laws are being broken left and right and yet time keeps moving in as of none of this matters. 

The people who read this paper are outraged but are the majority of conservatives outraged enough at the death toll to not vote for Trump?"
2020-09-10 14:39,"This report of a recorded conversation from 2/2020 reveals not only a racist transaction but criminal or near treasonous behavior. Specifically, he comments on the respiratory or air transmission of the virus, following which he decried the use of masks. Additionally, ""essential workers"" were bullied or mandated into reporting for work when he was discouraging mask use. Essential workers are disproportionately ethnic and racial minorities, as reported by NPR and or the NYT recently, and we have come to know that while expert medical care can impact the course of COVID 19 when applied, most such workers have limited or no access to expert medical care, because of economics and overwhelming surge demand in many places. Therefore, his behavior and policies disproportionately placed life and limb at risk for minorities. In my opinion, this is heinous."
2020-09-10 14:52,"So this is what we want in a President and his staff to be deceived, and to downplay  the most serious global health issue in our lifetime. If it happened once it will happen again and again, and if you think everything else he says is truthful think again..This guy is bad news for our lives and country. We need to vote him out on Nov 3rd."
2020-09-10 15:00,"Trump seeks to control not what the public knows, but what it thinks! He really believes that facts don't matter. So even if 10s of thousand more people die, the only thing that counts to Donald Trump is what people think, not what really happens. There's a kind of logic to that if your sole ambition is to maintain power. The problem with that mind-set, which he shares with all autocrats, is that reality will eventually catch up, and often at just the most inconvenient time, like an election year."
2020-09-10 14:44,"This implicates Fauci.   Trump wanted to play down the seriousness of Covid19.   One aspect of this has always been not advocating for wearing masks.  And this is occurring to this day.  But why was Fauci silent in the early months?  He has claimed that he didn't want to put a stress on the system - but that is not convincing.  Everyone could have made their own masks and we could have bumped up production.  I think Fauci and others were following the orders of Trump to minimize the seriousness of Covid19.  If so, Fauci has to come clean."
2020-09-10 14:52,"My grandmother was buried behind this virus. 
My grandmother survived 80 years in this country, moving to New York City, having emigrated from Jamaica, working hard & making a life here & lost two of her children in the process before her time.
I had to watch her funeral through a Zoom call. I didn't get to say goodbye, or wish her well. She died alone.
I had to listen to the doctors prior to her sudden death explain that her health stabilized, then her body gave out; behind this virus.

All the while, I wondered;
if we'd taken this virus seriously (from a unified public health standpoint) - if we'd better prepared, if protection wasn't made partisan; 
how many people wouldn't have been put in a position like mine?

This has to end. It's sad that there are still so many more who have to suffer before it does, needlessly."

This illegitimate excuse for our fear-injecting leader could not recall the word for the influenza that comes each autumn to the northern hemisphere: it is the ""seasonal"" flu. There is no such thing as a strenuous flu. Bu then, his use of language is always garbled and full of gobbledygook. He displays his unfitness for office every day, all day. 

This slouching loser is a national threat to every element of governmental function and structure: public health; economy; judiciary; treasury; e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g.... 

Can he be removed from office now?"
2020-09-10 14:54,"Enough already.. The press is being duped.  They are giving Trump far too much credit if they believe that he deliberately downplayed the virus because he did not want to cause a panic. 

That implies a sense of compassion (however misplaced) in a way that is inconsistent with his pathological narcissism.

Trump was trying to impress Bob Woodward - simply that.  He was willing to say ANYTHING to do so. Why do you think he granted him 18 hours of interviews after his aides warned him against it. He (Trump) thought that implying he was looking out for the Nation would impart a sense of leadership and forethought which, after almost 4 years, we all know he does NOT have. 

It is far more likely that Trump truly believes that Covid-19 is a hoax manufactured by Liberals & the so-called deep-state solely to discredit him and harm his chances for re-election. If fact, he has said as much.. not just once in some interview, but many times.  

And that, my naive friends, is far more consistent with his severe mental disfunction than a supposed desire to protect the national well-being."
2020-09-10 14:57,"He'll do anything and say anything to keep from looking bad.   He has a fragile ego, he's insecure; actually doesn't have one good trait.   To be so selfish and uncaring and lie because he's not capable of telling the truth is tragic for us.   He's just an outsider, friendless  (except for Putin ) which may explain his vindictiveness.  Money does not  create class.  He's just an overgrown toddler who does not know how to conduct himself in public.

What’s more, his whole life/administration has been about encouraging chaos, and his whole campaign has been about stoking panic. How big do the lies have to become, before there is ONE responsible voice from the Republican Party who will repudiate this outrage?"
2020-09-10 15:05,"If Trump knew the virus is ""deadly stuff"" then why didn't he make mask wearing mandatory, and why does he continue to hold rallies where mask wearing and social distancing are rarely seen?"
2020-09-10 15:15,"Man, if the President had told us the truth and  told us exactly what the experts said we needed to do to stop the spread of the virus in its tracks we would have done it. This is yet another facet of Trump’s lack of understanding of human nature: when the going gets tough we don’t panic, we get going. Instead, Trump panicked, underestimated us, and now 200,000 are dead."
2020-09-10 15:08,"Kudos to Woodward for eliciting this acknowledgement from Trump—apparent to many early on.  Shame on Woodward for withholding such important information until many months later when his book was days short of publication.   Likely his motive was profit--and, perhaps, influencing the election outcome--and, as such, his action is just as compromised and unethical as John Bolton’s.  Will we ever know if failure to go public with Trump’s disclosures would have spared untold number of deaths?  Presumably yes."
2020-09-10 15:07,"Trump deliberately downplayinig the dangers of coronavirus and not only keeping that information from the public but telling them that there was nothing to worry about?   What we have here is a man-child treating Americans as children, instead of adults."
2020-09-10 15:20,"It has been apparent for a long time that by any critical measure--competence, integrity, honesty, decency, rationality--that Trump is unfit to be president. Even by Trump's bottom of the barrel scraping standards the last few days have brought a jaw-dropping stream of his most egregious comments, actions, and inactions. And yet have we heard even murmurs of criticism from the leadership of the Republican party?  Rather their constant near unanimous support of this almost surreally awful president is clear evidence of their party's near total moral bankruptcy.

This week Trump accused our military leaders of contriving excuses to send their soldiers into harm's way in order to fatten the profits of defense contractors. Rhetoric that one would have expected to hear from a patently left-wing peacenik. Yet not a whimper of criticism from the supposedly fervently pro-military G.O.P.  Trump reveals in his own voice that he repeatedly lied to the nation about the danger of the coronavirus which has inarguably resulted in the preventable deaths of tens of thousands of Americans, and the Republican leadership is deafeningly silent. One could go on and on and on. 

Never has it been clearer that in November we must not only excise Trump from the body politic but give the only decent major party we have left majorities in both branches of the Congress."
2020-09-10 15:09,"So the title of Woodward's book is ""Rage"".

The question is who's rage is being targeted?  

The American people or Trump?"
2020-09-10 15:20,"Trump knew this was deadly on February 7, and probably before that.  But if he knew that, then doesn't it stand to reason that so did Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx and all other senior doctors and scientists at CDC?  Or is that something Trump learned from President Xi only, and then kept to himself?  In February Drs. Fauci and Birx were publicly assuring Americans there was no need to change their daily habits.  Remember that? In February and March my siblings and I were caring for our 90 year old father and taking him to doctor visits and even an extended stay at the hospital. 
Now I know that Trump and probably others were letting people like my father and me and my siblings expose ourselves to risk of serious illness or death so that they could all feel better about themselves and what terrific ""leaders"" they all are.  The nearly 200,000 dead in just 7 months are a monument to their monumental failure."
2020-09-10 14:53,"Trump knew but he thought he knew better than any of the scientists, doctors, and epidemiologists what to do. And, as usual with Trump, he’s wrong. But, because he is President of the United States, hundreds of thousands of people die and the U.S. economy is in tatters. But because Trump is President of the United States and because he has the unwavering support of the majority of Republican Senators, the U.S. has suffered and is continuing to suffer more than any other country in the world. This alone should be enough for every single American to vote him out of office. I can’t imagine why anyone except America’s worst enemies would support this evil, arrogant, murderous man."

My life and the lives of millions have been put in peril due to his failure to tell the truth, his lies about the virus.
The obvious move for him was to honestly tell the truth about Covid, map out his plans and give a rousing speech enlisting us to work together to defeat the virus. Followed by periodic updates. He would have inspired confidence. Obviously he has little to no respect for us.
He did none of this. He lied to me and the American people and the world. 
Why did he lie? He lied because lying is all that he knows. He is a pathological liar. He would rather lie than tell the truth. This man can never be trusted  about anything ever again.
I am surprised, disappointed and hurt by this episode.
Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me. 
Never Again!"
2020-09-10 15:18,"Since when is trump concerned about not wanting us to panic? Early on, I worried about our country being nuked. Then the caravan. Kids in cages. Siding with white Supremecists. Supreme Court nominees who are unqualified. Judges who are barely out of law school. Ridiculing anyone whose beliefs are different from his. Mocking the disabled, women, minorities.  Calling Covid a hoax. Please. This guy is nothing but a panic.  I despise him even more."
2020-09-10 15:20,"So he didn’t want to create panic, eh? Yet on another occasion, he used a Sharpie to falsely extend hurricane warnings to Alabama (not to mention reprimanding the NWS as it tried to correct his misinformation) just to cover up his own error, creating panic in the process. A LIAR who has now been exposed for having been complicit in the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans. Shameful — as are his GOP enablers!"

Since Trump is a narcissist, I wonder if he knew the truth in early February but 15 minutes later (with the help of Fox News and Rush Limbaugh) reinvented reality staring himself as the hero of America and the virus as a hoax perpetrated by his enemies to hurt him.

The man is far more mentally unstable than diabolical."

Yup, when I think of Trump, I sure don’t think of chaos and destruction.

But, back to reality, when the fire department shows up to extinguish the fire, Trump is not the one jumping out of the big red truck with boots and hat rushing to connect a hose to the fire hydrant.  No, that is not Donald J Trump.  Instead, Trump is the one standing next to the burning building with a can of gasoline and a lit road flare saying fire?..what fire?..I don’t see a fire...Democrat Hoax!..Fake News!!!"

2020-09-10 15:31,"edits

President Trump knowingly played down the coronavirus even though he was aware it was life-threatening and vastly more serious than the seasonal flu. “This is deadly stuff,” Mr. Trump said on Feb. 7 in one of 18 interviews with journalist Bob Woodward.  “You just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed,” the president told Mr. Woodward in audio recordings made available on The Washington Post website. “And so that’s a very tricky one. That’s a very delicate one. It’s also more deadly than even your strenuous flus.”

However, in a series of public statements, the president repeatedly misled the American public on the issue.  Three days after his on the record remarks to Woodward, Mr. Trump said the opposite, telling Fox Business anchor Trish Regan: “We’re in very good shape. We have 11 cases. And most of them are getting better very rapidly. I think they will all be better.” Less than two weeks later, he told reporters on the South Lawn that “we have it very much under control in this country.”
By Feb. 26, the president publicly dismissed concerns about the lethality of the virus at a White House news conference. 
Despite the president’s own words in the recordings, and despite the repeated announcements about the dangers of COVID-19 pandemic to the contrary  by government, university, and state public heath officials the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, inexplicably told reporters on Wednesday that Mr. Trump had never publicly played down the virus."

Then it’s off to the Flat Earth Society meeting."

Governor Cuomo told residents of NY State the truth. The pandemic was initially worst here, but he held a press conference every day to tell us the truth.

He talked in reverential and respectful terms about the ""souls"" we'd lost that day and told us we could persevere and pull down the curve - because we were New York smart and New York tough, united, disciplined, and loving.

He said as much.
With regards to the virus, many had to have known that what Trump and his administration was saying was in direct conflict with what our lying eyes were seeing or what logic was showing us.
It didn't take a rocket scientist to get that this virus was airborne, yet not even the 'official' medical team was saying so.

Trump,  James Comey, etc.).

I'm currently reading ""A Very Stable Genius"" by Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, and while not much of the events they narrate are news to those who have followed this presidency closely, their ability to put everything in historical perspective makes it quite compelling reading. 

What is consistent in all these books is Trump's disdain for the truth and his belief that ""only I can fix it."" In just a few weeks, people will make a historic choice with their votes. As for me, I would vote for my dog before I would vote for any Republican running this November. Climate change, NATO, the World Health Organization, equal opportunity for all in the current economy and, most of all, free and fair trade agreements are on the line for those who haven't unnecessarily died or been forever affected by COVID-19.

Not inducing panic and preserving his own political image are superficial. If he saved the US from the pandemic, he would be a hero and more likely ensure re-election. 
For some time I have looked at his actions through a Russian lens. That is, how would any action benefit Russia? With that perspective, if a goal is to inflict pain and suffering on a populace and tear down the US economy, prolonging the pandemic and worsening the outcome in the US would be an efficient and very effective way to do it. It would make more sense in light of these revelations that he understood the risk was very high and much worse than the flu. Starting a culture war over masks would pour kerosene on that fire would worsen our cultural and political divide and fit into that goal, too. 
Ultimately, if all of his actions are looked at to benefit Russia and benefit himself and his cronies, a lot more of this would make sense and not simply be about neglect or stupidity. This is more about wrecking the American way of life, something that has been going on since 2017."

But that is false. Trump can't have been aware of that, because no one knew that when Trump was interviewed by Woodward. Even 2 months later, the World Health Organization was saying that the evidence was not conclusive.

One thing is sure. Trump did not play down the estimates he was getting from the experts. On January 26, Fauci was asked if Americans should be scared by the virus. Fauci answered “I don’t think so. The American people should not be worried or frightened by this. It’s a very, very low risk to the United States, but it’s something we, as public health officials, need to take very seriously.”

So is the charge against Trump that he should have contradicted the experts and shared his private forebodings and hunches with the public in place of the advice he was getting? The question is so ridiculous that it answers itself. 

Trump also publicly speculated about how the threat might develop. He chose to try to keep spirits up by accentuating the positive. Stupid, you may say. Wrongheaded. Maybe, and maybe not. Should he have shouted ""fire"" in a crowded theater?

2020-09-11 1:06,This is a desperate man who will say/do anything to stay in office and out of a New York jail should he lose.
2020-09-11 1:48,"Dr Fauci stated that what Trump was saying publicly was not in contradiction with his advisors (Fauci and Brix) had been telling him. Also since this pandemic is not a lab experiment , we can not replay it again with Biden as president to see if we can get a different outcome. We should be united to get through this and not play politics."
2020-09-11 2:12,"I doubt that President Trump's lies about coronavirus are all that different from the GOP's lies about climate change. Surely they must know the danger both represent--they are not all so far gone to deny basic science and the advice of experts--but they are more than willing to tell the American public otherwise. And for what? Presumably, not to hurt the bottom line of businesses and continue to keep people working. In the long run, the strategy will implode--unfortunately, we will carry the burden of the fallout."
2020-09-11 2:20,"If lying about a deadly virus, allowing 200K to die, & our economy to be devastated isn't grounds for removal from office, what is?"
2020-09-11 2:53,"Well, it seems that telling people that the virus was just a democratic hoax, ad would be gone with 1. warm weather, 2 weeks, 3 soon, or4.  ""I take no responsibility for any of this"" was just an innocent way of keeping people (ie the stock market) calm.  Nothing more.  See how much good that has done us?  I wonder what all those children who lost parents and grandparents who believed trump, to the idea that the virus was a hoax,  have to say now?  To ignore the politics of what he did is to invite this again. The sky in my neighborhood is yellow today. This is how the world ends, not with a bang but a whimper. He will kill us all."
2020-09-11 2:57,"If you hate Trump this changes nothing. If you don’t hate Trump you don’t really get triggered over anything he says. Trump isn’t a good communicator but I want a President to be more hopeful when a disaster strikes. I take his actions to be hopeful, his words well they always are misunderstood by those who hate him. Funny how you get what you hate."
2020-09-11 3:17,"Actions speak louder than words. We were all here while he created chaos on supplies and refused to use the power of his office to create a coordinated response. We were all here when he lied, over and over. We are all still here as he holds superspreader events and doesn't care. He, like all cowardly bullies, is protected himself, but he doesn't want to share, he wants to ""win"". His corruption is in all his actions. Your excuse broadcasting makes you part of the problem, not part of the solution."
