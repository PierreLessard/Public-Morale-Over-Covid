2021-01-13 12:13,"Unfortunate consequences, we must come up with a plan, for when another deadly virus spreads among us. No one is safe from the deadly viruses, that  will ultimately return.

2021-01-13 12:05,"We are all human,created equal.While it's sad that people make mistakes but that doesn't make anyone less human.I extend sympathy to everyone affected by covid 19."
2021-01-13 14:20,Thank you Jacey Fortin for writing this.
2021-01-13 16:43,"To be incarcerated for a crime committed and then subjected to a virus because the federal government refused to protect its citizens seems like double jeopardy.

Having said this, we must also recognize that the innocent victims of their crimes are being subjected to the same outcomes from the viral infections. 

A truly despicable outcome for humanity."
2021-01-13 16:45,Having compassion for the incarcerated and their loved ones does not mean we approve of their crimes or deny the impact of those crimes on their victims and their loved ones. Love is not a zero sum game. Compassion is not a limited resource.
2021-01-13 17:37,Deepest condolences to all of the families losing their loved ones in prison. I can't imagine the trauma. It was bad enough losing two people close to me who weren't in prison last year. Very sorry to hear of this compounded human tragedy. Not getting information on whats going on is horrifying and then the worst news comes.
2021-01-13 18:53,"One thing we have learned is that everything is harder with this virus. Losing a loved one, travel, visiting a doctor, mental health, etc. If you make it through relatively unscathed, consider yourself very fortunate."
2021-01-13 18:17,"Hank Warner lost his brother three times.

Before he lost him to prison and the Virus, he lost him to manslaughter. (He also implies that his little brother had committed other crimes, too.) 

That said, we need to do more to stop the contagion in our prisons."
2021-01-13 21:41,"I understand the desire to honor their lives independent of the crimes they committed, but... there are multiple glowing profiles of Eric Warner now from various news outlets. His journey of trying to turn his life around is getting a lot of attention, but the man he killed is unknown. What must it be like, being the family of that man and seeing these beautiful memorials to his life while his victim's goes unmentioned, without acknowledgement of the value of the life that Eric Warner cut short?"
2021-01-13 12:50,Honoring “the humanity” of convicted criminals while ignoring the victims and loved ones of the victims whose lives were destroyed by the crimes is a heartless travesty.
2021-01-13 17:20,"Once again an article portraying people as victims, rather than bad actors. 
Being in prison is a recognition that you did something criminal, saying-in the same breath-that a criminal in prison died of COVID, seeks to lend some random, “it could happen to any of us” thinking to their circumstance. 
Inmates aren’t victims. 
Their VICTIMS are victims. 

I will give you this, if Gov. Newsome couldn’t get a literally captive group vaccinated in a day or two he did victimize them."
2021-01-13 16:20,"@Fortin You took time and got paid to write about convicted criminals suffering in prison? I don't care about the convicts, I do care about the law abiding citizens that are suffering and dying due to Covid or any other disease."
2021-01-19 15:32,"The difference is barely statistically significant (2-sigma), meaning a 10% likelihood of being a result of chance.  Unfortunately, in the real world, most such results are wrong (if 10 studies are conducted on drugs that do nothing at all, on average one would produce a 2-sigma result, but most of the other nine aren't published---that's called publication bias).

Most real studies are affected by unrecognized biases, making even results that appear to be very statistically significant only the result of bias.  In the physical sciences we say that half of all 3-sigma results are wrong, although without bias that would only occur 0.5% of the time.

There is a saying in physics that if you need statistics to show that you are right, you are likely wrong (attributed to Ehrenfest).  It seems to be a reliable guide."
2021-01-19 19:16,These are drugs for treatment of RHEUMATOID arthritis which is a   systemic inflammatory disease that affects the joints and can affect organs.  Simply writing that these drugs are common treatments for arthritis is misleading and inaccurate as it may lead people to think they are treatments for the more common osteoarthritis.
2021-01-20 1:16,One has to wonder whether the same drugs might alleviate some of the “long hauler” symptoms.
2021-01-12 19:14,"We're very lucky to have the vaccines is such a record time.  But we still don't have any universal way to kill these viruses like we have antibiotics to kill bacterial infections.  I hope that's a priority in the science research community.  Otherwise, we are at risk constantly for another pandemic.  And the standard annual ""flu"" takes a big toll, too."
2021-01-12 19:18,"“An annoying childhood infection” like the common cold? 

I used to love getting the common cold as a child. I knew it was harmless and was a license to lazily sit in front of the TV eating hot soup while I knew my peers were slaving away in vicious school-factories. 

So as on envision it, future generations will not see it as “annoying” but rather one of those occasional short-lived blessings that will evoke fantasies of a Corona golden age where the germ actually got most of the population out of school torture for a year, rather than just for a day or 2."
2021-01-12 19:20,"i am not a scientist, so this is just my metaphorical understanding, but i read a theory that the common cold was once as dangerous to populations as this virus is, and we adapted to it over time.

here's hoping."
2021-01-12 19:21,"Well, that's reassuring, I guess.  Currently a friend is dealing with an outbreak of shingles, which is a decades-later after-effect of chicken pox.  The pain caused by damage from untreated shingles is a significant cause of suicide deaths.  Maybe because it is a corona virus, different from varicella-zoster that causes chicken pox, such a long-term effect is not a concern.  But on the other hand, the novel coronavirus is known to attack a variety of organ systems other than the respiratory system.  Clearly, in some cases at least, it gets in the nerves, leading to loss of smell and other effects.  

I think there's still a lot of unknowns about how this will play out in the long term."
2021-01-12 19:23,"I’m curious if this prediction is accounting for the fact that many children have been home for nearly one year, and thus not exposed to the common colds/GI bugs in daycare/preschool? I’m wondering if my children’s immune systems will be deficient bc they aren’t exposed to any germs...
There are so many ongoing questions. I’m so tired of second guessing every decision/exposure for my family, so basically have decided to be the most careful possible while riding out this winter wave."
2021-01-12 19:33,"This article is highly misleading. 

All coronaviruses mutate, some more often than others. The common cold is often a combination of 3-4 coronaviruses, seen before but mutating around once per year. 

The coronavirus that causes COVID has already mutated many times, with the most contagious variations becoming more prevalent. The variation that appeared in Europe last winter was perhaps the first mutation, and about a year later we see at least 3 new variations. 

Sooner or later the Covid virus will become partly or fully immune to the current vaccines, and could become deadly again. 

This is the way it's been for billions of years. 

We are incredibly lucky to live in a world (which we are intent upon destroying) where science has given us the tools and wisdom to reduce the death and misery substantially. 

As for the beautiful world man is destroying with his greed, don't worry...

Once man is gone, the earth will heal in perhaps less than 100,000 years."
2021-01-12 19:38,"its far more likely that, like other highly infectious but low mortality diseases, after infecting the population at large, covid will  become a disease of childhood like measles and other common viral illnesses. that is, after all, how those diseases also came to be associated with childhood."
2021-01-12 19:45,"Sarbecoviruses are not like the other seasonal coronaviruses in two main ways, which make it hard to analogize to these viruses.  First, they use ACE2 as a receptor and ACE2 expression is highly differentially expressed by age; this is possibly why the virus has been muted in children. Second, they bring a panoply of additional accessory genes to antagonize the immune system that are not in the other coronaviruses. Which way do these biological factors affect pathophysiology in 30 years?  Hard to know.  But I would think it premature to analogize to the other coronaviruses."
2021-01-12 19:52,"There was an article in the Atlantic along these lines last summer. The article talked about a pandemic around the turn of last century that occurred after a virus jumped from cows to humans. The results - symptom profile, killing elderly/weak - are very similar to covid today. However, after a generation humanity had basically processed the disease so that any newly born person would get it as a child and easily defeat it. That virus is today one of the main ""common colds."""
2021-01-12 20:24,I am a scientist and because of this I agree with what my fellow scientist are quoted has having said. We cannot know with any certainty what the future will bring for this pandemic. I could imagine that Covid 19 may run its course by 2022. This is certainly what cruise lines and the stock market believes. But there really is no guarantee.
2021-01-12 20:37,"This is one of those articles where people can see what they want to see.

An important quote from the Science article, emphasis mine:
“**Social distancing and an effective vaccine are critical for control during a virgin epidemic and the transition out of it**, but once we enter the endemic phase, mass vaccination may no longer be necessary.”"
2021-01-12 20:08,"No human knows what evolutionary fit natural selection direction will drive COVID- 19 nor people.

COVID-19 aka novel coronavirus-19 aka SARS-2 aka COV-SARS-2 RNA evolutionary fit genomic be fruitful and multiply currently knows far more about our DNA African primate ape aka human host cells and organs than we know about it.

COVID-19 is neither benign nor malign.  It is merely acting according to it's nature. And so are people.

COVID-19 ' genius' is it's long asymptomatic contagious spread while being far more lethal than influenza but much less deadly than Ebola.  COVID-19 is among 1400+ known types of coronaviruses that are endemic to 1400+ known types of bats.

Bats tolerate the coronaviruses.  Coronaviruses have gigantic genomes for viruses with biological CRISPR mechanisms that limit mutations.

Scientists need to tell us the science facts about what they know and don't know about COVID-19. Admitting and saying ' I don't know' is infinitely wise humble humane empathetic.

Telling us the COVID-19 ' truth' is troublesome. Because the ' truth' is a relative philosophical, legal, moral, political and theological term."
2021-01-12 19:11,Lets hope the immunity isnt going away after months...
2021-01-12 19:34,"Apoorva, great reporting as always. It's interesting to note that the recent peer reviewed paper (Baden et al. 2020 in NEJM: <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33378609"" target=""_blank"">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33378609</a>/) on the Moderna Phase 3 trials found no statistical difference in their ~30,000 trial participants between natural immunity and vaccine immunity. 

Based on the fact that only one case was found in the 680 baseline Covid test positives (meaning they already had tested positive for Covid when they started the trials), and 11 were found in the vaccine group, we can compare “natural immunity” to “acquired immunity” figures from this clinical trial as follows: 

natural was 1 - 1/680 = 99.85% immunity
acquired was 1 - 11/15,210 = 99.93% immunity

So arguably the vaccine was twice as effective but with a single case in the natural immunity bucket that comparison is not statistically significant and they are in fact equivalent. 

And since the risk is so low for people under 60 or so (about 0.01% mortality rate for this population in the US from Covid-19), there is a decent argument, considered alongside the precautions by the experts you mention in your article, that getting infected is probably a better way to gain immunity than the vaccine in this not at high risk population."
2021-01-12 20:54,I still don't understand how the pandemic will fully go away if immunity from the new vaccines only lasts 1-2 years. Anyone knowledgeable care to explain?
2021-01-12 20:55,"When this virus and it's toll first emerged I was struck by the similarities to Multiple Sclerosis attacks and how the attacks can vary wide based on the individual or such factors as overall health and lesion load. I made these remarks to family, friends and online comments which were often sometimes with skepticism.

Now the makers of this virus are announcing they will have a vaccine for Multiple Sclerosis based on the vaccine for Covid 19.  As a person with MS I can say this is a dangerous and misleading claim. The vaccine just like other treatments is not a cure  for MS and they should be pushed to admit that fact. 

I also find it interesting that before the Covid 19 outbreak there were studies on what are known as survivor genes. It is believed that diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis started as ancient human  responses to viruses and protected us. That's why the autoimmune system in Multiple Sclerosis is ramped up so high. It is why people with MS often have remarkable health during their early years. We no longer live in harsh environments and the survivor genes have difficulties turning off and can later  become liabilities resulting in issues such as  cytokine storms.

 I remember there were studies trying to replicate this natural mutation in humans even though we still don't fully understand it. I just hope Covid 19 isn't the result of an attempt to replicate survivor genes in a lab and control nature but it went horribly wrong."
2021-01-12 21:58,"Missing from this article is this very important caveat from the orginal paper (towards the end of the abstract):

""We predict a different outcome for an emergent coronavirus that causes severe disease in children.""

Evidence suggests that the new 'UK variant' of COVID is much more transmissable in general, but particularly among pediatric populations--and also may cause/be evolving in the direction of causing more severe disease in children.

The 2003 SARS epidemic should also be placed in the balance in weighing the significance for healthcare policy of modeling studies such as these. That was a very, very close call, a pandemic with a >10% case fatality rate. It was shut down due only because of the outstanding--and tragic, in the case of the MSF physician involved--response of healthcare primarily in Vietnam, Hong Kong and Canada.

What is more to the point is to realize that (1) the current SARS-Covid will evolve, *perhaps* in a milder direction, but (2) recurrent *new* SARS-Covid pathogens will continue to emerge and 'wash' across the globe. Even if each SARS-Covid pathogen evolves in the direction of less virulence...and they may not...the evidence suggests the recurring emergence of new strains of virulence ranging from 1% case-fatality (SARS-Covid19) to 10% case-fatality (SARS-Covid03).

It is worth considering what it would take to 'flatten the curve' for a SARS-Covid pathogen with a 10% case-fatality rate.

Could we do it?

How"
2021-01-12 22:19,"Yes, I agree. In fact I said this six months or more ago. The tendency of the virus (and any virus or parasite) is to become more transmissible and less fatal over time. That's natural selection.

Some 10% or so of colds are caused by coronaviruses already. That suggests that coronas (and other cold viruses such as rhinoviruses) have ""jumped"" from other species to humans, caused epidemics, and then become more or less innocuous."
2021-01-12 22:31,"""Reanalyzing data from a previous study, they found that the first infection with common cold coronaviruses occurs on average at 3 to 5 years of age. After that age, people may become infected again and again, boosting their immunity and keeping the viruses circulating. But they don’t become ill.""

Does this mean that each person can only get the cold from a coronavirus four times in a lifetime, one for each coronavirus? And that all other times someone gets a cold it's due to some other type of virus?"
2021-01-12 22:40,"Best news I've read today, because it makes sense.  Humans would not have survived hundreds of thousands of years without contagious viruses not eventually becoming mere nuisances."
2021-01-12 23:09,"This article is highly informative. To me, the most natural solution is to expose oneself to common cold coronaviruses as regularly as possible, thus providing stronger immunity to novel coronaviruses such as n-SARS Cov-2. For example, I liked sitting by kids on the metro. Unfortunately, our communities are currently losing regular transmission of common cold viruses and seasonal flus. We must pray that the unintended consequences of this unprecedented social distancing experiment are not too much to bear."
2021-01-12 23:59,"I don't understand the use of ""endemic"" here. Here is an entirely typical definition: ""of a disease or condition) regularly found among particular people or in a certain area.
""complacency is endemic in industry today""
Nothing in the definition implies that the disease is benign at all.
Daniel Boyarin, UC Berkeley"
2021-01-12 21:56,"It is NOT a respiratory illness, it enters the body through the lungs then finds ACE 2 receptors to bind to and infect the entire body, through other organs. It also coats its protein spike in sugar masking it or cloaking it from our immune system, as well known other viruses like AIDS do. Stop saying it is a COLD. It’s not."
2021-01-12 21:15,Human is not the boss of earth. We can't eradicate everything we don't like. We have to learn how to coexist with other inhabitants on the planet.
2021-01-12 20:45,"I'll take one large coronavirus vaccine to go, please..."
2021-01-12 22:36,"You mentioned-all too briefly-New Variants of COVID-19 way down in your article but you really should have started off with that, the longer the virus circulates the more likely it is that it could develop into something a lot more deadly for which no cure can be found-this message should be pumped out of every news outlet in the country until it finally gets through to the trumpists/anti-vac mob. then you won't have to contend with the pushback that has bedevilled the campaign against the virus so far.
This thing could wipe out billions of us unless a coordinated response is mounted world wide-I can't go out much because I am in a high -risk group and there are still far too many people who think it's ok to flout even the most basic of safety requirements, we have the faster-spreading variant here and I am wondering if I am ever going to see my close relatives ever again, ( I learned today that our Govt. estimates 2.1 years before we all get vaccinated-I cannot believe that this will work out as hoped for with new variants possibly springing up all over the place.so we all have to take responsibility by pulling together and wearing the masks.
 You have to push the message out that the COVID strain which takes us, your families and friends out is bound to emerge if we don't."
2021-01-12 21:42,"Coronavirus will not offer long term natural immunity post infection. It is reported that antibodies last around four months.

2021-01-13 0:57,"That's all very reassuring, but what about Long Covid?  There's every sign that some people, once infected, may never get over it completely.  I've had bad colds that lasted a couple weeks, not 6 months."
2021-01-13 1:06,"The notion that the virus will become more benign with time need not be true on moderately short time scales. One way to think of this is to consider an idealized situation with two populations: one population which gets the virus and dies but doesn't spread it and while the other population gets the virus and spreads it but doesn't die. In this admittedly idealized scenario there is no selection pressure towards a kinder gentler and less deadly coronavirus. What will happen in the real world is anybody's guess at this point but the scenario above isn't all that far from what is occurring now. Young people get the disease and spread it asymptomatically or they get sick with symptoms like a nasty case of flu, but mainly they don't die. The elderly people who die aren't spreading it much."
2021-01-13 1:16,"Krzysztof Pyrc et. al. offer a suggestion that the two coronaviruses 229E and NL-63 in the alpha genus that infect humans share a common ancestor circulating about 1000 years ago, although this ancestor may have been in an animal host as 229E is closely related to PEDV, an economically destructive coronavirus infection of pigs. In the Beta genus, Susanna Lau et. al. discuss coronavirus HKU-1, which they say is “associated with community-acquired pneumonia” in Hong Kong. OC-43, the other human Beta species, is a relative of Bovine coronavirus. None of these four coronaviruses should be considered totally benign; all are more likely than rhinovirus, the classic cause of common colds, to produce serious illness in older people.

We do manage to live with them absent fear, however. That may be the result of our CDC using the lumping mortality category “influenza and pneumonia” in its National Vital Statistics Reports. Many bacteria and viruses are involved here, so they aren’t listed separately. Or weren’t until SARS coronavirus 2 came along. While the new virus may become less dangerous for generations growing up with it as Lavine thinks, it has its own mortality category now, about seven times as large as the other influenza and pneumonia."
2021-01-13 2:51,"Scientist predict this? That’s like predicting winter will come each year. Of course, the majority of the population has a strong enough immune system to fight it. As with most other viruses, it will attack the weak. Nature is a cruel, but wonderful thing. Darwinism rules!"
2021-01-13 3:30,"And for those of us who ""get colds"" which are followed by bronchitis and pneumonia, or just gets the same cold again and again and again until we're exhausted and beaten...

This is not such great news. 

Whoopee!"
2021-01-13 4:16,"We don’t know whether the vaccines prevent transmission or merely suppress symptomatic disease.  We don’t know how long vaccine-induced immunity lasts.  We don’t know whether the inevitable viral mutations will result in vaccine resistance.  We do already know that existing mutations result in increased transmissibility.  We do know that a fortunately small group of people have contracted the disease a second time.

The article mentions that it might take “decades” for SARS-CoV-2 to become endemic.  This is not a hopeful scenario.  Don’t throw away your masks."
2021-01-13 8:05,"This is madness. COVID damages essentially everyone it infects with 77 to 85% (depending on the study) suffering lingering aftereffects in every serious study of long-term effects. Subjecting children to a lifetime of disability to a greater or lesser extent most of the time seems a bad option.  

COVID-19 is not the flu. It is not a respiratory illness. 

It is a disease of the blood vessels. Specifically the lining of the blood vessels. The pneumonia that is frequently associated with COVID-19 is caused by the initial infection there and the damage done to the many blood vessels in the lungs that leak fluid into the lungs. 

Autopsy results show damage in the brains of essentially everyone who has died of COVID-19, caused by numerous small brain bleeds from weakened blood vessels. 

Survivors of COVID-19 complain of lingering aftereffects in at least 75% of the patients. ""Brain Fog"" is a frequent complaint along with kidney damage, poor endurance and intestinal issues. There is even an ailment called ""COVID-toe"".

Letting children get COVID as a childhood disease is a huge risk to their long-term health even if few die. 

Of course once enough adults are vaccinated, COVID-19 will not circulate widely--but still, just as we ensure our children get their vaccinations today, COVID-19 vaccines will be an essential part of the heath management of children whose parents prefer them to grow up without serious lingering health issues."
2021-01-13 9:36,"So we should go for the Cuban vaccine that is sniffed instead of injected? 

I have always wondered about micro-infections: the kind of situation where you sniff a few corona viruses but not enough to get sick. The scientific theory is that that won't have any effect. But what if it does help developing some resistance? One of the unexplained facts about flue viruses (like 1918) is that after one of two seasons they just disappear. This might explain that."
2021-01-13 12:02,"If it is more plausible that the vaccines will prevent illness — but not necessarily infection and transmission (Dr. Crotty), why vaccinate younger healthy people?"
2021-01-13 12:18,"Dr. Lipsitch states we do not know what it looks like when adults get a primary case of the cold-virus versions of coronavirus.  My theory is that we might have seen evidence of that.

When Columbus came to the new world up to 90% of the population died in some indigenous communities.  This was attributed to smallpox.  It should be noted that smallpox has a mortality rate of about 30%, and does not truly account for the level of death seen.

On the other hand, if 2-4 coronaviruses hit a community for the first time along side smallpox it might be better able to account for what was seen historically.

I have also been wondering whether this is somehow a factor for why many of the native american populations have been hit harder by COVID-19."
2021-01-13 12:34,This coronavirus should have been named the Chameleon virus - it seems to cause every possible (and impossible) symptoms
2021-01-13 12:46,"This hits me as a whole lot of hubris. Perhaps maybe that’s a misread, influenced by the brain fog, fatigue, and stress of managing lingering symptoms 10 months after getting COVID-19. My teenager is in the same boat. I read the stories of worried parents of children of all ages in world-wide support groups. I would hesitate to say the virus doesn’t affect young children badly, as we don’t yet know what the long term consequences for them could be. Medicine and research have focused on keeping people alive and on developing a vaccine, but there are millions of people who’ve had this virus and still struggle in the post-acute phase. Many won’t realize that the heart attacks, migraines, intense fatigue or cognitive impairment that develop months later are directly related to their “resolved” SARS-COV2 infection. I’m not a scientist or a researcher, but I know enough to see that lack of scientific study doesn’t equal lack of scientific evidence."
2021-01-13 12:56,"Interesting hypothesis. In the meantime, could we all focus on getting the vaccine supply chain working as it's completely stalled out as of this week here in the Great Lakes state of MI.
We need a PLAN to get the vaccine to all the states and then get it quickly into as many citizens as willing to take it. That is still not happening."
2021-01-13 14:02,"Unless I misread, this is kinda pollyana-ish, especially since there is some question about the long-term shield from the vaccines, not to mention the fact that even today a kid with a cold can take out someone with a compromised respiratory system, pass on their rhino virus and it blossoms into a dire pneumonia. 

Maybe a better hypothesis is this corona could become like bad flu season, manageable but best avoided, if possible. That's the status of flu nowadays – annual vaccinations and projections about strains and their potential severity. 

That makes more sense, though it's merely a theory overlaid on an existing  scenario we can all get our heads around."
2021-01-13 14:23,"Well this is certainly not the opinion of all who are considered experts. Conjectures about the future of the virus, at least these kinds of conjectures, are a bit premature."
2021-01-13 11:32,"Over simplified nonsense. Do other corona viruses disable the ACE2 receptor. Do they cause widespread vascular oxidative damage leading to clotting ? Most of the really sick patients are extremely obese, why? We are just beginning to understand this pathogen."
2021-01-13 8:04,"“Naïve, refers to an older, adult person whose immune system has not been exposed to the virus.”

Interesting article, and loved discovering this new ( to me anyway) use of the word “naïve.” Looked it up for more info about its use in medicine and read that you can be “treatment-naive” when you have never undergone treatment for a particular illness, or “secondary-naive” if the clinician judges the medicine has washed out of your system for a sufficiently long period. I apologize to medical professionals if I’ve gotten any of this wrong but it was fascinating finding this adjective in medical terminology."
2021-01-13 14:16,"On TWIV this week, second part, <a href=""https://www.microbe.tv/twiv"" target=""_blank"">https://www.microbe.tv/twiv</a>/, they discuss a newly published study that found that one common cold coronavirus changed over time, and the blood of people who had previous versions of it was not able to neutralize the newer ones.   

In other words, the reason why coronaviruses cause 20% of common colds in all age groups despite there being only four of them in existence, is not that our immunity to them slips, but that the virus evolves to evade our immunity.    

Obviously it is not true that one just gets one cold in a lifetime from each of the four common cold coronavirus (only two of which are at all common); if that were true, coronaviruses could not be 20% or more of all common colds.

But I do believe there has been discussion in regard to the changes in covid that there is often partial immunity."
2021-01-13 14:44,This is an irresponsible outlook on the potential hazards of such an outcome.  The cheery-seeming headline needs to be changed.
2021-01-13 15:57,"The  upshot is the virus will be with us for the foreseeable future...     Maybe generations of virus will interact with generations of people in a way of peaceful coexistence, maybe this war escalates from one side or the other.    The immediate challenge is half the population needs to be convinced or forced to get innoculation.       How do we accomplish that short term?"
2021-01-13 16:36,"Seems like a nice, happy-go-lucky scenario.

How about an alternative: the virus now causing COVID-19 remains in animal vectors and undergoes gradual evolution, periodically reinfecting human populations whenever they have mutated sufficiently to overcome existing resistance. Sort of like the influenza virus variations do today."
2021-01-13 11:44,"Something very wrong with this article. I've read this over and over. We get infected with common cold viruses after the first exposure at age 3-5, but don't become ill? Really? So then why do so many people get sick from the common cold in most years? EDITOR!! STAT!"
2021-01-13 18:11,"I am a baby boomer.  We've had our day in the sun and are now surplus other than those with big pension and retirement accounts based on spiralling home and stock prices which, economically speaking, outweigh the actual value of we baby boomers. At age 75, medical assistance, including that in care homes, should be restricted to pain relief rather than using and doing everything possible to keep us alive another five to 10 years, and doing little except watching cash reserves grow and depriving those behind us a chance to -- wait for it -- clean up the degrading environment and live in a genuine stustainable manner without copying the greed of baby boomers: age 75 restrictions are necessary."
2021-01-13 18:11,"Well, this was a predictable article. 

Next up, articles on how the U.S. is gradually achieving herd immunity; and how most people who were infected with, and/or exhibited symptoms of COVID-19, say it felt like a really bad cold. 

Incredible, but not entirely unbelievable."
2021-01-13 18:20,The article says that the immune response is in the nose and throat and that the vaccine in the arm is not ideal. Months ago I read about researchers working on a COVID vaccine that was sprayed into the nose. Does anyone know what happened to that research and if a vaccine sprayed into the nose is possible?
2021-01-13 9:42,"Scientists HOPE the virus will come to resemble the common cold once immunity is widespread in adults but like  just about everything having to do with Covid 19, they don't really know & won't really know for years.

2021-01-15 19:04,I have read numerous articles about the new variants being more contagious. But no article has explained what makes them more contagious. Does the virus survive longer on surfaces? Travel farther? Can someone explain this?
2021-01-15 19:05,"In my area, we locked down too early. There were zero cases in this state in March, yet this place was a ghost town. Meanwhile, the masses are restless and NOW is the time to hunker down. It’s incredibly frustrating. We have schools, bars, gyms, everything open. Our Republican Governor keeps stressing “personal responsibility “ , but it looks like he doesn’t think that applies to him taking any."
2021-01-15 19:17,We can shake people all we want for not wearing masks or social distancing or whatever but the real fail here is the lack of testing and tracing in this country which is what is really allowing cases to surge.  Until that is in place we will never have this under control.
2021-01-15 19:24,"This current pandemic and the new unsurprising variants are  simply feeding on people coming together and not isolating. Why on earth are governments sanctioning flights? What better place than to go inside a nice aluminium tube with other people. Our current predicament as with other previous outbreaks of infectious airborne disease, is simply being driven by flight.  An individual carrying infection leaves one infected geographic location and within hours alights like a fly to sugar in another.
We need to stop flying for a good long period to prevent these 'bloody bugs' thriving with sublime ease."
2021-01-15 19:26,"Now more than ever, our government and the people it is meant to serve and protect must be guided by science, experience and compassion. We know who will be in charge in on January 21st so that should happen. If only more Americans understood the facts and what is at stake. 

Misinformation, fear and hatred have taken a terrible toll on our country."
2021-01-15 18:55,"The Biden administration should learn from other countries like Austria, Taiwan, and Bavaria, Germany and give the public access to medical grade mask.

Now that most health care workers who want the vaccine are already immunized, we need to line up people by age at sports stadiums (>65, 50-64, 30-49, etc) and start mass vaccinations (12 parallel vaccine lines per stadium).   Get 100 million AZ doses to the stadiums.  Establish government fund for rare vaccine side effects as done for other vaccines.

When will we learn as a species that politicians are exactly the wrong people to design policies, methods and ways to combat a pandemic. The only thing politicians need to do is open up the wallets to fund scientists’ and medical personnel’s solutions.

I guess two million deaths does not cinch the change in tactics. Will four, ten or twenty million deaths convince us otherwise?"
2021-01-15 19:18,"The CDC estimate that only 1 million Americans will receive the COVID vaccine weekly is VERY distressing, as it would take YEARS for vaccination at that rate to lead to herd immunity.

Even the Biden plan to administer 1 million vaccine doses daily is disturbing, as it will take almost two years for vaccination at the rate to lead to herd immunity.

Of course, these projections will improve if the single dose vaccine is effective and approved."
2021-01-15 19:22,"Feels like the U.S. is collapsing and public health knowledge is dimming. The CDC has botched most of their public communication efforts.

At that rate it will be 2026 before everyone in United States has access to the vaccine, assuming immunity even lasts close to that long, which is absolutely not a safe assumption. Invoke the defense production act, temporarily suspend intellectual property laws, and throw money at every company capable of rolling out vaccine production lines, or the pandemic will become a way of life, with vaccinations reserved for healthcare workers and the oldest among us indefinitely."
2021-01-15 19:46,"""Federal health officials sounded the alarm Friday about a fast spreading, far more contagious variant of the coronavirus that is projected to become the dominant source of infection in the country by March, potentially fueling another wrenching surge of cases and deaths.""

And yet the Mayor of Chicago is asking the Governor to ease up on restaurants and bars reopening for in-door dining and service, not to mention sending kids back to the classroom.

Until vaccinations become widely available across the board, opening things up will only ADD to the problem of this fast spreading contagious variant of COVID.

My husband and I have pretty much sheltered in place since Autumn.  We can endure a few more months of watching Downton Abbey and Midsomer Murders."
2021-01-15 19:54,"We better get control of this virus and get everyone inoculated ASAP and ensure those not yet inoculated are exercising precautions. 

The big risk is every infected person is an incubator for a mutation ant it’s quite possible one mutation will render the vaccine ineffective. 
Dr. Osterholm’s podcast said the South Africa variant took only a month to defeat convalescent plasma in Italian lab tests. 

While plasma is not vaccine, this does not bode well and cautions us time is of the essence."
2021-01-15 19:58,"If we can get the most vulnerable people vaccinated in the next 30 days, hopefully, the impact from this contagious variant will be less deadly.  Already, 75% of nursing home people are vaccinated. Hopefully, with the ramped-up vaccine delivery targeting the 65+ population, we'll cover more at risk people."

The carve-out early on for the travel industry that has allowed the mutation to spread widely is a disaster. There must be consequences for being so dead wrong."
2021-01-15 20:13,"The really odd thing about the reaction, and measures being taken by the United States government, to attack and push back this virus, is this -

Surely, by now, it has to be obvious to anyone with basic knowledge of how this virus spreads, that unless vaccinations outpace infections, rapidly, very rapidly, the infection rate, and the death rate, will soar.

I'm pretty confident that Dr. Fauci, and other competent actors, in the battle against Covid-19, know full well the threat this virus presents and the disastrous future which will occur, unless we wake up.

The Biden team has been briefed and they are scared nearly silly; unless massive vaccination production, and massive vaccinations occur, with vaccination centers operating 24/7 in every local community across America, six months from now the virus will be rampaging, still ahead of the vaccination rate, which means it will be winning.

The fiddling has to stop, now, otherwise we will all be looking at years of chaos, healtwise and economically."
2021-01-15 20:15,"A few people on this thread have lamented that vaccinations of 1 million people per week (even per day) will take years to get to everyone in the US, which is why IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT PEOPLE HEED PUBLIC HEALTH ADVICE AND GET VACCINES WHEN IT'S THEIR TURN IN LINE, including their booster shots on schedule. I work for a large, nonprofit healthcare provider in eastern Mass. and the logistical challenge of vaccinating even our own employees is mind-boggling. Each vial of vaccine that's opened contains 10 doses that must be used within 6 hours, same goes for follow-up doses 4 weeks later. Every time someone is a cancels/no-shows because they they got an active infection, forgot an appointment, or changed their mind for some reason creates waste and chaos in the system.

The entire strategy behind the vaccine roll-out and continued social distancing recommendations (they should be mandates) is to SLOW THE SPREAD by inoculating first those people most like to contract and disperse the virus so that others who may not be in line for a vaccine for months or years are less likely to contract the virus in public settings.

Please don't be fatalist about the timeline. Be vigilant, be responsible, and for the love of everyone as-yet un-vaccinated, get the shots when it's your turn!"

As we know eligibility and availability don’t compute.  Not being able to get inoculated has delayed my decision to get someone as a home care companion a few days a week.  I will struggle with getting to doctor appointments, and just dealing with daily chores before I get a home care companion.  Since they are not medical helpers they have not had the vaccine either.  I do not want to get covid from someone, and I certainly don’t want to inadvertently give it to a helper.  Different situations like mine  must be prevalent in the dwellings of many seniors like me who have a bunch of health problems."
2021-01-15 20:51,"As the new British variant spreads (already discovered here in Illinois) the pressures on business will grow even worse. Particularly for restaurants and bars. Chicago's mayor is reacting to businesses that are on the brink.

If we are going to beat this new variant of the virus and avoid MILLIONS more American deaths, more businesses will inevitably fail. The only way to avoid even worse business collapse is not to reopen, but rather to provide federal economic aid to keep them afloat. PPP was a good start. President-Elect Biden announced more good news in that regard last night.

But just reopening, as the Mayor of Chicago and many other officials are pressuring, will only lead to much more sickness, death, and economic collapse, especially with the new UK variant spreading rapidly right now."
2021-01-15 21:06,"The federal government needs to take over vaccine delivery.  At the rate we're going, people like me are going to be waiting until late this year to get one, and risk getting this new virulent Covid.  Why is this being done state by state, county by county?  We need mass vaccination centers open 24x7.  Here in Texas, it's county by county.  The governor has announced vaccination hubs, but each county is deciding who gets to use them, and setting up their own registration websites.  How inefficient.  I've personally signed up on 5 different websites (county health site, pharmacies, doctors) to get notified to make an appointment, when I'm eligible, and they have supply.  My elderly 75+ parents can't even locate vaccine yet."
2021-01-15 21:12,does the current vaccine work on the variant? we need answers now.
2021-01-15 21:31,Efficacy is a generic term and without context does not have much meaning. Both the Moderna and Pfizer trials defined efficacy as not developing serious symptoms and or dying. Both trials decidedly did not address the risk of being infected. Any one in the media who uses the term efficacy without defining what it precisely means is contributing to our profound culture of misinformation. The US is a tower of babble.
2021-01-15 21:40,"More guidelines on what, if any, new steps we should be taking would be really helpful, like double masks? or going back to taking care w packages and such? or how specifically is the new variant more contagious, and what can we do to lower our risks with it? thanks!"
2021-01-15 21:47,"It makes little virological sense in our dire situation not to enforce the same restrictions on domestic air travel that have been placed on international arrivals.  But that’s just small potatoes. 

Since Christmas, the US has lost more lives to the virus than we did during the entire quarter-century Vietnam War.  And now, a more contagious variant is seeding??  How is a draconian shutdown not warranted?  How is massive relief not warranted?

As a nation, we must be in a state of deep psychological shock and delusion."
2021-01-15 21:49,"I'm still not convinced that the new variant is the reason of Britain's fast moving contamination, if it was the case it should have already spreaded massively in some others countries, because the ordinary variant already crossed any borders easily despite protection.

This variant is only dangerous in Britain, and contained elsewhere... I would rather think it's because of the weather.

Vaccine should be combined with virus tests to improve the accuracy and protect the right target.

We need vaccine but we still need as much test as possible to contain the spreading."
2021-01-15 22:03,"In Massachusetts, as of today, the MA Dept. of Public Health is removing the requirement for flu vaccination for attendance for students preschool-through college age. 

WHY?!? The removal of this requirement is upsetting to me. The reason influenza has largely taken a backseat is because of a combo of preventative measures: an influenza vaccine, plus all of the additional COVID precautions. 

A Massachusetts police sergeant, a father of two litter girls, recently passed away due to complications from influenza A, COVID, and pneumonia. 

So upsetting. And I'm supposed to send my children back to in-person school, while the pandemic is raging, the flu vaccine requirement has been eliminated, and the UK variant is ready to take hold! No, thank you!"

That concerns me as my wife works in a home improvement store and is around a lot of people. Employees have to wear a mask while working in the store. But customers who come in the store are not forced to wear masks. I'm not thrilled with the stores policy as it puts employees and they're families 'at risk.

2021-01-15 19:37,"Do you think maybe it's time to shut down international travel?  This new virus is a much greater threat.  The doctors are telling us that it is no more lethal but by being much more contagious, more people will get the disease which will result in more deaths.  

Meanwhile, people have had it with shutdowns and the Republicans have now rediscovered their opposition to federal spending which they forgot about for the last four years.  Then-good-now-bad.

We blew it big time.  Trump politicized it and turned it into a right wing cause.  Now we are suffering the consequences as the virus rages across the nation with a new one barreling in.

Looks like the herd immunity crowd will get its wish.  The way things are going, the virus is going to get its way before we can mount an offensive.  The next three months will tell the tale.  If we can't bend that curve down by then, well... we are already losing 3000 a day."

This pandemic has illuminated just how profoundly disturbing human behavior is. If China had been transparent, we would likely have avoided a pandemic. If we had stopped all travel and mobilized a global effort, like we have with Ebola, this pandemic would not have occurred. If Trump had not dismantled the National pandemic programs, and if he had mobilized a federal effort instead of working against it, we would likely not be in this situation. If the alternate reality citizens had sheltered in place, complied with mask wearing and distancing, we would not have this situation."

2021-01-15 19:21,"In Massachusetts, the 0 - 19 age group is experiencing an enormous increase in positive tests, and, in fact, it is the age cohort with the most infections.

<a href=""https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting"" target=""_blank"">https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting</a>

In the past two weeks there were more than 14000 positive tests for members of this group, which is generally the school-age population.

Just three days ago the number was less than 11000, which is a possible indication of a tremendous surge.

More ominously, this is a not an age group that has generally been required to get tested.  Some independent schools -- at great expense -- have tested their students after long breaks but certainly not every other day or every other week as some colleges and universities have.  Public schools in MA are about get pool testing but haven't yet.

How many more cases are out there?  And does the rapid uptick in Massachusetts mean the Variant is already out and about spreading contagion like wildfire?

The prevailing, unsubstantiated mantra has been that schools are not sites with high transmission rates.  

However, the numbers in the latest MA report indicate that schools will soon become super-spreaders, if they haven't already."

2021-01-15 23:19,"The higher rate of infection is scary simply because it will disable hospitals to the point at which the death rate rises significantly due to the absence of available professional medical care. The disease will become more deadly but not due to the virus but due to the fact that the hospitals are overrun by need. Even with a single vaccine shot, severity of disease is lowered for the newly infected. As both hospital beds are emptied and vaccination is over 50% (guess) the downturn and relief will be felt. Normalcy of some sort should resume to locales with stable low rates of infection along with vaccination rates above 85% (guess)."
2021-01-15 23:24,"I got home from a quick trip to my neighborhood Kroger's (Fred Meyer) in this city and state where infection rates are rising, about 20 minutes ago.
All employees and almost all customers were masked, but when I left the store I walked past, and looked into, the window of a makeshift ""break room"" created apparently for the ""pickers"" who select, bag and deliver groceries in the parking lot, to those who don't want to risk coming into the store.
I saw the same thing I saw a couple days ago: unmasked people, presumably pickers, sitting at ""normal"", close, unsafe dining distance from each other, eating and conversing.
The people I know who use the ""curbside delivery"" service do so because they feel it's safer than being in the store, and that they are in a very small, safe ""bubble"", but from what I'm observing their bubble is a lot larger, and more porous, than they would find comfortable, if they knew."
2021-01-15 18:57,"It's curious that the CDC states that current mitigation strategies are good enough to deal with the new strain. Meanwhile, in other countries - notably the UK - residents are being told not to leave their homes, except to exercise or run essential errands. Why isn't the CDC following their lead? Isn't it time to get more serious about this, especially now that the Republicans are out of power?

I realize no one enjoys lockdowns but - as we saw last spring in NY - they have proved effective at halting the spread of the virus."
2021-01-15 20:03,"In his brilliant and extremely important 2005 book, ""The Great Influenza,"" John M.  Barry spends much of the last chapter recommending the essential steps our federal government would need to take to be prepared for the next inevitable pandemic.  These steps include adequately funding our critical federal health agencies, making sure these agencies are staffed with top scientists and administrators, making sure stocks of critical supplies are adequate, making sure supply chains are adequate, and making sure that federal decision-making on the pandemic is not politicized.  Most importantly, Mr. Barry emphasized over and over how critical it would be for the federal government to tell Americans the truth about the pandemic, and to keep doing so throughout the course of the crisis.

Needless to say, it is shocking to read Mr. Barry's prophetic words in 2021.  Basically, his great insights and warnings were entirely ignored by the Trump Administration, which, most importantly, lied about the coronavirus from the beginning of 2020 to the present day, with the result that nearly 400,000 Americans have died.

While we certainly need to investigate the horror show that occurred at the Capitol on January 6, it is at least equally important for an independent commission to thoroughly investigate all of the nonfeasance, misfeasance and malfeasance of Trump and his administration throughout the coronavirus crisis that is continuing to kill thousands of us every day."
2021-01-15 22:57,"Good thing it's just a hoax.  In the same way that large swaths of our population are absolutely convinced that the election was stolen, there are a significant number of Americans who refuse to wear a mask (and ridicule, or bully those who do), socially distance, or do, anything, really, that would count as taking into account other human beings.  This same group will steadfastly refuse to take the vaccine and we'll be left with entire regions of the U.S. where the virus will continue its rampage, probably for years to come.  I hope I am wrong about this."

2021-01-15 19:35,"Yup. Thanks to the foot dragging (deliberate ?) by the Trump administration we are way, way behind the 8-ball. Staggering numbers of dead and vulnerable people out there because of the disorganized National vaccine distribution effort. Unacceptably poor leadership."
2021-01-15 21:33,"And yet there is no lockdown of the economy, no country wide penalty for not wearing a mask in public."
2021-01-15 19:30,"With the new variants circulating, it is even more pertinent that the speed of vaccination increases. As of today, CDC has released 30.6 million doses (Cuomo, not dosages!!)  in US and ~1.9 million doses to NY.  It is sad that NY has only administered ~679K doses so far and sitting on ~1.2 million doses. They knew this was coming since summer and instead of preparing for mass inoculations, they were busy in vaccine criticism and made many people skeptical in the process. Another thing I don't understand is Cuomo's math skills. He used to call all 20 million people eligible for vaccination. Today he fixed that error and counted 16 million after excluding children under 16. Furthermore, he said that people 1a and  1b covered so far are 7.1 million total and people with underlying conditions are another 5 million. Are you telling us that these 7.1 million have no underlying conditions? Who does your math? A large number of people with underlying conditions are elderly who are in the 65+ group. Also factor in the vaccine hesitancy, thanks to his criticism of the vaccine in the fall and some people who got Covid are choosing to wait. Even if 25% (a random no) people got Covid, herd immunity can be achieved by speeding up the vaccination. Coming back to the point, this is the time to show leadership and get the ball rolling and not earn brownie points by passing on the blame.

2021-01-15 23:45,"95 percent of fatalities are among  those over 50 and 80 percent among those who are over 65, and yet current plans call for vaccinating health 18-year-olds.

The consequence will be carnage, as those at highest risk are unable to get the vaccine.

If, on the other hand, the vaccine went to those at highest risk, we could slash the number of deaths to a fraction of what would otherwise occur, and keep hospitals from being overwhelmed as well."
2021-01-15 23:59,"The vaccine rollout is a nightmare, reminiscent of the still-present individual choice for mask-wearing throughout all 50 states. The fact that some Republican congress members refused to wear masks when confined in one room with other congressional members is outrageous and should be considered a crime. Hospital administrators with no patient contact are vaccinated when those who are in their 70s are still waiting. 80% of people who die from the virus are over 65. As much as a I value our democratic freedom, the United States needs to set laws for states--not guidelines, to ensure  national mask wearing and that all states have vaccinated the individuals identified by the CDC who should begin receiving vaccinations. The issue of vaccine manufacture and distribution is a parallel problem and needs to be addressed through the Defense Production Act and other Federal mandates.  It will be years before we can get control of this virus if things continue in this piecemeal, state driven fashion."

How about getting a lesser sized treatment of the same, and or something similar that could be quickly be administered like other shots in the doctor’s office? Are any ideas like this being thrown about with all the dark forecasts that seem to be designed to prepare us for continued or worsened death tolls? Where is the all- out government effort to speed up vaccinations? How are the treatment experiments going? Anyone that by now doesn’t know what precautions we can take must have been living in a cave, and so what good are the ominous predictions other than to put more strain on the already worried people.

And the most frightening thing about the government predictions is the experience of them becoming reality, and at a time when it is clear that more energy could be focused on keeping people alive rather than predicting our demise. The predicting part is easy because the horrible storm is already upon us, and what we need are signs of hope, and the rational actions that produce hope."

2021-01-16 0:24,"1)  The hospitals would not be overburdened with Covid patients if the CDC had ordered vaccine priority beginning December 14 to people over age 60 beginning with oldest first.  Instead the medical workers at  CDC ordered the unethical immoral vaccine priority exclusively to all ages of all medical workers (the vast, vast majority of whom are age 20-59 and would suffer only mild symptoms if infected).  And a great many of those ""medical workers"" aren't really even medical workers.....they just work for hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes but never interact with patients e.g. administrative, clerical, food service, maintenance.

Result:  many thousands of older people continue dying each day and hospitals are full of older people with severe symptoms

2) Medical workers at CDC finally reluctantly relented and said everyone over 65 has equal priority with medical workers.  But medical workers at many places persist denying the public vaccine access.   I am 72.  Today I tried to schedule an appointment for vaccination at the major hospital in town that has an appointment website exclusively for medical workers.  I stated I was 72 and referred to the CDC order.  Initially they thought I was an applying medical worker and I got a cordial confirmation of my request and message that they would get back to me soon.

The WaPo is reporting that all U.S. vaccine reserves are gone already. To me that means that the vitally important ""Second Shot"" may be in danger.

I also learned today that Pfizer, mysteriously, can't provide the vaccines it promised to the EU on time. They say they make it up later, but what good is that for the people needing the second shot?

If one takes these two facts into consideration, and combines them with Trump's agenda of ""America First"", one comes to a very troubling conclusion: our vaccines were STOLEN BY THE U.S.!

Furthermore, and for the record, I would like to make it absolutely clear that Pfizer did NOTHING to develop the vaccine that bears their name in the U.S.. The BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine was developed SOLELY in Germany. Pfizer was only taken on board for the clinical trails and the mass production.

It is therefor another betrayal of an alley by the United States of America if vaccine doses are redirected from Europe to the U.S. to compensate for the overpromising and underdelivering Trump regime, especially in it's last days and throws.

Now that the vaccine is out, suddenly there’s anger that elderly are not automatically  first  in line before younger healthcare and essential workers and the truth that the virus is typically mild for younger people is mentioned as the reason. You cannot have your cake and eat it too. You cannot ask young people to shut down their lives, economic activity, educational opportunities, etc - telling them its because they too are at risk only to admit once the vaccine is out that really they weren’t high risk all along. Perhaps at the very least some gratitude is in order to the young people for shutting down their lives for what ( now that the vaccine is available ) has been deemed ‘ low risk’ for them."

Why can there not be a daily lottery that you get to play towards the end of the day and whoever gets lucky gets the vaccine, any age group. At least this way all vaccines will be going towards humans in need. I am very glad this young man got a shot that might have been needlessly wasted."

Earlier today, I tried to make a vaccination appointment at Palo Alto Medical Foundation (a Sutter location). Their eligibility criteria are still showing 75 years or older and front-line health care workers. Does nobody call Sacramento or even monitor the news?

Instead the unethical, immoral medical workers at CDC ordered denial of vaccine to the elderly but privileged vaccination to all medical workers (the vast majority of whom are under 59 or less and wouldn't suffer severe illness if infected).  So, the elderly have continued dying by the thousands per day.

As the elderly death count surged, the CDC reluctantly relented to allow priority vaccination of older people on par with the priority to young medical workers.  But medical workers in some states are flagrantly ignoring the new CDC orders.

Here is Oregon just an hour ago, the politicians and the medical workers in the state health authority stated that they would not follow CDC priorities until and unless they receive extra vaccine.  So they are continuing to deny vaccine to the elderly but continue vaccinating young medical workers.

Not only that, but even when they get the extra vaccine they want, they will still ignore the new CDC priorities, still deny vaccine to the elderly until they first vaccinate the legion of young teachers so they can avoid mild illness.

SoCal needs a European style lock down to bolster the hospitals. Personally, I don't like it, but I don't want more lives to be lost.  We also need better masks to protect the wearer. That is a large failure of the Trump administration in fostering the production of better masks.

We can all complain about those 'horrible and cruel wet markets' and how they should be banned but the reality is, just about any market in the world where raw animal products are sold is a wet market, when you buy your fish from a fishmonger is it dry?  Of course not, around 13 to 14% of the worlds population has no access to electricity, should we stop them selling food that is wet?   Go to any town or city in the world and you will come across wet markets, they are everywhere, and just because this virus was supposed to come from bats (bats make up around 25% of ALL mammal species) it does not make it a foregone conclusion that bats are to blame.  We had Hendra virus here, its lethal and comes from horses, it comes from bats originally but needs to get into horses before it can jump into humans, are we going to ban bats?

    It’s crucial to roll out vaccines as quickly as possible and to convince people that the vaccines are safe. Unfortunately, that is no happening in our country. 
    Out of 22 million vaccines distributed as of this month ((January) only 6.7 million doses have been administered as of today. At this rate of vaccination, the virus is going to spread rapidly before sufficient people get vaccinated to develop herd immunity. Hospitalizations and deaths will soar.
     There was a lot of victory dancing and celebrating that we were bringing forward these great vaccines, but our country failed to implement a decent vaccination program, which is a tragedy. We had several months to implement a good vaccination program. 
  At this stage, face masks are our savior and the most important public health tool we have right now.  In fact, face masks are more effective than vaccines according to Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control.  
   But it is astonishing that even our lawmakers are refusing to wear facemasks. Some members of Congress recently contacted the coronavirus after spending time in a lockdown room in the Capitol on January 6, some lawmakers did not wear masks. Rioters and congressmen without masks, a perfect setting for another superspreader event."
2021-01-16 4:02,"All viruses mutate...this is normally not news. If the mutation makes the virus more contagious, vaccinating nursing home residents and the over 75 population is even more critical  Almost all COVID-19 mortality models focused on number of deaths, without considering age structure and co-morbidities. This can give very misleading inferences about the burden of disease in terms of quality-adjusted life-years lost, which is far more important than simple death count. For example, the 1918 Spanish flu killed young people with a median fatality  age of 28 and its burden in terms of number of quality-adjusted person-years lost was about 500-fold higher than the COVID-19 (at least as of January  1, 2021). The majority of covid fatalities are in Massachusetts were  in their 80s and 90s. Vaccinating this demographic will dramatically reduce the number of covid deaths. Isn’t that the point of our public health strategy for the last 9 months?"
2021-01-16 4:28,"As stated in the article, people who follow current precautions (masks, social distancing, etc.) are at no greater risk of contracting the new variant of the virus. If you are following the guidelines and have not contracted COVID, nothing has changed."
2021-01-16 3:52,"Those who refuse to wear masks - especially those in responsible governing positions should simply not leave their private residences. Period. If they do so without masks I’d like to see them heavily fined. Jailed. ( who cares if they get Covid in prison- they obviously aren’t worried). 
Masks, distancing and finally, a vaccination ( but still wearing masks until it’s totally “safe”. That’s the only way."
2021-01-16 3:37,"Since trump successfully politicized the virus, and caused the US have a yuuuuge number of cases, it’s only fitting to rename it the ‘trump virus’.  A little something to remember him by, as Mt Rushmore or the Nobel are likely not happening now."
2021-01-16 4:17,For the life of me can somebody please let me know if the vaccine is good for this new strain or not?
2021-01-16 4:34,"In theory natural selection should favor strains of the virus that are contagious but cause less severe illness.  Presumably, obviously sick people will be more likely to be isolated in their home or in a hospital and thus less likely to spread the virus to others, while mildly ill or asymptomatic people may be more likely to circulate around town and spread virus. This gives some basis for hope that Covid will become milder over time."
2021-01-16 4:55,"Today I learned the mutated virus is in Chicago - brought to us by someone that traveled to Britain and the Middle east 2 weeks before being diagnosed with Covid. I sure wish that person had a telephone call, or a zoom meeting instead. Just when northern IL numbers were improving  - I'm learning to not get my hopes up, and to think that there's still a long haul ahead of us."
2021-01-16 5:02,"Variants were able to mutate because there was so many cases. So much for allowing it to run amok Trump- style and fostering herd immunity as a strategy.
For variant strains to evolve the more people who had it the better for the evolving strain. That is why suppression of the virus was so important. Full disclosure- I am not a medico. But my uncle was a doctor and that must count for something (for Trumpsters reading this I am being ironic about the uncle).
Imagine the reaction if Obama had said there would be down to zero cases very soon and then went on to preside over 380 000 American deaths while doing nothing about it."
2021-01-16 5:01,"This is hopeless, this virus is just gonna keep spreading until 98% of us have it. The vaccines that have been approved will make no difference. We need to come to grips with the fact that’s it too to do anything about this pandemic, it’s destined to become a way of life forever."

2021-01-16 7:01,"I'm frustrated to have lived through the horrors of the first wave in NYC, and now this huge wave in CA, and to feel like nothing has changed substantially in our country's preparedness over those 10 months. Not only are testing centers and hospitals equally overwhelmed, adequate PPE again not available enough, people dying and infections rising in huge numbers, but we're actually in an even worse place as the longer this spreads the more mutations change what little we've been able to get a handle on. The failure to properly organize for vaccine rollout is the cherry on top."
2021-01-16 7:36,"Until vaccines are readily available, we need to all wear masks and social distance and stay out of crowded enclosed or certain outdoor spaces. That requires that masks be made available and even free to many people. 

We also need to depoliticize mask-wearing. I am appalled at the Republicans who refused to wear masks and some who may have infected their fellow colleagues in the Capitol who were sheltering in place."
2021-01-16 7:58,"Improvement in ventilation and frequency of air exchange in buildings is the single most important thing we could do to reduce transmission indoors.
 It is also the least-mentioned recommendation on lists of things to improve. 
It is slightly ridiculous that hygiene-theater is still emphasized so much compared to improving the performance of building Air-Handlers.
 We should now be spending as much as possible to improve air in buildings in anticipation of the (very likely much deadlier) pandemics we are sure to encounter in the future. If we spent many billions now in order to avoid many trillions in future medical costs it would be the most efficient use of our resources, especially if a global program of vaccine development (such as that recommended by Dr Osterholm more than fifteen years ago) was also initiated.
Penny wise, pound foolish, we are."

This has been a big fear since the start of the Pandemic. It can't be ignored that new variants may have been created because of the AZ trials in Britain and South Africa. It should be looked at.

Surely it is a straightforward procedure requiring an hour or less of training."
2021-01-16 10:06,"And even with all this going on, school districts all over my area are just chomping at the bit to re-open and stay open no matter what. They are far more worried about the optics and than of people dying.  All of the assertions that kids cannot get the virus or spread the virus have been completely debunked and yet are still being spread in a general effort to cram kids back into school. Even in the hybrid model, where only about half the kids are in the building at any one time, you are still looking at a more crowded situation for a longer period of time than just about any other kind of activity.  Yes, remote teaching is not ideal but it’s certainly better than deliberately pulling people together in close enough quarters to guarantee that the virus spikes even further.  And the hybrid model, which includes teaching kids who are in class at exactly the same time you are teaching kids who are remote is a virtually (if you’ll forgive the fun) is an impossible task that significantly dilutes the experience for everyone because it demands the teacher to literally be in two places at the same time.  Those who are making the decisions never have to live with the consequences of those decisions and so far they have not asked for any feedback on how we might make it better. They just want the public to be able to drive by the school and see teacher cars in the parking lot. It’s all about optics and not at all about science or safety."
2021-01-16 12:10,"Forgetting all the current political factionalism in these arguments (not so easy to do), keep in mind that most viral pandemics end within two years. It will still mean a terrible  death toll, but this COVID pandemic is not likely to have the duration of something like bubonic plague. Vaccinations will help a good bit, especially once the rollout is improved.

As with the 1918 influenza pandemic, we are perhaps in the midst of the worst seasonal peak. There are bits of data that COVID does not mutate as fast as the influenza virus, but there is a lot we have to learn. Whatever the current estimates of US (and worldwide) cases, they are most certainly too low--by what factor we do not know but five-fold would not be a completely unreasonable assumption (could be more).

We are are much more populace planet now with more extensive means of travel, hence spread--so these conditions create some other unknowns. As has been emphasized before, we are going to have to live with this virus for a long time."
2021-01-16 12:52,"We fail one-another when we decide only to listen to those we already agree with.

We fail one-another when we decide not ever to listen to family members, co-workers or neighbors who happen  to have a political world-view different from our own.

We fail one-another when we shut-down and refuse to listen to people who either claim a strong traditional Faith life basis, or people who have chosen not to believe in anything at all.

Likewise, do we not fail each other grievously when when we fail to include in our health deliberations both the current narratives in the media that unilaterally support mandated vaccines against the Covid family of viruses, as well as the passionate data and stories of people with vigorous immune systems who have taken care to adopt healthy life styles and to adopt the support and advice of decades and centuries of so-called alternative health practices?

Finally, as we look at the evolving economical and psychological data surrounding the global orchestration of the 2020 Pandemic response, would it not be rational also to look at all the consequences of the decisions we are making?

Increasingly data is suggesting that our children, as well as many susceptible adults, are developing long-term, perhaps permanent psychological syndromes of fear and anxiety that act, in many ways, similar to how extreme fear and violence has been documented to impact soldiers and people in war-torn regions of the world.

Let's listen to each other, please."

2021-01-15 20:19,"Imagine that: a coronavirus that mutates.  Well, don't worry because we've got vaccines that never made it to Phase 3 testing that are going to handle everything. And if they don't, don't worry unless you are elderly or have some serious underlying illness. 99.7% of infected people recover.

As Newsweek reported yesterday (Jan. 14):
""The study compared cases in England, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the U.S. – all countries that implemented mandatory lockdown orders and business closures – to South Korea and Sweden, which implemented less severe, voluntary responses. It aimed to analyze the effect that less restrictive or more restrictive measures had on changing individual behavior and curbing the transmission of the virus.

The researchers used a mathematical model that subtracted ""the sum of non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) effects and epidemic dynamics in countries that did not enact more restrictive non-pharmaceutical interventions (mrNPIs) from the sum of NPI effects and epidemic dynamics in countries that did.""

Using that model, the researchers determined that there is ""no clear, significant beneficial effect of [more restrictive measures] on case growth in any country."""""

2021-01-16 6:04,Terrible news.  A consequence of the higher transmission rate is a higher mutation rate owing to higher virus concentrations in the community.  Every resource needs to be brought to bear to get the world vaccinated before a more virulent strain appears.
2021-01-16 8:27,"Mask wearing practices need to improve. People are too complacent thinking they've got one on that's enough, but they also touch them all the time without sanitising hands first, wear them on their chin, neck, pull them away to talk, wear badly fitted masks where there is airflow around the edges. If they have the virus they are likely spreading it to others. 
Also, apparently bathrooms and toilets are where they find the most concentrations of virus. It's very very airborne, so close the lid before you flush people!"
2021-01-16 9:12,"We have roughly FOUR TIMES the rate of infections of other nations. We’re Number One, one could argue. 

Letting 50 states and many territories—and then counties and other localities—independently decide how to deal with coronavirus is a key reason we are in this mess today. 

We need federal action. Now. To close restaurants for in-person access for 3 to 6 months. Same with gyms, schools from pre-K to post-grad. Fine non-maskers. Encourage double-masking. 

Clearly we’re not the brightest bulbs on the string, so forcing us to behave via federal legislation is necessary. Sad, yes. Necessary—also YES. 

If we all stayed home as much as possible for 3 to 6 months, while ramping up vaccination, we’d have a good fall season. We’ll likely be wearing masks and social distancing for 2 to 3 years, when the next coronavirus pandemic starts. But denying reality is well as we know DEADLY. 

And oh how I wish there was a way to put anti-maskers at the tail end of the vaccine line. But they’re the biggest spreaders.

I’ve isolated since March, only touching my husband, occasionally the cat. My 52-year-old sister is facing open heart surgery in a few weeks. I’m going out of state to help her recover. And yes I’m terrified—because it’s Ohio. Not exactly a leader in vaccine response."

Living in the Uk with this threat of the new variant, makes you hyper aware of the dangers of all social contact outside your home. Vaccinations in the short term will not help the majority of the population as the rate of contagion from people spreading this virus is up to 50% greater.

The best advice in the UK at the moment is to stay a t home as much as possible and avoid all crowds and dangerous indoor environments where the virus can be transmitted by stagnant air.

 A disturbing feature of all this is the news broadcasts of young people in their 30's upwards who have fallen prey to this new variant and are fighting for their life in hospital. The hospitals are overwhelmed, particularly in London where there has always been insufficient Hospital beds due to the never ending cuts in the NHS, which have been unrelenting since 2010 with the Tory Governments in charge.

Hopefully, with President Biden this Pandemic can be brought under control in the US, particularly with the potential threat of this new variant of the virus."
2021-01-16 14:04,"The roll-out has been dismal and assured the chaos that followed.  The problem is because of a huge failure of our Federal Government, as with everything they took no responsibility, and abdicated everything to each individual, State and County.  

Here is Key West a friend called us on January 5th, and indicated that we should go to the Gato Building ASAP, they are taking names to be vaccinated.  We rushed over, joined the group, gave our name to a young woman holding a pad of blank paper.   The Monroe County Board of health only had enough vaccine for 130 people.  People were notified randomly from these list and given a time to be vaccinated.  We were never called and it was impossible to reach anyone by phone.  There is no published information, the Florida website is not operational.  So we have no idea if a list exists, if our names are still on a surviving list or we should travel up the State.  What we do know is that there is no more available vaccine and they have no idea when more we arrive.  Again, there is little to no information, everything is word of mouth.

We were able to easily put our names of the New Jersey website, if they contact us we will fly home for the vaccine and the follow-up.  

The problem is few people have answers, websites are vague.  The Miami Herald and the KW Citizen have no information."

Why wasn’t a plan for this mapped out when vaccine development first began? Vaccine development and implementation should have been developed on parallel paths. 

My hope is that Biden’s team will quickly make up for the shocking incompetence and abdication of responsibility of the Trump team. “Operation Warp Speed”? I don’t think so."

2021-01-02 16:56,"I do not understand how sealing off borders is regarded as draconian. I think every country should seal off their border, No one should be allowed in or out for a long period of time. Domestic travel needs to be banned between states. No one in their right mind should be venturing out of their states unless they work in industries that are essential. Also this includes people trying to returning to their countries which they should have done back in march anyway. Only way to beat virus is to first stop people from traveling between countries so countries can focus on domestic sources of this virus. US should have done this back in early February of last year when we started seeing cases in Washington. Yes, tourism will suffer but lives are worth more than any industry."
2021-01-02 17:14,"This was the exact same concern that I saw again and again in the  media about New Zealand.  There too, officials and experts ""worried"" that sure, the border controls kept the pandemic in check, but how long could it last? We are almost 10 months into this pandemic.  Clearly, it works quite well and with a vaccine here, I see no real challenge to keeping going another 4-6 months.  I've come to see these articles questioning the most successful Covid-19 response approaches as simple jealousy.  There can be no serious debate that the health strategy in places like Taiwan and New Zealand have been anything but an unmitigated success. Enough with the concern trolling and worrying about the sustainability of these approaches.  If we had simply copied them, instead of spending endless print time pointing to hypothetical (but never realized) challenges, we wouldn't have 4000 deaths a day."

In addition being a island and strong government policies for Cordiv, it is not surprising that it is doing good. We in US have to admit we are far behind on all four factors mentioned even we have the best medical and biotech talents in the world. 

Strangely these days China is recovering too. In early October during its National Day holiday, 600 millions of citizens went out traveling and social gatherings, we haven’t see any report about surge of infection. I understand West is often suspicious about the China information, but if their cases are as bad as US now, they can’t hide them. In addition, Western intelligence could get those data. 

I talked to my relatives in Guangzhou of South China, they all believe at this moment they have this behind while they and local government officials are on guard. Any person tested positive would be taken away to isolate by local authorities, and any people who have been interacting with that person, the local government takes effort to track them down,  are put into isolation for two weeks. The costs of the two-week isolation stay, often in a hotel, are paid by the affected people and their families.

I understand this is very authoritative approach, which is impossible to implement here. But what can we do now? Lockdown for fever?"

What a contrast."
2021-01-02 17:01,"Taiwan has a population of 24 million humans.

It has had a TOTAL of seven coronavirus deaths in the last year.....the same amount of coronavirus deaths the USA has every four minutes or seven minutes, depending on the day.

Yes, we have 330 million people and and we are not an island nation like Taiwan, but there are many things we can learn from the Taiwanese (and the Japanese and the Koreans) if we would only lift our big, swollen unthinking heads out of our two-year old 'freedom' sand bucket.

After nearly 9 months at home, unlike many here in Atlanta I finally ordered some takeout dinner. When I went to the restaurant to pick it up, there was a line of people outside not really socially distancing. A maskless man speaking loudly by the door wouldn’t yield to enable me to safely enter the restaurant. REALLY??

I’ve done my part to protect myself and my family. If Gov. Kemp & Prez. Trump want me to get out, enjoy life and support the economy, I need to feel safe without worry of infection.

Our leadership has failed. In a way, this is treasonous as they are supposed to look after the constituents. They are supposed to LEAD and PROTECT us; ALL of us, not just those who believe in personal freedoms. I have a right to be safe."

Alas, the clueless commander-in-chief with his extremely incompetent minions treated it as politics, rather than a public health crisis. Today, over 200,000 people who died due to Covid could be with us if we had adult folks running the US administration. They  have shown the world how to lead and bring everyone together to contain the deadly disease. Now is the time for the world to recognize Taiwan. Over the years, China successfully bullied every nation to block Taiwan’s entry into the UN and World Health Organization. This must stop. UN and WHO must apologize to Taiwan and  include them as member and use their expertise to combat Covid."

In the case of US and UK where it is totally out of control, states and counties should also move infected people to quarantine hotels for the two weeks, where they can be isolated, fed and monitored to check if they need hospitalization. 

It is too difficult to self-isolate at home and just spreads infection within families, which become a nexus as inevitably one or more family members must have a playdate or go to work and so it never stops spreading.

This sounds expensive, paying to rent hotels for isolation, to pay chefs to feed people during the 2week stay, pay CNAs to check if their symptoms get serious, but the alternative is the unending economic disruption and high death counts you have in the USA.

In New Zealand this Managed Isolation Quarantine (MIQ) was initially free, but now is charged $3,000 (NZD) so about $2,000 USD to returning Kiwis unless they are permanently returning or coming back for compassionate visits like to a dying relative. Still our MIQ is booked till April, and you can't buy an airline ticket to NZ without having your MIQ spot booked. 

There are not yet enough MIQ spots for non-citizens as demand to return by citizens just never seems to slow."

They don't understand why we are still allowed to travel between provinces, flying in and out of our borders, and a lack of unified lockdown rule.  To them, a single covid death is worth more than the cost of an economic downturn.  They constantly question me why does our government officials not abide the health authority's guideline and go on oversea tropical vacations with social media cover-ups.  i have no answer, and all I can say is perhaps white person privilege and entitlement."
2021-01-02 18:05,"And guess what, with extremely low transmission rate, people in Taiwan STILL wear masks when going out in public spaces. That’s how you control the virus. Whereas somewhere else on the earth masks are still politicized and people use “freedom” as euphemism for selfishness."

Empathy and compassion for others plays a huge role too, as does an overall lack of selfishness. Taiwan possesses all of these things.

The United States does not."

Taiwan sealed their borders . We , to this day allow planes full of people infected with coronavirus fly right into every airport in the country.

The airlines have gotten off Scott free , even though they ferried coronavirus to every country and every city on this planet. 

It seems the airlines have no controlling authority. They can turn any novel virus into a global pandemic in a matter of weeks.

When the virus first appeared in China last January, the world should have sealed off China from the rest of the world. No airplanes in, no airplanes out. The exact opposite happened, millions of people from China traveled for Chinese New Year. Seeding the globe with coronavirus, the airlines flew in and out of China for months while the virus raged in Wuhan.

If the world had acted as one to seal off China, while at the same time working on a vaccine, no pandemic.

The sad part is that nothing has been learned, the new variant of coronavirus is already  here...we learned absolutely nothing from the first go at this. 

Keep doing what you are doing Taiwan, and most importantly don’t you dare let anybody in from the US."

People in Europe and US are so selfish, so arrogant and think they are so supreme. This is why so many of them died. Besides that, Trump and his administration are incompetent to handle anything. These two factors make coronavirus be able to be  spreaded freely.

Look at the speed of people get coronavirus vaccine in US and Europe. Some of them even arguing not to get shots because they have precious ""freedom"" and precious ""choices"". Government should force them to sign a legal agreement; in case they get COVID-19, they will be sent to concentration camps to wait for termination."
2021-01-02 19:12,"The article was trying to be polite and didn't point out directly that Taiwan's medical chief, Mr. Chen Shih-chung adopted the same doctrine as President Mr. Trump: ""More testings result in more cases.""

2021-01-02 17:42,"I was surprised to learn Taiwan doesn't administer covid tests for new arrivals. This seems to be eschewing the low-hanging fruit of pandemic control. If Taiwan already requires a negative covid test for arrivals AND a 14-day quarantine, the addition of mandatory covid tests at airports (in similar fashion to mainland China) in a no-brainer, in that it will hopefully identify infectious arrivals, so they can be provided with medical assistance as well as (if necessary) placed in extended quarantine."

The government has earned that trust. That is a major difference that helps immeasurably when a government attempts to impose rules (short term... not as an autocracy) that make tough calls for a greater good. In our fractious democracy with an abundance of conspiracy theories and counter-productive behaviors regarding public health, we can only watch Taiwan's example of effective virus control with admiration, maybe a little envy."

Compare that to the deaths, destruction, and isolations we face in this country because of Republican policies."
2021-01-02 19:58,"The article did not make clear an important point as to why the Taiwan government is not testing more widely at its airports to catch more cases that do not show symptoms.

Since Taiwan already requires a negative covid test for arrivals AND a 14-day quarantine, the addition of mandatory covid tests at its airports may lead to far more false positives than true positives. (*When the true infection is low, even tests with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity can generate a lot more false positives than true positives.) Also due to the long incubation period, a negative test result during the airport arrival does not mean much. A 14-day quarantine following arrival would, on the other hand, be far more effective in protecting the population. Furthermore, since Taiwan government covers all COVID treatments and hospitalization costs for all who test positive (even for non-citizens and those without insurance), the false positives would add a huge financial and resources drain without adding much public health benefits.

This assumes, however, that the true infection rate among the arrivals is pretty low. On the other hand, if the true infection rate among the arrivals is high, then an universal testing requirement would indeed catch more true positives than false positives and would therefore become worthwhile. Thus, some random samplings at the airport would still be helpful to verify that, but an universal requirement may, for now, be an overkill."
2021-01-02 19:53,"Through the continuous reference to Taiwan as an ""island"" and the repeated suggestion that its geography is the key to its success, this article diminishes Taiwan's fantastic public policy.  Implicit in crafting the argument this way is an excuse for why the USA failed so miserably.  We have two borders, one of which on the North is effectively closed and one on the South that isn't a source of COVID infection   We too are an ""island"" but one with awful leadership, bad public policy and a large portion of citizenry who can't seem to understand basic rules or are just unwilling to comply like the citizens of Taiwan   This failure truly has nothing to do with unfortunate geography"

It is so disappointing to see the Times buying into and furthering the American delusion that New Zealand and Taiwan's success against Covid-19 is due to geography rather than, say, popular respect for scientists and experts, and a shared popular sense that a short period of national sacrifice and discipline were needed to achieve longer term success. America is not drowning in Covid because of its borders, and is not powerless to stop the disease. Covid-19 did not come to America over the Mexican border. America has chosen to submit to Covid-19 (inaction is in fact a choice).

By the look of covid-19 fatality statistics around the world, the window of economic opportunity will last at least a year or more.

The Sars-Cov-2 virus doesn't care about holidays and borders. Covid-19 can be held back. It's a matter of leadership and collective will of the people. The craving for instant gratification and selfishness are deadly. Blaming other countries and rehashing old allegations will not save a single life."
2021-01-02 19:55,"It should be noted that you ,Taiwan,  had one very big thing going for you that we didn’t , you didn’t have Trump running your coronavirus response.

If your aim was to let the virus spread quickly to ever corner of your country than he was your man. Even Alaska and Hawaii got involved and they are not even attached to the mainland.

If your theory is that 400,000 to 500,000 dead is acceptable  as long as freedom is not restricted, as long as the airlines load their planes, then Trump is your man,

If you want someone in charge who makes fun of mask wearing, once again Trump is the one for you.

If you want someone who will tell the public there is nothing to fear and that the virus is no big deal , then get someone like Trump.

If you want someone who never mourns all the poor souls caught up in this calamity , all the dead and their grieving friends and family , who golfs while people die, then Trump is surely your pick.

Our wonderful president never once told his supporters to curtail holiday gatherings, and he did all he could do to muzzle Dr Fauci.
Guess, Taiwan, which of the two had it right about holiday gatherings, one clue, it was the one with Dr in front of his name.

But there is hope for us Taiwan , a whole new, whole different administration is coming in just 18 days, one that actually listens to the science.

The best thing that could happen to us is about to happen, Trump is leaving .

Even before the scale and severity of the then-nascent pandemic was unknown, trust in their leadership and strong communitarian ethic - and comprehensive health care system - made the difference. Mask-wearing was ubiquitous, hand sanitizer everywhere and temperatures taken when entering museums and checking into hotels. In stark contrast to the US administration’s criminal negligence in managing 
covid-19, Taiwan’s government acted immediately and decisively in accord with medical science. For these reasons the infection rate has been contained and the deaths few."
2021-01-02 21:05,"Taiwan sent two emails to China and the WHO about human-to-human transmission on December 31st, which were ignored by both. Despite this, Taiwan still took precautions on the same day, which included screening and setting up an emergency response center. On January 14th, the WHO announced that Chinese authorities had seen “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission and in early February, the WHO said “the chances of getting this going to anywhere outside of China were very low.” In March, the WHO cited Chinese data to downplay asymptomatic spread saying that “COVID-19 does not transmit as efficiently as influenza."" It seems as though part of an effective response entailed ignoring many of the substantive communications by the WHO on the coronavirus."

The people in Taiwan were very responsible too. They had their masks on whether it is the subway, buses or the supermarkets.

Taiwan has been a model since the start of Covid-19. From memory they reactivated their epidemic control centre and command on January 1 2020 after receiving early signals of a new virus in Wuhan. 

I think your article unintentionally repeats - an apparently commonsense, but misleading - orthodoxy that countries which are successfully managing Covid-19 spread will be under intense pressure from their own citizens to reopen borders to countries with uncontrolled spread. 

I suggest the opposite is true - in Australia and New Zealand, and I suspect also in Taiwan, there is very strong domestic pressure not squander hard won gains. Is mid or late 2021 really that far away in the greater scheme of things?"

Given Taiwan's astounding success in containing Covid19, the author is surprisingly foreboding and insinuates that Taiwan's very low number of deaths is due to a combination of dumb luck and government overreach. The Taiwanese people and government should instead be applauded for their foresight, critical thinking skills, and collective sacrifice for the good of their country. I'm quite confident, furthermore, that Taiwan's government would handle the distribution of Covid vaccines far more effectively than we are."

Sure, Taiwan is a disciplined and educated country, whose citizens don a mask without being told when they have the flu. Practice makes perfect.  

This international virus needs a concerted effort by all. The latest show of ignorance is the use of the Rapid Antigen test (from Abbott) that demonstrated a sensitivity of 60%, whereas the Rapid PCR test has demonstrated sensitivity of 100%. My guess is that Taiwan is using these. Part of France has been using it since Aug 10th, and bought the mobile equipment (lab on a sidewalk...) from Singapore. See <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbR_gnE7Hjg"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbR_gnE7Hjg</a> . Sorry, this is in French.

The health official began boarding flights from Wuhan to screen passengers for symptoms in early January. As an island across the strait from China does not give Taiwan extra protection. The government supported the private sector to increase the production of masks from 2 millions in February 2020 to nearly 20 millions per day within two months. It is not an authoritarian government or Confucius culture that drives Taiwanese to become compliant with public health measure - you should read more about how Taiwanese enjoy their freedom holding demonstrations and protests, both on the street and in the legislature. Minister Chen and his team has earned the public trust in Taiwan through comprehensive epidemic control measures. Its ""daily"" news conferences has provided transparent data and consistent information on COVID-19 since February 2020. One small example - Travelers returning from overseas are required to take a pandemic taxis or private car home.

All of these strategies were available to the US (were, in fact, urged by the scientists in Trump's orbit).

One thing worth to mention is the name-based Mask Distribution System created by the Taiwanese government. Each citizen is qualified to purchase two face masks every 7 days initially. The purchase days alternate based upon the last digit of the National Health ID card issued to EVERY Taiwan citizen. No price gouging. No panic; no long lines; The government earned the trust from its people.

Many do not believe Taiwan's reported figures--a popular joke is, Taiwan is either really lucky or has a magical shield.  They do what Donald Trump wanted to do--curtail the testing.  Recently people entering other countries from Taiwan have tested positive at point of entry, calling Taiwan's situation into question.  

BTW, people from the Diamond Princess were allowed to go onshore in Taiwan and mingle--it was in Taiwan, not Japan.  

There was a domestic mask shortage and Premier Su apparently lied about availability.  Mr. Chen Shih-chung even demonstrated how to use rice cooker to sterilize and re-use masks.  While the population stood in line to buy 9 masks for 14 days, the DPP administration donated masks to other countries to curry favor.  This was attacked. 

The situation with vaccines is that Taiwan does not have contracts to buy vaccines--there was a big uproar and scandal. The government and Chen Shih-chung have hardly been transparent and straightforward--they are not giving the people a straight story."

We are lucky we acted as quick as possible, since we don't want to risk any person's lives, we are lucky we are kind enough to aware this. We are lucky that we've been isolated for very long time- we are on our own, the only thing we can believe is practice and experience. That's why we are lucky, that we didn't believe whatever Chinese government claimed. We are lucky we have faith in science and facts, since the painful lesson we learned at SARS era that the world would just leave us to die because of CHINA. We are lucky we are not China. Are we lucky? Yes I guess so. Our hard working doesn't mean anything at all. You put us on the edge now you saying we are lucky, fair enough huh."
2021-01-03 15:04,"Food for thought.

Well, I don't know why this article ignored the factors about similar policies that have been imposed by Australian and New Zealand governments. Maybe this journalist has the preferences on Taiwan but rather to ignore the harder border control policies that Australian government has been introduced since March 2020. They are stricter than Taiwanese government, for example, Australian or PR need submit the request to the Department of Home Affair to be granted the approval to leave Australia. At the same time, visitors without PR visa could not enter Australia from March 2020 to date. 
*But DOES TAIWANESE GOVERNMENT IMPOSE THE SAME POLICY?* I doubt  that.

I can not help wondering, if this journalist is corresponding for the Asia-Pacific region. How could NYT's editor would agree to publish such an article that included Singapore without considering Australia and New Zealand. Or, NYT and this journalist do not consider Australia and New Zealand as part of the Asia-Pacific region. As such, it could perfectly justify why this journalist only concerning how could ""Taiwan"" persist the border control without mentioning the harder border control policies in Australia and New Zealand, for the same question, how long could they persist?"
2021-01-03 9:50,"Before questioning Taiwan’s border control, have you done your research and look at places like Australia and New Zealand? Both have far strictest border control regulation in place, banning ALL visitors / temporary visa / work visa holders from entering the countries. I appreciate fresh perspective but you gotta do your research right."
2021-01-03 4:03,I find it very odd most of the Asian countries are doing so well and the US is doing so poorly.  New Zealand is an exception as it is an island of small population.  Strange and Sad!

2021-01-03 13:50,"Arghhh! Another article falsely claiming that Taiwan's success (as with OZ and NZ) is due to the ""island"" factor.  Most island countries have terrible Covid outcomes: UK, Philippines, Indonesia. Even Ireland is struggling now. Island geography is irrelevant if borders remain open. It's the difficult political decision to shut down foreign travel (along with masks, social distancing, etc.) that makes the difference.

Second, this article claims that Taiwan closed its borders at the risk of its economy. Yet Taiwan, China, Australia, NZ, and other countries that closed borders have better GDP outcomes than those with open borders.

Third, this article claims that Australia and NZ's ""insularity"" protected them from the virus. Just the opposite. The virus hit during the OZ summer when it was a bustling hive of about 1 million visitors along with countless Aussies on summer vacation overseas. 850,000 foreign tertiary students (approx 40% from China) were arriving by the end of February (OZ's 3rd largest ""export"" is education). That entire industry was shut down. Since mid-March, more than 450,000 people (many/mostly Aussie expats) have returned to OZ. Hardly an insular island."
2021-01-08 16:29,"The problem appears to be that, with all the treatments that help people who aren't yet terribly sick, the hospitals and clinics are so overwhelmed with very sick patients that they can't devote any resources and staff for the infusions.  

I doubt if I called my doctor with a few early symptoms, I'd be able to get one of these treatments."
2021-01-08 16:29,"Lots of luck with getting the treatment.  Not sure how many states are as strained as Arizona but in this state there is no room or staff to provide the treatment.  So busy on the backend of the patient load to care for the front end.  Thus, more move from the front to the back because they do not receive the treatment upfront.  Crazy!"

Every day I suffer from ""brain fog"", extreme fatigue, and debilitating headaches. I am not alone. There are tens if not hundreds of thousands of people like me suffering from Long Term Covid. Many of our symptoms are neurological and do not manifest as a physical disability. Often times I'm told that I look great but inside, I feel awful. As the numbers of long term covid sufferers increases, many work places will be affected. I sincerely hope that increased research can discover some type of treatment to help me and others return to a quality of life we had prior to the horrific outbreak of Covid-19."

2021-01-12 16:23,"Had Covid early April 2020. While I've been managing the physical symptoms all right, my smell and taste are still all wrong. 

I used to love aromatics (onions, ginger, garlic, etc.), now most smell like they've gone bad and taste even worse. Citrus smells musty and chemical. Bell peppers are the worst offenders, smelling and tasting totally rotten. It's really frustrating to have to cook and eat so differently than I used to. I still automatically say ""I love garlic"" before having to correct myself. 

I feel like I'm having an identity crisis at times; I'm wasn't a picky eater, but now I am... will I be forever? I hope not."

The progression from anosmia, through parosmia, some recovery, and then setbacks to anosmia again has been common for me and others I know who had Covid in March."
2021-01-03 16:22,This article is very timely.  It is unfortunate that the experts and the government have not focused on this.  Research by Virocule has shown that nearly 90 percent of Covid-19 infected suffer from smell dysfunction. It is an early marker of the disease and can be used to  better manage outbreaks.  The long-term effects also need to be seriously and consistently measured.

2021-01-03 16:31,"As the effects of losing one’s sense of smell and taste are alarming it should be noted that millions, including myself once, have volunteered for these symptoms by embracing cigarettes and strong drink even though those two things degrade those two senses. One of the reasons people gain weight after quitting either vice is because of a reawakening of those senses."
2021-01-03 16:31,"Ironically, I have experience with 2 family members losing their senses of taste and smell.
My brother was in a bad accident well over 30 years ago and lost both senses, Eventually his sense of taste returned but never his sense of smell.

My younger son had a virus deemed an adenovirus (but not tested) just prior to Sandy in 2012.  He lost both taste and smell, apparently never to return.  Luckily, he had his uncle to help him through it. We dragged him to a dozen doctors, of all sorts, and none could do anything for him. One, in a fancy NYC hospital suggested a painful surgery that made no sense and likely would not work. Finally, our son said ""enough!"" and we decided to live with it.

Like blind people (especially from birth) must create a different imaging model of the world than sighted people, so he has done the same for food. Texture is everything, so all our meals are built with that in mind.  A delicious quiche that his mom and I enjoyed was a flop: ""It's mush!""  he averred. 

This new model works for him, and he enjoys everything from steak to certain kinds of ice cream.  He only drinks water, and is otherwise a normal, healthy teen.

Of course the big worry is he cannot smell danger--gas, spoiled foods etc, although something noxious can irritate his nasal passages.

After 8 years for him, and 30 + for my brother, I KNOW that one can live and enjoy life and food with diminished or non-existent taste and smell.  But one must change ones expectations and perceptions."

2021-01-03 16:46,"I lost my sense of smell and taste when I moved to the Seattle area in 2006. I did not regain either until I was given dupixent in early 2020. I never had any issues with nutrition or depression - just came part of life. I had 4 sinus surgeries and issues with asthma due to polyps that just never went away. I had some miserable nights and days but still got up, took care of my children, and went to work. I think just like anything else, depends on how you look at something thrown at you."
2021-01-03 16:53,"The study mentioned in the article in Germany has more details and tips how to “train” the sense of smell back. 

Losing my sense of smell and taste would be devastating - I basically plan my days around what I will eat and love cooking. One of my best friends got covid back in March and still can’t taste or smell properly. He said unfortunately the only things that really get through still is junk food. He’s working on “training” now and hopefully it will help. 

This is a serious side effect that has major life quality (and life safety) repercussions. There is a reason we can smell and taste. 

I hope much more work is done in this area.

2021-01-03 16:54,"Most of us anosmiacs sense sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. Crunch takes on new meaning. Yes, install detectors and remove the gas stove. But like waking as an adult with complete vision loss? No. Join a support group if that suits you, but why not write a cookbook with recipes that rely on food texture? And for those among us who have found texture as exciting as we used to find taste, how about an anosmiac's diet recipe book!"
2021-01-03 16:56,"Surely hope that a treatment is found and that there is more respect for this consideration and empathy for its sufferers. 

From the comments much has to be done in these areas.

Complete loss of smell and taste not only usually ends in malnutrition. It generally ends in driving the sufferer to social isolation and to depression that tragically all to often ends in suicide. I once read that this condition way an extremely salient one in statistical terms of sufferers taking their own lives. 

This is a very terrible condition to have in a permanent basis and it’s not easy to adjust too in spite of the sad and quick dismissal of it by friends, family, and coworkers, not to say some doctors —especially those outside of the mental health disciplines."
2021-01-03 16:59,"I'm so grateful for the comments, and encouraged by those who can report a life NOT ruined by anosmia.  If ever there was a subject that required anecdotal ""data,"" this is it!  It's so hard to imagine a life without smell/taste.  The article did a good job of it, and I found myself reading it aloud to my kids, but the comments are rounding it out."
2021-01-03 17:00,"There is research to suggest that direct electrical stimulation of olfactory nerves can produce a sense of smell in people who have lost it. It functions much like a cochlear implant does, for people who have lost their hearing. Neuroprosthetics offer some promise in treating anosmia as well as a vast array of other maladies. I encourage people to support this research and people who are currently suffering anosmia to seek out this sort of treatment - though still experimental. One place conducting research in this area, as of 2018, is the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary."

On Thanksgiving I ate nothing and threw up on a glass of water.   This is slowly subsiding but it makes me wonder what other damage my body has suffered.  

Warning:  If you love to cook, eat, savor, and entertain then avoid other people and keep that mask on!"
2021-01-03 17:17,"Let's maintain a certain sense of perspective about this: after struggling to breathe through March and dealing  for months with the racing heart symptoms in the middle of the night, I personally am just glad to be here.  If I can never taste a chardonnay or a diet coke again (both still taste like medicine) that will bother me little when compared to the many blessings I've been given simply by recovering. And, I should mention, you can buy a gas detection alarm from Home Depot to put in the kitchen."
2021-01-03 17:18,"Five years ago, I went through radiation treatment for head and neck cancer and lost my sense of taste for several months. In that time, I lost my love for life and became suicidal. I felt isolated from the culture of communal eating. Everywhere I looked, people rejoiced in food and friends talked about where they ate recently or their favorite dishes, unaware at how painful it was to be so disconnected from this simple human pleasure. So much focus is on the deaths from Covid, and while those are tragic, there is another toll that will be reckoned with for years to come - the long term, debilitating side effects of the virus. Those who downplay the pandemic are cruelly and woefully misguided."
2021-01-03 17:18,"I had this happen a few years ago, apparently from a virus that acted very much like covid-19.  I sympathize deeply—it was awful.  I’ve forgotten now how long it lasted, but it was a long time.  It has returned.  There are ENTs who are smell/taste specialists.  I suggest searching them out.  I know they have them at the U. of Fla. in Gainesville and at Yale New Haven.  I used sinus irrigation with dissolved budesonide (prescription) and “smell retraining” with certain essential oils.  You might start with cinnamon.  I wish the best of luck to anyone impacted by this.  I’m counting the minutes till my vaccinations.  I’m 78, live in a CCRC, and I want it now!  I’ve seen friends and elderly residents die of covid.  My eldest grandchild turns 7 today and we all need to hug each other."

By the third day she began lightly smelling ""something""  and over a few more days her ability to smell came back."

I experienced all the minor things that the article mentioned - alternate smells (I could smell ""something"" when there was a skunk/ I had a ""smell like standing over a septic tank"" at unusual times, etc.), I remain without either except for odd times. I can only smell salmon of all the foods I eat, no flowers or other foods or anything else.    Based on my experience, I am shocked that others are so extraordinarily effected by having the loss. I have always felt that one can get used to almost anything, and I have.        I wish there were a more balanced report on what can happen with one's life than this article."

As a result, I have zero sense of smell or taste. For the first few years, I really missed the smell of rain and spring, and of a million other things. I missed being able to taste food. But, over time, we all learn to accept and adapt. I still enjoy cooking and have learned to enjoy and crave for food. Other than being extra careful about food in the refrigerator (if in doubt, throw it away), the one advice I would give to people with anosmia, particularly those who have gas stoves: get a natural gas leakage detector/alarm. No, this is not a carbon monoxide detector.  This has been a lifesaver for me. It's available on Amazon for under $50."

This is such a crazy virus with so many varied post-infection complications that I can't predict the outcome for a course of treatment but it is worth a try. I have just begun treating a few patients for post-infection fatigue and brain fog symptoms. It is to soon to determine an outcome, but I am hopeful."
2021-01-03 17:37,"I used to have an excellent sense of smell. Then about 15 years ago, at Christmas in a room darkened to watch a movie, I cracked open a walnut and put it in my mouth. It was one of the most horrible moments of my life, an explosion of the most profoundly  noxious smell. I immediately spit it out, and then started brushing my teeth and washing my nose and mouth, to no avail. For about 2 months, I couldn’t escape the smell, and then my sense of smell came back but only barely. I’ve always assumed it was a neurotoxin. In the 15 years since, it has very gradually returned for some smells in a diminished way and is still quite absent for others. Haven’t ever heard of trying to retrain it. 

I couldn’t smell the gas leak my daughter noticed (in time to get it fixed). My enjoyment of cooking is now strictly for others, but diminished because I lack confidence in the taste. I couldn’t assess some conditions well in animal patients. The wonderful smell of the ocean, yep, gone. 

It is a loss. I get excited when I can smell something, even if I have to plant my face in it and snort! It must look odd to others. Sometimes I can smell something, but it’s distorted, rancid, or weird. 

I’m glad to know there are researchers working on this. For those who are new to it, it is worth trying to find things that smell good and keeping that near. Makes life a little sweeter."
2021-01-03 17:42,"My father always believed he lost his sense of smell from smoking during the first 30 years of his life. If he were alive today, I could tell him that it was likely something else, as I, too, have little sense of smell left and never smoked.

He eventually died decades later of Lewy body dementia, and if you google around there has been some research looking into whether loss of smell is an early marker for that disease (among others).

I only mention this as the article seems to suggest connections between loss of smell, and more serious problems like depression, or withdrawal from society. These are issues that logically could be caused by a disease like LBD - but it seems less clear how losing your sense of smell from a virus would cause these serious problems.

For what it's worth, for those who do not get back a full sense of smell, I would echo what some others have offered that texture and the taste bud senses (sweet/sour/salty) still provide a lot interest and enjoyment. When life gives you lemons, you might still be able to taste lemonade."

2021-01-03 17:46,"I had Covid back in March.  I have not completely lost my sense of smell, but it has changed.  Prior to Covid I would often smell things very intensely, not always a pleasant experience, but a very valuable and evocative one.  From the beginning of Covid, I had phantom smells, cat spray in a house without cats, a campfire in the bathroom, and other unpleasant smells.  I love to cook, but found myself unable to taste, or I would taste something and there would be an intense chemical taste.  Last week I couldn't eat salmon, because it tasted like it has been doused in gasoline.  This often ends in my abandoning food I've made and I have to force myself to eat.  I spent so much time obsessing about food that I spent a month writing a recipe book, but found I could only imagine the dishes I couldn't cook them. I now rely on crackers, soup and fruit shakes. I'll make myself eat a little of something, but it is quickly abandoned if it doesn't taste right. I had another symptom, which I looked up and it said this usually happened with malnutrition. I have three vitamins sitting on the table next to me, but they often make me throw up, so I'm reluctant to take them. I have many ongoing symptoms after Covid and this is one of the most maddening ones. On the other hand, I had to laugh the other day as the room changed from spelling like a fragrant garden, to something very rotten and then a spice market in Asia.  I figure I can sit in my living room and travel the world."

2021-01-03 17:21,"To this toxicologist, the progression of sensory dysfunction reported by COVID-19 survivors from first suddenly losing, and then gradually recovering sharper but distorted senses is similar to that seen in cases of carbon monoxde (CO) poisoning. 

The CO in COVID-19 is not inhaled, of course, but made naturally from the breakdown of heme proteins by heme oxygenase-1, the Universal Stress Enzyme, which  also releases equal parts of bilirubin and ferritin, all of which are reported higher than normal in COVID-19 patients in ICU, and highest just before death. 

 Both this CO we make and the CO we inhale modulate all our senses, acting as a  gasotransmitter that dulls our senses (like an anesthetic) when CO is rising and sharpens them when CO is falling.

Those who have lost their sense and/or taste probably still have higher than normal CO levels in their nose, mouth and throat.  This leaves a tell tale bright red color when high, similar to that  seen in COVID-19 toes, and red rashes on face and chest.  They also will have more CO coming out of their tissues than going in, marked by a chroncially low waking temperature and venous CO greater than arterial CO.   This is the opposite of healthy normal people (unless you are pregnant or premenstrual).  

Good news for those trying to get their senses back: you can quickly reduce your HO-1/CO production by taking a daily zinc supplement, the only compound approved by FDA for coronavirus treatment before COVID-19."

It is a nasal spray made from water, capsaicin pepper, and a few other natural items. A similar product is being sold under the name Sinus Plumber. It cost roughly $15 on the internet.

2021-01-03 17:56,I lost my sense of smell and most tastes several years ago but I've gotten used to it. No big deal.
2021-01-03 18:01,"I hope there is a lot of research around this and breakthrough. I lost most of my sense of smell about 25 years ago. The only thing I can attribute it to would be a severe sinus infection, and to this day my sinuses are perpetually stuffed and inflamed 

I remember the wonderful fragrance of a just opened bottle of wine. I drink a lot of wine, but I cannot smell anything even with my nose inside the glass

The smell of chocolate was heavenly. One of my favorite coffee shop hangouts in recent years was a chocolate cafe. Customers would walk in the door and exclaim how heavenly the smell, and I would think to myself “That’s right there is a smell.”

I could go on.

I can still smell some things. I can smell rain in the air. I can smell a musty basement. I can smell some bodily functions that I would prefer not to. I can smell smoldering wires 

But for the most part I cannot smell food. I eat well. But I substitute strong tastes for loss of smell. I only eat raw garlic. I use lots of curry. I drink only the most tanic wines.

Every so often a smell returns very briefly. But only as a reminder of what was lost"
2021-01-03 18:16,"The elephant in the room, either invisible or ignored, is the question “what percentage of covid survivors experience this symptom?”. It was barely alluded to in the article. So what’s the answer?"
2021-01-03 18:16,"There have been some successes regaining the sense of smell with elderly recovered Covid-19 patients in a nursing home where a friend's sister is a nurse, utilizing the essential oil blend known as ""Thieves"". They have been putting a few drops of the oil on cotton balls and having the patients smell it several times a day. I realize this is purely anecdotal, and I don't have any more information than this, but it is an inexpensive and practical solution for some, and well worth a try.
   There are several proprietary blends on the market, but the recipe can be found easily online for those who wish to make their own. It includes clove, lemon, eucalyptus, cinnamon, and rosemary."
2021-01-03 18:26,"I went to an ENT doctor at Cedar Sinai in Los Angeles last month for this same problem.  I had covid in mid-august and still haven't completely recovered my sense of taste and smell.  Fortunately, although slowly it has been improving!  I do smell training everyday with essential oils and I think this has helped."
2021-01-03 18:29,"Years ago my husband went to China for business. While there, he  contracted meningitis (we think). He was sent to hospital without a translator so who knows?
When he returned he had terrible headaches for two weeks and then could not smell or taste. The medical profession did an MRI and saw a black area just above the nose between the eyebrows which indicated that area being burned out.
He then began to get acupuncture treatments which was a last ditch effort to awaken the senses. And it worked as he then began to smell something burning but I suppose it was just a random smell from the brain messages. His sense of taste also returned but only in general ways. sweet, citrus, salty but not  smell the roasted chicken he so loved.
I believe that it changed our intimacy as well since we all send out signals to one another - odours, aromas, scents, the chemicals of love.  Our relationship certainly changed.
I hope the medical sleuths can find out what's going on for all of our benefit. Be well!"
2021-01-03 18:32,"Another reason for all of us to follow as stricly as we can the guidelines that stop the spread of Covid-19. 

I have no doubt that what these people are describing is serious and life-changing, and they have my deep sympathy and best wishes for eventual full recovery."
2021-01-03 18:43,"On a higher note, due to COVID I lost my sense of smell in March as part of being sick for two weeks, but it finally returned in August.  And since I love to bake, one of the more disappointing setbacks was being able to smell fresh breads, pastries, and cakes."
2021-01-03 18:44,I got tested for Covid when I couldn't smell or taste. Only symptoms I've had. They put me on the Covid floor for 5 days. It went away. It comes back now and then but only for a day. I can't imagine how frustrating this is would be to have long term.
2021-01-03 18:53,"Two years ago I had a bad cold that resulted in anosmia. I sought medical attention but there was nothing for it. My sense of taste and smell would return or it wouldn't. It hasn't. I rely on my wife's sense for warning of danger. But, for many years now I have practiced accepting things I cannot change. I will not indulge in self pity over this. I will not torture myself with ""why"" questions.  I'll do the best I can with what I've got. I'm going to enjoy this my only life."
2021-01-03 18:55,"If you can taste, but not smell, it might be a good time to see what Durian tastes like."
2021-01-03 19:02,"Taste and smell are linked.  This happened to me about fifteen years ago after a very bad virus.  I’ll never forget the look on the ENT’s face when he told me there was little to do except wait.  The loss persisted for about six months and I was truly devastated.  I would snuggle up to my husband and could not smell his familiar smell.  Meals became fraught, as I was reminded over and over about what I had lost.  I didn’t feel fully in my body; I felt cut off from the world.  I felt like I was walking around in an altered state.  It got so that I longed to smell bus exhaust.  I was incredibly depressed.  

One day I tasted lemongrass in a Vietnamese soup in a restaurant and I started crying.  I was so overjoyed.  Slowly, I began to taste and smell more and more.  I was filled with gratitude.  

We must not minimize what this loss means to people.  Everyone is different, but for me the loss was acute and life-altering.  I wish nothing but the best for those affected this way by Covid.  Having been there, I know the sadness.  Even more reason for my anger at those people who endanger others by refusing to mask up and observe protocols.  You might get a “mild” case but the people you infect may end up with life-long, devastating losses."
2021-01-03 19:04,"In 2018, I developed anosmia (absence of smell and taste), which after six weeks morphed into parosmia (distortion of smell and taste), which lasted for approximately nine months. Experts said it was the result of a virus, probably a coronavirus, though obviously not COVID-19. I soon learned that there was no cure or treatment available, and it was unknown if or when it would ever end. It was absolutely horrible. All odors smelled and all food tasted like raw sewage. I lost weight and the quality of my life suffered tremendously.  I could not stand going into restaurants because of the smells. Eating often caused gagging. One expert advised me that, if the olfactory receptor neurons were to ever repair themselves, I would probably regain my normal sense of smell and taste very suddenly. He was right. I literally woke up one day and my taste and smell had improved about 75%. I was able to mostly eat normal foods again. That was two years ago. Since then, my sense of smell and taste has improved even more, and I'm at about 90% of normal. I have great empathy for people who are suffering from anosmia. But if it’s any consolation, having zero sense of smell and taste was preferable to the horrific experience of parosmia, which transforms the joy of eating into a nightmare.  And, eventually, the body does heal itself. It will get better."
2021-01-03 19:06,"Totally lost both taste and smell and the hearing in my right ear when I fractured my skull 53 years ago. They’re gone. 
Food, and the experience with food, started rocky during the first months after the skull fracture; I ate too much hoping something/anything would ‘register;’ it didn’t. But realized some response - like bitter, sweet, salt - were on my tongue. Although for 53 years, I haven’t smelled or ‘tasted’ what everyone else does, food can be enjoyable by texture, warmth, ‘sweetness,’ crunchiness, or even a bit of sour or bitter. The last thing I consider is ‘I’m handicapped;’ but every room I enter smells the same, whether I’m in a bakery or dog kennel, every plate of food smells exactly the same - zero. But the smoothness of a bit of pate is delightful. Or one piece of chocolate; three pieces of chocolate is a ‘sweet overload.’ I can’t taste wine, beer, soda, juice, coffee, tea... but a warm cup of very milky coffee starts my day. A nudge. Salty food can easily be overwhelming; well-smoked salmon is pleasant, poorly smoked fish blasts ‘salt’ that is inedible. Chicken thighs are ‘sweeter’ than the usual breast meat. 
Life is playing the hand we are dealt; enjoying what we can and not blubbering about ‘loss.’ That said, I have to pay strict attention to ‘sell-by’ and ‘use-by’ dates... they are there for a reason."
2021-01-03 19:09,"I had a mild case of Covid in April and lost my sense of smell completely for several weeks. It returned, slowly."
2021-01-03 19:15,"A great anti-inflammatory I take is Sulforaphane. I just hope it can help with anosmia. Early on, I noticed positive mentions of its being given to severe covid cases in other countries.

I take it in capsule form. It's helped me feel less sore, and generally feel better overall; I wake up feeling like I got an extra hour of sleep."
2021-01-03 19:26,I lost my smell due to a nasal spray in 2008.   I was initially told the Anosmia was permanent.  I went to a taste and smell specialist MD in Washington DC and after several months of treatment my sense of taste and taste returned.  Mick O’Hare of New Scientist magazine also lost his taste and smell and has written some informative articles on this malady and its medical treatment.
2021-01-03 19:31,"My sense of smell and taste diminished slightly when I had COVID-lite in October of 2020.  But since then, smell and taste are better than pre-infection.  I’d say this type of thing, not loss but CHANGE, could be explored."
2021-01-03 19:50,"I lost my sense of smell after brain surgery in 2003. At first it was awful. I ate my favorite foods,but without taste,it was awful. You get used to it. I haven't wasted away,and though I miss flavors, I've adjusted. Texture is more important to me. Soup is like eating hot water. Life goes on. Do I miss my sense of smell? Yes, but I never lost weight. I would love  to smell the ocean,and pine trees,and flowers. Do I miss noxious odors, no!"
2021-01-03 20:00,"My olfactory loss from Covid last March waxes and wanes, some days are pretty good. Yesterday walking the dogs on the snowy woods was gratifying; I could smell the wet tree bark and pine needles and it was heaven. So I have regained a lot of it. I have had several instances of parosmia, where I smelled ammonia or an odor of stale urine, and one day a hard-boiled egg tasted like gasoline. So strange!
Fortunately (or not) I can still taste things like chocolate, which my expanding waistline is a testament to."
2021-01-03 17:52,"I permanently lost my sense of smell this past summer due to sinus cancer. Now, I’ve lost my sense of taste due to radiation therapy. 

I have been depressed and grieving ever since and not sure how I’ll come to terms with it. For those who say “it’s no big deal” I believe that you never found joy in things like the smell of a desert thunderstorm or enjoyed the nuanced flavors in food and drink....Those are permanent losses for me and I am gutted. Life may become rich in other ways but I will always grieve this loss."
2021-01-03 17:09,"So much of life's enjoyment is connected to smell and taste: the bloom of daphne in February that heralds hope for Spring, the smell of morning coffee brewing, calling you out of bed; the Frito scent of a dog's paws, the richness of a ripe mango or the complex flavors of a favorite wine. All these evoke memory and compel connection with our world and with others. My mother lost lost her sense of smell and taste in the early stages of Alzheimers:  only an appreciation of tart/sour flavors remained. That the loss of smell and taste is associated with depression is not surprising. This is a serious complication wrought by COVID in some individuals and should be considered as such."
2021-01-03 18:16,"My husband lost his sense of smell and taste after chemotherapy 3 years ago. It has not come back and he is limited to perceiving sweet, sour and heat but no taste when eating. He is a man who has always lived to eat and in theory he should be devastated by this loss. But he still enjoys his meals with such gusto and appreciation that I constantly forget his loss. My mother, on the other hand, who lost most of her ability to taste food due to old age, was miserable at mealtimes and raged against the loss. Glass half full or half empty seems to be a huge factor in how loss is dealt with."
2021-01-03 18:05,I am not sure this would help but it seems that quite possible that that Covid attacks nerves. Years ago my had with burning mouth syndrome. It is caused by neuropathological pain to the nerves of the tongue. All the docs in the world were of no use. Then I found R lipoid acid as a possible treatment because it heals damaged nerves. She could taste but always had this sense of her tongue being burned. And it was made worse by eating food. After a few weeks on R Lipoic acid it was completely healed.
2021-01-03 18:13,I would advise anyone who uses a gas cooking range / stove that loses their sense of smell replace it with an electric range.

2021-01-03 19:23,"I know a couple in which the male has had no sense of taste for his whole life.  His wife, has no sense of smell.  When they cook in the kitchen, they help each other cook.  They are in their 60's. They have had a long marriage, going on 30 years. The stories they tell are amazing.
Maybe what's key is the fact that they have each other to double check what the other lacks.  Social networks are very important for survival.  I feel terrible for those who don't have it. Loneliness is depressing, and puts you at risk of suicide.
My heart goes out to these people. I'm sending them a virtual hug."
2021-01-03 18:49,"Hi I'm a 31 year old single mom. I contracted Covid Aug 13 2020. As of today Jan 3, 2021, I cannot smell. I work as a Nursing Assistant in a nursing home. My work has a variety of smells most unpleasant. I can't not smell anything. I have been doing my own smell training with my essential oils. I can smell mint, sometimes. Now anything that has mint in it I can only smell the mint. For example, my coworker gave me some lotion from bath and body works. I can't remember the name but I ""smelled"" my hands and I could smell mint. She said it didn't have any mint in the ingredients sometimes in the shower I think I smell my shampoo for a second but then it's gone. 😣😣 it's also affecting my food. I have suspected that I can't taste some foods. What I do taste isn't as strong as it once was. I can eat spicy foods and they don't bother me at all. I am worried I'll never be the same. 😭"
2021-01-03 19:16,"I had COVID last January, before anyone had heard of it. There was a strange flu cluster at the ski resort I was visiting: people ill with flu symptoms who tested negative for flu. 

First I had the red toe thing. Then I had fatigue. Unmotivated to cook, I ordered nachos.

I was shocked when the nachos turned out to be tasteless. How can anyone make a plate of nachos with ZERO flavor or even smell?

Incensed, tired, cranky, and ignorant, I called the restaurant delivery service. The manager was sick, working with a 102 degree fever. We both cried a little and she refunded my nacho money.

Now I feel horrible, because nobody was guilty of selling tasteless nachos. It was COVID.

My smell came back a week later when I realized the condo had a stale odor and I opened the balcony door and smelled the clean, pine-scented outdoors. 

Hope I never get that again. I hope scientists will have an answer here soon."
2021-01-03 18:43,"I lost my sense of smell 14 years ago after fracturing my skull in a fall.  When I finally realized it after a couple days when my head felt like a giant street puppet throbbing and dizzy, the neurologist said  - your sense of smell will never return, your olfactory nerves have been shattered.  When I started to cry he told me to snap out of it and be thankful I'm still alive, because many don't survive this type of fall.  
The phantom smells that occur are really weird but happen as you heal.  But those  are temporary.
I still can't smell, but I can taste sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami.  If anything I'm a more adventurous eater and a better cook.  Texture is really important and remember how wonderful things smell and certainly don't miss bad ones.

I appreciate the wondrous variety of everything available we can prepare or eat.  I do ask fellow shoppers to smell a cantelope for me if it has the sweet smell - Precovid of course!  
I remember how everything smelled. Especially my husbands neck a couple inches under his right earlobe.
A sandalwood bead necklace that belonged to my mother.
That weird water buffalo smell of sandals when you broke them in.  Rain on a hot sidewalk.  Brewing. Coffee."
2021-01-03 19:27,"i think one of the biggest mistakes authorities have made during the pandemic has been the failure to educate the masses on the non-fatal dangers of the virus. If one reads the NYT and/or invests time to stay informed the information is available, but that is hardly enough. Older people die from Covid much more than most others, but my guess is the majority of people who have lost their sense of smell from Covid have been younger people, for they usually survive their infections. I'm 59 years old, and had Covid, and thankfully survived it with no side effects as far as I can tell. But even if I had lost my sense of smell, it wouldn't be nearly as tragic as that happening to someone much younger. I can only imagine the rage some may feel at our soon-to-be ex-President and his sycophants who spent the last year downplaying the dangers of Covid. It reminds me of the commercials for cars on television which depict reckless driving, even highlighting speedometers approaching 100 mph, cloaked in messages extolling freedom and the spirit of adventure. The commercials never show the millions of people who lose a leg, a finger, or an eye in car accidents each year. This may be a country which revels in it's spirit of free will--or a country that drowns in it's idiocy, depending on one's perspective. To me, it's obvious that the tragedy that was Trump will haunt us for decades."
2021-01-03 20:19,"Lost my sense of smell over twenty years ago.  I’ve got just the tongue tastes, more or less.  The tongue is the base for taste, the nose provides the rich over tones that make eating so particularly pleasurable.  My sweet wife cooks meals that highlight the physical properties of food, such as texture and temperature, as well as more ethereal info provided by way of nasal packages.  So, a drag.
Also a drag, doctors have blown off my situation for years.  Absolutely none of them were interested.  It’s good to see this condition finally get some press.
There has been an upside to all this, for me me at least. I’m a hospital physical therapist, and have been a member of the wound care team. Smells that nauseated even the most experience nurse were nothing to me!"

2021-01-03 18:03,Lost sense of smell? Welcome to my world. I cannot even smell a skunk. Or a flower. It is unfortunate but you deal with it and move on.
2021-01-03 19:21,"Wear that mask, stay out crowds, distancing, isolate when possible or, this could happen to You."
2021-01-03 19:41,"In February of 2019 I suffered through a particularly terrible flu. When I recovered, I realized I had 100 percent of my sense of smell and taste (taste relies largely on smell, so I see them as one sense). This condition lasted through the rest of the year (it began to improve, slowly, in December). At one point, my neurologist performed an impromptu scent test and was blown away by my inability to get even a hint of scent from really stinky items he jammed right under my nose.

After about ten months of sensing nothing having to do with taste or smell, I began to be able to discern sweetness. I assume that my taste buds began to recover before my sense of smell. Taste buds that detect sweetness occupy a large part of your tongue’s surface. The ability to taste salt came a few months later. Sour came even later. My sense of smell did not begin to return — slowly — until maybe 18 months after the illness. Now, almost two years on, I have regained almost all of my smell/taste sense. Emphasis on almost. Some things still smell oddly wrong to me, and I no longer have the super sensitive nose I once had. I am grateful my sense of smell returned, though. Tasting and smelling food is nice. Being able to smell smoke or a gas leak is critical. 

There is some evidence that doing a scent training regime helps to rewire your brain after this kind of injury. I did it. I think it helped:

2021-01-03 20:13,"In the fast food part of America, losing your sense of taste and smell will likely go unnoticed.  In another example, smokers lose their sense of taste and smell yet they still keep smoking."
2021-01-03 19:38,"Parosmia is maddening. I smell tobacco smoke and I am a never smoker. I always thought someone was sneaking a cigarette but when I smelled it during a trans Atlantic flight, I knew something was wrong. It diminished over several years so hopefully Covid patients will get some relief eventually."
2021-01-03 20:32,"I lost my sense of smell and taste 27 years ago due to an accident; it grew back but took a number of years. One must grieve the loss, and it is dangerous not to be able to smell chemical spills, dead mice, or other triggers. Mine grew back in stages. After 2 months I could taste butter and chocolate (not so good for weight), then chicken. I could taste beef after 6 months, but then not consistently for 8 years. Although this might sound odd, it helps to tell yourself what things are supposed to smell and taste like, to retrain the brain."
2021-01-03 20:17,"I just heard from someone who works in the field of naturopathy, that Artemisia might be helpful with loss of smell and taste.
If you are interested in trying, just make sure it is not artemisinin, which is only the effective ingredient but not the whole plant.
Using Artemisia (=whole plant) has the advantage of making it less likely for you to get resistant to the effective ingredient artemisinin (which is a very important medication for malaria)."
2021-01-03 16:37,"The article assumes Covid 19 causes loss of smell without citing evidence. If there is no scientific evidence, say so. If there is, cite it and tell us what that evidence says about the prevalence? Is the long term effect incredibly rare or a common result?  (A “study” of self reported Facebook group comments is not evidence of causation just because it’s analyzed by scientists.) The lack of reporting on these fundamental points makes the article unhelpful at best and potentially misleading."
2021-01-03 16:40,"Not to make lite of the situation, but a coworker of mine usually pours so much parfumerie on, it might be beneficial to smell her less."
2021-01-03 20:44,"I had Covid in March. I lost my sense of smell and taste almost immediately. They were gone for months, well after I had recovered. They slowly started to come back, about when my energy returned to almost normal, some time in May. Then in July or August, things suddenly tasted weird. Coke had a smokey, gasoline-like aftertaste. Big macs tasted and smelled like they'd been drenched with perfume. Coffee and sauteed onions smelled and tasted like garbage. At first I didn't understand what was going on. I bought a new coffee maker, threw out the bad onions and coffee. Switched to rootbeer. My husband didn't smell or taste anything off, however. I finally realized it was more of the Covid gift that keeps on giving. For anyone going through this now, I am much better now, though I do not smell or taste as well as I once did."
2021-01-03 20:59,"I lost my sense of taste and smell about 30 yrs ago after taking medicine,Z pack for a flu like symptom. I miss the taste and smell, but I've gotten so that I can live with it. Takes a while for your body to learn to instead use the mouth feel and other things that make it livable.
Now I can get along fine. I eat healthier. and since everything tastes the same, (more or less) am now a vegetarian."
2021-01-03 21:01,"I recall the “ aroma of fear” (a mixture of disinfectant and chalk dust) when being summoned to the Principal’s off in High School. That lingering aroma memory will stay with me forever.  On a positive note, if one has a significant other who is lacking in cooking skills, the lack of taste/smell may be a blessing."
2021-01-03 21:11,"I had the opposite smell/taste reaction during my bout with Covid. It increased dramatically (to the point everything tasted bad, even things I had loved in the past so couldn't bear to eat.) Fortunately, it has subsided somewhat. Indeed, that change in smell/taste led me to get tested for Covid when my other symptoms were just a little ""off."" Even though it's not mentioned in the literature I'm sure I'm not the only person who has had this experience. My suggestion: any change, get tested."
2021-01-03 21:16,"I had Covid in early March 2020 shortly before shutdown. My symptoms were relatively mild. I have type 1 diabetes so my biggest concern was extremely high blood sugar while I was sick. 

I noticed loss of smell and taste once I started to recover. It’s been nearly 10 months and I haven’t fully recovered either sense. 

I couldn’t get a Covid test when I was sick since I didn’t meet the testing criteria at the time. I got an antibody test in May. Positive. I’ve had positive antibody tests in October and December too. 

Is my long-haul anosmia linked to my antibodies? For now, I tell myself that I’ll accept the trade off: my sense of smell and taste for protection from Covid. 

I’m a foodie and love to cook, bake and garden. I miss so many scents and flavors. For those who dismiss the loss of smell and taste as no big deal, it does have a big impact on quality of life. I’m grateful that I survived Covid. I hope that I’ll recover fully soon."
2021-01-03 21:18,"I lost my sense of taste for two months.  Everything tasted like when the soda in a restaurant soda dispenser goes flat.  I kept eating even though it  was hard.  It did eventually return ok.  I had three Covid tests but, they were all negative- even with additional Covid symptoms."
2021-01-03 21:33,"Obviously this is a strange and disconcerting symptom of the virus.  But I think The Times does a disservice when it offers absolutely no estimate as to how many of the infected, first, experience this symptom at all and, second, what percentage of those who do suffer from this symptom experience it for more than a month or two.  One person I know had the loss of smell/taste for 3 days and was quite happy that was his only symptom.

More significantly, though, is the statement in the article that even if only 10% of the infected suffer from this symptom, millions would be affected.  That certainly suggests, without any backup evidence, that 10% would suffer from the symptom and, more critically, that a fair number would suffer from it for quite some time so as to be significantly and negatively impacted.

Sadly, I've found that the MS media coverage of this disease is often free from context, comparisons, minority opinions or analysis of the unintended consequences of the actions we do take to mitigate the spread."
2021-01-03 21:45,"In April of 2017 I had a virus (never identified) that caused loss of my senses of smell and taste. I had almost every symptom associated with Covid, a vicious cough, fever, weakness, weird dreams, fatigue, leg pains etc. but no pneumonia, and covid-19 did not exist at that time.
Now I can"" almost"" smell things, but the sensation is vague. I used to enjoy cooking, but it is difficult to feel confident when tasting does not verify that the desired blend of flavors has been achieved.
I can still enjoy eating ice cream, candy and salty foods, but many scents are gone forever. 
My advice to those like afflicted is to focus on textures. Spongy banana bread, crunchy parmesan crackers, cheeses, and tender steaks can still be enjoyed. And flavors, or more accurately hints of flavors, seem more detectable on one day than the next. 
So, don't get discouraged. You have the advantage of knowing this loss is a possibility with Covid, and seek help promptly. Keep tasting, keep sniffing, keep trying. Smelling spices upon opening when the smells are the strongest, before they are added to a dish, helps me continue to make tasty meals, or so says my family. 
But don't trust your taste of sugar or salt. Err on the side of too little and let those consuming add to drinks and dishes if they desire."
2021-01-03 22:06,Have there been studies on the impact of COVID on the facial nerve? Years back I had Bell’s Palsy as a result of an infection that inflamed my facial nerve. One result of this was loss of smell and taste. Luckily I was diagnosed early at UPMC’s Bell’s Palsy Clinic and treated with steroids. This relieved the palsy and my sense of smell an taste returned.
2021-01-03 22:08,"My wife with profound food allergies that has rendered her unable to eat most foods got Covid and lost her sense of taste and smell. Some has returned but she still cannot experience food as she did before 
But this has not really caused much distress or undermined either her pleasure in life or social connections. She had already redefined her relationship with food due to her allergies. She has found a way to enjoy life without food at the centre. Like most people in the world she eats the same food all day everyday. 
Maybe this is an opportunity for some to rediscover a rich life that does not centre around what we ate, what we are eating and what we are going to eat."
2021-01-03 22:10,I always took the sense of smell and taste for granted. Now I have few more thing to be grateful for.
2021-01-03 22:11,"I was given the gift of anosmia after a nasty sinus infection and was devastated. I would wake up in the middle of the night thinking I smelled natural gas in the kitchen. At first I ate very little, slowly learning to live with the disappointment and blandness of food. Periodically burning wood was a scent I experienced and it came out of nowhere. Over the years some tastes and smells have returned. The hardest part is eating and afterwards wondering, if I really tasted the food or am I living off my memory of the taste ? However, reading that doctors worry about the mental & physical health of anosmic patients is, to me, a bit over dramatic. Yes anosmia is a bitter pill to swallow but those of us afflicted with it have accepted, coped and continue to move through life."
2021-01-03 21:07,"imagine my surprise while in the middle of reading this article an ad appears for something that appears to be a drink, with the tagline ""unlock your palate! have you discovered a new taste recently"". Since I was unable to report the ad, I thought I'd just drop a comment about how completely clueless, nay heartless this is."
2021-01-03 21:49,"My bout with COVID-19, back in April, left me with the most ridiculous of ""scars."" After I had regained my hearing, the sound of crinkling cellophane became nearly unbearable.

2021-01-03 21:43,"I had these symptoms for almost 6 months, I couldn't smell or taste anything, I didn't have appetite at all, it was a torture. Back then, I was very scared that these symptoms will remain, bur right now it got better, but not completely. I was curios if somebody else had the same problem."
2021-01-03 22:07,"I lost my sense of smell about 5 years ago. Before that, I could smell faint odours those around me could not. I do miss some things (fresh ground coffee beans), and I have left the stove gas on once. I need to pay close attention to best-before dates on food. But really, there are far worse things that can happen to you. Which of the other 4 senses would you be willing to trade to get your smell back? Or perhaps a limb? How about pretty much any other physical ailment like chronic back pain, or severe arthritis? I thought so. It's not a huge deal. Look around, there are plenty of people with far worse problems than lack of smell who get on with life regardless. The most surprising thing Covid 19 has revealed is how fragile and weak-willed some people are. How easy our generation(s) have had it. People today would lose it completely if they had to endure some of the hardships that pretty much every generation prior to baby boomers went through. How'd you like to go to a dentist back before local anesthetic had been invented?"
2021-01-03 22:51,"It may be that the only “upside” to the collective Coronavirus experience will be the medical/psychological/sociological insights and advances that derive from this vast “cohort study.”  Hope so, anyway.

If only researchers could figure out how to turn the olfactory off and on, at will... *sigh*"
2021-01-03 23:05,I lost my sense of taste and smell more than 10 years ago. My doctors always use chemotherapy as the cause. I took chemo 18 years ago. 5 years ago I begin having phantom smells. Haven't had covid but can attest to losing these senses is very difficult.  This article is interesting and if there are answers out there please share.
2021-01-03 23:13,"A number of decades ago influenze resulted in temporary loss of saliva. As I began eating a slice of (quite moist) pizza which smelled wonderful, I could hardly finish it due to the lack of saliva. Make no mistake about it: the inability to enjoy what you eat is a tragedy."
2021-01-03 23:20,"My heart goes out to Covid-19 survivors who experience anosmia, as decades ago, I had radiation treatment to my head as a result of a cancer diagnosis, which resulted in anosmia for three months. 
This loss of smell and taste left me feeling, as one COVID-19 survivor stated ""discombobulated.""
I experienced tremendous weight loss, as I could barely tolerate food in general and a strange sense of complete detachment from the world around me. 
Fortunately, the anosmia lasted but three months, but it was a harrowing experience that I still remember quite vividly, because this lack robbed me of so much for the time I had it.
Moreover, otolaryngologists might just hold the key to unlocking the ongoing side effects of anosmia in COVID-19 survivors, as these cancer specialists work closely with head and neck cancer patients who develop anosmia as a result of post-surgical treatment. 
COVID-19 attacks virtually every organ in the body, so follow protocol and stay safe."
2021-01-03 23:52,I recently recovered from Covid over the holidays and had lost my smell and taste also. I started taking zinc and vitamin d supplements. Within days I started to regain both senses. Now I am back to almost 100%. I will continue taking knowing that for me it is working.
2021-01-04 0:42,One thing that is not being talked about is what other types of nerve damage are caused by Covid-19? The loss of sense (olfactory nerve) is readily noticeable but other types of nerve damage may not be so obvious. It is fair to assume the never damage caused by this virus is extensive. There needs to be systematic research into that while we have patients to study.
2021-01-04 0:46,"I too have lost my sense of taste and smell, since testing positive w/Covid last week. It’s quite unnerving. I seem to gravitate to foods that have some sort of substance, the first few days eating a hard boiled egg to gain some protein. But as time goes on, nothing at all feels substantive to eat. I’m hoping that in due time, I’ll get them back, of course. It’s not good."
2021-01-03 22:53,"To this toxicologist, the progression of sensory dysfunction reported by COVID-19 survivors from first suddenly losing, and then gradually recovering sharper but distorted senses is similar to that seen in cases of carbon monoxde (CO) poisoning.

The CO in COVID-19 is not inhaled, of course, but made naturally from the breakdown of heme proteins by heme oxygenase-1, the Universal Stress Enzyme, which  also releases equal parts of bilirubin and ferritin, all of which are reported higher than normal in COVID-19 patients in ICU, and highest just before death.

Both this CO we make and the CO we inhale modulate all our senses, acting as a  gasotransmitter that dulls our senses (like an anesthetic) when CO is rising and sharpens them when CO is falling.

Those who have lost their sense and/or taste probably still have higher than normal CO levels in their nose, mouth and throat.  This leaves a tell tale bright red color when high, similar to that  seen in COVID-19 toes, and red rashes on face and chest.  

They also will have more CO coming out of their tissues than going in, marked by a chroncially low waking temperature and venous CO greater than arterial CO.   This is the opposite of healthy normal people (unless you are pregnant or premenstrual). 

Good news for those trying to get their senses back: you can quickly reduce your HO-1/CO production by taking a daily zinc supplement, the only compound approved by FDA for coronavirus treatment before COVID-19."
2021-01-04 0:19,"I was born without the sense of smell, in fact, thanks to COVID,  I was able to write about it and other patients stories. For the ones who are struggling with the loss of smell check out my book on Amazon: <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BDYYMD9/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_20L8FbQP64E1G?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1"" target=""_blank"">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BDYYMD9/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_20L8FbQP64E1G?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1</a>
There is a lot more to the absence of smell than food. This was my first book and my writing style is different,  but it's easy to read, just grab a Kleenex."
2021-01-03 23:21,"For the love of Pete, just take Zinc.  If you can't smell you are Zinc deficient. The virus displaces Iron from your red blood cells when it attaches to them and replicates. Free floating Iron in your body is bad and highly toxic. So your body releases Zinc from your bones to bond with the Iron and evacuate it via waste. The problem with this Virus is that it replicates so fast that your body usually runs out of Zinc before your immune system can eradicate the Virus.  A key point to make here is Zinc is a key building block for white blood cells Along with Vitamin C & D (that's your immune system), but your body is prioritizing Iron poisoning over immune system manufacturing for obvious reasons.  Your sense of Taste and Smell rely on Zinc to function also (odd that the article made no mention of this).  This is why an early loss of smell or taste is a warning sign to boost your Zinc levels and give your body a much needed mineral to do it's job.  A word of caution: you CAN get too much Zinc and suffer Zinc toxicity, you will know when you start getting too much Zinc, everything will begin to have a metal type taste.  That is when you stop taking the Zinc, or you can just stop once you get your FULL sense of taste and smell back."
2021-01-03 23:35,"This is just the tip of the iceberg. I fear down the road there will be more issues that emerge for people who have had Covid, especially those infected with a heavy viral load. This is why it is so ridiculous for people to not take precautions such as wearing a mask and socially distancing. Even people who have previously been infect or may  be asymptomatic should take precautions to continue reducing their viral load. In the future I think that will be a key factor.

When I first started hearing about the symptoms associated with Covid it reminded me of how Multiple Sclerosis works and some researchers have noticed the same things.  The sensory deprivations, such as loss of taste,  that come and go are common in MS. Sometimes mild symptoms or no noticeable symptoms can be a time when MS is doing its most damage. In fact some of us feel our best just before an attack. So being asymptomatic when testing positive for Covid is not an automatic pass. There could be hidden dangers.

Hopefully they will all have their sense of smell and taste return but if it is anything like MS it  take can months or years and can suddenly return out of the blue. I hope that is what happens to them. In the meantime more people need to be aware of the potential for long term damage from Covid and take  precautions seriously.

2021-01-03 22:50,Why is potential dementia (Alzheimer's) not mentioned in this article about the loss of taste or smell? it's a standard marker unrelated to Covid-19 but still worth reporting somewhere in the report.
2021-01-04 1:02,Someone close to me lost her sense of smell and taste a few months prior to developing Alzheimers. I wonder if this association/connection is more than coincidence and could be a clue to understanding one or both of these awful and debilitating illnesses.
2021-01-04 1:02,"I lost mine as well, but not completely.

I noticed that the fabric softener did not smell quite right. My beer was a bit off and the OJ tasted like the industrial ""from concentrate"" Sysco stuff you got in the school cafeteria.

It was only after my wife brought up a soap and had me sniff it to ""smell the coconut"" that the link was made. I could not smell it, but it smelled very similar to the fabric softener I was thinking was off.

Strong smells still come through. Garlic, Basil, hot peppers. But I found I cannot smell gas. Even my bodily functions do not smell right. I though it was some digestive problem until I noticed it smelled the same no matter what I ate or drank.

The final test was licking soap. Three different varieties and it just tasted a little salty.

Some of it has come back in the 9 months since I have had it, but it still is not 100%.

Combine THAT with the occasional mental disconnect and this CV-19 is a regular Sneaky Pete."
2021-01-04 3:15,"Though I landed up in a hospital with only burning eyes and not much else as a symptom of Covid-19, by the third day, the already-bad coffee tasted like dishwater. The aroma quotient was zero. The only thing I could smell was the alcohol (and no other fragrances that had been added to make the sanitiser friendly). Meals were thrust down my throat (by yours truly) hoping that this ordeal will end some day.

However, by day 11 of my 15-day stay, it all came back to me - intact. My sense of smell, which I am intensely proud of, is as good as new now, allowing me to identify coffee beans and roasts to a T. 

What I fear now is Long Covid and its potential effects."
2021-01-04 4:04,"I had an extremely depressing 2 weeks when I lost both my sense of taste and smell to COVID and my searches online pointed to chances of it never coming back. I could not even smell a whiff of intense perfume to my face. Food tasted like chewing dirt.

But thank heavens I got back roughly 40% of my pre-Covid smell and taste function in 4 weeks. I hope all of it comes back some day.

If you are going through this too, stay strong and don't lose hope."
2021-01-04 4:17,"I remember hearing an interview on a public radio science show about 12 years ago about how our sense of smell may be so subtle as to detect people we are more genetically compatible with in terms of having healthy offspring.  It's nothing conscious. I remember the interviewer saying, "" you mean within minutes of meeting someone your body can tell if your DNA is compatible?"" And the scientist corrected him by saying, ""Within seconds."".  It left a deep impression on me in terms of how our sense of smell might function beyond our conscious awareness."
2021-01-04 4:56,"I quite enjoyed the experience of losing my sense of smell and taste with Covid. I continued to eat well and appreciated the sight, temperature and consistency of food and liquids instead of their other qualities. Even if I couldn't taste I still had sugar cravings that were just as difficult to ignore. 
Not tasting and smelling became an easy comfort zone. When my taste started returning I almost freaked out, not wanting to have to taste the things I once loved because I knew they would be strong and I wasn't sure I would still like them."
2021-01-04 8:18,"The loss of smell and taste can be devastating.

2021-01-04 14:34,"Restaurateur Grant Achatz lost his sense of smell and taste after being treated for cancer of the tongue.  He didn’t passively accept it, but developed a progressive program of smelling and tasting spices and foods that allowed him to retrain his sensory apparatus to recognize and experience scents and flavors.  I believe others are using these techniques to recover their abilities."
2021-01-04 15:31,"Many years ago, before my raging allergic rhinitis was brought under control, I lost my sense of taste and smell. I had developed a nasal polyp as a result of sinus inflammation and irritation. Once the polyp was removed, the two senses returned. It was an extremely weird and unpleasant period of time. I was especially prone to anxiety about whether the food I was eating could be spoiled as I had no way to discern that unless it looked bad. I made my husband sample everything first. My sympathies to everyone who has experienced this loss and also hoping your senses will return."

2021-01-04 8:28,"This article had me feeling like I lived on a different planet.  

I feel for those experiencing this condition—it sounds terrible.  But I am not mystified by its cause.  This unnecessary suffering is the result of the failings of the mainstream healthcare system—a system that is the result of holding profit, not public health and well being, above all else.  Those in mainstream medicine are suffering from chronic nutritional ignorance.  Others of us who follow nutrition research from the last 40 years, as well as those of us who have seen this constellation of symptoms in our own families or ourselves recognize it for what it is: a lack of sense of smell together with depression and anxiety are classic symptoms of low zinc.  To paraphrase James Carville:  It’s the nutrition, stupid.

Studies such as this one point to the critical nature of zinc blood levels in fighting Covid:  <a href=""https://www.news-medical.net/news/20201012/Zinc-deficiency-linked-to-poor-COVID-19-outcomes.aspx"" target=""_blank"">https://www.news-medical.net/news/20201012/Zinc-deficiency-linked-to-poor-COVID-19-outcomes.aspx</a>.

People in the United States are dying by the tens of thousands.  Can we please break through the profit barrier and start adding some common sense nutritional solutions to our fight of this disease and its aftermath?

2021-01-04 11:55,"I was born with no sense of smell and I'm glad the condition is getting more attention these days. Growing up, doctors always brushed it off as no big deal. 

However I will say that my experience is very different than for people who lose their sense of smell later in life. Your brain normally interprets smell and taste together as one sensation, with the majority coming from smell. So when people lose that, they aren't used to it and food seems totally bland. But I have never had it so I think food tastes great, although I could never be a professional sommelier. 

And in fact I don't think my quality of life is reduced at all compared to other people. Sometimes I even feel like people who can smell are just a bunch of whiners who are super picky about everything. And they're always buying plastic junk so rooms can have ridiculous aromas like ""winter sparkle."" No thanks I'm glad I won't fall for that at least!"
2021-01-04 13:30,"Well, scientists should start studying CRPS, which often comes with sensory illusions like this -- feeling you are walking on broken glass, for instance. Or they might study synesthesia. Frankly I'm surprised this article didn't mention that."
2021-01-15 11:40,"This is a great relief, and cause for much hope. 

Kessler is a rockstar and experienced in getting things done in the government."
2021-01-15 11:51,I find it reassuring that  expertise and experience are the criteria for hiring in the new administration rather than political affiliation or loyalty to a politician.
2021-01-15 11:52,"Each day as we read about this new Administration's appointments it raises ones hopes another notch or two. Mr. Kessler is another experienced individual and adds more credibility to the Biden/Harris team.

I cannot way until January 20th!"
2021-01-15 11:53,"Kessler might be adept in the back room development but I can’t see how has prepared him to deal with this gargantuan distribution project.

Seems to me that Bezos would be the best man given his remarkable global distribution experience.

Biden again shows just how  he’s an old politician first and foremost. Most of his appointments coming from the Obama administration and we all know just how ineffective those 8 years were.

Empty suits prevail in the White House once again..."
2021-01-15 12:04,"How refreshing it is to actually see qualified, knowledgeable, intelligent, experienced and caring people appointed to critical leadership positions in this country.  What a novel approach to governing!"
2021-01-15 12:13,"""At some vaccination sites, long lines of elderly people have queued up for hours waiting for a vaccine; at others, a lack of willing recipients is forcing providers to offer the shots to random passers-by, before the doses expire.""

To spend so much time and money on creation of Covid vaccines, only to see them wasted or seniors having to wait in long lines--risking health and limb--is a travesty.  Thank God Biden and his team take over next Wednesday.

I admire Dr. Kessler, particularly regarding his relentless war on tobacco.  This piece fleshed out a ton more of his highly active career.  I can't think of a more qualified person for the job of ensuring these precious vaccines get where they're needed most.  His vast experience will serve him well as he seeks to inject order into a chaotic vaccine rollout, that has been, up to now, anything but orderly."
2021-01-15 12:15,"Finally, someone who knows the logistics, the bureaucracy, and the process to get things done, without making false promises (e.g., 20 million by the end of 2020)."
2021-01-15 12:16,"As an AIDS advocate for 25 years, I applaud the selection of Dr. Kessler to shepherd the EUA's and vaccine production. However, I am concerned that once again Pharmaceutical Companies are being handed a blank check as just as they were for HIV medications. Once again, private companies using Federal resources are about to reap a tremendous windfall on the back of American taxpayers. When is enough going to be enough. Please keep an eye on this and follow the money."
2021-01-15 12:16,"Does he have the experience to deal with the major distribution problems? Will he ensure that critical support is provided to state and local governments to facilitate an effective and orderly distribution of the vaccine? State and local government don’t seem to have the resources and capacity. 

Will the stimulus package address these issues also? Will he have the resources to make the needed improvements to address these issues?"
2021-01-15 12:17,Kessler will drive improvements. It won't be easy and it won't be perfect but things will improve. Great to see him on the public stage again.
2021-01-15 12:19,"Let's see how he does before applauding this appointment.  I hope he's competent and has a real impact. We will not recover until Covid-19 is tamed. 

Sadly, despite the remarkable Warp Speed development by Dr.Slaoui's vaccine development team leadership, the Trump administration program has failed to meet the most basic requirements for state and local level vaccine delivery."
2021-01-15 12:19,"Excellent.  Also, the best place to store Vaccine is in human bodies.  Much more can, and will, be manufactured.  My very elderly Parents are still waiting for Vaccination, isolated and very afraid.  Because Florida, and the Trump clone masquerading as Governor.
   Thanks Joe. I’m counting on you to save them.  The Husband and I can wait, but my Parents can’t. 
   Please hurry."
2021-01-15 12:21,"He resigned from boards that were in conflict of interest to his appointment. That says a lot. He fought against big tobacco. He has fought against aids. He has worked in other administrations. He has fought against monetary mismanagement at University of California and was a whistle blower. He was a chairman of Science in the Public Interest.
Now there is a novel idea that needs to be re-started. He is a good choice for many more reasons."
2021-01-15 12:26,"Working overseas for the UN for 30 years across all continents, one learns quickly that delivery challenges to millions are almost always wholly logistical/ supply chain/ communications and outreach related ones - not associated much with a medical background at all.  I hope the Perna / Kessler combo can rise to the urgent operational aspects of this distribution effort."
2021-01-15 12:28,"So glad that Kessler will be a formal part of this administration.  With a proven track record of getting things done in government, as well as the character to speak truth to power he is just what this country needs now."
2021-01-15 12:29,"In my quarter century working in biopharma companies on new product approvals, Kessler was the most effective and most principled FDA commissioner ever.  He will be fantastic in this new role. The grownups are back."
2021-01-15 12:30,"Dr.K is a great choice.
I had the privilege of working with him on a patient safety initiative (SHBWG) in the late '90s early 00's.  

There are few more principled, and fewer still who's passion for patient outcomes is a driving force throughout their entire careers.

Thank you, David, for stepping up to this monumental world defining task."
2021-01-15 12:38,A scientist and administrator with a stellar resume of achievements in science and administration is selected to lead an urgently needed national initiative based on science and logistics. How refreshing! How normal!
2021-01-15 12:58,"In the same way that a child needs active parental involvement even if the child is being taught by the world's smartest teachers, the vaccination effort will need active presidential involvement even if it is being run by the world's smartest doctors.  This is not to suggest that the involvement be heavy-handed or dictatorial, but enough so that the president is not content to be a captive of the experts, who learn to tell him only what he wants to hear.  I believe Joe Biden understands this."
2021-01-15 13:02,"An excellent choice however the problem is not a question of medicine or science at this point. The problem is totally logistics and the use of War Powers act to drive production. Both these areas were totally mismanaged by the prior administration for almost a year. I would like to see a specific plan from Dr. K. We can not put up with another bumper sticker  ""100million shots in 100 days"" or ""Operation Warp Speed"". Do the job and drop the rhetoric, Mr. President."
2021-01-15 13:02,"Listening to Biden’s excellent rescue plan last night and hearing about the appointment of Dr. Kessler to run Operation Warp Speed feels like a shot of dopamine. After 4 years of Trump, having a competent government that puts country first is almost too good to believe.

I know there’s a lot of trouble in River City (and everywhere) but there’s also hope. Five days to go."
2021-01-15 13:27,"I agree with rnrnry: Dr. Kessler is a great choice but the problems at this juncture are logistical, not scientific. We need to get the shots transported quickly, people need to be able to make an appointment easily, and there needs to be a waiting list available so people can come in and replace any no-shows."
2021-01-15 13:46,"I see people are worried about having a scientist leading the logistics. But you must remember that part of the failures of the past months have been from a lack of understanding of how the processes work - such as sending swabs to sites packed more than one to a pack instead of individually packaged and sterile which meant that they couldn't be used easily. He led the FDA, which mostly doesn't do science;  they mostly organize, document, approve and direct science. The FDA examines your work when you are developing drugs and tells you where the holes are and makes you fix them. Besides, a good leader doesn't make the little choices, he/she makes good decisions about the plan of action and choosing who should be given responsibility to make the operational choices."
2021-01-15 13:49,"Gee - Somebody with expertise and experience who believes in science leading a federal vaccine effort. What novel concept.

No offence to Dr. Slaoui - he was able to work with what he had and work around the Trump Administration. He is to be commended for that, and it's good news that he will continue to serve as a consultant."
2021-01-15 13:52,Dr. Kessler is an impressive choice for a multitude of reasons. What a joy to see.
2021-01-15 13:54,Great news! I feel even more optimistic that the Biden administration will bring us through this dark period. Dr. Kessler is an excellent choice.
2021-01-15 14:00,"Competent people focused serving the people are key to sound processes and decisions. I only know Kessler by what I just read here, but it's easy to see already that he is a competent leader with the interests of the nation as his priority. Neither of those qualities were typical over the past four years. Let's give him a chance to bring experience, capability, and national interest to a problem that has been, so far, managed primarily for optics. It's so encouraging to have qualified people working for us again."
2021-01-15 14:40,"The distribution problem is not strictly a medical one, so those with medical backgrounds are only part of the process of finding solutions. The greatest problem is how eligible people know when it is their time to go for a shot. Logistics and coordination are key.

I happened to be in Paris some years ago and, with my highly imperfect French, turned on the evening news. It sounded like there was some strange mass evacuation from Paris and people were being told when they could leave. After a few minutes, remembering it was August, I realized that the ""evacuation"" was for the annual one month getaway religiously followed in France. It was carefully staged using license plate numbers to avoid massive traffic jams.

Some staging methods can work here, too. The formula needs to include age, days when one can go and locations, with knowledge of how many people (census data) in each age group live in the area.

We might fail in various tasks (all of us and the nation) but if we do fail, let's do it from a position of calling on the best, most experienced among us. Experience does not guarantee success, as is easily seen from world history, but total inexperience can be a quick route to disaster.

Dr. Kessler has been around the track multiple times. We need to combine his knowledge with creative ideas that bring solutions to the distribution problem. Nothing will work perfectly but trying new approaches, and the risk that involves, will soon enough get the job done."
2021-01-15 14:47,"Dr. Kessler versus four more years of the Trump administration and Scott Atlas's herd mentality. My mother just turned 90, stepdad's 93, and these two extroverts, who were still traveling the world, immersing in theater, museums, and socializing with a dwindling number of friends were starting to lose it mentally with the way things were going. It's not an overstatement to say that President Biden will add years to my mother's life."

2021-01-15 15:00,"The world has changed a lot since the 1990s. Hopefully, this new team will be able to tap into new tools of distribution and delivery into the arms of citizens. It may take a temporary shut down of Amazon’s trinket delivery, replacing it with emergency measures to deliver vaccine. Wal-Mart and drug store chains that are everywhere could be receivers and deliver the injections into the arms of the people in even remote locations in the US. The National Guard medical units have experience, also, with logistics of, for example, vaccinations of dogs for rabies in developing countries. Perhaps their skills can be used to accelerate delivery into human population in our own fragmented border-line third world country. It will not be easy, but it must be done, and quickly."
2021-01-15 15:15,"I noted Dr Kessler divested himself of stock that would be a conflict and doesn't own stock in vaccine or pharmaceutical companies.  What a breath of fresh air to have a competent and ethical person working for President Biden.  Now if we could get Congress to ban direct stock ownership for their members ( I work for a healthcare GPO and can't own stock, only mutual funds)."
2021-01-15 15:16,"Dr Kessler did a fine job as FDA chief, but after he was enthusiastically welcomed in to lead the faculty as Dean of Yale School of Medicine, he failed miserably within a few years. The faculty was delighted when he left town early. The people of the US all want him to succeed now and help us, but it’s been a while since his last victory, and the world has changed. I am skeptical about him, but I hope his performance proves my suspicions wrong."
2021-01-15 15:36,"To doubters re: rescuing lost souls on the Trump train- once the results from the new deeply experienced leadership (for Covid we have Kessler, Kerry, etc.) start to permeate all aspects society, it will be undeniable that ‘something’ is different. You can’t repeatedly tell people they’re wrong until they finally listen- you can however change hearts and minds once people feel differently about their day to day experience. Less vitriol, more healing- it will eventually be impossible escape much as it was impossible le for so many of us to find a moment of peace for the last 4 years."
2021-01-15 15:48,A lot of my stress has been because the national Covid effort has been nonexistent.  With every appointment Biden restores my faith in what a government can do.  We need the vaccine to be used and not thrown away as New York just went through.  Would every elected official please work together right now.  Thank you!
2021-01-15 15:53,"Tinkering with the timing of the second dose is scary. 
Potential problems are enormous, both in public health and public trust.
Please get the vaccine into as many willing arms as possible as fast as possible, but be certain that the second dose is available. It’s a two-part vaccine. Half isn’t good enough."
2021-01-15 15:54,"This is good news, an excellent choice. Dr. Kessler appears to have the record and the character for this job."
2021-01-15 15:55,"Last night I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine. I went to a pop-up clinic downtown, at a civic center. The clinic has been open for a couple of weeks; there was trouble, at first, with phones lines being overrun, so the organizers turned to using a ticketing system that was designed for entertainment events. Go to the website, order a ""ticket"" for a date and time, and you're in.  The entire experience, including the drive, took one hour.  Firefighters administered the vaccine. Plenty of volunteers were there, and one person who escorted me out had been at every clinic held at the center. There are good decisions being made, and the gears are turning. We just need more vaccine to move through the system. Local governments are definitely able to make sound decisions to insure the health of their citizens."
2021-01-15 12:20,At long last an adult will take over.
2021-01-15 12:51,"After the nightmare of the politicized ineptitude we've suffered this past year, it makes me teary with relief that from now on we are in the good hands of Dr. Kessler and Dr. Fauci."
2021-01-15 13:10,"Kessler will put some much-needed urgency into a coherent and nationwide program. I hope he changes the name of the operation, if only to eliminate the trumpian stench and separate their bungling from Kessler-led competence."
2021-01-15 13:40,"I will never forget the way this man proudly looked at a jury of poor black folks in Philadelphia and declared ""That's right!"" with a huge smile and thumbs up when the corporate defense attorney asked him if his hourly rate was actually a full thousand dollars per hour (it was), and if he actually got paid that piggish rate for every hour of his also paid-for first class flight from California to Philadelphia to testify (he did). Needless to say the jury had trouble believing, as I do, that this is a principled man who speaks truth to power. 

Kessler has been a hired gun and expert witness for the last 20+ years. He hasn't led a governmental institution or been interested in much besides his own enrichment and aggrandizement since before the impeachment of Bill Clinton. The most impressive thing about him is the level to which he has exploited his brief and long-ago public service for personal gain. One only hopes this is a purely figurehead appointment and that he won't be allowed anywhere near the actual logistical decisions."
2021-01-15 14:21,"Thank god - a straight shooter who calls and tells it like it is. He stood up to big tobacco and got help for AIDS patients at a time when few would dare to speak truth and work for change. Kessler is just what we need now, and I wish that we had 100 more like him."
2021-01-15 14:24,"Why is Perna being retrained.   He failed to address the last mile problem.  He is part of the problem, not part of the solution."
2021-01-15 15:54,"Finally somebody with the experience to tackle the intricacies of coronavirus, thus far disgracefully neglected by a deeply incompetent and ignominiously indifferent Trumpian mafia in government. To add to Dr. Kessler's value, he is divesting himself from all items that may give even the appearance of conflict of interest, a necessary step for his credibility as a science man whose only interest is people's well-being. What a contrast with Trump, a devious narcissist unwilling to divest himself from his multiple suspicious businesses, his only interest, even while president; Trump, persistent in his demagogy and a mantra of spewing 'fear, resentment and division'. So, welcome Dr. Kessler, and best of luck besides your expertise and dedication, you'll need it!"
2021-01-15 16:03,"Dr. Kessler is the perfect choice for the daunting challenge ahead. His appointment brings hope to what has seemed a hopeless situation under the non-leadership of the outgoing administration. But doesn’t he have a formal title? The journalist says he will “lead” and “head” the operation, but no specific title is mentioned in the article."
2021-01-15 16:16,"Reading Dr. Kessler's bio is like walking out into a meadow ... so much fresh air, so much blue sky. Just having Biden put competent people is place takes so much of the worry out of it all. This is what I've been missing for four years: simply quality people."
2021-01-15 11:55,A breath of Fresh Air is about to come to the ruling capital and world sense and wisdom belief and respect to institutions proper decorum and above all less headlines and tweets ! Welcome aboard
2021-01-15 11:59,"This is an inspired choice. With his vast experience in government and in medicine developing drugs, he has the skills and competence to accelerate the process of getting the vaccines distributed promptly to the public. He will be the perfect Dr. to make Operation Warp Speed live up to its name."
2021-01-15 12:11,"Well, hope is on the way.  

A proven, experienced, scientist to lead the way for Americans in the COVID pandemic.  Someone in association with Dr. Fauci.  

As a healthcare worker and all those other personal identities, this heart has yearned for stability, science, steadfastness for my fellow country men and women, to lead the way in our country’s combat with COVID.  

Finally, finally, with experience, compassion, and allegiance to Americans, that we are yearning to find in our next administration, beginning in about 120 hours,  we do have hope for our country.  There will be strategy and science so that we can look forward to actually leading lives again.  

Dr. Kessler, welcome aboard!"
2021-01-15 12:21,Great News!   An other experience professional will be working for us.
2021-01-15 12:26,"Biden's choice of Dr. Kessler makes sense, but can we also dissolve ""Operation Warp Speed"" and create a wholly new entity?

The fact is that Operation Warp Speed (with its classic Trumpian name) was and is a pathetic joke.  Big Pharma knows how to develop vaccines all on their own -- and as we know, Pfizer developed the very first Covid vaccine, in record time, without taking a nickel from the federal government.

Yes, there must be coordination between Big Pharma and the FDA and CDC, but we didn't need Operation Warp Speed for that to happen.  It was very helpful for federal money to be plopped into the hands of Moderna and other vaccine manufacturers, but we didn't need Operation Warp Speed for that.

What we needed was a president who used the DPA to ensure that the materials needed to create the vaccines were available from the supply chain, and to require private companies to manufacture essential items like N95 masks.  We didn't need Operation Warp Speed for that.

What we do need is a federal entity, filled with actual experts, to tackle all of the logistical problems associated with getting vaccines into arms.  This will require tremendous coordination between federal, state and local governments.

When I hear the name ""Operation Warp Speed"" my gag reflex kicks in, because the current entity represents so much of what was horrible about the Trump administration's ""handling"" of the coronavirus pandemic.  Operation Warp Speed belongs in the dumpster."
2021-01-15 12:30,Scientists in charge of science. Seems like it should be obvious....but after the last 4 years...
2021-01-15 12:32,This news makes me very happy.  Dr Kessler is very impressive and very experienced.
2021-01-15 12:37,Finally a professional taking the lead. Thank You Dr. Kessler!
2021-01-15 12:52,"Wow! What a great choice. And, a man with a sense of ethics as well how refreshing! I knew voting for Biden Harris was the right move."
2021-01-15 12:53,I always liked the sound of “Make America Sane Again “. Perhaps we’re on the verge of doing it.
2021-01-15 13:02,"Welcome, Dr. Kessler, a noted figure who was instrumental in helping the US and the world fight Big Tobacco and AIDS, an acronym that once was a deadly scourge running rampant through the gay population, but whose presence was made especially newsworthy when heterosexuals began dying, too. Thank God for scientists, who’ve been muted and ridiculed and dismissed for the past four years. And bravo to president-elect Joe Biden for faithfully executing every good leader’s first rule of success: always surround yourself with people smarter than you are."
2021-01-15 13:10,Resigning from all boards and divesting of stock in the companies.  What a unique idea to eliminate conflict of interests.  Maybe the corrupt current administration should have considered this?  Oh - I forgot - their idea was to pick a winner and then personally INVEST before announcing their choice!
2021-01-15 13:11,"It is amazing to learn each of decisions being made by the incoming administration are geared toward the hard work of dealing with the pandemic instead of wishful thinking, obfuscation, and outright mendacity of the current leader. I think I remember what this is called. Give me a minute. . . Ah! Leadership!"
2021-01-15 13:25,"As a former college prof, over the years I’ve introduced my students to Dr Kessler for his anti tobacco and food labeling initiatives. He’s an American hero. He should have received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from W Bush or Obama. Trump has debased that award with Jim Jordan, Devin Nunes, Adelson’s wife. Lou Holtz and a bunch of golfers."
2021-01-15 13:30,Great choice. The adults are back.
2021-01-15 14:07,What? An ETHICAL administrator? I forgot what they looked like. 5 days to go and we're already looking better.
2021-01-15 14:10,Brilliant choice - now get on with a new NIH Institute on Viral Diseases. We need more basic research immediately - other viruses may be around the corner.
2021-01-15 14:15,Not much to do. States are rapidly coming up to speed. Here in AZ phase 1A and 1B which include 75 + and first responders are well underway. You can get vaccinated 24/7.
2021-01-15 14:38,"I have mixed feelings on this one. On one hand, Dr. Kessler is very clearly qualified for the job. On the other hand, his ties to pharmaceutical companies is worrying. Let's just hope that he doesn't still hold loyalties for Big Pharma"
2021-01-15 14:38,"This is just the sort of appointment I hoped for, prayed for, following the shock and fear of the Trump years sycophanticism. David Kessler is a quiet, true superstar that is exactly what we need to quickly turn around the vaccinations and COVID-19 control.
This is a common good action!"
2021-01-15 14:39,"Can we please acknowledge: Democrats value government, Republicans don't. How do we know? Democrats choose competent and experienced folks to actually lead agencies. Republicans choose friends who seek to dismantle the very agencies they'll ""lead"". Yes, Republican's cynically choose folks who are inexperienced so when agencies fail voters think government is incompetent! Yes, it's a tactic."
2021-01-15 14:50,"The singlest important factor that will determine the success of the economy Under President Biden is how soon he can bring the pandemic to an end. I am delighted to see he has asked congress for large funds to control the spread of the Virus. 4000+ Americans are dying every day, ICU's are clogged and leading to delayed care for cancer and other patients. I would urge President Biden to go further like Germany is doing. They are funding an entire plant in partnership with BionTech and building capacity to supply Covid-19 vaccines. The vaccine efficacy is estimated to be 1 year and with the mutations happening this may be a problem that may persist. But we can control it if the US builds enough capacity of the best efficacy medicine. Either Moderna or Pfizer. J&J will be coming out with their results this month but they are having manufacturing problems and supply to US is going to be limited. In the $1900 billion package, some money should go towards building capacity for PPE and Vaccine manufacturing capacity to ensure an 8 year period of recovery and growth in the economy."
2021-01-15 14:51,The guy sounds like a mensch. I feel we’ll be in good hands. I look forward to having him at the helm.
2021-01-15 15:13,"Why does ""Operation Warp Speed"" still get credited with the speedy development of both the BionTech / Pfizer s well as with the Moderna vaccine? Did BionTech/Pfizer not refuse any financial & other help?

It may just be a sideshow for some, but as Trump prides himself with being the ""savior"" here - in my book it is not a sideshow. 
Rather the credit should go to the guys who deserve it: the men & women , who did the research and the hard work in bringing these vaccines within record time! The scientists , who - again - will save the world from this scorge, something that ""thoughts & prayers"" never achieve. And in the BionTech/Pfizer case - these scientists do so without any involvement of Project Warp Speed. 
(Anybody: correct me if I am wrong or miss something.)"
2021-01-15 15:16,"I would highly suggest renaming this vaccine initiative. ""Operation Warp Speed"" carries many negative connotations of incompetence, misinformation, and lack of preparedness."
2021-01-15 15:33,"One by one, competent people are replacing the unqualified corporate hacks Trump appointed to generate campaign contributions. A vaccine distribution plan should have been started more than a year ago, long before product was available. A central database, and a consistent presentation to the entire county could have been created as soon as it became evident COVID was not ""going to simply go away"" and Clorox wouldn't fix it. 

But Trump was never interested in serving the needs of the nation. In his deranged mind, the office of president was simply another revenue stream to be exploited, no matter the cost which has proven exorbitant.

I'm delighted to see the Biden transition but equally important is the prosecution of all Trump acolytes who contributed to the death of hundreds of thousands and the economic devastation inflicted to our country. McConnell, Graham, Cruz, Pence and a long list of unsavory characters need to answer for their crimes. By all means, eradicate the looters, but simultaneously, jail the guilty."
2021-01-15 15:34,"There Joe Biden goes again, appointing qualified and ethical experts at a time of national crisis. The nerve of him. What's next, actually caring about the well being of the American people?"
2021-01-15 15:43,"I know this guy.  An excellent choice, a fine partner for Dr. Fauci and best yet, pharma trembles when they hear his name!"
2021-01-15 12:15,"Thank God...a return to experienced, competent professionals running our federal agencies."
2021-01-15 13:38,can they please change the name? it's so previous administration
2021-01-15 11:39,Experience and knowledgeable people being chosen.
2021-01-15 11:42,"I certainly hope that along with getting America well, he will change the name of ""operation warpED speed."""

The issue is reliable delivery."
2021-01-15 12:25,"Delighted that Dr. David Kessler will be joining Operation Warp Speed as its Chief Science Officer.

Dr. Kessler’s presence will no doubt facilitate the rapid manufacture and delivery of COVID-19 treatments.

I am hopeful as well that the Biden administration will bring aboard additional logistics professionals to speed the smooth distribution of the vaccines."
2021-01-15 12:49,"He won't be at all acceptable to Republicans or conservatives:

2021-01-15 13:20,"Interesting that Biden keeps using the “go-to” pool of special people whose pot contains the same people who created our socioeconomic problems.    Isn’t there better talent in the country?  Just watch who Biden is reputed to have selected as the SEC chief. Janet Yellen comes in having made $u million in speeches in the last 2 yrs. to Wall Street.  On the day of the siege, the market went up 400 points.  Shame on Biden.  This isn’t Build back better, it’s delusion."
2021-01-15 13:40,Please please can we drop the ridiculous marketing title of Operation Warp Speed.  Clearly it failed the speed test .
2021-01-15 13:49,"Dr. Kessler is a person of integrity. As the former FDA commissioner, he butted heads with Orrin Hatch. Hatch slated him for FDA commissioner. When Kessler demanded truth in advertising from orange juice companies about fresh frozen vs. fresh, Hatch was incensed. Kessler pushed forward. Kessler prevailed. We need more people like Kessler that believe in truth in government. Holding companies and government officials accountable is democracy in action."
2021-01-15 14:17,Hope he does something about the diabetes pandemic caused by Big Food companies. Needs regulation just like Big Tobacco.

2021-01-15 17:39,"With this latest stellar appointment, Joe Biden continues to justify “ big time” the confidence that I and 81 million of my fellow Americans placed in him on November 3rd. 
Kudos Mr. President- Elect - you are continuing to do us proud!"
2021-01-15 17:42,"We have Covid 19 vaccine vials that are just sitting in refrigerators.  He should focus on speeding up the process and getting the vaccines we have out of storage and into arms.   The process has been very slow and uneven around the country.  With so many people who give shots and other vaccines everyday, the government and health care industry should figure out a way to get the current supply of vaccines into arms. In the 1960's, I remember the neighborhood going to the local junior high school cafeteria to get an oral polio vaccine."
2021-01-15 18:13,"I think we need a team of young, innovative, forward-thinking software engineers who can develop a scheduling website that doesn’t crash and a distribution plan that functions as seamlessly as Amazon Prime. Big tech is evil, sure, but there is a reason Amazon is so big - because it works! It’s user friendly! Their customer service is top notch! Have you ever tried to get a DEA license? Let’s just say you can’t even look up your number without using the postal service."
2021-01-15 18:22,Can’t we seek out a partnership with Amazon to get on top of this? I couldn’t function—particularly during the pandemic—without Amazon and am grateful for their speed and efficiency.
2021-01-15 12:25,"Dr. Kessler is a highly qualified good person.  President Biden will let him do his job free of politics. I humbly suggest that Kessler look to Israel for ideas on how to straighten out the inexcusable  mess that we have in the USA getting our people vaccinated and stopping the horrendous death rate we have from the  ignorant, disgracefully poor management by Trump and his inept team of political hacks."
2021-01-15 12:46,Fantastic News!!
2021-01-15 12:59,"Now that changes Biden's identity obsessed quota cabinet.

Now he has to pick a person of color for the next appointment.

When identity comes first and competency is put second disasters will happen.

It killed Hillary with her identity/social engineering obsession. Reno being forced on Bill Clinton by neo feminists  gave us the Waco tragedy and Trump's obsession with white men and the rest tokens gave us the Trump administration. 

Learn from history or forever be condemned to repeat its worst mistakes."

Not credited enough by the NYT, which often injected doubts into its coverage of the vaccine always hedging with terms like, ""unprecedented"" and ""never been done before."""
2021-01-15 16:32,"I had not remembered him with his latest photo but the other photo - when he was testifying -  brought back memories of this man.

You have to be in the right place at the right time - to ge lucky.

With WarpSpeed having delivered what it was set to do - all he has to ensure no one throws the sand in to wreck the gears.

I know it is not fashionable to complement soon to be ex POTUS -  but Trump deserves credit for ""thinking out of the box.""

And with Biden throwing money at everything - this man has it reasonably easy.

My only problem is his past association with Faucci who has been there too long,"
2021-01-15 16:44,The FDA is known as the king of delays with layers upon layers of regulations. Companies hiring experts for millions of dollars to get through their maise of rules. Dr. Kessler doesn't have any experience in making things happen quickly so please don't expect things to get better.

2021-01-15 17:56,"Wonderful choice.  Clearly, President Elect Biden is 100% intent upon bringing the best minds and hearts to bear on the current situation, which is of course as it should be. 

To all those who idiotically followed the current occupant of the WH in deriding and laughing at Dr Fauci, I would ask them to consider this:  If you were to find yourself or a loved one battling a serious illness, whom would you choose?  An expert who had selflessly and tirelessly devoted his life to the study and eradication of that disease, or the radiologist who had just X-Rayed your broken wrist?  Think about it."

Much has been done to bring down the risk level for healthcare workers and while it is still higher than it is for the general public, community spread is by far our biggest threat now versus what was last spring. We cannot waste time holding back vaccines for people who remain reluctant."
2021-01-14 11:43,"While the vaccine-reluctant are coddled, those of us who desperately want (and need!) the vaccine cannot get it.  I'm 1b.  Give their vaccine to me now!"
2021-01-14 11:44,"This is absurd. Do these employees have to be vaccinated for MMR, Tetanus, Hepatitis, and be tested for TB and treated if positive as a condition of employment. Do the standards of practice for licensure in the NYSED OP require vaccination? Why not? Do the conditions for employment require vaccination? They must be. Permitting Healthcare professionals and unlicensed healthcare workers to work unvaccinated is simply dangerous. Healthcare is based on science. Science requires cold blooded reasoning."
2021-01-14 11:51,"If I had a relative in senior care, I would only consider facilities that required vaccination.

80% of deaths are in people over 65. But try getting the vaccine if you're a person over 65.

Regular people are crashing computer sites to get it. But people who can potentially infect the most vulnerable are offered the vaccine and refuse it."
2021-01-14 11:58,It’s an easy decision. Get the vaccine or don’t show up to work. Hospitals are folding under the brunt of Covid as surgeries and normal health care efforts have been suspended to allow enough manpower to care for sick patients. The last thing we need are staff members spreading Covid among the patient population.
2021-01-14 12:01,"Most hospital systems mandated flu shots years ago. Now these same administrators feel vaccinating for a virus that’s much more lethal should be voluntary?  I have co workers spew q anon nonsense, believe that masks cause the disease, that believe in everything trump. Anyone want a health care provider to care for you that doesn’t believe in infectious disease ? Maybe we should have hospitals that only serve conservatives by conservative practitioners. Surgeons who don’t wash hands or wear masks would be encouraged. Nurses who wear maga hats the norm."
2021-01-14 12:02,I guess there's no reason why medical care people overall should be any more well read or wiser than the general population. The data and news stories are out there to indicate the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines.
2021-01-14 12:06,"Given the historical as well as personal reasons that many health care workers, especially low-paid workers, have for skepticism, it would be helpful if we made it clear that highly-paid doctors and administrators have been the first in line to get the vaccine--and nearly unanimously.  

This is not a case of ""testing"" something on poor people and people of color; those leading the way are often white and usually privileged people.  This needs to be made clear.  The safety of the workers as well as the patients is at stake."
2021-01-14 12:07,"American capitalism is so broken that when something good finally comes out of it, people are rightly suspicious.

Apparently, years of corporate PR along the lines of “In order to build our team and our most valuable asset, YOU, we’ve decided to cut your pay and your benefits and give our CEO a bonus” has taken its toll. 

But, while I’m sympathetic to folks who presume their employers and the government that serves them is lying and places no value on their time, lives, or general welfare, in this case, vaccinations should be mandatory. That they are not mandated by the state AND by healthcare employers is absurd. This is a public health crisis. 

And, honestly, if healthcare organizations can’t manage to fill spots, even with historically high unemployment, maybe they should pay people more."
2021-01-14 12:18,"Had an annual exam recently and after chatting with my PCP about how eager I was to get the vaccine when it became available (she agreed), I went to the phlebotomist for routine bloodwork. I was surprised and dismayed when the phlebotomist told me she didn’t want to take the vaccine. Although I realize there are different levels of education within the medical industry I really didn’t expect that any medical worker would have such an attitude."
2021-01-14 12:25,"Don’t mandate the vaccine at this time, and stop obsessing about these arbitrary priorities. Just move on and give it to someone who wants it."
2021-01-14 12:28,"Hmm...cash, time off, or a ""waffle house"" gift card --total cost of breakfast? $3.89--as incentives. I wonder which one sinks to the bottom as an enticement?

All kidding aside, I'm glad this dilemma is being addressed so clearly. It's imperative that we begin accelerating the rate of vaccination by magnitudes of numbers. At this rate, the vaccine will have worn off the handful of people getting it and we'll keep chasing each other in infection circles.

It's shocking to me that healthcare workers would be reluctant, but then...it's shocking to me what was done to African Americans in the name of medical inquiry and experimentation. Once again, we're dealing with the long arm of injustice and a bill is overdue.

I began with a quip about the absurdity of the range in incentives, but will end on a serious note. If I were a healthcare worker who had been pulling 48 hour shifts caring for patients parked in hospital gift shops, I would be beyond insulted if someone told me I was getting a Waffle House gift card. If we want incentives to work, make them real incentives and the kind the benefit all frontline workers risking their lives in this pandemic. Whatever happened to the quaint notion of bonuses? 

Many are staying safely home. Others are risking death. It would be nice if our society recognized that divide and did something about it. Nice as the gesture is, banging pots and pans and clapping people home doesn't cut it. A $10,000 bonus to vaccinate and compensate does."
2021-01-14 12:40,"I worked in a state medical school, where each winter, the flu vaccine was mandatory. Directives were circulated in no uncertain terms: you could refuse the shot if you had allergies and/or serious objections, but unvaccinated employees were required to wear a mask at all times inside the school buildings, were banned from clinical areas and patients' floors and could not eat at the cafés and cafeterias. Your ID badge was marked to that effect.

With COVID19 upending society in such pervasive ways, why would hospitals not require their staff to be vaccinated? How could medical staff involved with direct contact with the public be allowed to refuse protection?? What has changed between past flu policies and this disease? The administration in charge?

I understand all the current reticence and fear about vaccines, but I find these doubts misplaced in a clinical setting. I hear I am low on the priorities' list, and may have to wait months before I can be protected and feel safe. The phlebotomist, the janitor, the EMR don't want to be vaccinated? I'll take their shot tomorrow!"
2021-01-14 12:41,"I know the push to just hand out all vaccines is there, but I do hope someone is keeping careful tally for the second dose. We could be in a world of trouble if we come up short in a month. 

That said, I agree with those voicing their frustration about the rate and sin of throwing out doses and having them go bad for lack of an arm to put them in. 

An Ohio official came in for some censure when he had extra doses and called up the local police and firemen and gave them to them. Honestly, I can't fault him. What's the alternative? Throwing them out? Letting them spoil? Sure we should be following the protocols, but the people entitled to the vaccine don't seem to be taking them; it's criminal that doses are going to waste.

Adopt a policy where if it's clear by 1:00 pm --and surely *someone* is keeping count!-- that there are going to be extras, a call should go out and anyone should be able to walk in off the street and get it. At this point we HAVE to get these vaccines distributed.

You know...I just wish the right bet, the safe bet wasn't the cynical, jaded, pessimistic one. In September, when it was becoming clear that we really were going to blast through with a miracle, I said to my husband, ""How much you want to bet that the doctors and scientists get it right and we blow spectacularly the distribution?"" Here we are. 

Is there one single thing that can be done right in this pandemic? Anything at all?"
2021-01-14 12:53,"This article fails to mention that the currently-available COVID-19 vaccines in the US are allowed via Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs). This process allows for us to access the vaccines prior to/without formal FDA approval. 
EUAs still require full Phase 1 and 2 safety data, as well as a significant amount of data from an in-process Phase 3 trial. Another of FDA’s evaluation of an EUA application is making sure that producing it is safe by reviewing the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information for the vaccine. Vaccines granted EUAs have been reviewed with rigorous standards and should be seen as safe. 
However, given that the vaccines have not yet reached the point where they hace sufficient/complete Phase 3 data and have been submitted for and deemed to be “approved” vaccines, I am surprised that any workplaces have made them mandatory. With an EUA, they can be considered safe and highly recommended (and maybe minimally incentivized). But I do have a lot of cognitive dissonance about requiring non-approved vaccines as a mandatory inoculation."
2021-01-14 12:53,Our healthcare institution has very efficient processes for giving these vaccines. We have given vaccines to employees and we are vaccinating our  patients in the 65 and over group. We are so efficient that we have run out of vaccines and are waiting for our next shipment. My suggestion is to route unused vaccines to highly efficient facilities as they run out of doses. Wouldn't this be preferable to allowing the vaccine to go unused?
2021-01-14 13:05,"Prior to the pandemic and ongoing, every hospital in this country requires every staff member - and even volunteers - to receive several vaccinations before they’re allowed to work. Why is the situation different? Why are they being allowed to work if they refuse to be vaccinated? They should be fired if they won’t comply."
2021-01-14 13:14,"Here is a simple lesson that any 3rd grader could understand and that does not require an ""expert"" to teach:

If you want to protect the people most vulnerable to severe suffering from this virus, then you vaccinate the people most vulnerable to severe suffering from this virus.

Instead, we have a medial community which is determined to act unethically and immorally, devoting its energy to protecting its young members who would suffer only minor illness if infected, even devoting extra energy to persuade its young members who don't want vaccination.  

The medical community inside governments at federal, state, and local level have been and persist in their unethical, immoral, and selfish effort to protect their younger members (under age 60) by denying scarce vaccine to older general population Americans.  

And much of the medical community outside of government has unethically and immorally (and often cheerfully) performed this unethical and immoral vaccination priority."
2021-01-14 13:23,The vaccine is not scary. I had had 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. What is scary is COVID-19.
2021-01-14 13:25,"I feel like this article is an ad for the Waffle House. I am a physician who is not currently working. I can fully understand the reluctance people feel to get a ""new"" vaccine. It's difficult to imagine taking something that could potentially cause harm when you feel fine to fight off something you don't have yet or had and recovered from. It's often a struggle I had as a working pediatrician to convince families to vaccinate in general. NOTHING is risk free. The risks so far appear to be low. Most people have been doing very well. A few (29 people) have had anaphylaxis and survived. One physician died 16 days post vaccination from an autoimmune attack on his own platelets, it's not clear if this was vaccine related but it could be. That's small in relation to the risks of Covid, and I feel that it's worth it. I am uncomfortable with mandates, even if it seems like ""the right thing to do"" because people should be in charge of their own bodies."
2021-01-14 13:35,"This is just another sign of American failure.  This is straight out of Putnam's work - when there is a diverse community there is less social trust, trust in government and institutions and trust that things are going to work out.  We are more diverse than ever and it is tearing our nation apart. 

The vaccines are as safe as vaccines get.  But these anti-vaxxers don't believe it because they don't trust who is telling them that."
2021-01-14 13:45,"That so many people working in health care, including a lot of registered nurses, are either reluctant or refusing to get vaccinated, illustrates how ineffective and incomplete their  medical training was.  The two vaccines now being administered in the US were given to more than 15,000 patients in the trials conducted to evaluate them and no one was harmed.  They have now been given to millions of patients with the same result (except for the single death).  Some of the people in the trials received the vaccine nearly a year ago, and still, nothing to indicate they are unsafe.  The allergic reactions are exceedingly rare, and because they are known side effects, have been successfully treated in every case.  If trained medical professionals can be anti-vaxxers, then how can we expect people who know nothing about how drugs are developed and approved to accept vaccination?  Unsafe behavior is no longer allowed in any responsibly managed work place and typically leads to immediate dismissal.  Health care workers refusing to be vaccinated are behaving in an unsafe manner that puts their patients at risk. Thus, getting vaccinated is part of their job unless they have a valid medical reason for not getting vaccinated, like a known allergy to a vaccine component.  If they won't or can't be vaccinated, they should not be in contact with patients."
2021-01-14 13:48,"It seems to me a given that workers in healthcare should expect to be required to take approved vaccines as directed by their employers as a condition of their employment or continued employment, and that includes vaccines developed after employment commenced. It is as simple as that."
2021-01-14 13:49,They can give the rejected vaccine to federal workers who serve the general public. The mayor and the governor have not even mentioned this group of public servants.  Like people with preexisting conditions  ...  It is as if they don't exist.    Shame on them. Give it to federal  workers.
2021-01-14 13:56,"Could you clarify WHY they don’t want to take vaccine?  One doctor I know will not take the vaccine because she’s already had covid. She believes she has immunity, at least for a while.

Once the vaccine is no longer scarce, she plans to get it.  But in the meantime, she wants the vaccine that would have gone to her to go to someone else, because it could save one more life."
2021-01-14 14:00,"Are these the same healthcare workers that post all about their kids' playdates, indoor neighborhood parties, and unmasked grocery shopping trips? Maybe they need to miss a couple paychecks to convince them to get the shot. And, if they still don't want their dose, I can be up to the clinic in 10 minutes!"
2021-01-14 14:01,"I just don’t get it.  These caregivers are the most vulnerable to the Pandemic. Yet some significant number of them do not want to take the vaccine, EVER. How do they expect to survive and deal with the threat of COVID?  What about their families, friends and co-workers?"
2021-01-14 14:03,"Not mentioned - these employees have been lied to by their employers throughout this pandemic.

Told their flimsy PPE was adequate.

Told, also, if they need time off for the flu like symptoms of the vaccine, they cannot use sick days.

And Atria’s employees are not overwhelmingly positive."
2021-01-14 14:05,"Just one more example of the devastation the GOP has wrought on this country of ours.

2021-01-14 11:54,Getting Covid vaccine should be a condition of employment for any health care worker.  We do not need to be infected by the very people who are supposed to take care of us.  Fire the vaccine reluctant!
2021-01-14 11:30,"When many millions of high risk Americans seek the vaccine and are unable to get it, attempts to force anyone to take it against their will is utter nonsense."
2021-01-14 11:31,What about the rights of patients to receive safe care?  At some point you have to think beyond yourself. Why work in healthcare in the first place?
2021-01-14 12:36,"I am a high risk candidate, and I want that vaccine.  I am 1C and hopefully will be able to get my fiurst shot soon.  But as a healthcare worker also those who elect to not get vaccinated my find themselves unemployed.  You can not work if your last place of residence is the local funeral home and you are in a box ready for cremation."
2021-01-14 14:11,"The two elderly people I know who have died recently from Covid had been in “lock down” in their nursing home facilities for months and had seen family only through a window to the outdoors. The logical conclusion is that a staff member gave it to them, thus killing people who had families who love them and now mourn them. The vaccine  should be mandatory for anyone working with vulnerable people. Two separate issues to be addressed are (1) we don’t pay essential workers a living wage in this country and (2) we need to figure out why so many people would rather believe QAnon conspiracies and Trump’s lies than data and provable fact."
2021-01-14 14:15,"if you are in contact with people with Covid, aren't your two choices geting vaccinated or getting Covid.  One has had very few side effects, the other has lots of dead people or people with long covid including long term breathing, heart, neurological issues, exhaustion, etc.  With the new strains being even more contagious and seeing the amazing spread of this disease, and the heartbreaking stories of those affected, how can you pick Covid over the Covid vaccine ?"
2021-01-14 14:17,"Put them on warning, and if they still refuse after the grace period, suspend them. If they still refuse after suspension, fire them. They are willfully putting patients and co-workers at risk.

Refusal to follow any of these protocols resulted in termination."
2021-01-14 14:17,"We need fewer ridiculously long articles about this that belong in sidebars. The real news is that there's not enough vaccine and that the demand is overwhelming. I'm sorry these people were treated poorly by their employers or are under-educated, easy targets for conspiracy theories. Millions have already been vaccinated (I personally know ten) with fewer side effects than the flu shot."
2021-01-14 14:20,"If a single breakfast at Waffle House is enough to change someone's mind about getting vaccinated we have a major problem in value systems.

First, let's offer a cheap carrot.  Can you be any more condescending?  I haven't been in one since college in the 80s, but it can't be more than a $10 value.

Second, let's offer a poor nutritional choice as a carrot.  Choosing *very* carefully may provide a good nutritional meal, but these chains are famous for food loaded with sodium, saturated fat and topping out at half a day's worth of calories."
2021-01-14 14:22,"The US is the world epicenter for COVID-19, with more than 1/3 of all the new cases in the world, despite having only 1/25 of the world population.  This is due entirely to Trump’s narcissism, denial, and anti-competence.

The only way to defeat COVID worldwide is to first defeat it in the US.  That requires vaccinating as many Americans as possible as fast as possible. It matters less exactly which people and in which order.

This should be President Biden’s top priority for 2021.  After COVID has been defeated in the US, President Biden should work with our allies and with the World Health Organization to ensure a worldwide program to help vaccinate poor people around the world.  Otherwise, COVID will just return again next year.

Finally, President Biden should work with our allies and international agencies to promote long-term policies that ensure that the next pandemic never gains a foothold, anywhere in the world."
2021-01-14 14:27,"Enough of the hefty moralizing. The last time I checked, I was still the owner of my body. We've have been thinking beyond ourselves every day we care for our patients. The idea that we are being selfish because we don't want to take a brand new vaccine immediately is wrong. We still have to wear masks anyway. And our patients are not protected from  other people who haven't been vaccinated. 

Kemp's idea that a restaurant gift card is sufficient inducement to get hesitant people to take the vaccine shows how clueless he is about their true motivations and what little regard he has for his constituents. How about laying off the pressure and letting us make our own decisions? That alone will change some minds."
2021-01-14 14:27,"This is nuts - there shouldn’t be any discussion about this - if you want to continue working in any part of health care, you should be vaccinated.  The article hardly gets into discussion about the reasons people are opposed, but it doesn’t matter.  There may well be pay and working condition issues, but those are separate from the absolute necessity of protecting residents and patients.  No vaccination, no job."
2021-01-14 14:34,"I find this situation infuriating. We've been locked out of nursing homes for nearly a year. Our loved ones are continuing to decline both mentally and physically. They are still getting Covid and dying due to staffers bringing in Covid. Enough! If long term care facilities are going to take a hands off approach with regard to requiring staff to be vaccinated, then there is no excuse for not allowing us back into the facilities. It's painfully clear that the staffers are presenting a far greater risk to our loved ones than allowing one properly attired family member to visit."
2021-01-14 14:35,"I'm surprised there isn't more about the legal piece. This issue of mandating vaccines came up a few weeks ago and I can't remember whether it was a journalist here or at The Guardian who did the research, but the answer was unambiguous.

 An employer has every right to mandate anything, including that employees must be vaccinated to work (and that's not just healthcare workers; it's all places of work). If we were serious about this pandemic--and don't get me started on the 123,842,108 ways we're demonstrating we're not--we'd mandate them as a prerequisite to work.

Our whiffle-waffle attitude about everything is 99% of our crisis. There are straightforward, unambiguous, clear-cut ways to end this pandemic. Apparently, we just don't want to do any of them. Someone should be made to answer for why we don't."
2021-01-14 14:37,"I lead by example, just had my second shot of the vaccine. There is no trust on the healthcare system. Too much disinformation on social media. I am trying to educate people but it’s like swimming up stream. We need more positive news. What people read are the few negative side effects, not the majority that short term are fine and long term, based on science, should also be fine. It amazes me that people don’t realize how many risky things we do on our daily lives and we don’t care about our long term risk ( overweight, texting/driving, etc). I’ve been trying to give examples to people, including some medications, that we take and have many side effects.
Can you publish small articles of random people daily that took the vaccine ( similarly to your Sunday’s articles about what people do) and what is their experience? I think of people understood better the science for some would be easy to take. Most people are worried if it will affect their DNA ( it will not), afraid of side effects but if you explained to them their risk factors, short and potentially long term effects maybe then they will give it a try. On top of all this, we need leader from both parties to agree that vaccination can return life to normal, religious groups ( some people are concerned that the vaccines are made with fetal aborted fetuses; not true). And finally, an social media campaign. We can do this, just one person at a time"
2021-01-14 14:38,"Earlier this week at my Trader Joe’s in Soho I asked my cashier — a man in his 30s — if he was eligible to get the vaccine.  He said he didn’t know but it didn’t matter because he had no interest.  He went on to cite a laundry list of what to me sounded like conspiracy theories about the vaccine — not the least being the untrue claim that it dangerously prompts the body to manufacture and reproduce the virus in its entirety.  He also expressed suspicion about how quickly the vaccine had been developed and said he didn’t want to be a “guinea pig”.

So this is what we’re up against.  As a 65-year-old man with a surgically repaired mitral valve I’m all in on getting vaccinated. And I’m old enough to remember a time when vaccines were almost universally regarded as a near miraculous benefit to public health — especially where polio was involved.

Those days, alas, are gone forever."
2021-01-14 14:40,"Move on. Next person up. Vaccinate those individuals who want to help defeat this scourge. It is extremely selfish not participating in a vaccination program that will help patients, colleagues and family members directly. This isn’t about me or you, but us. Especially  Healthcare professionals. They absolutely should know better."
2021-01-14 14:41,"(Let me preface by saying I am an ICU nurse who chose to get the Pfizer vaccine on December 15.) The vengeful, “let them cooperate or be sacrificed” tone of virtually all the comments here exactly reflects why many healthcare workers are at their limit, including the limit of their open mindedness to getting the vaccine. We are emotionally exhausted from being at the frontline for months. Now we are at the frontline of a new mRNA vaccine that has been tested on about 40,000 subjects (half of whom received placebos) over several months.  There is literally no long term data because the long term has not yet transpired. I personally was eager to get the vaccine because I posit the likelihood of damage from covid if far higher than the likelihood of an unknown long term negative vaccine outcome (as we saw with the swine flu vaccine).  But that second likelihood is not zero. Do not preach to healthcare workers who have labored and sacrificed for nearly a year, often with inadequate PPE and empty promises of safety from corporate hospital management.  We are suffering from (P) TSD - except we are nowhere near the “post” phase yet.  Many who wrote comments may have sacrificed too, I know.  But perhaps many more commenters worked from home, made weekend driving trips that they rationalized were safe, all doing their little micro part to perpetuate covid, and now judge us for being emotionally depleted and afraid of a vaccine we have no control over. You have not walked in our shoes."
2021-01-14 14:47,There are millions of people who want the vaccine. Just move on to the next person and give it to someone who wants it and thankful for it.

Trying to convince the unwilling at this point doesn't seem to make sense and doesn't seem to be working. We could reach herd immunity quicker than with the current mandated stratification of vaccine distribution that is keeping so many willing 65+ people from getting a shot.
2021-01-14 15:02,"The key point of the article is right at the top, stated beautifully by Dr. Mike Wasserman. The rest of the article is just the people in charge failing to address the real issue - actually respecting the people who have been risking their lives this whole pandemic."

From an ethical standpoint, caring for our elderly and vulnerable - including anyone who has the misfortune to land in a health care facility - requires certain minimum standards.  I want my doctor to have a medical degree, and I want to know that anyone who comes near me in a medical setting is not a further risk to my health and wellbeing.  First do no harm.

Allowing those who can contract and infect others to continue to care for the vulnerable is completely irresponsible on the part of the organizations and should leave them open to lawsuits"

I'm a traveling healthcare worker based in Alaska so I'm not connected to any medical centers here. The hospitals get the most vaccines but they are hoarding them for their employees and patients. There are few waiting lists, no one to call. Everyone says they know nothing. I keep getting redirected to the useless health department website. Most people I know already had the virus. I will get infected before I can get the vaccine. I think once they become easier to find, resistance will decrease as well."
2021-01-14 15:20,"I thought this was about saving lives in an emergency? I thought we were standing up to conspiracy theorists? Remember when anyone wanting to have a somewhat normal Thanksgiving and Christmas was labeled a selfish super-spreader killing grandma?

If a health care worker is putting patients at risk by refusing the vaccine, they give up their right to work there. 

At the very least, if health workers won't get vaccinated, just move on to the next group. These people should not be delaying vaccinations for people who want it.

Another thought -  if health care workers who have a front row seat to all those overloaded ICU's aren't worried, why are we shut down?"
2021-01-14 15:29,"It blows my mind that there are people working in healthcare who are refusing the vaccine.

Grow up or pick a new field."
2021-01-14 15:39,"Sort of like medical workers, including nurses and doctors who smoke.  Human bullheadedness occurs everywhere.

But I offer an incentive to those organizations which have hospitals.  Any staff which refuses the shot will be immediately reassigned to the Covid ward, period, to stay there until the end of the pandemic.

But the shot has to be a condition of employment for all too obvious reasons."
2021-01-14 15:42,"My husband is a geriatrician; he owns a private practice and is also medical director of a number of local nursing homes. When it became evident how few of the nursing home staff were willing to get the vaccine, he immediately offered to go in and talk with them. He spoke with the nursing staff, the maintenance staff, the kitchen staff... explaining the decades old science of the “new” vaccines, assuring them that he’d already had his first dose and that his wife and young children will be getting theirs as soon as it’s made available to them. He answered questions ranging from “Will it make me sterile?” to “Are there baby parts in it?”  to “I have —— condition. Is it still safe for me?” That’s literally all it took: a person that the staff knows and trusts taking the time to actually talk with them, not to them, in person. From that one interaction, the percentage of staff agreeing to take the vaccine skyrocketed. No threats, no dangling of incentives, just respectful human interaction. Between the historical abuse so many of our society have experienced at the hands of our government, and the absolute deluge of misinformation about these vaccines we have all been exposed to, it should come as no surprise that people are hesitant, if not scared, to take the vaccines. If the corporate “leaders” in healthcare would address their employees as humans first, instead of throwing a litany of new “policies” at them designed to manipulate behavior, it would go a long way."
2021-01-14 15:43,"My first question to any doctor, dentist, optometrist or other health care professional I visit will be whether they've been vaccinated.  No vaccine, no visit.  It's like going to someone who refuses to wear a mask, and tells a great deal about the quality of the person."
2021-01-14 15:48,"Mandates are one of the least effective ways of changing human behavior. Say they make the vaccine mandatory upon threat of termination. The low paid overworked employee either refuses and gets fired, making the unemployment rate rise, or they take the vaccine against their will, in which case they seethe about it and quit. Who will take care of the patients then? Another low paid overworked employee who might have the same attitude. The nursing home then has the same problem. Meanwhile, the nursing home opened up to visitors, believing they were now “safe,” placing residents at risk again. Terrible idea."
2021-01-14 16:00,Why not let them skip the vaccine and give it to someone who will take it no questions asked? Spending time and effort to change their minds may be a waste of resources that could be used to vaccinate the masses who do want the vaccine. Forcing someone to get a vaccine will be met with resistance.
2021-01-14 16:07,"Personally I find the fact that a LOT of people in the medical profession don't believe in medicine and science to be totally frightening.

It's not going to turn out well.

Get the News: ANY so called ""Medical Professional"" or ""Healthcare Worker"" that refuses who does not have a legitimate medical reason for not getting vaccinated has NO business working in The Healthcare Industry.

We hired people who don't believe in government to run our government and look how that turned out.. The LAST thing we need are Healthcare Workers who don't believe in medicine or science. 

I am already signed up for my shot simply because I have a health condition that makes me extra vulnerable. I got early March appt but I'd have taken today if it was available. If it's good enough for Dr Faucci I want my shots too."
2021-01-14 16:12,"The people I have heard hesitant about the vaccine are concerned because of the lack of data on long-term effects of mRNA vaccines.￼  This seems less than issue for older people, and those not interested in procreation.

These businesses don’t care about the low paid folks who fo all the daily dirty work and keep the businesses afloat with very few benefits.

Take a pay cut executives and boost the pay and benefits of your employees and treat them like valued employees. They buoy your brand and reputation for pennies.
After you treat them like valued employees, then  they will have faith that taking a chance on the vaccine is worth it."

I have spent a lot of time thinking about this issue and trying to convince skeptical staff members to accept the vaccine. Almost without exception the vaccine refusers I talk to want everyone else to get the vaccine. This is both because they want this nightmare pandemic to end ASAP, and because they want more real world data before making their own decision on the vaccine. In other words, they want to benefit from having others take a theoretical risk that they themselves are unwilling to take. This is selfishness. I am not vilifying my coworkers. These are people I like like. They are hard-working, kind individuals who do their job very well. But on this issue they are selfish, cowardly, and hypocritical.

Do no harm includes not infecting patients who are already vulnerable with a known deadly disease. If you don’t believe in science work somewhere else. There are requirements for all jobs, this should be one of them. Can you work for an airport and not believe everyone has to be screened by the TSA?"
2021-01-14 15:20,"I am an ER physician and have been treating COVID patients for almost a year.

I am fortunate to have been vaccinated and ran to it with open arms the moment it was available to me.

While the distrust and fear of this vaccine is a tragic consequence of ill informed public leaders, I admit I was hoping that the healthcare workforce would know better.

The vast majority of healthcare workers have to be vaccinated and demonstrate immunity against several infectious diseases (Hep B, MMR titers) to be hired and continue to work in patient care. We all receive routine PPD screening annually.

In my opinion it is our professional duty to comply with any vaccine or treatment that helps us to protect, and not in fact harm, our patients.

I would gently suggest that fears aside, if you are not comfortable with this aspect of healthcare - perhaps it isn’t the right field for you. 

I hope that continued educational campaigns and leading by example helps here. The vaccine is far safe than contracting COVID, which is like playing Russian roulette with a loaded gun, and whose long term side effects will not be known for decades."
2021-01-14 11:55,"When the first vaccine from Pfizer was released I too was reluctant to get it at first due to the speed of development and testing. As an essential worker in the servicing of medical equipment and at the age of 63 I am at risk. 

So after this new wave that has hit the NYC metropolitan area I got my first Moderna vaccine shot last week. My arm was sore way more then the flu shot but other than that I feel fine."
2021-01-14 19:26,"I work at one of the 50 largest medical centers in the USA, and as of one week ago only 17% of the hospital nursing staff had chosen to get the freely offered vaccine. This is in stark contrast to the physician staff which is upwards of 90%. The flu vaccination is mandatory for all staff, but I think the hospital feels it can make the COVID vaccine mandatory at this time. Short of making the vaccine mandatory, the hospital could say that there is no paid time off, no paid healthcare, etc. for those refusing the vaccine who then get COVID - but this is rather draconian and the hospital cannot afford to lose a large percentage of their nursing staff. On the positive side, unused vaccinations are now being offered to those 65 and older before the expire."

Perhaps Biden will set us straight."
2021-01-14 21:04,"I sympathize with the emotional and physical trauma experience by many front line healthcare workers. However, I struggle to view this as a justifiable reason for knowingly putting their patients at greater risk of infection, particularly when the vaccine is being withheld from those of us in the general population who want it in order to ensure that they can receive it immediately."
2021-01-14 23:56,"Health care workers have performed heroically throughout the pandemic, and I sympathize with those who are reluctant to be vaccinated. But being vaccinated against contagious illnesses, whether it's the flu or Covid or measles, is a logical job requirement for anyone who chooses a career in the medical field. Part of the ""do no harm"" maxim is ensuring that you don't infect your patients, many of whom are very fragile medically, with a potentially fatal illness you may not know you are carrying."
2021-01-15 0:07,"I will probably go ahead and get that vaccine. 

But, I have a couple of doctors ( specialists ) in my family and they would not prefer to be first in line. They would get the vaccine if asked by the government or the authorities. There is nothing anti-vaxx or being non-scientific about it.

Actually, science and data shows that there is a probability that there can be an adverse impact; however small or minuscule it may be. It is about at least acknowledging that the risk is there. 

I fly regularly and I know the probability of dying on an aircraft is negligible.Doesn’t mean I go around calling people who question any news about an accident from flying as being anti-science or fake news. It is literally just the opposite.

 I haven’t tried but pretty sure you can prove that  having an accident in an aircraft while flying is statistically insignificant. Doesn’t mean zero,"

Does the reporter not know the basics of the CARES ACT? Here's the leave policy straight from the federal government ...  ""Two weeks (up to 80 hours) of paid sick leave at the employee’s regular rate of pay where the employee is unable to work because the employee is quarantined (pursuant to Federal, State, or local government order or advice of a health care provider), and/or experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and seeking a medical diagnosis.""  

So, a bit of poor reporting combined with a political agenda and willful ignorance that comes from watching too much cable news.

I would suggest that to all in the medical community that have access to the vaccine .. Get it!   We've held your doses too long.  We need to open them up to other groups like my 99 year old grandmother who isn't in facility.  Really, get with the program or get out."

The fact that health care workers are choosing to not be vaccinated is criminal.

I'm in hospitals and care centers a lot, I come into maskless contact often. For these people to refuse vaccination simply has no scientific rational and no doubt has caused many deaths — it is just insane.

To report on this without clearly outlining all the health risks associated with refusing vaccination is irresponsible.

Such a policy would allow programs to be focused on getting vaccine in arms with no coercion."

I spoke with a hospital pharmacist who reviewed the studies and how it was developed and came to understand the technology has been under development for many years, not just the previous 9 months.  After working on a COVID unit for a day, I got vaccinated the next available day.  I definitely didn’t want to get Covid or pass it unknowingly to others. 

I understand why someone might be reluctant to get it if their employer doesn’t offer adequate healthcare, sick time or PPE.   It sounds like the employers in this article are prioritizing their finances over their workers.  If the workers knew they were valued as human beings, they might be more willing to consider the vaccine.  If the company owners sat down and were vaccinated with them, they also might be more willing to be vaccinated.

Once we approve the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines (hopefully in February) we will move from the confusion of too many people trying to get too few available doses to a place where anyone that wants to get the vaccine can from their local pharmacy or drug store.

Net - the issue we have right now is largely caused by trying to restrict who gets the vaccine (which it should be when its limited in supply).  We don't need to build federal vaccine sites that won't be used once the supply constraint is removed."
2021-01-16 1:44,"These are all good steps but to get to a real 'warp speed' we need to change our mind set.  We are 20M+ vaccinations behind existing supplies - we need to get to 3M+ vaccinations a day - 800k. Get to mass vaccination with lots of support of the NG at major event centers (stadiums, Disneyland, convention centers, etc.) and stop the 'by appointment mentality.  Get a few thousand NG troops at several sites in a major metro area (eg LA, SFO, NYC, ATL, CHI, etc.) and do 100,000s per day at each site. Line up show an ID (medical or age) and get a shot - no waiting.  Anyone with 5 mins training can collect the data, administer a shot or fill a syringe (fastest practice is to have those jobs done separately).  Much easier to handle shipping and storage if you do a few major sites vs distributing to every CVS in the country.  Once you take care of some major metro areas (which could actually have an impact on new case counts in that area), move on to the next area.  Much more effective than trying to micromanage each shot, individually approve each appointment, distribute across every hospital/cvs/etc in US.  This is how NYC did it in 1947 when they did 5M smallpox vaccinations in 2 weeks."

The most important thing any president must do is always to tell the truth about any situation that threatens American lives, including health situations like a viral pandemic.  Fortunately, Mr. Biden is committed to telling the truth, as his speech today made clear.

But Americans also need to hear the truth about what went wrong with the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic.  Now that the coronavirus has taken nearly 390,000 American lives, it is time to establish an independent commission to determine how our country wound up in this catastrophic mess.  Establishing such an independent commission would not be for the purpose of scoring political points -- although of course there will be endless accusations that this is the motivation.  Rather, establishing such an independent commission would be for the purpose of enabling our country to avoid a similar meltdown in the future --  because we can bet the ranch that the 2020-21 coronavirus pandemic will not be our last viral catastrophe."

2021-01-16 1:55,"Yeah, “things will get worse before they get better”—

But it didn’t have to be that way. We are always playing catch-up.

With the disordered clumsy roll-out of the vaccine, crucial time was lost in getting ahead of this new highly contagious variant.

Instead of planning for massive distribution and administration of the vaccine, Trump was only worried about saying the vaccine was ready before the election—and then had a characteristic Trump-meltdown-blind-fury when it wasn’t."
2021-01-16 2:02,"Promises. Promises. It's all a joke. Unfortunately Trump has put us so far behind it will be a year or more before we really can make this vaccine turn around the hardship we are experiencing. I am 65 and in NY. Though 2 days ago they said people in my demographic could get the vaccines, the websites, didn't load, the listed sites are minimal and if you get on one they say no appointments available. The government of the USA  has killed 100's of thousands of people by their inept response to this crisis for over 10 months. And these are the people elected and paid way more than any of us. The US Government: Among the world's worst when it comes to protecting the people."
2021-01-16 2:13,"I have some concerns about Biden's approach.

First, if you add everyone 65 and older right now, demand will vastly outstrip supply, resulting in a first come, first served free-for-all that throws the CDC's stated priorities out the window.  We could see some frontline healthcare workers and nursing home residents going without because the available vaccines went to others first.

Second, ""mass vaccination centers"" in sports stadiums and high school gymnasiums, as are apparently being planned, have the potential to become superspreader events, if hundreds or even thousands of people are crowded together for lengthy periods of time.

I'm relieved to have an incoming president who takes the problem seriously, but if we end up subordinating practical considerations to political slogans (""100 million shots in 100 days!""), it may not end well."

Hey Joe, you have 6000 doctors and nurses in the US Public Health Service paid good money to do more than desk jobs at CDC and FDA. They’re ready to get deployed to vaccinate...heck we the taxpayers pay them to get deployed and practice their art.

2021-01-16 2:24,"it's very clear that the problem is vaccine supply. The distribution problem was a three week issue.  It's nearly impossible to find a clear schedule of vaccine doses. The best I can do is to expect 20 million doses per month from Pfizer and Moderna (combined) which leads to NY getting 6% or 1.2MM per month. There is no clear increase coning in the short term  Even if Janssen  is approved in February, they have already stated they have production problems, and many not provide significant supply until a few months later.  I believe that the only true option is to approve Astraveneca/Oxford based on the data the several countries have used, but the FDA is somehow reluctant to weight 4K deaths per day versus a dosing error."

While Trump & his minions have endlessly Lied that he saved millions of lives !! This bleak US scenario in the Trump era of last 5 years, of no one in the US strongly exposing the Truth while Trump trumpets his flood of brazen Lies, is the exact repeat of Adolf Hitler’s Germany from 1932 onwards.

2021-01-16 2:37,"The most important part of this announcement, and probably the only significant part, is Biden's being honest and leveling with the public. Trying to help states improve the logistics of vaccine delivery might also be useful, especially since the needed infrastructure already exists. However, there is nothing Biden or the federal government can do to increase the amount of vaccine. Building a production line for an injected drug is a bit more difficult than making masks. Likewise, the idea of building vaccine injection sites seems rather silly since all you need are a couple rooms, and these facilities are available throughout the US."
2021-01-16 2:35,"The federal rollout has gone quite well.  But sadly, many states are doling out vaccines to political interest groups rather than exclusively to people over age 65, who are the people medically at high risk to die of COVID-19.  Worse, the early distributions were half pre-allocated for repeat dosages, reducing the quantity of early doses by half.  Federal authorities are trying to educate states in the hope of reducing deaths from COVID-19, for example by releasing the hoarding of follow-up doses.  But that is only one of many competing goals, many of which are political.  Eventually, there will be enough vaccine for all.  And this won't be the biggest public health concern anymore."

2021-01-16 2:41,NYT - the critical issue right now is not a vaccine shortage but that the majority of vaccines are sitting unused due to excess bureaucracy in distribution. See Zeynep’s editorial today.

2021-01-16 2:58,"Now might be a very good time for the media to ask Pfizer and Moderna to confirm exactly how many vaccine doses they've released to the federal government. It should not be this difficult to track doses released to the feds vs doses released to the states vs doses injected into arms to at least give us a good idea as to where the bottlenecks are and whether we actually have a lack of supply/challenges with demand at certain restrictive tiers/difficulty at the last mile. 

Figuring this out rapidly, along with a focus on getting the vaccine into the older adults who have the highest rates of hospitalization and mortality, is key to changing these trends."
2021-01-16 3:03,"I was surprised by the premise stated in the description of this article on the home page that having just two approved vaccines will slow down production. This makes no sense, as 10 different companies can create 10 times as many doses in the same amount of time of the same vaccine. During WWII a number of companies built B-17s at the same time, for example, so I don't see why the same principle wouldn't apply in this case."
2021-01-16 3:03,"I hope Dr. Kessler goes faster than he sounds, a pace in line with everyone getting a shot in the next two years or so.

The health care professionals on the tube of any stripe are completely disconnected to actually getting those shots into the arms of private citizens.

A sense of urgency is non-existent.

Why have the National guard in every state not been called up to give the shots around the clock?

Oh, I forgot, in states like NJ Guard are somewhat short staffed guarding the US capitol and maybe the State Capitol from attack by the Trump despicables. 

Good luck out there in Michigan and Missouri though."
2021-01-16 2:49,Biden plans to vaccinate 100 million within his first 100 days.This is a very measurable objective.It's a pass/fail option.We'll judge Joe on his results.

Right now I'm locked out of the 1B group, I'm 64, 1 month, and 15 days old, not old enough for the 65 and older group, so like others I have to wait.  Even though I have co-morbidities, I'm prime target for really bad Covid infection.  I'm also aware that children, infants are even further down the list.  So everybody double down on mask wearing, hand washing, and social distancing.  A vaccine doesn't cure dead.  Dead is dead.  And the end result of dead is a casket in the ground and grieving family members. Keep your wits about you."

I am most concerned fir my senior parents with more serious underlying medical
conditions . It’s funny now everyone has underlying medical conditions .  In our city we aren’t sure how they chose the first 50 to get vaccinated.  Seniors with underlying maybe try by lottery . Nj is behind most seniors in other states are already going into second round or know their date !"

2021-01-16 3:21,"Here’s my issue, and it’s a big one.  Biden says we are racing the new 50% more infectious virus variants (3).  One leading expert advising Biden’s team interviewed on the Newshour today said this is our “last stand.”
Meanwhile the FDA is holding up approval of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine because of a relatively trivial issue about dosages, not safety issues.  Apparently the FDA would rather set the world-class standard for approvals than save lives.  That’s great in general but as Biden said, we’re at war with the virus.
The AstraZeneca vaccine is not only tested in clinical trials, but it is being given to millions of Britons as I write.
I applaud Biden’s commitment to keeping politics out of the FDA, but it is not playing politics to go over there and knock some heads together.
As Bill said, “We seek progress, not perfection.”"
2021-01-16 3:23,"Your article reads, 

""With only two federally authorized vaccines, supplies will be scarce for the next several months""

How do you reconcile this with the fact that New York and other states are throwing away vaccines because they're expiring?  The problem is not a shortage of vaccine.  The problem is bone-headed government policies that threaten health care workers who mistakenly give the vaccine to the ""wrong"" people.

If there was more vaccine, there would be more waste, period."
2021-01-16 4:00,"Didn’t the Trump administration lie about what vaccines  were in reserve, and in fact there aren’t any in reserve because Azar et al never really set up anything safe in reserve???"
2021-01-16 4:36,"Mass vaccinations make no sense. If we had all the vaccine doses we need, then we would need to speed up vaccinations. A new vaccination system might be helpful. 

But the bottleneck is not getting shots into human shoulders. The bottleneck is in making vaccine. The pace of manufacturing is going flat out, but demand will outpace supply for at least the next year. The infrastructure already exists for vaccinations that will keep up with all the doses we can get. 

Medical offices, pharmacies, employers, and other sites already distribute flu shots at a peak pace of 2 million a day. Add in some new sites (like my county did with a drive-thru vaccination center) and there will be more than enough. 

Joe Biden's plan will probably do nothing to speed up the production of vaccine doses. We have Donald Trump to thank that we got manufacturing going so quickly in the first place.

So not only will a new federal program to vaccinate people waste money, it is likely to slow things down rather than speed things up. Better to focus on working the kinks out of the existing system than add a whole new system, with its own kinks to work out, on top of it."
2021-01-16 5:12,"The answer is simple. Authorize the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is safe and being used in many other countries, including the UK. And speed along the Johnson & Johnson.

Unfortunately, the whole world must wait for another 5 days."
2021-01-16 4:40,"This might expose my ignorance of modern day pharmaceutical manufacturing practices, but can’t other companies that aren’t producing coronavirus vaccines retool their factories to make them during this crisis? And be well compensated for their efforts? The way Detroit’s powerful automotive industry retooled its factories for the war effort in the 40s? Isn’t that the whole point of the Defense Production Act?"
2021-01-16 4:11,"The Defense Production Act is not the panacea Joe Biden thinks it is. Look at what happened with ventilators. Governors were clamoring for them. Companies geared up to produce them. The Defense Production Act was invoked. Money was thrown at the problem. 

Turns out we didn't need any more ventilators. Nor does any other country. We now have a glut of ventilators that are going into expensive storage where they will likely degrade into uselessness before they are ever used. 

Leave the vaccine manufacturing up to the vaccine makers. They know what they are doing. They have every incentive to do it as fast as they can. Help them when they ask for it, but otherwise stay out of their way. 

Joe Biden needs to learn that he can't just order things to happen. Remember the Cancer Moonshot Task Force that he headed up when he was vice president? And the Biden Cancer Initiative after he left office? Both chewed up money and generated nothing in return. Promises were made and promises were broken. 

At least Donald Trump can claim credit for getting two vaccines approved while he was still in office, and another two close. In government, that is indeed warp speed. Much, much faster than Biden speed."

The federal government exists to do what people in their day to day lives have not the means. It can change the priorities of all to get the job done, and there are laws and much experience to facilitate the efforts. But it just does not spring into action like a thought springs into mind. It requires time, energy, money, and rational hard work."
2021-01-16 5:20,"FQHCs are indeed key components in community health delivery, many of which were created or significantly expanded by the Affordable Care Act. 

Rahm Emanuel initially advised President Obama not to pursue health care reform, and its interesting to read that he now trumpets the effectiveness of the reform he discouraged. Emanuel went even further as Chicago's mayor, shutting down most of the City of Chicago community mental health centers that served critically ill patients in favor of a private model that left many patients out of care.

As we begin a serious federal response to this crisis hopefully our understanding of the challenges and solutions will be shaped by science and leaders with track records of solid public health policymaking."

All those jobs have massive amounts of responsibility and training that goes well above and beyond administering vaccines.  Training allied health professionals in such tasks is neither novel nor monumental.     With anticipation of a vaccine from ""Operation Warp Speed"" and public releases about it dating back months, there was a massive lack of any preparation for this vaccine.

    It is crucial to roll out vaccines as quickly as possible but unfortunately, that is not going to happen in our country, hospitalizations and deaths will soar meanwhile.
  Most of us can expect to get vaccinated by late spring or summer. Better late than never.
  Meanwhile, at least we all have facemasks, facemasks are our savior. In fact, according to Robert Redfield of CDC, masks are more effective than vaccines. A national mandatory order to wear a face mask will save a lot of lives
and would keep people from becoming ""walking weapons"".
    It is astonishing that even some of our lawmakers are refusing to wear facemasks. What is wrong with them? Some congressmen contracted the virus after spending time in a lockdown room in the Capitol on January 6, some of them did not wear masks. I would not be surprised if these congressmen and the rioters caused a superspreader event on that day.

And yes, as some mention here, the failure to consider reviewing the Oxford AZ vaccine for emergency authorization until March (the USA has has reserved 300 million doses) -- is also criminal, especially since the Oxford vaccine is *at cost* and 1-6-1/8 the price of Pfizer and Moderna, doesn't need a cold chain, and can even sit outside a fridge for a week and still be fine.  It's very black humor  -- or the usual USA ignorance -- that people here suggest trusting the drug companies, when the ex-CEO of Moderna (the most expensive vaccine) is the outgoing head of Not-Warp Speed.

2021-01-16 5:35,"The CDC's January 20, 2020 report recommending prioritizing frontline essential workers over the elderly for vaccines relies on falsified data that intentionally understates the death toll of the virus on the elderly by many times and unrealistically assumes all Americans can be vaccinated very quickly.  The CDC report suggests that the death rate per 100,000 for a 70 year old is in the 143 per 100,000 range, when the state data on deaths for 70 year olds approaches 1 in 100 people.  If the CDC data materially underestimated COVID deaths of the elderly, as even their more recent data appears to do, then the conclusion of the CDC report that prioritizing essential workers over the elderly will only result in 1% to 5% more deaths is not only incorrect.  The CDC recommendations are a death sentence for older Americans.  The Biden Administration should reissue the CDC report quickly.   America should not be prioritizing 24 year old child care workers for the vaccine if 65 year olds and 55 year olds are dying in large numbers and few people in their 20s die from the virus.  The Biden Administration should also identify a smaller subset of high risk 16 - 64 year olds than a third of the population. identified by the CDC report  Someone with sickle cell disease, cancer or an organ transplant is more vulnerable than one third of the population and should be prioritized early on."

I'm not a scientist or doctor, but why can't Biden use the war time act to force the existing vaccine makers to share their formula with other drug companies in order to speed up the whole process?"
2021-01-16 5:57,"Just what the doctors ordered.  A President who is not afraid of his job.  And, I might add, the people whom he is supposed to serve.

The big challenge, aside from the mini=Trumps in a number of Governors' offices, is finding enough qualified people to inject vaccines into people's arms.  There is some talk of ""training"" ordinary citizens to administer the vaccine, but that would be quite unwise, causing nervous citizens to shy away getting the vaccine.  

I am a child of the Depression, happy that Biden intends to go big, like FDR, to confront our national disasters.  

I suggest the new President also emulate one of FDR's wonderful innovations, the Civilian Conservative Corps (CCC. Numerous health care professionals who, because they worked in non-COVID related sectors of medicine, have been laid off.  These professionals, and recently retired nurses and other retired health professionals could be recruited for a mobile Vaccine Corps.  Such a VC would be shared among the states, to staff vaccine centers which would be otherwise unattended.  

The US government would commit to  keeping them employed, at a modest but decent wage with per diem, until the nation reaches herd immunity.   Letting newly recruited VC members have some say in where they are sent would provide a recruiting enticement."

2021-01-16 11:06,I know that the well-being of the American people is foremost in  President Biden thoughts but I hope he will keep in mind that the American people and the world are watching to see how effectively we execute this vaccine roll out.  I'm recalling the problems with the rollout of the Obamacare websites and the damage that was done to public trust and confidence in government.  Execution matters.  Americans need to see their government effectively handling vaccination.  It will instill confidence in the public that the government is once again willing and able to act in their best interests.  Foreign rivals and adversaries are also watching carefully to see if America really is over - or still needs to be respected.
2021-01-16 6:49,"Pfizer and Moderna are already producing millions of vaccine doses.  Biden saying he will invoke the Defense Production Act serves no useful purpose other than it being a publicity stunt.

2021-01-16 6:54,Why it was just last month that Biden said he had a plan. What exactly was his plan? Or was it just a plan to have a plan? Why does Biden's incompetence get a free pass while his predecessor's didn't? Of it is simply the inconvenient reality that both legally and logistically this is a job for state governments to tackle -- a reality that has been pretty obvious to anyone who was not totally besotted by Trump animus?

It seems strange from our local perspective that so many in the USA reject wearing masks and practicing social distancing to reduce these figures.
I live in a beachside town 1 hour north of Sydney which have been in partial lockdown in response to a literal handful of daily cases. My town has not had a single case ever. But if you go to a shopping center here literally everyone is wearing a mask and keeping 6 feet apart, and registering on a state government website to help with contact tracing. It's not difficult to do.
Good luck with a speedy and effective vaccination program. Please try to minimize the risk of transmission in the meantime."

2021-01-16 9:06,"Anyone thinking Biden's approach is somehow better should be prepared to be disappointed. Vaccination by risk group coupled with parsing available vaccine supply to every state for equitable distribution is failing on every level to quickly deliver millions of vaccine shots. Hoping Biden's plan for tweaking it isn't going to make it work any better since it doesn't address the root cause for failing.  The primary goal and focus should be getting millions of people quickly vaccinated. Adopting a plan to quickly vaccinate as many people as possible should make a lot of Democrats happy too. It starts with sending all the available vaccine supply to population centers. Population center hae all the infrastructure to support and deliver vaccine on a large scale. Use transportation infrastructure for people to get to the vaccination centers (initially hospitals) and vaccinate everyone you can (abandon the risk priority for receiving the vaccination), and hospitals should be able to add additional vaccination capability quickly. Adding secondary vaccination centers (think where flu shots are given) would be the next step to bring online when more vaccine is available/for second dosing capacity, and in parallel add the mobile and remote vaccination capability by using the military infrastructure for these use cases. Clear, bold and expansive are just words when you ignore the reasons why the current plan is failing to deliver millions of shot."
2021-01-16 9:38,"While the promised policies against the virus are commendable including invoking the defense appropriations act to have more vaccine produced, the public and Congress have to keep the pressure on to make sure they happen.  He’s fond of perpetuating an image as in “I told you,” he said, “I’ll always level with you.” This was not true when he stated during the campaign that publicly funded health insurance costs twice as much as privately funded insurance when it is the opposite. That was a political calculation. We need the resolve of Roosevelt’s in WW II to fight this .  A comparable amount of people are dying."
2021-01-16 9:39,"Maybe the FDA can do a faster job of reviewing the AZ-Oxford  data that allowed the UK to approve it. It is easier to transport and store, can be manufactured in far greater quantities, and is cheaper. Since it is already in use in the UK, approved Dec 30th, we can proceed here in the US on a schedule later by 20 days, knowing that unlikely side effects will show up there first and we can then suspend here if needed. Why such a risky move? To save 100,000 US lives before the new strain explodes our cases, the US must be a bit bolder and more risky, despite the anti-vaxxer propaganda from Russia. promoted on social media."
2021-01-16 10:13,"You know, the NYT and media could calm the waters a bit, don’t you think?  Yes, many infections; but the vast majority are nothing burgers.  Encourage all to get the vaccine but encourage also those with materially less at risk to wait just a bit. 

Moreover, if saving lives is the goal (and if the Democrats would follow the science), the absolute test for vaccine should be two-pronged: age 60  and those with pre-existing known co-morbidities, regardless of occupation.

Finally, Texas is distributing vaccine in mass inoculations and it is getting the stuff out there, first come, first served.  These Governors who are otherwise micromanaging the distribution, as usual, are doing more harm than good."
2021-01-16 10:24,"I don't understand why the FDA isn't approving the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. There are millions of does available. My 92 year old father got his first dose last week. 

Whilst it isn't as effective at fully stopping the illness as the other two, it reduces the chances of hospitalisation - on one does - by over 90%.

The US vaccines are over 20 bucks a go and the AZ one is just 2, and it doesn't need super cold storage. Whatever the US does or doesn't do, it will form the backbone of the global response. In the meantime though more people could needlessly die."

Just in the NY Times and SF newspapers, one can read articles that insist rich countries (the US, Canada, European countries, Japan and South Africa already have more vaccines than they need for their entire populations (Canada reportedly has six times as much), but other articles that say there's too little vaccine being produced -- anywhere. Here in SF, it's possible to read one article whose author insists we've got no ICU beds left, and then pick up another article that insists hospital admissions are way down in the last month or so. Obviously both ""facts"" can't be true.

If one just sticks with COVID-19, it's possible to read one article that insists new cases and deaths are ""surging"", and another article that insists that both are dropping slightly (because of the vaccines).

Even Anthony Fauci appears to be stretching the truth. In a recent interview, he said that he used to say the US could develop herd immunity if only 70% of Americans were vaccinated, but then he gradually switched to 90% because, he said, Americans are now prepared to hear 90%. He said he's always believed the higher number, but didn't tell Americans that higher number because, he says, they weren't ready to accept it until recently

Are we idiots, or what? Whatever happened to consistency? To facts?"

If the Defense Production Act, instituted at the outset of the Korean War, can be invoked for organizing the allocation of materials for military defense production , or in 2020 for making PPE and fast-tracking production of ventilators, then why can't Biden immediately order another 5 or 6 of the larger US pharmaceutical companies to carry out production only of the quantities of vaccine the nation needs.  This is an unprecedented public health & economic emergency, and both the adaptive vision and the systems in place seem utterly inadequate, notwithstanding President Biden's determination to ""manage the hell out of this.""

As long as COVID stays alive in human hosts it will mutate. So far those mutations have resulted in a more contagious but thankfully no more deadly form.

But... there is no guarantee that this will remain true. Biden knows he must act swiftly to get ""shots in arms"" before a form of the virus comes into existence which may be more contagious and more deadly. He and his team also know they must embark on a program to improve anti-viral therapies and codify vaccine development technology for the longer term.

Having a plan does not ensure success but the absence of a plan means chaos and wasted effort, two things we can  not afford in this, the fight of our lives.

Biden and his administration are off to a good start, even before they are officially empowered and it is a good thing."

That means that companies have to be ordered, with the force of civil or criminal sanction, to produce the vaccine at full retooled assembly line capacity. Companies must retrofit existing production capacities to produce more, even though that means they suffer in the bottom line. Corporations are social fictions and only exist if willed to exist by all. The people have to take precedence over corporate ""health"". Would corporations fail to ramp up better to maker tanks for war? The big problem is that this is capitalism and that the loosely federated form of government we have is very, very inefficient.

2021-01-16 13:39,"These actions may not be sufficient. The administration’s actions need to be smart as well. Indeed, the current vaccination campaign can be much improved via better designs. 

For instance, much of the problems stems from the federal  government’s inability to provide smooth and predictable levels of supplies, which make it impossible for local and state authorities to plan and execute efficiently. Yet, currently the federal government is carrying a huge stock of vaccine, for it is holding back the 2nd shot on a 100% basis. Thus, even if we lose the entire vaccine supply chains, those already vaccinated would still get booster shots. However, how likely is such a catastrophic total shutdown? And even if such a catastrophe occurs, wouldn’t it be better to divert the vaccines in stock as 1st shot so that twice as many people will have some protection while the supply chain gets sorted out? In the meantime, to cushion random glitches and to ensure a smooth and predictable supplies to the state/local authorities, we should use the existing vaccine stocks as an inventory reserve, to be withdrawn when there’s an unexpected delay and to be replenished when the delayed supply comes in. With such a large inventory reserve, state/local authorities can be supplied on a far more consistent and predictable basis. Indeed, as the vaccine supplies chains are built up and become more robust, the reserve level can be reduced while still provide the same level of stability and predictability."
2021-01-16 13:47,"The US is the world epicenter for COVID-19, with more than 1/3 of all the new cases in the world, despite having only 1/25 of the world population.  This is due entirely to Trump’s narcissism, denial, and anti-competence.

The only way to defeat COVID worldwide is to first defeat it in the US.  That requires vaccinating as many Americans as possible as fast as possible. It matters less exactly which people and in which order.

This should be President Biden’s top priority for 2021.  After COVID has been defeated in the US, President Biden should work with our allies and with the World Health Organization to ensure a worldwide program to help vaccinate poor people around the world.  Otherwise, COVID will just return again next year.

Finally, President Biden should work with our allies and international agencies to promote long-term policies that ensure that the next pandemic never gains a foothold, anywhere in the world."
2021-01-16 14:38,"Here is Texas, vaccination is chaos. As the new mutation of the virus surges, our state’s vaccination program has given us ...a map. We’re on our own to try and find the vaccine. In our mid 70’s with several risk factors each, we qualify, but there are no appointments for us anywhere within 100 miles or more. A national vaccination plan, and competent adults in charge again can’t come soon enough."
2021-01-16 14:54,"Biden thinks he is announcing an aggressive plan to ship 100 million doses in 100 days, or 1 million per day? Since the vaccines were approved, that is the shipping rate already. 32 million doses in just over 30 days, including Christmas and New Years. So he is not proposing to make any increase. And Pfizer and Moderna have agreed with the US for 400 million doses by mid year. So why shouldn’t he do better?

The biggest issue so far is actually innoculating people, which is the responsibility of the states. They have used on average only 40% of the doses they have received, but even then, the rate has been steadily growing, and is currently up to 844k per day. So again, Biden is not expecting to make much of an improvement.

Why not report on those states that have done the worst job in getting people vaccinated? You could start with California, which has only used 30%, and ranks near the bottom. Texas, Florida, and NY have done much better, with rates of 40-50%."

The vaccine first needs to go where it can be delivered and administered most expeditiously to avoid waste, not where there will be the most appealing sound bite (rural areas, inner cities, third world countries, what have you).  Every person vaccinated is a win when supplies are short, and with all due respect, I’m not sure National Guard troops should give injections and observing for anaphylaxis.  How about recruiting (and vaccinating) retired MDs and RNs?"
2021-01-16 15:32,"Throwing vaccines at people doesn't make a difference if they refuse to take them. We need to educate them better. Education is cheap and effective. But saying, ""It's safe"" is obviously not enough. Most infected people have no symptoms and it's much easier to get the virus than the shots. It's no wonder people don't want it. Elderly people are likely to take it, but not younger people. Why would they? The virus confers immunity also and we have no idea how long the immunity from the vaccine lasts. Until these questions are answered, people will avoid it out of confusion."
2021-01-16 15:47,Plans and good intent are welcome but they need to be connected to realty. The level of production needed to supply so many vaccines takes time and will not happen in January. The criminal incompetence of the Trump mis-administration has killed tens of thousands of us and will continue to do so. We look forward to more competent leadership in rolling out distribution as the vaccine is available. We should use any in production without corporate favoritism and getting vaccinated must be mandatory for school or job site attendance or government financial assistance after a certain date of availability.

Trump showed the US bureaucracy that a Vaccine can be developed, tested, approved, and millions of doses produced in 9 months.   I hope the lesson is not lost.  This is the Trump vaccine, and if it were to prove ineffective/dangerous/etc, it will be blamed on his administration.

2021-01-16 14:38,"Thank you, Mr. President (Elect). Hopefully, your Administration will take over a few minutes after Noon, four days from now. The Republican Administration before your Democratic Administration, had botched or derailed or destroyed so much of America’s foundation and political infrastructure that you’re starting from a position a lot like our Nation was in on Monday, December 8th, 1941. That was the day after the Empire of Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, as well as many other sites across the Pacific Ocean. Prior to that day, a Conservative Congress and Supreme Court had been arrogantly blind to the Second World War raging the Globe everywhere but here in America. After Mr. Roosevelt’s Declaration of War, our Nation rose up with one united purpose and went to War. 

But, even with such united purpose and great energy and haste, it took about a year-and-a-half before we were up to speed. All sorts of logistical and technological problems had to be solved. People and mines and factories  had to be modernized and mobilized. This United States of America became the Arsenal of Democracy, supplying many of our allied nations with materials, weapons, and determination. A year-and-a-half later the Allied Nations of the World destroyed and defeated the Axis Powers. Our Nation played an important role in that Victory.

We, today, are in a similar situation as we were on that Monday. Covid-19 is as vicious and more terrible an enemy as the World  faced then. Godspeed Joe Biden."

Trump and his administration: have been indifferent to people's suffering, have been in denial, have been lying to the American People and they have turn this crisis into a political fight for their own survival. prior to November elections.

As of today, the USA's stats are rather dramatic: since February 2020, we are now approaching 400K death, we have over 23 million people contaminated and money spent right and left without us being able to prove the efficacy of the investments made (with the rare exception for the money that went to the development of a vaccine.)

I hear here and there that in the spirit of Unity we should let things go. It would be more criminal I believe if we did not make the efforts and the necessary investigations to understand what happened. 400,000 souls demand us to act and do everything we can to understand and make everything we can to prevent such a catastrophe to happen again."

2021-01-16 16:25,"I hope the expected surge in vaccine production materializes so that Biden can get vaccination to the people who suffer most and die most from this virus 

Certainly we cannot rely upon the medical community to vaccinate anyone but their selfish selves.  They have been vaccinating themselves and denying vaccination to older general public for 5 weeks now and are still vaccinating only themselves and denying vaccine to older general public

Massive additional vaccine supply will be necessary for Biden to succeed vaccinating older Americans because he, too, is determined to deny vaccine to older Americans until every last young medical worker is vaccinated (most of whom never interact with patients & many of whom aren't really medical workers, they are clerks, food service, administrative who work at medical facilities)
 
Biden, too, is determined to deny vaccine to older general public until the vast army of young teachers are vaccinated

But we needn't worry about all the politicians.  They, young and old, got vaccinated a month ago during the first days of vaccination (or even before that).  Just ask AOC who gleefully waved her privileged vaccine access in our faces

The medical community inside government and across the nation have betrayed the public, serving their own selfish selves by denying vaccine to those who suffer most from the virus, causing many thousands of unnecessary deaths.  So, too, the politicians have betrayed the public except in West Virginia"

2021-01-16 16:50,If a person is gets tested (PCR) regularly and obtains results indicating no detection of coronavirus the next step should be to get inoculated regardless of age.
2021-01-16 16:55,"It is disturbing that the Trump Administration promised large numbers of doses of the RNA vaccines to the States, and were not honest about the inability of the manufacturers to meet these numbers.  It is yet another lie in a long list told by the Trump Administration.  With a Covid variant which is much more highly transmissable expected to be the dominant strain by March, many of us who looked forward to being vaccinated will now have to wait longer; nobody can tell us how much longer, and we need to become even more careful and isolated.  Right wing media will likely try to pin the blame on the Biden Administration, but the blame falls squarely on Donald Trump for not being honest with the American people."
2021-01-16 17:13,"This reader hits the nail on the head:

""President Biden should ... work with Pfizer and Moderna...assuming that enough raw materials can be obtained.""

As I understand matters, Pfizer and Moderna ""promised"" to make more vaccine if and only if the US government ""guarantees"" sufficient raw materials. Raw materials haven't been forthcoming, and so Pfizer and Moderna aren't required to make more vaccine. There also is a shortage of health care workers to administer the vaccine.

Bottom line: Fewer and fewer vaccines are being administered. By the end of summer 2021, a vaccination probably will be administered to anyone who wants one, but it sure isn't that way now. 

In addition, what's with the new plan to administer just 1 shot and then hope that enough additional vaccines will show up to give someone Shot 2? The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were approved by the FDA only on the assumption that 2 shots would be given (though each WOULD have been FDA-approved merely by showing 50%+ effectiveness). Now I have to worry whether someone at my local grocery store has received only 1 shot rather than 2 --  whether he is 95% protected or only 50%? Frankly, I preferred the OLD WAY"
2021-01-16 17:14,"Imagine that; mustering the collective force of federal, state and local government to address the most pressing crisis of our time. Not preening or tweeting. Governing.

2021-01-16 17:24,"What does the FDA say?

""When all the seniors are given this vaccine, there will be an army of people to help...""

Depends on what's meant by ""given this vaccine."" The FDA approved the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines on the assumption that 2 shots would be given. Maybe the FDA WOULD have approved one or both vaccines if only 1 shot was given, but the FDA was never asked that question. Both Trump and Biden now say 1 shot is good enough, but let's not forget that the FDA has never said that. Now we have to wonder not only whether the ""other guy"" has been vaccinated or not, but also whether he's received 1 shot or 2? Frankly, I liked the old way better."
2021-01-16 17:44,"Can't say I've read the Defense Production Act, but I doubt it's  a panacea. I hear it's been ""invoked"" thousands of times, with no positive effect that I can see. My hunch is that any manufacturer with two brain cells to rub together can fit within some exception, so that the manufacturer (for example) need NOT convert an auto-parts plant in Indiana to vaccine production. Financial incentives are what moves manufacturers -- nothing more, nothing less. If the US government promises to buy every dose of vaccine a manufacturer produces, that's called a financial incentive. 

In short, the DPA won't save us. The US government promise to buy every dose of vaccine might. Biden has promised that. So has Trump."

Really? Apparently vaccines are resident-specific! Why aren’t we allowing anyone who wants a vaccine no matter where they are from in this country to get one??? I never had to be a VT resident to be tested for covid. This blows my mind and boils down to states trying to squeeze taxes, obviously. But, in the middle of a pandemic????

2021-01-16 16:14,"Frankly, what Biden is doing is expanding the number eligible in the Phase 1B priority while proposing nothing to expand supply other than the promise to ""manage the hell out of this operation"".

In New Jersey,  right now, there are 4 million, out of a population of 8 million, that are newly qualified but only a 100,000 vaccinations available weekly meaning it will take 40 weeks to get through this group at this rate.

The hope of increased vaccine availability are just hopes while the prospect of a J&J one-shot vaccine is already hampered by production delays. 

Biden has a small time window to show significant progress in vaccine inoculations before dissatisfaction translates into electoral losses in 2022."
2021-01-16 15:02,I have no doubt Joe Biden will do everything in his power to get this vaccine rollout working better than it is now. How could it possibly be worse?

After nearly a year it is a testament just how stupid human beings can be when protecting themselves and loved ones in taking such simple basic steps and yet it is apparently some infringement on simpletons` rights to expose themselves and everyone else to a death sentence. BRILLIANT. Do you want to stop Covid-19 in its killer tracks? Trying using your brain for a change.
2021-01-16 19:18,"""Biden Pledges Federal Vaccine Campaign to Beat a Surging Coronavirus...""

And Biden *will* deliver. And save millions of our lives.

Trump 2016 and 2020 voters who still champion Trump should think *very* carefully about how Biden is saving their lives now.

And wants to pass legislation to make their and everyone else's life, health, and opportunity better.

And Biden *can*deliver. And make all of our lives better.

So Trump 2016 and 2020 voters who still champion him should, at the very least, even if they want to maintain their Election Fraud delusion, tell their Republican Senators and Representatives to GET OUT OF THE WAY - and don't pull any of the OBSTRUCT OBSTRUCT OBSTRUCT nonsense that made all our lives much worse and worst of all put Donald Trump in the position of being able to kill 400,000 of us for naked political advantage before he leaves office on 1/20/21."
2021-01-16 19:26,"I shudder when I hear leaders use phrases like “get shots into more arms.” Does that mean the system will become first-come, first-served, with the chronically ill and elderly shoved aside, and the “prize” going to the most aggressive? I fear politicians’ desire to look good to voters will drive up the totals by ignoring the medical goals of getting the vaccine to those most likely to die from infection first, and also ensuring second booster shots are given in the effective time frame."
2021-01-16 16:06,"So long Trump Titanic.

Hello Biden Salvage Operation.

D to go forward; R for reverse.... over the cliff."
2021-01-16 21:41,"President-Elect Biden has to do more than just ""encourage states to expand vaccine eligibility to people 65 and older."" He has to require it, since old people are at greatest risk of death from Covid, and it is a moral imperative to allocate vaccines in the way apt to save the most lives. States like my own, which have run afoul of this principle, should not be allowed to persist in doing so."
2021-01-13 12:57,This is bad news indeed for those countries which depended upon China.  Probably something they should remember.  Meanwhile the production of effective vaccines from the rest of the world should be accelerated to fill the gap.  Every country needs access to adequate supplies to protect their citizens.
2021-01-13 13:04,"If the efficacy is about  is about 50%. it is as good as a placebo. 
Many feel that phase 3 data for the drug is now being carried out by other countries and the vaccine is yet to be peer reviewed"
2021-01-13 13:22,"The world has been enjoying a lot of schadenfreude from watching the US suffer so severely from this virus.  And, politically motivated people in the US seem to enjoy repeatedly presenting the utterly false claim to Americans that the US is suffering more than every other nation (even though several European countries have suffered as severely as the US).

But where will they turn when they want vaccine to protect them from this virus from China?  It won't be China.  It will be to the US.  It will be primarily the US drug companies, their researchers, their manufacturing people, and their logistics people who they will turn to.  And they will want us to give it to them free or nearly so.

And after we do......they will condemn us and politically motivated Americans will join them in their condemnation saying that we should have given it to them sooner by depriving Americans of being vaccinated first."
2021-01-13 13:23,"What do these results say about the actual efficacy of the vaccines used in China and the current state of the virus in China? 

Is China using a more effective vaccine for its' own people? Or are their results bogus and the virus continues to thrive in China?"
2021-01-13 13:23,Is anyone surprised? Authoritarian regimes are not capable of cutting edge science because independent thought is a threat to their government.
2021-01-13 13:30,"Interesting the article did not further explore the potential relationship between the inconsistent efficacy data and the use of older vaccine technology.  If the manufacturing process is not well controlled, all of the efficacy results reported could be correct for the batches used.  It just means you don't know if your country got a good batch or not until you do the study.  A Model T pushed to its limits will break down pretty regularly."
2021-01-13 13:30,"The article has failed to mention that Butantan showed yesterday that the vaccine has a much higher efficacy in preventing serious symptoms and therefore hospitalization. It might not prevent you from getting the disease, but it should prevent you from being hospitalized. If that is shown to be true in the real world, that's great news. Hospitals should not be strained to the point of collapse anymore. The article has also not mentioned that installed production capacity is enough to, together with Oxford's vacccine, vaccinate all (adult) Brazilians before the end of the year. Yeah, it isn't as effective as Pfizer's and Moderna's, but it is, if results are correct, a better deal. The article could have also criticized the point of view I presented here, which is the one still motivating serious, independent health officials in this country despite the low overall efficacy results. I get the geopolitics inclination of the article but it should have presented most information under the public health standpoint."
2021-01-13 13:48,"Actually a vaccine to protect from hospitalization is a best deal if Chinese vaccines can do it,  as said at the very end of article as if hoping the readers do not notice.  it is based on proven tech for decades so people don't have to worry about long term effect"
2021-01-13 13:51,"When there’s an ingrained culture of copy and paste in the country— abetted and facilitated by the state — it should should not come as surprise that when a novel problem emerges that requires original and innovative thought, Chinese state-backed ‘researchers’ will come up short. That’s why it’s hard to believe all talk of China rising to dominate the next technology and scientific revolution. Innovation requires the right incentives— profit maximizing, sound legal framework, and open exchange of ideas— which are all stifled by the authoritarian communist party. China will not overtake the west unless in influence unless there’s serious domestic reforms."
2021-01-13 14:29,"It is a problem that state propaganda and political pressure in China and fake news, protection of markets, and political spin in the West clouds the evaluation of this life-saving vaccine.  I get that science is messy, but unfortunately politics seems to have infiltrated every last public institution including science, reporting on science, and the WHO and CDC.  Which vaccine would I choose if given a choice?  I hope that experts and my doctors can cut through the fog."
2021-01-13 14:30,"Thank you to the letter writers who point out that the method of calculating efficacy can make one vaccine construct appear better than another. Everyone should remember that a vaccine doesn’t ever prevent infection, it limits the depth and duration of the disease e.g., if you are exposed to the flu, and you have taken the flu vaccine, you will generally feel rotten for about 48 hrs instead of ten days, and you won’t shed virus to others. Vaccines don’t kill the germ in your body, they build antibodies to fight the virus, and that takes a little time, so some people may show more symptoms for longer than others. Only harsh symptoms would be most relevant so the Pfizer numbers are appropriate and the more transparent use of all symptoms in the study in Brazil are appropriate science as well, just hard for the press and non-scientists to compare"
2021-01-13 14:36,"I would attribute the low Chinese number due to the fact that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are not manufactured in China. If they were, they would have been quickly stolen and copied. The Chinese have never respected intellectual property and the theft of technology is a cornerstone of their attempts to modernize."
2021-01-13 14:38,"Following the CoronaVac vaccine’s differing efficacy data in trials in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia, chairman Yin Weidong of Sinopharm said that the Brazil trials had found it to be 100 per cent effective in preventing ""severe Covid-19 cases.""

Every vaccine companies are playing the word and number game. If Pfizer considered patients with light symptoms in its efficacy calculation, the result would be much lower. And Pfizer never published its results in details, and we never question its calculation."
2021-01-13 14:46,"If the Chinese vaccine is not even close to being effective as those developed in the west, do we accept for immigration and airline travel purposes that those who have had the Chinese shot have satisfied any future immunity standard?"
2021-01-13 15:29,"China's skill-set is stealing technology from others, not developing it from within. Better for poorer countries to get something as important as a vaccine from other more reputable sources."
2021-01-13 15:30,"china initially said their vaccine was 78% effective but surprise, it's 50%. This is the same country that covered up the pandemic until it had rampaged across the globe and whose pharmaceuticals and consumer goods are notorious for dangerous contaminants. I would sooner self-inject diesel fuel than take a chinese vaccine.  Moderna, Pfizer and hopefully J&J, no problem."
2021-01-13 15:32,"Lumping Sinovac and Sinopharma
creates confusion. Sinopharma has
higher rate of effectiveness. It was tried
in UAE and other countries ,the results showed effectiveness of 73%."
2021-01-13 15:38,It seems fishy when the ‘actual’ efficacy reported barely meets WHO standards. Sort of when China revised their ‘actual’ COVID deaths to reflect a perfect 50% increase.
2021-01-13 15:42,"Wow, what a huge difference.

A person with a 50%-effective vaccination is 10 times as likely as someone with a 95%-effective vaccination to catch the disease, while someone with a 85%-effective vaccination is only 3 times as likely to catch the disease.

That is a huge difference. Serious investigations should be undertaken as to why different trials produced such a huge discrepancy."
2021-01-13 15:51,"The Chinese vaccines do not require refrigeration, which is significant for rapid distribution, particularly in developing countries. Pfizer’s vaccine uses -70 C for long term storage, and Moderna’ s uses regular refrigeration and still expires within a month. Nanoparticles are fragile! These limitations already hinder distribution in a country like the US, and would diminish the heralded 95% efficacy in countries without a widespread network of such storage systems."
2021-01-13 16:06,"What a strange article. I started reading the article thinking that this was a major setback. And ended the article very hopeful that we've found a solution. 

The article ends with a doctor in Brazil talking about the problem of misleading information, which is exactly what this article is. 

This story could have been told in so many ways. It sounds like there is evidence out there that this vaccine prevents the really bad symptoms. 

And as it turns out, the bad results in Brazil that it points to, are an outlier. Other results, in countries where the vaccine isn't so politicized by a psychopathic president (Bolansaro, who really seems like the spawn of Trump), show much better results. 

Also, if they were to just crank out that vaccine, instead of the fancy one that needs to be frozen, we could get everyone juiced in record time. 

Hit me with that juice, Bruce!"
2021-01-13 16:06,"China's relative vaccine failure provides us with an opportunity to do our humanitarian duty and  regain leadership in the world at the same time.

We can commit to a massive expansion of Pfizer and Moderna vaccine  production capacity and an at cost distribution to those countries unable to afford these 90% effective remedies. We can both supply the vaccine and provide the infrastructure upgrade as part of a WHO/UN initiative.

The cost-benefit ratio for this activity makes it the most attractive economic outlet for any capital at the present time and it also has the unique advantage of being the right thing to do.

This horrid pandemic could be turned into a tipping point for worldwide cooperation and a redemption of our standing therein."
2021-01-13 16:28,Help me understand why the companies with the most efficacious vaccines are not sharing the technology to other companies around the world?
2021-01-13 13:12,"What? I’m shocked! Things that are Made In China are flimsy and cheap, and barely last a season? Shocked!"
2021-01-13 14:04,"Please, give China the “recipe” for the vaccines that work so they can produce their own, as well as give it to the Brazils of the world.

We need to vaccinate as many people as we can, as fast as we can, regardless of country or profit, to stop the virus from mutating in to something unmanageable."
2021-01-13 14:15,"Here NYT wants the US vaccines to succeed because they are the only hopes we have to get back to normal living.

But on the other hand, it also wants the Chinese vaccine to be  less spectacular because of the country's non-democratic authoritarian system.

There will be misinformation about all vaccines.  And someone will ask about the US vaccine effectiveness when placed under similar stringent criteria (including the very mild cases) as the Chinese one?  In fact the medical director of the Brazilian trial gave his assessment but the article did not include it"
2021-01-13 14:19,Kudos to Brazil for risking retaliation from the CCP by reporting the inferiority of this vaccine.  Brazil may want to reach out to Australia to commiserate.
2021-01-13 15:49,"And the Chinese misstating the efficacy of their vaccine is a surprise to whom?  The Chinese exist by stealing technology from other developed nations and then manufacturing inexpensive knockoffs.  At the same time controlling their huge population with heavy handed measures.  

A nation which sprouted the current pandemic and delivered it to the world with lies and obfuscated internal data to diminish its culpability.  

A nation which is bullying its pacific neighbors who compete for fish stocks to feed their own population.  

Unless and until China begins acting like a first world nation it should be treated like the third world dictatorship it really is."
2021-01-13 16:00,"Unlike 9/11 where all of us stood together as one nation unwilling to let the terrorism divide our nation, our politicians have used the pandemic to sow constant division when our common enemy, China, has always been in plain sight.   Our corporate nation sold us out for a piece of the Chinese moon cake.    So, why are we surprised China is still given a stage to peddle misinformation?"
2021-01-13 16:03,"According to South China Morning Post, the 94.5% efficacy rate reported by Moderna and Pfizer for their vaccines did not include individuals who have mild symptoms of Covids were not tested. If these individuals were also included, the efficacy rate would drop below 30 percent.
In a separate article, reporters also reported that  the President of Brazil is against the Chinese vaccine and Covid by the governor who is contemplating running for President is promoting the same vaccine.

2021-01-13 17:28,"That's not entirely accurate. The 50% efficacy is for every group and every level of the development of the disease. The 78% refers to the efficacy of the vaccine for hospitalization cases, and the vaccine prevents death in 100% of the cases."
2021-01-13 17:32,"Throwing out the good in search of the perfect is a ver bad strategy to deploy against this virus. 

50% efficacy against COVID and 70-80% effect in preventing hospitalization that is easier to make and distribute is going to save a lot of lives, especially in poorer countries.  Any study of vaccine distribution will show that time is more important than effectiveness. 

Yes, in a perfect world we would have unlimited supply of 100% vaccine that is cheap to make, easy to administer  and shelf stable. We don’t. 

Articles like this that don’t consider the context of the situation are bad for worldwide public health. An effective vaccine now is much better than a perfect vaccine next year."
2021-01-13 18:47,"Besides the fact that the article spends the majority of its time trying to belittle the Chinese product while failing to mention the reason for the discrepancy in rates (78% vs 50% due to definition of how infections are measured), I also see people saying this shows the Chinese cannot innovate. Uh, at least the Chinese are trying. Who else in the west, besides the US and maybe Germany, has even come up with a viable vaccine? UK (AstraZeneca) had one trial report 60% and another report 90% efficacy, huge difference. France (Sanofi) just went back to the drawing board. Where are the Canadian, Australian, Italian, Spanish vaccines? Using the same standards one uses to judge China, one could say all these countries are ""failing to innovate"". Since we don't hear that, it must be people are using double standards."
2021-01-13 19:39,"Any vaccine is better than none, but after China's horrible track record of not only trying to mute any news of the virus initially, as well as allowing it to be spread to the four corners of the globe last January, make it easy to see why any discrepancies from vaccines effectiveness rates via state owned companies would be met with further distrust.  

This does not reflect on the Chinese people, but the CCP, who has been inflating data about Chinese growth for 40 years.  

The good news is that China is making an effort to help developing nations at an affordable cost.  Until J&J can release their vaccine, it's the best option in a world with very few."
2021-01-13 18:30,"Considering the logic of capitalism, it is natural that more modern and efficient vaccines (therefore more expensive and of more complex distribution) are and will be accessible mainly to rich countries - and, therefore, there is a demand and market for more outdated, less efficient, and cheaper vaccines, which the poorest countries will have to be satisfied with. This is how the world works, unfortunately: also in health and vaccines against covid-19, the rich will have greater safety and protection with the best vaccines available and the poor will get sick and die in greater numbers, 'protected' by second-class vaccines. PS: I'm Brazilian, so Pfizer and Moderna will not be available for me, only Sinovac and Astra Zeneca."

2021-01-13 21:18,"It's understandable a lot of people here want the Chinese vaccine to be less effective because of the country's non-democratic authoritarian system.  A ""communist"" country that can produce a good vaccine does not fit our political narrative.

However there is already so much misinformation about vaccines.  Telling people 50% of the truth is not OK..  It will make people ask about the US vaccines when placed under similar stringent criteria (including the very mild cases) as the Chinese one.  In fact the medical director of the Brazilian trial assumes a much lower effectiveness for pfizer/moderna vaccines.  Of course the article will not mention it."
2021-01-13 21:41,"With an effective immunity rate of about 50% for this vaccine, it is going to be nearly impossible to reach a herd immunity level of at least 70% (and we must keep in mind that some reliable estimates of the level of immunity needed to achieve herd immunity for this virus and its more transmissible variant are as high as 90-95%).

Even if every single person in the country receives this vaccine, 70% immunity can only be achieved if 20% of the population develops immunity from having been infected or by receiving multiple courses of the vaccine (a protocol that I am pretty certain has never been investigated for safety or effectiveness).  Furthermore, that 20% would need to include only those who failed to achieve immunity from the vaccine in the first place."
2021-01-13 22:04,"According to the British Medical Journal (i.e. google ""peter doshi, Pfizer"" ).  Pfizer's '95% effective rate' came from: out of 170 confirmed covid cases (of 30,000+ test cases), 162 was from the placebo group, 8 from the vaccinated group. (so, 8/170  is roughly 5%, or 95% effective).  However, there were another 3410 suspected covid cases excluded from the result, of which 1594 were from the vaccinated group (so, 1594 /3410 is roughly 47%, or 53% effective if including the suspected covid cases.)

Chinese data included suspected covid cases."

It seems that extraordinary degrees of evidence are only required when claiming that China's vaccines work, but not when trashing them!

On the other hand, the NYTimes was happy to proclaim Pfizer or Moderna to be miracle cures before either one completed Phase III trials. Even when the very same standard was used to call Chinese vaccines ""unproven"".

The authors also failed to mention that Brazil seems to be under political pressure to cast Chinese vaccines in a bad light. Earlier the NYTimes reported that a trial had been halted due to an unstated ""serious medical event"" in a patient.

Earlier today Sinovac just offers an explanation of the 50% efficacy rate from its Brazilian trial; many of the volunteers are healthcare workers who have higher exposure to the Coronavirus. In Pfizer trial the participants are mostly folks with normal exposure in daily life.

By not employing consistent trial methodology, not keeping a tight control of when and how the trial results are released, and not releasing test data for peer review; inevitably the inconsistent efficacy results have created concern and doubt.

Since this vaccine is based on a very well established vaccine technology (created from inactivated or attenuated virus); it might be prematured to discount its value. The low cost and regular storage temperature make this vaccine potentially well suited for developing countries if it works."
2021-01-14 2:21,"Just to clarify, the Butanta institute, which is well respected in Brazil and in the rest of the world for researching cures for diseases and more specifically for tropical diseases, later clarified that the metric '100% effectiveness in severe cases' has not statistical significance and more research is needed to prove this case."
2021-01-14 2:10,It will be better that USA give Brazil and other poor countries efficient vaccine free.
2021-01-14 3:02,"American technology the best, China's not great at all, is that hard to believe?"
2021-01-13 13:49,"Well, the flu jabs that we are encouraged to take every year have efficacy of under 70 percent. Should we call it a failure or its promotion a marketing tactic?"
2021-01-13 14:07,"I read from other sources with much more professional coverage on this and fount out this piece missed some really important information.

The Brazillian data published has multiple ties. This 50.4% data is the overall efficacy that included all cases, including very light symptoms while an earlier number 78% excluded those cases with light symptoms. This number uses similar statistic standard as of other trials. 

Pfizer/BioTech's 90% plus used the latter statistic standard. If Pfirzer/BioTech's data used the former standard that includes all cases, even those with very light symptoms, it would drop a lot, maybe below 50%.

All attention has focused on the dramatic efficacy results: Pfizer reported 170 PCR confirmed covid-19 cases, split 8 to 162 between vaccine and placebo groups. But these numbers were dwarfed by a category of disease called “suspected covid-19”—those with symptomatic covid-19 that were not PCR confirmed. According to FDA’s report on Pfizer’s vaccine, there were “3410 total cases of suspected, but unconfirmed covid-19 in the overall study population, 1594 occurred in the vaccine group vs. 1816 in the placebo group.”"
2021-01-13 14:01,"This should be a warning to to the developing world. The neo-colonialists will try to exploit every crisis to increase their hegemony under the guise of soft power - with belts and roads, hundred year leases on strategic ports, man made islands, sticks and stones, and now ineffective vaccines to lull unsuspecting victims into a false sense of security."
2021-01-13 14:10,"The vaccines that are being developed in poor or developing countries are way cheaper than what US, UK or other rich nations are producing. They often are better suited to the hot and humid conditions of such countries. Even if they are 50 percent effective, they will save 50 percent more people from getting affected or from getting hospitalized. By the way, read CDC’s report about the efficacy of the flu vaccine here in the US and one will be shocked to know the results. No fan of China here but neither of the selective reporting of facts for narrative purposes."
2021-01-13 14:11,"This article neglects to mention why the efficacy dropped. It's because of different definitions used for ""infection."" The 50% efficacy refers to all positive tests, including ""very mild"" infections, while the 70%+ efficacy number refers to ""mild"" infections. For an apples-to-apples comparison to Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, you would have to compare the definitions of ""infections"" used in those trials; with a less stringent definition, the efficacy rates of those vaccines would fall well below 95%. It seems NYT is just looking for any chance to belittle China with highly selective coverage."
2021-01-13 15:21,"Herd immunity in all nations rich and poor is achievable only when there is global herd immunity.
The alternative is every nation close their borders and let the pandemic run its course. Impossible to do. 
So isn’t it better for humankind that the formula for most effective vaccine be made public so the whole world can get back to normal as quickly as possible? 
I am too naive to think like this, but the talk of efficacy rates is a sad reflection of humanity."
2021-01-13 16:24,"Unlike 9/11 where all of us stood together as one nation unwilling to let the terrorism divide our nation, our politicians have used the pandemic to sown constant division when our common enemy, China, has always been in plain sight.   Our corporate nation sold us out for a piece of the Chinese moon cake.    So, why are we surprised China and it's state backed corporations are still given a stage to peddle misinformation?"
2021-01-13 12:52,Novavax will be announcing on two weeks s as well. Worldwide production already in place. Efficacy will be superb and it prevents transmission. Will be the gold standard.
2021-01-13 13:45,"If it works and hence they know there is a lot of money to be made off of it, they will ramp up production much more aggressively than they have to date. I know a lot of people who work in pharma, and (for the executives making decisions) it is all about the bottom line. They are not going to invest more than they have to before they know that there will be demand. Unfortunately, the pandemic will keep raging in the meantime..."
2021-01-13 13:47,"Like the article says, a little bit of mold in a corner, a little foreign particle inside a finished vial, and hundreds of thousands of doses may have to be discarded, and you start over again. Manufacturing injectables is tricky, it is both an art and a science."
2021-01-13 14:21,"The Defense Production Act could have been invoked last year to smooth supply and manufacturing problems.  Biden said he will do it on day one if required.  

Canada ordered NINE doses of vaccines for every person in the country, in order to get as many doses as possible as fast as possible.  

The US ordered just slightly over two doses per person.  

The losing candidate will leave office with 400,000 deaths on his hands."
2021-01-13 14:22,"As of the most recent data, NY has still only used 36% of the vaccine it has been allotted.  At the current rate of distribution, it will take several years to inoculate enough people in New York State.  So it does not seem to matter that Johnson & Johnson has production delays since we can't even distribute the limited supply we already have. The fact that the logistics of distribution was not fully worked out and in place, ready to go is shameful. There was plenty of time to prepare; many lives have been unnecessarily lost in the delay. Perhaps we need supply chain/logistics professionals from industry to help. People have been joking about involving Amazon, but is it really such an outlandish idea?"
2021-01-13 14:41,"J&J better shape up and get the job done!

But slowness of their vaccine production is NOT why deaths and hospitalizations are currently soaring.  The reason deaths are soaring is that unethical, immoral medical workers at CDC directed that all medical workers get the vaccine first (after all the politicians & their staffs, of course).  There are 21 million medical workers who thus became privileged despite that the vast majority of them are young (20-60) and despite that the majority of them never interact with patients (they included as medical workers the hospital/clinic employees who are administrative/clerical, food service etc).

Priority should have been only to medical workers who interact with patients and are over age 60.  Then the general public over age 65 beginning with the oldest first.  

Instead the immoral medical workers at the CDC intentionally chose to prohibit vaccination of older general public Americans, thus intentionally choosing that they continue suffering severely and dying in great number.  

Following are the CDC's own counts of the people they privileged to receive vaccine while denying vaccine to older general public Americans:

1A	Health-care personnel - 21 million
1A	Long-term care residents - 3 million
1B	Frontline essential workers	- 30 million
1B	Ages 75+  - 19 million
1C	Ages 65-74  - 28 million

If all Americans over age 65 were vaccinated, then Covid deaths would have fallen 85% and hospitalizations by 65%."
2021-01-13 14:48,"If I didn't know better, I'd think several of the commentators here so far are either J&J insiders or parties acting on their behalf.  No one expects or wants any company to rush a drug on to the market without maximum safety and certainty that it works.  That said, if J&J is not compliance with the contract they signed and money they took from the U.S. government, they could and should do a much better job of explaining why they're lagging behind on their original projections. Like any other manufacturer, however, if this is a case of where the firm made promises they could never reasonably keep, to score competitive points and boost their share price, they should pay fines or in some other way compensate the customer, in this case the U.S. government."
2021-01-13 14:51,"One of the major problems pharmaceutical firms face in this country is American lawyers. It is possible that tort lawsuits, many of which seem unjust and inappropriate, have deprived companies like Johnson and Johnson of the resources to rapidly produce vaccines.

J and J is one of the major targets of lawsuits, including claims that its baby powder products have caused ovarian and other cancers, and that its drug Respirdal had unexpected side effects such as breast enlargement.

Drug companies should not receive blanket immunity from legal liability for their products by any means.  At the same time, it truly seems that tort litigation in the US is way out of control. Verdicts often seem to be excessive and based on junk science. They are won because plaintiffs are often sympathetic, even when companies are not at fault. Many verdicts have been for literally billions of dollars each, and tens of thousands of more suits are pending.

During the 1970's and 1980's lawsuits nearly shutdown the availability of vaccines in the US. Only a last minute no-fault liability law, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, allowed vaccine production to continue.

The pandemic has shown that we need drug companies, which have the resources necessary to develop, test, and manufacture vaccines and drugs effective against the coronavirus.

We should not end legal liability, but Congress badly needs to reform the law.  We need vaccines far more than we need inappropriate lawsuits."
2021-01-13 14:55,"This is disappointing.  I've been frequently checking on J&J's progress, because it could be a game changer.  But looks like *if* it's effective, it's not going to have an impact on infection rates until late Spring at the earliest.  I was already rolling up my sleeve."
2021-01-13 14:57,"Under these circumstances, the refusal to consider the Oxford/Astrazeneca vaccine will consign many, many Americans to severe illness and death. We are not going to have a sufficient supply of other vaccines over the next few months, and this vaccine has been shown to be effective.  (In this crisis, the debates among experts about the data have acquired a kind of inside-baseball quality). If that effectiveness is best demonstrated with certain age groups, we should give it to those age groups. The delay in approval is becoming an example of letting the perfect be an enemy of the good."
2021-01-13 15:23,I am in the Johnson and Johnson single-shot study. I was just unblinded today and was informed that I received the vaccine on October 6. The injection went well; I experienced only arm soreness and redness for about 48 hours. A friend of mine in the same study experienced a headache and chest congestion for a few days.
2021-01-13 15:36,"Enough with the gloom and doom angle on every story!  The fact that we already have two highly effective vaccines being distributed and a possible third on the way is nothing short of miraculous.  That we are falling short of very ambitious aspirations is not surprising.  However, mass vaccination of high risk populations should rapidly decrease the strain on hospitals and death rates.  This is worth celebrating."
2021-01-13 15:43,"I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, I would expect any company receiving federal aid to fully utilize that aid in the manner in which it was prescribed. On the other hand, and I think more importantly, I understand vaccine development is not as simple as building a machine, and delays are inevitable. I'd love to see a third vaccine hit the market, but I refuse to blame J&J for any deaths in the meantime. It's not their fault half the country refuses to wear masks and stop going to parties."
2021-01-13 15:44,great news....when will FDA give emergency approval to the Oxford vaccine.    IF questions on its efficacy for higher risk persons  then just approve it for healthy 16-64 year olds with distribution via Pharmacies.
2021-01-13 15:55,"I am very uncomfortable with the RNA vaccines, putting the spike protein on the surface of your own cells seems like the perfect way to induce autoimmune diseases and I don't know if the trial lengths are long enough yet to let that show up.  Adenovirus vaccines have a much longer safety record and I'd be happy to get one of them, either this one or the Oxford one."
2021-01-13 16:12,"What J&J has done so far is already pretty impressive. 

A major bottleneck for viral vector vaccine production has always been scalability. Although, as indicated in the article, J&J scientists have found a recipe for producing the vaccine at a fast, reliable rate, assembling the vector vaccine is still a complex process, involving multiple steps and components, each of which increases the risk of contamination. Extensive testing is therefore required after every step, slowing production times and increasing costs."
2021-01-13 16:30,"Let's hope that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine succeeds. The World needs this vaccine as the infrastructure needed to store and deliver is not onerous.

Johnson & Johnson will do a great service to the emerging markets and the developing world as they neither have the infrastructure, nor the deep pockets for the mRNA vaccine.

I pray that Johnson & Johnson succeeds. And I wish them best so that they can increase manufacturing output substantially in coming months."
2021-01-13 14:11,"I received this vaccine 2 months ago (an antibody test confirmed it). I believe it’s prevented me from getting Covid at least once. And it seems safe — I didn’t have any side effects after the first night. So, as far as I can tell it works. And if it does, it will be an amazing boost to vaccination efforts globally, not just in wealthy first world countries.  Hopefully they will actually be able to catch up in manufacturing and this vaccine will accelerate the end of the pandemic."
2021-01-13 14:47,"In a single day, MORE than 4,400 preventable deaths were caused by covid in the US.  J&J is working on a vaccine that can save millions of lives.   Not just in the US, but across the world.  Before you badmouth J&J, put on a mask, and then ask yourself how much those saved lives are worth. 

In 2021, About 13,770 women in the US will die from ovarian cancer.  Some of these deaths MAY may have been caused by baby powder."
2021-01-13 14:37,"These glitches and the slow rollout of the vaccines are precisely the reason why we need Joe Biden and his administration in office. Trump has spent his time fomenting unrest, touring his incomplete border wall, and spewing fantasies about the last election—anything but doing his job: overseeing the fight against a pandemic that's crippled our economy, caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans, and that results in the deaths of thousands every day."
2021-01-13 13:04,"So, I was trying to see what exactly has been the problem that’s caused the delay, but it’s not really reported in this article. The article merely mentions towards the end that things like mold in a factory can delay the process. So, the reader is left wondering what exactly caused the delay and why the article can’t get to explaining or mentioning it!! So the article kind of keeps circling around the point, like wagons circling around a point endlessly. Why exactly are they having delays in manufacturing? One would think there’s no task more important and that the government would throw all the money in the world at this one task, especially since it’s a fraction of what it throws at wars, right?! So what’s the delay?! The other suspicion I have I think is the problem with all of these efforts: Trump! Perhaps he didn’t cooperate with some governments out there, so there weren’t as helpful as they might have been?! Also, I just wonder whether the owner of this company, who’s a known ardent Trump supporter, I believe he gave him the ambassadorship to the UK, perhaps hasn’t pushed things too fast cause his friend lost?! Seems trivial and like conspiracy, but if we’ve learned something the last four years, it’s that nothing is beyond Trump especially when it comes to sabotaging his opponents or cheating! Nothing is beyond his little mind!"
2021-01-13 13:55,"Thank you J&J.  Your vaccine could help the entire world, not just the rich parts."
2021-01-13 14:05,Not sure I fully understand why J & J will be unable to meet its production commitment.  Was there an event that has gummed up production or did they over-commit from the get-go?
2021-01-13 14:03,Three words: Defense Production Act.
2021-01-13 15:01,"Don’t worry , J&J. Our states and federal governments have so hopelessly botched the vaccine rollout that you have plenty of time. We’re still only at one third of doses distributed being administered! Let that sink in, as we huddle another endless month in social isolation."
2021-01-13 16:22,I do not trust Johnson & Johnson to make a vaccine after they made baby powder that caused cancer and painkillers that led to addiction. I am not anti-vaccine: I am anti Johnson & Johnson. I don't care quickly they develop it- I will wait if it means getting a Pfizer vaccine.
2021-01-13 16:40,"The US is the world epicenter for COVID-19, with more than 1/3 of all the new cases in the world, despite having only 1/25 of the world population.  This is due entirely to Trump’s narcissism, denial, and anti-competence.

The only way to defeat COVID worldwide is to first defeat it in the US.  That requires vaccinating as many Americans as possible as fast as possible. It matters less exactly which people and in which order.

This should be President Biden’s top priority for 2021.  After COVID has been defeated in the US, President Biden should work with our allies and with the World Health Organization to ensure a worldwide program to help vaccinate poor people around the world.  Otherwise, COVID will just return again next year.

Finally, President Biden should work with our allies and international agencies to promote long-term policies that ensure that the next pandemic never gains a foothold, anywhere in the world."
2021-01-13 16:46,"""Hiccups as small as mold in part of a facility could spur further delays.""

Mold in a part of a facility is not a hiccup, it is a serious violation of cGMP, the standard set by the FDA for manufacturing in this country.  Johnson & Johnson has been known to have serious quality issues for many years.  They have also contracted out manufacturing for years and the result is they have lost a lot of their expertise.  This once great company now just gobbles up the competition and relies on marketing to sell their products.  It does not surprise me that they haven't been able to ramp up manufacturing as quickly as promised. One of the great lessons of this pandemic is that when you off shore production, you lose expertise and you move to the back of the line in the event of an international emergency.  While the speedy development of this vaccine has been very successful, pharmaceutical manufacturing is complicated.  J&J will be looked at very closely by the FDA, because of its many lapses in the past."
2021-01-13 17:08,"My question is do we as citizens that paid for these vaccines to be created from the start own the patent on all of the vaccines? This is a valid question as tax money has been used to develop medication for years and pharmaceutical companies control the patent, and then gouge the consumers that paid for their development. 
We need these vaccines, but our government should start holding all patents for immunizations, other treatments, and drugs developed with tax payer money. 
This seems like a great time to stop corruption in the pharmaceutical industry. 
Anything tax money is used for is owned by the people. Anything using tax money is not “free market”. It is fraud."
2021-01-13 18:45,What exactly in the manufacturing process is the problem?
2021-01-13 20:12,"This push to vaccinate everyone has me nervous. Yes, the at risk population, elderly and front line workers  should be vaccinated. Most of the deaths have been the elderly. Mask wearing social distancing, hand washing etc... Are all effective ways to keep the virus from spreading. The media has seized upon fear and panic. Creating paranoia and anxiety. I feel the main push behind vaccinations is driven by money. Billions lost in the economy. And the billions the drug companies producing the vaccine will make. I for one will not be a guinea pig for profit."
2021-01-13 21:05,"I live in Bogota, Colombia.

At 71 - I volunteered to be a guinea pig for Johnson vaccine.

Injected on Dec 9 - I had symptoms that made me think I was not a placebo guy.

And they draw a lot of blood.  

29 days later - I had a check up with the testers where they did a physical routine and drew more blood.

Because this is a double blind test - they cannot tell you anything.

Though a nurse told me that prior to Dec 9 - my blood indicated that I had no exposure to Wuhan - that means no anti bodies.

Since they will not tell - I went to an independent lab - just yesterday - now some 4 plus weeks later - to see if I had developed anti bodies.

The lab said - de nada - a big zero.

So, despite my reaction to a possible Johnson vaccine shot - I have nothing to show for."

2021-01-13 15:19,"“The premise of the program was that the federal government would front the costs of development and manufacturing so that vaccine makers could mass-produce doses even before the vaccines were proved to work.”  Same for COVAX.  Great and bold idea with $ to match.

Over the past 10 years they purged those white males who had the experience and expertise they now so desperately need.

There is a huge wave of layoffs coming (and already in progress) by the state and local governments which have been absolutely clobbered by the pandemic and desperately need a major bailout.

They are the legislative branch of our government. He should demonstrate that he respects the Constitution's separation of powers, so unlike the current president. He can demonstrate his character through his actions with nominees to cabinet, his initiatives to attack COVID-19, economic recovery, etc. The media should be pre-empted from continually asking such questions by stating this period of no comment until a final result in Congress has occurred."

The extra costs of working from home, remote schooling, supplies, in some cases lack of overtime pay puts us in a financial bind. Can we the middle class catch a break? The poor gets assistance, the wealthy gets all the tax breaks and the middle class gets very little or nothing while trying to hold this broken country together. If you don't need the check or you are opposed to it, and receive one, donate it to charity or send it back to the Feds."

So a stimulus check that pays the rent and other fixed expenses tat keeps the landlord solvent and prevents the utility company from laying people off helps.  State aid is clearly needed in this respect to keep to prevent public employee layoffs and other bad outcomes.

Long term infrastructure projects are a good idea. The Democrats need to understand that from a long term climate change perspective, one of the top priorities should be high speed rail connecting medium to large cities in the south and midwest. e.g. Dallas to Minneapolis and Columbus.  These are Republican states, but if you truly care about the future, that's the place to go."

And if the $2,000 each does happen, it is only because the government wants to make as many people as possible dependent for their existence on Uncle Sam, because that way people are more easily controlled and accept Sunday rest by law when that comes as it will sooner than later. PLEOPLE NEED TO WORK is what they need to do as that was the way America dug their way out of The Great Depression during what some refer to as the ""dirty thirties."" I was born in 1945, but my father was born in 1919 and he told me before he sadly died in 1994 about those days. They had what was called the CCC or Civilian Conservation Corps, started by F.D.R. which was an agency authorized by the Government to hire unemployed young men for public conservation work. The corps was set up as part of the emergency program in 1933 and formally organized by an act of Congress  in 1937. It provided both training and employment. Why won't that be done? See above."

trump is behaving exactly like a junky being evicted after foreclosure - doing as much damage as possible before he is physically tossed out. It is a disgrace to the country, it hurts every American, and the long term damage it is doing domestically and in terms of the USA as a world power is immeasurable.

2021-01-14 14:39,I'm curious to see how quickly the Republican budget hawks will now start claiming how much Biden and the Democrats will burden our economy with more debt. Funny that for the past 4 years there were no complaints about the tax cuts adding debt or Trump stealing money from military funds to build his wall that was supposed to be paid by Mexico or how much money was spent on Trump's golf excursions.

2021-01-14 16:05,"Republicans peddle the myth that the economy was great under Trump but that’s just another Big Lie. Look at a chart of the rate of economic growth. The rate of growth starts to fall right after Trump was elected, and his failure to follow the pandemic plan Obama left him caused the pandemic and economic damage to be much, much worse than it needed to be. Remember that Obama and Biden had to pull us out of the Great Recession that Bush and the unregulated banks caused, too. Trump’s economy was just the fumes from Obama economy, with a big boost for the wealthy. That Republicans are good for the economy is probably the biggest Big Lie."

I wish I could enjoy the story of Democrats once again improving the economy, helping working men and women get healthcare, and conquering disease but I’ve spent enough time listening to Fox News after the bloody riot they caused with their election lies, and how they talk about Biden and the Democrats, to know that they will blame Biden for any failures in his pandemic campaign, failures for which Fox News gave Trump a pass until nearly 400,000 were dead, to know that their talk of “unity” and “healing” is just another of their nation destroying psy-ops campaigns."

Even if the amount of $2000 needs to be increased I am fine with that, but give to those who are impacted by the pandemic not those who have not seen a fall in income. Large injection of funds will lead to inflation and snuff out the nascent recovery."
2021-01-14 16:50,"This is an absurd amount of spending. This is going to lead to a devaluation of the dollar. In 2020 20% of all US dollars in circulation were created. Yes, 20%, 1/5 of all dollars were created in a single year. But here is the problem.

The economy is not based on money, it is based on the creation of value. Stuff, services, etc. Our productivity is determined by how much stuff we make and services we provide. Money is a standardized unit we use to trade stuff and services. If we create more money without creating more value we are reducing the ability of the currency to trade. It's essentially like a stock split, we aren't creating more value by creating more money. 

One of the biggest reasons countries don't do this is because this leads to inflation, the devaluation of currency. When people expect inflation it significantly lowers how much you can buy with it. If sellers thinks the money you are giving them now will be worth less later they are going to ask for more of it, thus driving down the value even more in a vicious cycle. Examples of this include in the Weimar Republic, Zimbabwe, and Venezuela.

But, this is also why countries very rarely default on their loans unless they are required to pay in another country's currency. US dollars are almost always the currency used because it is considered to be a stable currency. Fears about this is part of why bitcoin is high.

Bottom line is if we print more money without generating value it is going to cause problems."

Under Trump, McConnell and the GOP Senators had no concerns about deficits.  But under President Biden, McConnell will suddenly insist that deficit spending is evil.  Of course, he will also block any tax increases on the wealthy or large corporations.

This will make defeating COVID difficult, and will make any economic recovery very slow.

But to McConnnell, ensuring the failure of President Biden is the main point.  He did it before with President Obama.

The Senate must change its rules to eliminate the filibuster.  Otherwise McConnell will block everything that Biden proposes.

I'd rather see a more coherent and aggressive plan for vaccine production and distribution. Basically: spend whatever it takes to get the economy *safely* reopened.

The truth is the government only has a few options that can help. This stimulus is based on the thought that if people are given some extra money that they will spend it and spur some growth in the economy. It doesn't address the real problems like income inequality. Economic growth in the past is based on rising wages. The only government program which can help there is a nationwide infrastructure plan at scale that was used after the Great Depression.

Please, give the money to those people who need it. Those who lost jobs, houses and income need this money. Restaurants, music venues, and other independent small businesses need this money. Too many people living in the streets and without jobs to be giving 1,000's of dollars to people who have not lost income.

The biggest target for this kind of money should be in ending homelessness and supporting small businesses that were destroyed and all the employees that were laid off.

These people will spend the money and that will do what economists call ""increasing the velocity of money"", which is the most stimulative thing that can be done.   

Those who have not lost their jobs,  who are not on the street, are still profitable in their businesses, do not need a hand-out.  Sending hundreds of billions to those who don't need it is not an intelligent use of the money.  We need to use the same thinking in subsidies for oil companies, etc.

We need to make every dollar count and we need to move fast.   All those on unemployment should go back to the extra $600 or at least $500 per week supplement, a huge amount of effort needs to go into affordable housing and getting people off the street, into training that puts them to work doing what they are most gifted at doing.

Millions of dollars intended for rental assistance went unspent in my state last year as hundreds faced evictions. The level of documentation, bureaucracy, and landlord cooperation needed to wade through made it nearly impossible for many folks to receive help.

However, those $2,000 checks should only go to those who are unemployed or the working poor. Those of us with healthy-enough incomes and a job intact, have had plenty of time to save by not eating out, not travelling, not going to sporting events, etc.. 

Let’s really pinpoint those in need, keep them in their houses with some food on the table and a vaccine in the arm and move on from this disaster!"

There seems to be endless funding for liberal pet projects, giant infrastructure or pet industries, which is mostly money down the drain, and does nothing to address the root cause of environmental collapse anyway. Hasn't enough been targeted already for vaccination distribution and testing in the recent stimulus bill? How much of that is enriching the corporate healthcare industry? It's far better to think in terms of universal benefits that exclude no one.

2021-01-14 19:41,"My neighbor hasn't worked in 3 year's and is completely fine with sitting at home drinking bear all day instead of trying to do anything that even remotely looks like betterment I agree that their is a need for help in areas absolutely but something needs to be done with the tapeworms as well because helping these kind of people is throwing good money after bad and none of us should be footing the bill for that rich, middle class or, poor 

Not only that we would all have more than enough money to go around without tax hikes if something was done to restructure the way the federal , state, and local governments had their yearly budgets structured the way they all work is if they don't spend they won't get that much the next year so they all waste millions and I mean all the way down to the public school level I've seen it first hand THAT'S WHAT NEEDS CHANGE RIGHT NOW!"
2021-01-14 19:42,"It's time to ditch the failed, ""Laffer Curve"" economics that started with Reagan, and return to demand=-ide Keynesian economics that have worked just fine.

It's simple really.  Giving money to the already wealthy will result in an increase in personal investment, which does nothing for the economy.  Government spending to increase the income of those who will spend it, along with projects like infrastructure and clean energy that will increase jobs and have the same effect will work much faster.

It all worked just fine before Reagan.  Just look at the period following WWII for an example."
2021-01-14 14:20,"Even with decades of experience, stepping into the position of POTUS is daunting under ideal circumstances.   However, the contrast between President Biden, and Individual One, is like heaven vs hell."
2021-01-14 17:38,"We are watching the putrefaction of late-stage capitalism.
US economic decline has progressed to the point where the very survival of the American Empire requires continued looting (i.e., stealing) of large amounts of public money from the US Treasury to: 1) prop up Wall St. and insolvent banks (circa $7 trillion in 2020), without which many will collapse, and 2) subsidize the Pentagon and strategic debacles in Afghanistan (longest war in US history), Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen.
Biden/Democrats and Republicans are in 100% agreement on this. Dems will not do anything jeopardizing the money flow to the ruling Kleptocracy.
This is a dead-end strategy as ever-increasing economic resources are being used to prop up nonproductive institutions (finance & military) and fueling historically unprecedented high debt levels. As this continues, it is eroding US economic strength and endangering the role of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency.
To quote economist Richard Wolff:

""The Federal Reserve is sustaining US capitalism — directly by loaning to corporations and indirectly by loaning to the federal government — to run a huge deficit, excess of trillion dollars... The federal government is not an intrusion; the federal government is the only thing that keeps private capitalism from a complete bust... And what do we know about this way that the Federal Reserve is keeping capitalism going? It's funding the most extreme inequality in a century of American history."""
2021-01-14 19:47,Don’t let the greedy GOP say there is not enough funds for the stimulus check .  Make Trump and his tax evading family start paying their fair share .  Even big corporations like Apple that got big tax breaks back from the GOP  the last four years.
2021-01-14 20:27,"i see nothing in this report about what he plans to do to reinforce the faltering vaccination effort.. the report talks solely about economic relief, with vaccination efforts again being left in the dust. the cart is being put in front of the horse. if vaccination is successful, people will naturally go back to work and economy will naturally revive."
2021-01-14 20:55,"We will never dig out of this hole we are digging. My children will not and their children will not. So much money will be diverted to pay interest that economic investment will suffer. Taxes will have to be raised but the flip side is the government will have to reduce its spending - everywhere. We will be like Greece during the financial crises, only on a more massive scale."
2021-01-14 21:06,Complete Student loan debt cancellation and a re-tuning of the program so that interest on all student loans never totals more than 1% of the entire loan must be included in any economic reform package.
2021-01-14 21:50,"Not so sure, politically. This may backfire on the Dems if rates go up in advance of 2022. Remember, Biden won by less than 100k votes, Dems almost lost the House, and it took political negligence by Trump for Dems to tie in the Senate. None of the 2020 Trump induced political tailwinds or a pandemic will be present in 2022."
2021-01-14 22:09,Tax every Wall Street transaction for the next 18 months.
2021-01-14 22:11,"Biden is off to a good start. The potential weakening of the dollar that may result from his stimulus package will aid exports and further bolster full employment. It may hurt China, which is heavily invested here, but that is all the better.  They are not our friend."
2021-01-14 22:11,This whole package will be a good one. I hope those Democrats will respond to it.
2021-01-14 22:12,This is going to be an amazing start to his Presidency. I would think that he could get 54 votes in the Senate!
2021-01-14 22:13,"I am in agreement with this package. Many conservatives and left may argue that this is “too much”. However, if we think about it, we have been battling covid for almost a year now, and during 11 months, we have only seen two stimulus package, and the most recent one was half the aid to the people than the first. My only concern now is that many people that previously qualified, and continue to qualify, are being left out of the stimulus, of the EILD, of the COVID SBA small business grant opportunity.

What margins and qualifications are they using? It should be the same for all, and even more now after all these months of economic hardship, people who didn’t qualify before on the first package, may now qualify. That has to be worked around and considered."
2021-01-14 22:14,"Let's hope the $1400 payments are targeted to people that actually need them and don't get distributed based on 2019 income levels.    

The funding for 100,000 public health workers makes all the sense in the world!  Bravo.

Will this require 51 votes in the Senate or 2/3 majority?"
2021-01-14 22:14,"It’s a start. This country has a massive public spending deficit going back decades. This is but the first installment of what has to be a real turnaround. 

Getting the pandemic under control is essential. Jobs, inequality, infrastructure, and climate change above all - there’s a lot to do.

Getting the GOP under control is even more critical, especially with the sedition caucus challenging Biden’s legitimacy at every turn and reflex GOP posturing on deficits."
2021-01-14 22:15,"A hopeful start, but we're going to need a lot more than a few good stimulus packages to recover society from it's steep freefall of the previous 4 years."
2021-01-14 22:15,"I don't see a thing to complain about here. Raise taxes on the rich? Absolutely. Many of them pay zero taxes. It's high time they pay more. Get more people vaccinated? Once again, a great thing. Help state budget shortfalls? They need lots of help. Get kids back to school? Big win for education! So what's with the grumbling? This proposal is a risky move? Fantastic! I'm glad it is. It may even scare some voters. Good. Congratulations Democrats, you're actually doing something to help us."
2021-01-14 22:18,"Necessary. BUT...lower the income level to qualify. 75,000 per year is really not where the need is."
2021-01-14 22:18,And once again student loan reform/forgiveness is put on the back-burner...
2021-01-14 22:19,"Biden eliminating the ""trickle man"".A real program with real benefits.I'm retired and have more money now than when the pandemic started.The stock market and outside spending reduction have been good to me and millions of Americans.I will willingly pay my share of increased taxes to get this country back on it's feet.We stand on the shoulders of essential workers.Pay em for that."
2021-01-14 22:20,Are we just going to pay people unemployment forever?  I don’t understand why people who lost a job during the pandemic get to be on the government payroll without providing anything to the country.  It’s like winning a lottery.
2021-01-14 22:22,"I, too, plan to give Biden every chance and the benefit of the doubt. I believe he understands that many Americans will be looking to this as the first big test of what kind of President he will be. So I hope he is able to resist the clamoring for porkbarrel to be jammed into this bill, not only from the other party but from his political party as well. A primary concern over Biden I have in the back of my mind is that he is an old-time politician and may slip very easily into the now established pattern of political payoffs in the form of hidden bills and laws within the sheep's clothing of a supposedly beneficial program. This will be especially important in this case because of the gigantic amount of money involved in his plan and the Trump plan combined. So, President-elect Biden, good luck to you, and please be sure to stand with the rest of us and not merely with the current established beneficiaries of governmental largess."
2021-01-14 22:22,"I am not an expert on MMT, but this is the one instance in recent US history that the thinking behind that economic policy has to be put into practice."
2021-01-14 22:15,What time will this speech take place?
2021-01-14 22:23,"They must give the $1400 to only the 10-15 million out of work. If circumstances financially have not changed for retirees on Soc Sec or those still working as they did pre pandemic, do not give money to them as circumstances did not change!"
2021-01-14 22:23,"Mr. Biden will have to compensate for any defecting moderate Democrats with Republican votes at a time of scarce bipartisanship.

Moderate Democrats defecting? But that would mean these moderate Democrats would  be acting immoderately, especially because they'd end up forcing Biden to meet exacting Republican demands in order to get anything done."
2021-01-14 22:24,"Difficult times require out of the box thinking. The status quo of band-aid measures is not the answer. The scale of the problems is massive. To get ahead of the issues of economic losses and pandemic support . You have to plan big.  Biden has been given monumental challenges. He must present monumental solutions. Unlike Trump, Biden is up to the challenges."
2021-01-14 22:25,"It makes me quite happy seeing a dedicated, qualified man acting presidential and helping the citizens. It's going to be a long, hard road to recovery to repair the economy and create social & economic justice. Fortunately there are sources of revenue - those who have not been paying their fair share of taxes. A new army of IRS personnel looking for rich tax cheats will easily pay for itself and help bring us back, Mr. President."
2021-01-14 22:28,"I can’t stand the fact that I’m living in a country where the most important newspaper in the nation frames an actual pro-growth, pro-people, pro-society president -a Democrat who once again has to rush in to fix the mess left by another GOP administration- as soon to face “logistical challenges.”"
2021-01-14 22:11,"What happened to 2K/month checks until the pandemic is over, Senator/Vice President-elect Harris? Don’t expect much from Biden. But I was hoping you would vigorously advocate for suffering Americans."
2021-01-14 20:00,"While Joe is throwing money from his speeding presidential motorcade to fight coronavirus perhaps he can throw some at Arco to fix the debit card readers on their gas pumps in the name of disease prevention.  With my face mask I pull up to the most remote pump I can to reduce my human contact and hope to pay at the pump with my debit card with the minimum amount of surface contact, only naturally to find the card reader out of order and forcing me to have to go indoors a crowded minimart office to pay a cashier in person with cash.  And we wonder why in spite of Dr. Fauci the disease is spreading."
2021-01-14 20:40,"""he will need 10 Republican votes in the Senate to overcome a filibuster""

Why accept that?

Let's require that filibusters return to their original form, where if someone wants to block a bill they have to stand there and talk for days to defend their position,

Otherwise, return to passing bills with 50 votes, as it has been through our history up until the recent Republican obstructionists took over"
2021-01-14 20:47,"It won’t be too long now before the dollar falters and is no longer the world’s reserve currency. Consider a 30 year mortgage because you’ll never see rates this low again. Goodbye U.S. Dollar. 
Hello Chinese Renminbi."
2021-01-14 20:51,"What a frustrating comments section. It seems that all of these “fiscal conservatives” commenting here have zero problem with creating money out of thin air to prop up corporations and to dole out free money to them in the trillions during the pandemic, for these corporations to use this free money to buy back stocks to make sure the market isn’t affected by the current economic crisis... They were to use this money to keep employees on the payroll. Instead they STILL laid off and eliminated jobs. Instead they won the federal corporate welfare lottery. Disgusting. 

Yet when we talk about actually getting REAL help to millions of unemployed Americans with no money for food or rent, then suddenly it’s some sort of liberal crime we are seeing unfold before our eyes. The hypocrisy and immorality of the “fiscal conservatives” is disgusting. God forbid we should actually help the American people."
2021-01-14 21:20,"Maybe we can get MOR Republicans (are there any left?) to understand the good Keynesian economic policies can do for our country, and all its citizens."
2021-01-14 22:06,I really hope we won't be sending check to people with jobs. Send the money to the unemployed...
2021-01-14 22:08,And not a single cent will go to Kushner who pocketed over $700 million from the first round of the Covid relief fund.
2021-01-14 22:15,"It’s not health versus “economy.” As my mom always used to tell me, if you don’t have your health, you have nothing else. 

We the US people cannot have nice things unless everyone is healthy. Because the virus doesn’t care about borders, that means everyone: US citizens, wealthy, prisoner, undocumented immigrants, citizens of other countries, etc. EVERYBODY."
2021-01-14 22:16,"When I saw the word ""President"" in the Breaking news email, I assumed Trump was doing something catastrophic  again. How refreshing it was to see President-Elect Biden and this great plan. Vive le President!"
2021-01-14 22:17,"This is the way to go! 
Health before wealth! 
How can people go back to work or school if population is sick and dead. 
Im a proud democrat and supporter of Biden! 
This is what I expect from the taxes that I paid  is for the government to protect the health  of the whole population so we can move on!!! 
I am more optimistic now than ever during the past year!  
It’s late but we have hope!  More than 80 million Americans believed it can be done and it will be done!"
2021-01-14 22:21,"Gosh.  Gratefulness that Biden would even want to take on the mess of this country. He is taking big risks, not for himself but because our country is in danger of disintegrating before our eyes. Give him a chance."
2021-01-14 22:21,The last decade has shown to us that in fact money DOES grow on trees. Print away!
2021-01-14 22:35,"""The Biden “rescue” proposal, which would be financed entirely through increased federal borrowing...?

Why entirely? Why can't the defense budget be changed to help pay?

And why can't taxes be adjusted for the wealthy?"
2021-01-14 22:37,"Sounds great, how do we pay for it? Taxing corporations and high income earners won't meet this expenditure not to mention the almost $28T we already owe. I get the importance of supporting the economy, but we have to be reasonable."
2021-01-14 22:37,"What the United States NEEDS are monthly payments of $2000 to all adults, every month, until the pandemic is declared over.  Those who don't need them can donate them to charity."
2021-01-14 22:40,"Business as usual. Billions in giveaways to state and local governments which means their cronies can keep their do nothing 6 figure jobs, real estate developers can get more giveaways  and law enforcement can buy more military weapons. The paltry amount given  to those unemployed or who lost their businesses will be paltry in comparison. Of course there will be food stamp increases, more section 8 and an increase in welfare to make it look good.

We need universal healthcare, a flat monthly  payment to the unemployed just like they give to people who have been on welfare and section 8 for years or generations ,real help for small businesses,  the rebuilding of infrastructure, a moratorium on mortgages from the banks we once bailed out and a student loan forgiveness program for all.  We need bold new plans but once again the democrats just don't get it."
2021-01-14 22:40,"To date this would result in over $5T (read $5,000,000,000,000) in COVID relief , aka , printing money.

As bad as it seems, flooding a population of $330M with this much money incurs the risk of serious inflation, serious meaning beyond that needed to reignite the economy. 

If you don’t understand what that means, you had better look it up while such information is still available on line."
2021-01-14 22:40,"Simple response to the argument that the $2000 (reduced to $1400) goes to people in good finanial shape who do not need it:

Make it taxable income.

Those who are in dire need with little income will be in such a low tax bracket that they will keep it all,  But those in the six figure family income will pay part back in taxes.  And if they are in states and cities with income taxes, those governments will also benefit from the spoils."
2021-01-14 22:43,"It'll take quite a bit more than 400 billion to ""safely"" open the schools. 

Students need to be vaccinated. No vaccines will be available to them after his first 100 days. 

Education becomes a whipping boy again for a politician. 

Same as it ever was."
2021-01-14 22:44,"Every penny put into the economy right now will benefit everyone and lift all boats. It will allow someone to get their car repaired, buy groceries, pay rent and utilities, etc. If you don’t need the extra money, then spend it locally and support small businesses or donate it to a local food bank."
2021-01-14 22:47,"I was initially extremely disappointed that Biden was nominated but the more I read about his policies as well as learn about his nominees, the more pleased I am. Perhaps there's a little Bernie Sanders hiding under the mask after all."
2021-01-14 22:50,I hope as part of this is the stipulation the disrupting the administration of the vaccine is a felony.
2021-01-14 22:51,"I’m not an economist...but is there no risk to the economy in the long run from printing money like this? Honestly, Does national debt mean anything? I understand tax breaks for the rich might not be the answer...but do we accept printing money as the answer because it’s sound policy or because it’s nice?

I could easily apply for a credit card, go in debt, and buy my kids nice things today. But in the long run I could be ruined. We seem to understand this concept on a micro level but when it comes to national debt we throw it out the window. Does this make Biden a caring president or a foolish one?"
2021-01-14 22:55,I look forward to seeing all the unity the Republicans are so passionately calling for in action to support our new President’s plans.
2021-01-14 22:57,"I think of all the money Bush wasted in two fruitless and futile wars, and all the debt and interest accrued. Imagine if that money had been given directly to the people.  If Biden gets through another $1400 per person, it will fundamentally shift the economic winds in this country.  I can't wait to see how this plays out!"
2021-01-14 23:03,"Basically whatever Biden does to improve our situation should be welcome.  100 million people receiving $2000 is only 200 billion dollars.  It is money that will go to buy food, pay rent, cover any number of expenses that these 100 million Americans have, which means it is money that will circulate into the economy immediately helping to keep others working.  it is as important shot in the arm as the vaccine.  Helping states  with budget issues will also help keep police, teachers, firefighters, nurses and so many other essential workers on the job rather than forcing them to make cuts that will cause havoc for everyone.  Our economy and so much more is not going to come back until the virus is under control and if that means a 400 billion expenditure to get it done so be it.  That comes down to about $1200 for every American.  I think our lives are worth at least that much."
2021-01-14 23:04,"President Biden should think about high debts student loans. Not only these young kids get hard times finding jobs when they finish college but when they finally get a job according with what they studied, they don’t get the right salary even when big companies buy out senior employees because they have high salaries, but they hire young people that can make the same job but no with the same high salary. Right now are thousands of young kids struggling to pay their federal and private loans and not only this young kids but we (the parents) helping them to pay these high student loans debts.
President Biden should try to make it easy for these young kids and forgive these federal student loans. When these young kids finish the college, they come out with debts like they already bought a house."
2021-01-14 23:05,"Biden has the opportunity to be a great president. He can avert a civil war, stop a pandemic, and pull the economy out of a depression. To succeed, he will need to remake the U.S. Supreme Court early. Follow the good advice of James Clyburn and wait 100 days at least to try Trump in Senate. Be bold."
2021-01-14 23:06,This plan is for sure much needed for citizens and those opposing this plan could be considered as being responsible for doing nothing and sanctionned by vote.
2021-01-14 23:06,I welcome all of the stimulus that can be passed. I think it’s premature to start increasing taxes on corporations though unless we want to draw out it out and increase unemployment. There are plenty of corporations that are just barely surviving now. Taxes can be revisited once the COVID crises is over.
2021-01-14 22:29,"What Senator elected as a Democrat could oppose this program?
The Republican hypocrites who increased the deficit by trillions of dollars by the tax cuts to the 1% and corporations will howl about the deficit.
Their hypocrisy should be shouted to the roof tops on the Senate floor.
I guess Manchin will have to get a bone thrown his way to get his vote but there also have to be a few Republican Senators that see the damage that the pandemic has wrought to the economy in their states and could vote for this plan.
Biden realizes as does every rational person that while more money is needed to to tide us over the real threat to the economy is Covid-19 and finally the focus of the Oval Office will be to control the virus."
2021-01-14 22:37,Presidential! I’d almost forgot.
2021-01-14 22:44,"And now Republicans are going to flip their switch and start screaming about the deficit again. As a Democratic administration cleans up their foul mess one more time. Just like the Democratic Congressman who quietly started cleaning up alongside the janitors in the Capitol building a week ago.

News media -- don't let Republican ""leaders"" get away with the cyclic, never-ending hypocrisy."
2021-01-14 22:45,"I applied for jobless benefits in March 2020. It’s still pending. I never received any assistance. 

Excerpt... “including $1,400 payments and higher jobless benefits.”"
2021-01-14 22:46,"FINALLY, vision, purpose, direction now all we need is a real Cabinet that can EXECUTE the interagency plan and a waste watchdog, good excuse to re-buttress IG offices.  I feel like we just might get out the woods as a nation after all. Get r done Joe."
2021-01-14 22:26,"8 years later and it is deja vu all over again. Obama inherited a mess, and now so does Biden.

Biden has a tryst with destiny. His passion, personal and professional setbacks, and style of leadership (charismatic not wonky) will serve him well. 

But he needs an engaged public to support what he is doing. Otherwise the PACs and big money lobbyists representing Goldman Sachs, Amazon, Google and Exxon will once again loot America. 

Our personal financial decisions matter. Don't like the fact that Charles Schwab supported radical Republicans (as reported in the NYT Deal Book)? Then move your brokerage account. Don't like the fact that GM lobbied to undercut CA emission standards? Don't buy GM cars and trucks. Don't like FB and Twitter enabling right-wing anarchy? Stop using FB and Twitter."
2021-01-14 22:29,"""Go big or go home!""

Look for Republicans to start pounding sand sometime tomorrow and going forward.  They will try to reduce this valiant initiative to dust before Biden says, ""I do."""

2021-01-14 22:34,"If the brilliant Robert C. Hockett of Cornell knows his stuff, (and I trust he does), MMT is how our government’s finances function, period. It’s about time Americans figured this out.  When Senators try to convince Americans they should be grateful for the crumbs under the table and ask, disingenuously by the way, how are we going to pay for that, you should understand, it’s not like your household finances where you have to balance your checkbooks. I’m excited we may actually be able to save our country from this race to the bottom and quality of life only for the obscenely wealthy."
2021-01-14 22:37,WW1 was ended by a pandemic. 100 years later it seems that time is going in reverse this  time around. Hyper inflation after the first WW in Germany gave rise to AH.  If you don't learn from history you are destined to repeat it.

2021-01-14 23:05,"Fair taxes on the super wealthy and corporation is a win.  The Trump GOP overly large ""tax breaks"" not provide any trickle down at all.  A healthy economy and a healthy population, actions on global warming momentum which is terrible, bad enough to now affect the rate the earth spins. I am optimistic. BTW 70 million Trump voters surely weren't all crazy  regardless of the ones who are. The underlying fears and issues still remain. Border security is a must for all nations. Illegal immigration got Trump elected. we are full up with over 11 million. There is no racism in that,. The idea that ""I get  to the border or in I have a right to stay"" is absurd. Everyone wants to be here. We are in trouble. Overpopulation is sinking the entire and consumerism planet. Along with climate change  it is unlikely that babies borbn now will live out a normal lifespan. Too many babies everywhere."

2021-01-14 23:11,"I’m glad to see Biden push for a large stimulus, but the decision to offer $2000 TOTAL in direct payments comes off as petty and legalistic. 

Biden promised $2000 checks if Democrats won in Georgia. He needs to deliver on that promise. I am not eligible for this round of stimulus checks; I have no personal stake in this. But millions of people desperately need financial support."
2021-01-14 15:49,"I expect Repubs to throw a fit about the 'tax and spend' Dems are pushing the deficit sky high! Yes, the very same thing called 'deficit' which conveniently disappears from their vocabulary whenever they give a huge tax cut to the rich!"
2021-01-14 23:13,"If Income from 2019 is used as a basis to determine the amount of Stimulus each person receives, it will NOT be an equitable distribution, NOR will it be targeted to those who have suffered through 2020 as a result of the pandemic.
.
In 2019, prior to COVID, people were employed and earning an income.  In 2020 countless jobs were lost and continue to be lost.  The amount of Stimulus should be based on 2020 income, not 2019 income.  
.
This can be easily done by identifying the next Stimulus as a Tax Credit against 2020 taxes. Those who file electronically can have their Stimulus in a a few weeks or less.
.
Target the people who suffered in 2020, not those who did NOT suffer in 2019."
2021-01-14 23:17,"I would suggest that Mr. Biden’s economic team make the $2,000 stimulus payment the start of a quarterly recurring universal basic income pilot program that is reviewable on an annual basis. That’s right, four times per year, Americans in the middle-class and below would get a check from Uncle Sam for $2,000. We could pay for this if the government committed to a progressive tax collection plan and strict enforcement of tax collection from the wealthy and corporations. 

I would also have Mr. Biden appoint an economic justice czar and task that person with persuading employers in the public and private sectors to pursue the payment of higher, more livable wages across the economy. I would use the basic outline of the bill drafted by U.S Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in which rich, profitable mega-companies, such as Apple, Amazon, and Walmart, would be taxed for any federal assistance their hourly workers would have to obtain for their survival, as a bargaining chip.

These two measures would help refocus the U.S. economy on the majority of Americans and resolve America’s economic inequality and the socioeconomic problems that have come with it by increasing consumption which will increase demand and employment, as well as corporate revenue and profits."
2021-01-14 23:19,YES YES Yes happen to be a cpa - mba - cfe that's a few credentials.  But the important part of that is that this Biden administration is focusing on getting money to strengthen the middle class family and that is the RIGHT thing to do at this time.  Thank you Joe.
2021-01-14 23:19,"Nice to have people in charge that are making plans. I mean, that actually benefit others."
2021-01-14 23:20,"I think Biden should instruct the Treasury to issue $20,000,000 in cash to each American family.  That way, poverty would be eliminated over night, and nobody would have to work unless they really wanted to .  We could paint and walk and relax all day and not have to worry about money."
2021-01-14 23:21,"Please stop say logistic or legislative challenges and start saying ""Republican obstructionism"". When one party only believes in helping the wealthy, it's time we stopped granting that party legitimacy with reporting. Show me how much the Republicans have done anything to help the working classes over billionaires. We all know they haven't. Watch them fall back on tired ""it's the deficit"" arguments now that Democrats are in control. It must stop working. Report the hard facts instead of crouching your articles in vagueness and obfuscation. Call this what it is, not what sounds balanced. Ochs ideas need adapting for the 21st century."
2021-01-14 23:21,"Our infrastructure is terrible, at least in the northeast. Narrow highways with potholes and 65 mph speed limits.

2021-01-14 23:21,"I am a loyal Democrat. I have never voted for a Republican for President (though back in the 1960s, when we still had liberal Republicans like Governor Nelson Rockefeller and Senator Jack Javits, I voted for them, too).

I am already sick to death with all the palaver about impeachment.  I  think Trump is milking his atrocious behavior for every last bit of publicity, and the country should be moving on into pure Democratic territory. 

That is, after all, why the country  has elected a Democratic President and 2 Democratic Senators from the great state -- for Democrats, not against one obtuse Republican.

If Chuck Schumer wants to schedule a debate on impeachment, fine but let's get our priorities straight.  It is more important for Congress to approve of all of Joe  Biden's proposed appointments, and to get this big relief package -- in one form or another, underway.

Then if we still feel it's worth trying to  put Donald Trump permanently out of the politics business,  let's try for that -- too -- but only after we've attended to More Important Business....."
2021-01-14 23:22,"So Mr. Biden believes that allowing tenants to live rent free on the backs of landlords for a year and a half is the compassionate thing to do?  The housing crisis will very shortly be that small landlords like me with just a handful of buildings/units will be forced to stop paying property taxes, utilities and upkeep on their properties.  Billions to aid 'renters'?  We'll see, but I am extremely skeptical.   You have made landlords into Welfare agencies providing free housing, heat, electric, water and upkeep for a year and a half come September.  You have thwarted duly made legal contracts on a whim instead of providing relief - its already been about a year and not a penny has the government provided, only 'woke' rhetoric as to they are 'helping' people stay in THEIR homes while the landlords languish in debt.  Mr. Biden I so want you to succeed.   Do the right thing."
2021-01-14 23:26,"There really is no such thing as a budget deficit when a country has a ""sovereign currency.""  People generally think of the US budget as similar to a house hold budget.  But it isn't.  In fact,  if we maintain a minimum of a 2% ""deficit,"" our economy will soar. The money the government spends supporting jobless and business relief will feed the economy.  It is necessary, doable, and urgent.  It looks like Biden has been consulting with economists who know the role that ""debt"" plays in a very healthy economy."
2021-01-14 23:30,"It’s not only economists encouraging Democratic lawmakers to deficit spend, its also Wall Street and the markets that have been begging for public investment to compensate for the lack of private demand in the economy. These packages—the initial relief and the stimulus to follow—will turbocharge the economy this year and next. A booming economy might also have the added benefit of mitigating some of the anger in society."
2021-01-14 23:31,"Spot on. The Democrats need to move ahead in big ways.  Monumental ways. And not be afraid to do it.  Not be afraid of being call big spenders. Who cares?

And, they need to immediately point to the actual, positive effects of their efforts.  Get on TV and digital channels and let people know what you're doing for them!  This is not rocket science."

As much as I would like to see most of this money go to infrastructure which has been ignored for a long time, putting workers back to work immediately  and supporting others til the economy starts to recover is more important. Closing tax loop-holes that enable corporations to earn billions in profits but pay no taxes and close loop-holes that make it possible for the 1%ers to avoid taxes on a current basis plus pass on to their heirs billions of $ is unconscienceable. Taxing capital gains at a much higher rate than current income would help."

2021-01-15 0:02,"I like money, but people without jobs need it more. Imagine what we could do for unemployment benefits if the government would stop giving my fully employed family money to put into savings.

2021-01-15 0:07,"This is actually somewhat disappointing and I hope it is just a start. This number, 1.9T when added to the recent stimulus is very close to the original House number of 3T six months ago that Mitch laughed at. Again I hope it's a start because so much more is needed, particularly state and local. 

Along the lines of stimulus there is absolutely no ground for Biden to be obtained by going low."
2021-01-14 23:17,"Good lord. How does it benefit Suburban and Rural America?

The Biden Administration and the Democratic Party need to frontload ALL of their plans and programs by answering that question clearly and concisely. They need to get that message out effectively to people in suburban and rural communities. 

Failure to do so will cede the narrative to the GOP. The GOP will gleefully distort, misinform and manipulate. They are always more effective at messaging. This will lead to a 2010 style route in the midterms.

A wave of Trumpists entering the House as a majority will mean the end of law and democracy as we know it. 

So answer some basics like:
 “How is the government gonna help small businesses (e.g. a local restaurant that can’t open because of  COVID) pay employees $15/hr?”
“How is the government gonna help independent businesses (e.g. an independent mechanic shop) provide 14 weeks of paid leave?”

People speaking about which they know nothing because they want to compare the U.S. government’s monetary policy to their home budgeting plan. It is not the same thing. AT ALL. Austerity doesn’t work. Repeat after me: Austerity doesn’t work. Fiscal conservatives are nowhere to be found when larger and larger spending goes to the military, but the second we need to infuse the economy with some real dollars then they go nuts. They don’t know what they’re talking about because they’ve been saying the sky is falling for decades and no such thing has happened. Modern Monetary Theory seems the way to go: basically as long as you control inflation by various means, you can run deficits into perpetuity. The government owes it to us to keep the economy afloat and people in their homes right now; the only way to do that is with spending. All economists agree on this, but what do they know?"

We must Stand United and eliminate all violence to form a more perfect union.  Kudos to Biden and his team.   It will not be a smooth road, but we can be thankful for having sensibility at the WH with the President-Elect and his incoming thinking team, rather than selfish and corrupt hooligans who care absolutely nothing about our beloved country.  It’s time for ALL of us to work together to uplift this country with solemnity, and a genuine sense of justice for all.

A progressive tax is a tax in which the tax rate increases as the taxable amount increases.[1][2][3][4][5] The term progressive refers to the way the tax rate progresses from low to high, with the result that a taxpayer's average tax rate is less than the person's marginal tax rate.[6][7] The term can be applied to individual taxes or to a tax system as a whole. Progressive taxes are imposed in an attempt to reduce the tax incidence of people with a lower ability to pay, as such taxes shift the incidence increasingly to those with a higher ability-to-pay. The opposite of a progressive tax is a regressive tax, such as a sales tax, where the poor pay a larger proportion of their income compared to the rich.[5]

There is no reason Bezos should be paying less % of his REAL, FUNGIBLE income than one of his warehouse workers. The tax code needs to be made fair so rich people cannot hide their true income in tax breaks, write-offs, shell companies, overseas corps., etc. Just tax everyone at the same rate, proportionally. Can't do that? Then see above--enact a progressive income tax which increases the % you pay, the richer you are. And I mean by A LOT MORE, not the current rates. It's called fairness."

Biden has always had a casual relationship with the truth. Third Way trolls are going to circle their wagons around Joe for the next four years. What I fear may happen, and it looks to be happening already, is that the bar is going to be very low for Joe.

We can only imagine how bad things are going to be in a couple of months when the moratorium on evictions expires and renters and mortgage holders who owe six months at least of back payments.

2021-01-14 22:28,"And here we go again from the Obama school of negotiating with yourself before facing your opponent.
Biden said he would support and propose a $2000 per person stimulus payment. We are already down to $1,400 and he hasn’t even been sworn in.
He is already breaking a promise and he hasn’t even started.
By the time he is done dealing with the R’s  we will be down to maybe an additional $600 which will take a year to reach us.
(Already waiting for the first). Result: Forget stimulus. Welcome useless deficits, otherwise known as the art of missing two birds with one stone or Democrats standard easy economic road to nowhere.
Corporations can sleep tight. This Obama clone is not going to scare anyone. They may even get a tax cut if they play it right.
The very early grade for this administration before it starts: F."

Remember if he Biden and the Democrats refuse to help the suffering Americans quickly and in a massive way, the Republicans will find a more strategic diabolical demagogue to destroy this country. And She/He will make Trump years look like a kindergarten party.

The Nation has been reeling for close to a year of dealing with a deadly pandemic that the current Federal Administration treated with disdain and denial.

Now the incoming Biden Administration proposes a different take; one desperately needed and you skip lightly over the specifics only to then dwell on all the possible pitfalls to passage.

Kind of like a football coach at half-time telling his losing team that all is lost and they should give up anyway!

This report is very long on the negatives and short on the positives.

Is this funding be set aside for the surge of illegal immigration, a payment to Hunter and his Chinese associates, more money to Iran?

That bill was passed in the dark of night without Democrats even having seen it, and pushed through Congress by McConnell and his Trumpian colleagues. Our children will be paying for this long after we are gone.

Businesses can't stay open with few customers or PPP funds with a ton of bureaucracy. Money needs to flow into the economy as fast as possible, even if a fraction of the money ends up getting saved rather than spent. 

Why is there a nationwide pause in student loans with interest effectively forgiven for everyone including doctors? Yeah I said it - the ship for student loan forgiveness already sailed out of the port with forgiven interest over the past 9 months. We are doing this because the economy is in big trouble."

Let's face it, does the number really matter at this point?  Billions, trillions, kabillions, bajillions and gazillions does it really matter?

Just print the money and keep printing the money until we are out of this mess.  No more talk of how much money, or how much it will cost or take, or how much debt we will leave our children and grandchildren.

We've already seen democratic governances (New York, California) fumble their handling of the coronavirus. Sure, states will get more funding under Ol' Joe, but they haven't shown they can manage it.

Also, I fully expect relief checks to be caught up in means testing (based on faulty, pre-COVID data) because heaven forbid we just say ""everyone gets checks starting right now.""

These are tough problems. Just because Biden is a ""good guy"" (at least relative to Trump) doesn't mean he's suited for the task — in fact, his record suggests he isn't.

Just on the health front, I watched CNN reporting from California, where one of the nation's toughest and bravest journalists, Sara Sidner broke down live on TV. Sara has reported from some of the toughest spots in the world. I bet she never thought she'd see the level of suffering, misery and dysfunction in a domestic assignment.

Not a surprise, elections do have consequences, but this package is mostly pork coming right after the last $900 billion..and the trillions before that.

My hope is that Biden and his team have also learned from Obama’s failure on the public relations messaging side.  Kamala Harris and every cabinet member must be on every television show they can book to tout this plan, from the Sunday talk shows to the late night shows. And, yes, even FOX.

Trump deserves to be convicted in the Senate and prosecuted for his crimes, but there it does not make any sense to squander political capital on removal proceedings in the Senate after Trump has already left and there is little or no chance of getting a conviction.

There’s been a real blindness about ageist hiring practices (and it’s affect on late stage worker savings) and corporate reliance on an underpaid workforce. I see a very real period of prolonged poverty for low and middle class workers ahead. I don’t see real solutions (that puts $ in peoples’ pockets) being addressed."

Trump proved MMT works and so let’s stop the deficits and taxes lie.

Biden and the Democrats are not perfect, but they are for the most part honorable, intelligent, experienced and dedicated to doing their jobs as specified in the U.S. Constitution. 

It will be a relief and joy to get our institutions back; to right the upside-down, alternative universe we have been living in for too long and to get our standing back on the world stage.

While my family is solidly in the middle class-upper middle class, we no longer have much, if any disposable income.  Costs have risen and wages have not risen enough to meet the gap, and we own our home, but it is a small home.

And then Gerald Ford issued a pre-emptive pardon for all crimes, charged and uncharged, Watergate related.

Millions were outraged that Ford would do such a thing.  But they got over it in a month or less, and the nation was able to turn its full attention forward.

As January 20th approaches and will pass, Trump will be gone.  But much of the national and Congressional focus will still be on him.    Seems to me that we would all be better off to focus on how to get to the lifeboats, not on who put us into the iceberg."

2021-01-15 3:53,"Mass vaccinations make no sense. If we had all the vaccine doses we need, then we would need to speed up vaccinations. A new vaccination system might be helpful. 

But the bottleneck is not getting shots into human shoulders. The bottleneck is in making vaccine. The pace of manufacturing is going flat out, but demand will outpace supply for at least the next year. 

The infrastructure already exists for vaccinations that will keep up with all the doses we can get. Medical offices, pharmacies, employers, and other sites already distribute flu shots at a peak pace of 2 million a day. Add in some new sites (like my county did with a drive-thru vaccination center) and there will be more than enough. 

Joe Biden's plan does nothing to speed up the production of vaccine doses. We have Donald Trump to thank that we got manufacturing going so quickly in the first place."

Fortunately, Ossoff and Warnock were elected so that V.P. Harris can break congressional tie votes in favor of effecting Biden's proposed packages.  Also, thank goodness that Mitch-the-Lead-Sociopath will no longer be able to table or block legislation that's good for ALL Americans.

I must say, ""...finance those efforts by raising taxes on corporations and the rich"" and  ""...raising the federal minimum gage to $15 an hour..."" sounds quite Bernie-Sanders-esque.  GOOD!  It's about time his policy proposals are taken seriously.

This spending about equals the last tax cut the Republicans passed about 2 years ago, most of which went to those at the top. Repeal that. Take it back and use the money for economic stimulus instead. Let's replace trickle-down economics, which has never worked, with trickle-up economics, which always does.

In another example of Biden needing to be pushed at the margin, he claimed during the campaign that his tax plan would not result in more taxes for anyone making under $400,000 per year. I know that a few years ago, the top 1% of households had annual incomes of at least $250,000, so Biden's proposal limits any tax increases to less than 1% of the population. That's absurd. At such a critical time, tax hikes should extend down those who are in the top 5% or top 10%. No one can possibly argue that those people can't afford it.

The last I heard, a new Navy sub expected to cost over $1 trillion was experiencing cost overruns, a polite way of saying its cost is headed toward $2 trillion. We don't need another nuclear-capable sub right now; climate change, Donald Trump and his base, and COVID-19 all pose far more immediate and greater threats to our national security."

Throwing money at a problem in a way that doesn't carefully and narrow target the causes and a solution to the problem is a path to failure and election defeat.  And the exploding federal deficit is only part of the economic madness going on now.  The Federal Reserve as printed 3 trillion of cheap money this year, states, cities, counties are wracking up huge debts, many businesses are in a bubble and overborrowed and there is no painless solution to the mistakes that have already been made. Just ask the Greeks how easy it is to stop living the good life on borrowed money.  So Biden talking ""going big"" without talking about sacrifice, pain, struggle and reality is going to be a big problem soon. By the next election.   In my opinion, Biden needs to identify part of the problem as 1) Trumps tax cut for big corps and the wealthy, 2) easy cheap money, and 3) the consumer society.   We can't have it all because there isn't enough for 330 Million people in the USA or 8 Billion on the Earth. The party is over. Biden's plan looks like a nice story, happy talk.  Note he picked Yellen, another supporter of easy money, spending freely, and happy talk.  We finally got rid of Lying Donald. We had to pick the lesser of two evils."
2021-01-15 5:07,"""The plan is a bold move""? Have you all lost your collective mind? ONE $1,400 check is not going to start the economy back up. People aren't going to spend money if they have no reassurance that MORE is coming. This is why banks don't give you a 30-year mortgage if you have only one week of pay from a temp assignment. The media has to stop sugarcoating everything. Why? Because Trump will be back in 2024, and he will win because all he's have to say is ""Vote for me. I'm not Biden."""

People who lost their jobs, businesses and/or their homes need help. People who did not suffer a loss of income do not need help, and do not need thousands of dollars in free money.

Republicans gave huge tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans, and cut tax deductions for many middle class people. Democrats  are now giving thousands of dollars to couples making up to 150,000$/year. Upper middle class folks are left in the lurch once again.

Dems, do you not see who your voters  are ? Many are well educated upper middle class people. You are going to lose these voters unless you look out for them as well. Many have lost a significant portion of their income, yet still don't qualify for aid. Mortgages still need to be paid, and other expenses have only increased. House prices are out of control.

I’m encouraged by the promises of President-elect Biden and Vice President Harris. And I hope they follow through with great vigor. We must understand that the rest of the world needs us to attain peaceful coexistence. We need that as well because climate change is upon us. The speed of its change increases constantly.

The Republicans, being Republicans, will again raise the Reagan's “Welfare Queen"" mojo and resist raising taxes.  By 2022 government stagnation will have set in and nothing will happen.
  
It is hard to sell someone making $650 a week on unemployment plus a new tax credit (free money) kicker of $300 per month per child to go back to a job making $450 to $500 a week --- that's reality.  Immediately going to $15.00 an hour is wishful thinking an incremental incease is more likely.   Eventually, the economy will pick up...but, we’ll all chase the same dollar through bars, restaurant, fancy clothes establishments, and entertainment.  America makes and fixes cars, that’s about it --- we shipped manufacturing overseas and south of the border long ago.  

As the Fed prints too much money, we'll eventually look like Venezuela not Germany.  China will become the new power house of the world as we watch TV football, visit the gambling halls, drink beer and laminate how good things used to be --- and, hope we don’t get sick. 

Somethings are almost too good to be true but we should enjoy them while they lasts. Biden has not read the tea leave, he was elected because people didn't like Trump not because of the anything in the democratic platform. Moderation in everything is the answer."

2021-01-15 5:42,"Uhm...

I'm not an economist, but I have to say a few words about this.

$1.9T (T!, as in ""Trillion"") is quite a lot of money, even for Washington D.C. standards. This money will have to be:

a) acquired somehow
b) distributed somehow
c) paid back somehow

Point a) is a problem in a pandemic, economic downturn and the prospect of a Second Civil War

Point b) is loaded with fraud, inefficiency, stupidity and sheer lack of a cohesive plan (which is not Biden's fault, it's simply impossible to direct that much money where it would really help the most)

Point c) is the real killer, because the U.S. is already past 100% of GDP in terms of debt,  and - if point a) would work - would reach Japan-level of GDP-to-debt ratio

I'm all for spending in a crisis, and Germany does, without any limits. But - I'm sorry to say - we are in a position to do so, and America isn't. 

There is that joke: ""How do you get a German finance minister to give you a drink? - Stick two fingers down his throat!"". Look at Mr. Schäuble, the guy in the wheelchair, who belly-laughed at the Greeks when they wanted 600 billion Euros from Germany. You don't have people like him in America, sorry to say so.

I'm a huge fan of ""balanced laws"", meaning: you can't just tip into the cash register, you have to explain how you're going to pay for what you propose. And I don't see any way the U.S. could shoulder another $1.9T - except tax hikes, and that would kill the Biden presidency from the get-go.

Moreover, ""unity"" does not include, in my strong opinion, pardoning Trump, like Ford did for Nixon, in the name of moving our country forward.

In fact, a pardon will move America backward.  Why? If Trump and his merry band of seditious zombies aren't held accountable and sentenced appropriately for their various crimes, they'll believe they can get away with anything and try it again in our near future.  Next time, rather than a egotistical buffoon, someone who's capable of effecting successful sedition will continue the effort.

If not the current U.S. Congress, then the Biden administration needs to resolve to charge Trump and many others with sedition, crimes against humanity, and reckless endangerment of Americans.

He should go several steps further than the New Deal and make the private sector responsible for providing a decent job with a living wage for every adult American.

We do not need Socialism but the economy must be regulated for the good of all Americans.

Politically Biden must play hardball politics like McConnell and he must add four seats to the SC.

The realigned SC must immediately reverse CitizensUnited and get the money out of politics so that people will count more than corporations.

This country is in as deep a crisis as FDR faced in 1932, and we need basic structural changes.

Krugman, Stieglitz or Barney Frank should be Treasury secretary not some Reagan Democrat who is afraid to confront the private sector and force them to live up to their civic responsibilities.

Although I admire the resolve and ambitiousness of the new administration in tackling the downturn, time and patience is needed to achieve any meaningful result. It would be convenient to think problems will just vanish with Biden coming to power. But this is just the beginning of what could be a (very) long road to recovery. I hope people understand the unique circumstances Biden is inheriting as President and do not burden the man with overly high expectations.

Economic problems may not even start to vanish on Jan 21st as new policies take time to even have an impact.

I mention all this because I believe there was a lot of impatience during the Obama years. The man had also inherited the (then) worst economy since the Great Depression. However, I think a lot of disillusionment set in from the fact that the public didn't expect the recovery to be as long-drawn as it was. They got impatient when unemployment numbers were slow to go down, even if progress was steady.

I believe the public could be more understanding towards a Biden administration. Patience is a virtue that's needed, especially now."

Let's see: a 2 trillion dollar tax cut that mainly benefited the top 5%; continual attacks on the ACA without any comprehensive and practical alternative; a trade war with China that resulted in hefty aid to farmers (who were banged hard by the embargoes) without any finalized & reformed trade agreement; enmity with our allies & a weakened NATO; what else did Trump accomplish?

Absolutely disgusting display of gaslighting and outright lying. Everyone needs to call their Democrat senators and house reps and demand that the new checks be $2K like they promised. People are suffering, Biden hasn't even taken office yet, and is already backing off a key campaign promise for no reason. A one time $2K check is already nowhere even close to good enough and he wants to lower it down to $1400, when the American people should not only get $2K checks for every month since the previous $1200 checks, but we should continue to get monthly $2K checks until we reach herd immunity and the pandemic is over."

It won't be called a recession or depression; simply the Hole.

I fully support the Biden stimulus program.  However, our massive debt will one day be our undoing.  We pay a high percentage of GDP toward interest on our debt already.  It's simply a matter of physics; there must be a tipping point.

If and when the world emerges from the planetary economic crisis we are now facing (which is far more dire than we care to admit), we must not only mandate balanced budgets, we will need begin to pay down our national debt.  The bombs are ticking."

When, in the past year, has Trump stepped up and spoken about the number of people who are now hungry or food insecure in the country? When has he spoken about the desperation of the unemployed? Never. He's too busy whining about his and his base's imagined grievances, about how people are out to get HIM, and about his right to win the election no matter what. 

It's ironic, indeed, that his voters continue to believe that he speaks to their need. Surely, some of them are in those food lines; surely they have lost jobs. Even if they don't blame his very, very poor ""management"" of this year-long crisis, do they not care that he never even speaks to this misery, much less try to mitigate it?"

It was everything trump failed to do in four years as president.  Yes, there will be arguments and compromises about specific programs, mostly along ideological lines, but you will not hear the common cry from both sides of the aisle of not knowing what the president wants.  It also showed Pres. Elect Biden knew what many are going through that aren't in the top 5% of incomes.  The fear of not paying rent, affording food, living pay check to pay check not knowing if it will help.  We have lacked that empathy and understanding by the current administration."

But as boxer Mike Tyson said about his opponent many years ago, ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth."" Plans don't much matter. Execution does. 

Joe Biden, after more than four decades as a politician, has zero executive experience and zero real accomplishments. Sure, he's been full of talk and of plans. But he hasn't gotten anything done. 

People who have worked with Joe Biden, like Robert Gates and Barack Obama, really like him as a man, but criticize his ability to do things. 

Donald Trump, on the other hand, knows how to get things done. When he became the nation's chief executive he already had decades of experience as a chief executive in real estate development and entertainment, two very tough businesses. That showed. 

You may not like what Donald Trump has done. His plans may not be the ones you would choose. But you can't argue that he did get things done over his four years. A lot of things. 

Will Joe Biden surprise us and be an effective president? Be more than just plans and talk? Actually get things done? Maybe. But I wouldn't count on it. As Barack Obama reportedly said, ""Never underestimate Joe's ability to [foul] things up""."

An extra $2000 isn't going to convince me to go to restaurants I wouldn't go to anyway during a pandemic. The people who really do need the money can be more efficiently helped through unemployment insurance. 

There are smarter ways to spend the money:

(1) State and local governments need help with vaccine distribution. The sooner we get everybody vaccinated, the sooner the economy recovers.

(2) It's socially and politically critical that this administration help middle class working people. These are the people who got shafted by NAFTA, who had their jobs outsourced to Asia, and who are now working double just to keep even. Stimulus checks are nice, but what these people really want are good jobs and the dignity that comes with them. If middle America sours on Biden in 2024 and votes for Trump again, this nation is doomed.

(3) It's critical that we address climate change and infrastructure. Fortunately these two things can be done in tandem. And they have the added effect of creating a lot of middle-income jobs. The bulk of our spending should be here. But I'm worried that there's going to be little appetite for that in Congress when we've just blown $1.9 Trillion on the coronavirus.

So, can be be a little more strategic? If we're going to spend money, let's spend it on things that move the needle."
2021-01-15 16:48,"What good does talk of jobless benefits and stimulus checks do when you cannot even get unemployment.  When you call and call the offices to be put on perpetual hold for hours. For many people who need the stimulus the most there is a dead end to being able to sign up for it.  My son called on a daily basis for months and never received a reply.  He also filed for unemployment online and received a number which was useless since he never received a response and was unable to get through to an agent.  The numbers of unemployed are far higher than reported.  Those who have fallen off the rolls and those who were never even listed need help.  If the government really wants to help people, they need to put a system in place that works."
2021-01-15 17:08,"Prez Trump indicated plans are in the works to revise the foster care program, 80% of which are home-owning grandparents indebted to the state for health care for the foster/ grandchildren.  Strangely, the missing parents were dragged thru the courts endlessly by fines and warranting which forced their elective disappearance eliminating them from the expected inheritance.  The new plans are to make the extended family involved financially.  One wonders how child support can be included in this revision.  
Empty words about middle class home ownership need to be substantially backed by forgivable Federal program loans up to $50,000 to support families and individuals owing up to three rental homes.  Home ownership need not be wiped out as in the last recession that erased generational wealth."

2021-01-15 17:03,"The American Rescue Package clearly show Mr. Biden’s priorities: they deal with the coronavirus-19 pandemic by funding vaccinations with emphasis on people and their communities. This is a main street relief program rather than  a wall street program. Hopefully, it can be implemented by using the recently proposed BOOST Act, H.R. 6553.
One of the goals that demands attention is the global perspective that wants to “restore U.S. leadership globally and build better preparedness” knowing that, presently, a good health policy means a good economic policy. It also wants to protect United States from COVID-19  knowing that the “pandemic is a grave reminder that biological threats can pose catastrophic consequences to the United States and the world. The president-elect’s plan will provide $11 billion ….”.
One major modern way as opposed to the traditional way of raising taxes and borrowing for a nearly $2 trillion is the constitutional way of creating money that has been proposed since the 1930s and has become known as the Modern Monetary Theory with its variants. One of them is the monetary reform and transformation movement which aims not only to reform domestic financial, fiscal and monetary systems, but aims to transformation the financial, fiscal and monetary subsystems of the world economy. Part of that movement is Verhagen 2012""The Tierra Solution: Resolving the Climate Crisis through Monetary Transformation""  and its 2021 sequel with its Global 24 Initiative."

As for his plan to get this country back on its feet....if he actually pulls off getting the uber rich to truly pay their fair share, then maybe HE should see about having himself appointed President for life!"
2021-01-15 17:59,"Putting money into the hands of every American under a certain income level is great. For the poor, it pays for basic needs and helps reduce dependence on expensive services like emergency housing shelters. For the rest of us, it's a little something to spend be it on carryout food, a vacation or any number of things to help the economy, or to save for future needs. 
I treated my $600 like a windfall. Pets went to the groomer, I got a hair cut and color, and I went to dinner, with generous tips for all. I helped more people than Delta Airlines or Marriott would with a $600 check. 
For the poor, that money probably goes to Walmart or a landlord or a drug company, but really does save us in the long run. It's cheaper for a community to keep a family in a home than to deal with sheltering a homeless family and providing them services."

2021-01-15 18:20,"Considering what this country has been through, I believe the Biden's plan is much needed. The plan pushes to invest more into testing and vaccination, and providing relief for those who have been impacted from the deadly virus. It also addresses health disparities spanning over different communities. As we know, POC have been disproportionately affected from the pandemic than other groups because of low funding and lack of adequate testing. I think this has been an issue ignored by the previous administration. Luckily, Biden's stimulus bill acknowledges this issue and is hoping to address it. Also, as someone who is young and going into college soon, I am expecting Biden to address the student debt crisis many American face today. It is not mentioned in his current bill, but I'm hopeful it will be in the future ones."
2021-01-15 18:59,"America needs more stimulus. However this is a huge chunk of change--it will increase the national debt by 1.9 trillion, an amount equal to almost almost  $ 6000 for each and every every man, woman and child in the country. So let's hope it's carefully thought out and will send money only where needed. No more millions sent to millionaires and billionaires; not thousands to those employed and economically  unaffected by the recession.

 And let's have a plan to pay down the enormous debt the stimulus will create. Interest rates will be low for awhile, but not forever, and are not predictable. A precipitous rise in rates at the wrong time could cause its own crisis."
2021-01-15 19:11,How is this being paid for? We need cuts in government spending elsewhere and smaller government in general and limited corporate tax increases to cover this pandemic and so their part but not increases of individual tax rates to cover this
2021-01-15 19:36,"Starting next week, McConnell will no longer control the US Senate, but his power to obstruct will remain strong.

Under Trump, McConnell and the GOP Senators had no concerns about deficits.  But under President Biden, McConnell will suddenly insist that deficit spending is evil.  Of course, he will also block any tax increases on the wealthy or large corporations.

This will make defeating COVID difficult, and will make any economic recovery very slow.

But to McConnnell, ensuring the failure of President Biden is the main point.  He did it before with President Obama.

The Senate must change its rules to eliminate the filibuster.  Otherwise McConnell will block everything that Biden proposes.

McConnell’s obstruction will hurt America.  But I’m sure that it will make Trump and Putin quite happy."
2021-01-15 19:37,"Unless Biden can get all the Senate Democrats and at least 10 Senate Republicans to vote ""Yes"", then his $1.9 trillion relief package is dead on arrival.  At least now in the Senate with Moscow Mitch not having control of the agenda the relief bill will get debated and voted on.

It has no chance of passing, but at least we will get all Senators on record for a change."

2021-01-15 19:41,"This bill is a lobbyist's dream and a nightmare for the rest of us. Take the money being spent on clean energy, including electric vehicle charging. That money will be wasted. 

I work in the electric car industry, and have for the past 18 years. Plenty of private money goes into electric car infrastructure. Too much, in fact. The stock price of electric-carmaker Tesla, for example, has inflated to bubble proportions. Others are not far behind.

More government money will just add fuel to the fire. Not only will precious money be wasted, since it is unneeded, but it will heat up an industry that needs to be cooled down. Unrealistic projects need to fail and the best ones to survive. We need to starve the weak, not feed them. 

Vaccinations are the same way. We've already thrown billions at vaccine development and distribution. We don't need to spend any more. Instead, we need to work out the kinks in the current system (as we are doing). More money will not help with that. It will hurt. A new federal system will just add more kinks to the system, not get rid of current ones. 

Now is not the time to throw around money. Money won't end the epidemic. Now is the time to be opening up the economy, slowly and carefully. Now is the time to get vaccines into willing shoulders as soon as they are made. Now is the time work on the foundation so that our economy can grow when the epidemic is over. 

Money is a problem, not a solution."

I will likely be paying for this plan for the rest of my life -- and that is fine by me. I grew up working poor, I can live a very fine life even if 45% of my income goes to taxes. Money that goes to ending this pandemic and strengthening my community is worth it. The welfare of my community has a bigger impact on my quality of life than an extra $10-20K."

The sitting (and that's about all he does) President will soon be out of office.  He, and his enablers in the House and Senate and elsewhere, must be dealt with; no one is above the law.  Attorneys who violated their oaths must be disbarred.  Criminals must be convicted and jailed.

When hard times come, and they will, government needs to deficit spend like crazy. And this goes double or triple now that—like all mature economies—we run on consumption. It’s simple. People no have money, people no spend. People no spend, economy go squush. 

If Republicans and the Right actually gave a hoot about fiscal responsibility, they wouldn’t have run the loony Iraq War off the books. They wouldn’t have blown the budget on tax cuts, giveaways, military toys we don’t need—you know the drill. They woulda leapt at infrastructure investment back in 2009, or during the last four years. They’d have done something about Trump lining his pockets. 

And they would have prepared for the rainy day. 

Nope. But boy howdy, have they rediscovered fiscal responsibility right on schedule. Their cries of woe riseth unto Heaven, and so shall ever rise.

With this plan money will flow through the economy. Personal health care casts will go down, With the reopening of schools, parents will return to the workforce.  A $15/minimum wage will not decrease employment (I disagree with the author), but will increase purchasing and quality of life.  Federal and state tax income will increase.

It would be nice if it were possible to just rely on the public doing the right thing on its own but Western countries have demonstrated - over and over again -that this does not work. The tragedy of the C19 virus is that we in the West know exactly what we need to do to whip the virus - lockdown hard, like China, New Zealand, and Australia did. But, instead, our political leaders try to bargain with the disease, introducing half-measures that prolong the spread of the disease, stretch out the suffering, and allow many more people to die. Then, they are are forced to bring in much more severe measures anyway. Look at Ontario in Canada. The provincial govt there did far too little, far too late, introducing stricter measures weeks and months later than experts recommended, until the present rate of infection is more than 4000 cases a day and the hospital system will be overwhelmed in a few weeks if it is not brought under control. Now, finally, the govt has declared a state of emergency and issued a stay at home order. But this may still not be enough, according to experts, and the govt - not coincidentally, a conservative govt - continues to dither. The lesson of this pandemic is that effective govt is essential to get the disease under control. Too many in the West have failed that test."

They do this kind of lockdown with larger flare-ups, which is to say a few hundred cases. Some elements of this kind of lockdown may be hard to implement in the West.

They tested 800,000 people in that area in a matter of a few days.  Prior to this current lockdown life was almost normal for them.  We should only be so fortunate in this country..... Both my husband and I came down with Covid in December with fortunately mild cases.  Three other people in my family have had it with fevers and pain in their chests. Our next door neighbor has had it. We also have a distant cousin who died of Covid in March.  Connecticut has been exemplary in the way Governor Lamont has handled this epidemic, but the infection numbers continue to rise.  My husband and I have followed all the guidelines since March and only go out to grocery shop.  We still do not know where we might have picked it up.  At this point it would be smart to just assume that everyone you meet could be carriers, and act accordingly.  Wear masks and wash your hands frequently.

Canada did dry runs on vaccine deliveries to make sure that vaccine distribution would go seamlessly; not sure if that even happened in the United States.  There needs to be more cooperation between states and the federal government and across states.  Federal agencies should also be more robust for situations like this pandemic.

For example, people can fly into Newark and not get any information about having to quarantine and simple enter New York.  However, if you fly into LaGuardia and JFK, you need to quarantine.  How does this make any sense and flies in the face of public safety.  Flying into Canada, you are greeted by health department volunteers who explain what you need to do to quarantine safely.  This needs to happen at all ports of entry into the USA if we are taking this seriously."

When I read the news coming out of the USA I am dismayed at the total lack of leadership being shown and my heart bleeds for Americans who are living in times which are just so unbelievable. I am sure many Americans must by reflecting how did we get here. If they are not then I suggest they need to try a new perspective for their reflection."
2021-01-13 22:57,"The notion that this type of lockdown / pandemic control “cannot happen in a Western country” needs further examination. Australia and New Zealand both have had tremendous  success at keeping infection to a low level, in large part due to the quick response from their governments, willingness to take a short term sacrifice, and kept their guards up (imposing extended quarantine for entering the country, for example) even when things appear under control.  They also have leaders who are able to communicate the seriousness and urgency of the issue with clarity and empathy, earning public trust in the process rather than destroying it. That last point may well be the difference between countries like New Zealand and the US or Britain."

However, for a moment, consider what it takes to lock down 22 million people at a moment's notice. Anyone who's visited major tourism sites in Beijing knows that the  Chinese people are not always models of exemplary control. Rather, the apparatus of state power is so extensive that it can impose its will with impunity.

Given the recent news about the actual efficacy of the Chinese coronavirus vaccine -- on the order of 50% according to researchers in Brazil this week, far below the 78% announced last week -- the strategy of intermittent lockdowns in China will continue for many months to come. 

Obviously, China hopes to maintain the economic momentum it has gained while the West has struggled with the pandemic. However, while that is important, China really has its sights on the 2022 Winter Olympics which are scheduled for Beijing, February 4 – February 20. If those come off as planned, they will mark a global event every bit as decisive for China as the 2008 Summer Olympics. This will be particularly true if the already once-postponed 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo are cancelled completely. 

In sum, China has a tremendous amount riding on the continued containment of the coronavirus. If it succeeds, it will unquestionably shift the narrative from disaster in Wuhan to triumph in Beijing 2022."

2021-01-14 2:41,"On-the-ground view from Shanghai: it's clear that authorities across China are determined that there be no repeat in the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday of the current outbreak in Hebei.  Here in Shanghai, where there are no current locally transmitted cases, many employees have been ordered not to leave the city during CNY, except with management permission and for an urgent reason.  Schools sent home a note yesterday saying the same - Kids may not leave the city limits during their 1 month break, except with school leadership pre-approval, which will only be granted in exceptional cases. That's on the tough side.  Aside from living in a constantly surveilled bubble, life is normal.  Schools meet daily in person.  All restaurants are open and packed.  Go to the movies, just wear a mask.  Public transit is booming; Shanghai is opening a few more lines in the coming weeks.  Invite friends over for a dinner party, without fear. Send the kids away for a sleepover, again without fear.  Enjoy a weekend soccer tournament.  I doubt that any of this could be replicated in any open society; there simply isn't a similar level of deference to drastic government controls and oversight and widespread social compliance with mandates like mask wearing and movement tracking.  So take your pick - Authoritarian and safe or open and pandemic.  It's a tough call."
2021-01-14 2:52,"I think people are delusional about how China fundamentally works if they look at this and think if they see this is all going down smoothly and painlessly for individuals. What is different in China is that, say what you will about the iron-fisted technocrats, they put the big picture ahead of all other considerations. That has human costs but given how deadly the epidemic is, the human costs of failing to heed the big picture is higher. 

In the US, besides Trumpian stupidity, Americans politicians will cave to any business lobby that squeals loud enough - restaurants, hotels, bars, casinos, and pander to the most ignorant members of their base.

“ While the new restrictions have inconvenienced millions, there appears to be no significant public resistance to them.”

 If you replace “infectious disease prevention and control” with “the struggle for socialism” and cross out “epidemic” you have Lenin’s formulation of the relation with the people. The positive and negative of party life, debates, differences should be open for the masses to see and add their opinions too. No closed doors, no positions without open debate. This is true socialist and Communist democracy and the fall  of Eastern European “socialism” was mostly the result of this violation of Lenin’s principals. The popularity of Fidel in Cuba was due to his following this Leninist credo. No socialist movement will ever be successful that violates this credo. 
The second quote is also important. True peoples democracy (not the fake bourgeois democracy of the ruling class) is this. When the people feel at home with the decisions of their leaders — when the vast majority of workers and citizens feel and think their government is for them and they are part of the grand plan, there, and only there, you have real democracy. Where this didn’t exist “Communism” fell, where it doesn’t exist it will fall, and those parties that don’t follow Lenin’s credo will never have a chance to try it out."

Families can choose f2f or virtual. My school is over 80% f2f. We have classes with 30, 35, 40 students f2f. Our windows, if we even have them (not all classrooms do), do not open (school safety measure). Our district spent CARES Act money on a LMS and, now, on aqueous ozone stations for only the elementary schools. Despite spending $12 million, those stations are absent from even most elementaries. School bus routes were not adjusted to account for distancing and drivers were directed that they could not turn away unmasked students nor could they distribute masks. THIS is the reality of most public schools in the US, not an ability to test students or staff regularly, not distancing, not strict mask enforcing. Knowing this, would these public health experts still advise the same?"
2021-01-15 14:41,"If you have data, why not discuss it in detail?

Dont characterizing decisions as “too conservative” without demonstrating why — with evidence.  And when you don’t really know, please say that.  

This report makes it seem like epidemiologists are shooting from the hip, with decisions made according to personal circumstance and intuition and not objective measures that can be applied by others.  The public needs more specific information that you’re offering."
2021-01-15 14:52,"When the article begins with ""Current safeguards should protect schools, experts said, but only if strictly enforced"", it is hard not to start laughing nervously.

You realize that if everyone in US strictly adhered to guidances, like wear a mask, social distancing, wash hands, we would not have a mess we are having. And this was for adults!!!

Despite all reports, despite all the evidence, we still hear about super spreader parties, clubs, etc.

So, let's be honest -- what had to happen is mayors had to prepare for remote learning during summer, by providing laptops, high speed internet, and creating safe physical spaces for the most vulnerable. 

Some did, others, like de Blasio, failed. Now, to prop up the mediocre politicians' approval ratings we will risk infections' exponential rise. Any DAs want to bring charges of criminal negligence?!"

2021-01-15 16:25,"My nephews attend elementary school in an area of London. Their school banned students from wearing masks!  Needless to say they had a rash of cases but had no intention of changing any safety protocols. Crazy. Of course, now they are closed with all the other schools but with that kind of leadership you wonder what will happen when they reopen."
2021-01-15 17:08,"This is disheartening.  The thought that schools may have to close again because of the new variant?  In Oregon, most schools haven’t even opened at all since last March even though cases have always been low."
2021-01-15 18:22,"To my knowledge, the claims about children not getting COVID as easily as adults has not been backed up by little other than specious claims.  There has been no comprehensive testing program of school children to determine if they are carrying the virus without symptoms.  In fact, there has been very little testing of children at all.

That getting children back to school is being promoted in the middle of a a nationwide surge that has left our hospitals overwhelmed is absurd.  School facilities vary greatly in adequate ventilation and physical structure and children who cooperate with social distancing in school will naturally abandon such practices the minute they leave the building.

Everyone wants children to return to school.  But our first job in a pandemic is to survive.  Everything else is secondary."
2021-01-15 18:27,"The comments reinforce how much school funding varies across the country and within states. Our schools are inching back to in person hybrid for the first time since March 2020.  Kinder and high needs have already been back in hybrid.  Our public schools are well funded by local taxes, but I know that's not the case in the deep South where the school I attended looks the same 40 years later,  just much more dilapidated.  Here local tax levies cover school remodels and rebuilds and fund technology access. It's not perfect, but when my children return to elementary school 2 days a week in a few weeks, masks will be mandatory as will arrival temperature check and distancing. Children will follow rules if schools require them and enforce them.  Class sizes mean fewer than 10 children will be present in rooms with modern ventilation. Our country needs to prioritize public school funding.  I'm nervous about the return but grateful to be in an area that funds local public schools.  Teachers even receive professional wages. Imagine!"
2021-01-15 18:37,"I wish someone would explain why the new strain is more contagious, and what measures we can take to keep from getting it. I'm already staying home, wearing a mask, washing packages, etc. Is that enough against the new strain? Does it live on surfaces longer, etc? There are so many unanswered questions. It's concerning that there have been no guidelines given on how to deal with the new strain. I'm not a COVID denier, but I could totally see how this kind of reporting would fuel that fire."
2021-01-15 18:38,"The Johnson  Government has been propagating a myth for many months, which was not based on any evidence or studies, that somehow children could not become infected by the virus or be carriers of the virus.

Plainly this is not true and children can transmit the virus to other people including their own families. The latest mutation of COVD19 in the UK has made the transmission of this virus at least 50% more transmissible.
I personally know at least one family who became infected with Covid19 and became very ill. The source of the infection was from their own school age child.

Schools are very large social gatherings which often have cramped classrooms, without free flowing air, thus an ideal environment for breathing in this virus.

Children need to be educated, but they also need to be safe, to protect themselves, their families and their teachers. A lot of work needs to be done here to safeguard children."
2021-01-15 17:02,I feel like I haven’t seen enough discussion of the fact that students in British schools don’t wear masks. Obviously the virus is going to spread like crazy when a 100 person grade is a “pod” (along with all of their families). Maybe that accounts for some of the crazy high transmission rates?
2021-01-15 18:43,"Every time, a new excuse to deny our children an education."
2021-01-15 18:50,"A more contagious virus means more kids will end up in the hospital and there will be a higher number of community spread cases as well.  Now is not the time to force kids back to school in person as the Iowa Governor is doing at a time when more will get the virus, some will be hospitalized, others will have long hauler effects, and many will die."
2021-01-15 19:53,Schools are nowhere near equipped to handle COVID19 safely and shouldn’t reopen until all teachers can be vaccinated and likely most children. Who are we even kidding? There were 238k new infections today. Obviously keeping schools open is pure folly.

2021-01-13 13:03,"This article is an incomplete start for what should or could have been a more complete discussion of this topic.  

While there are difficulties and pitfalls, many people obviously find opening an OnlyFans account to be a worthwhile endeavor. 

Anything involving the internet, in today's intolerant atmosphere, carries a certain danger, including my posting a Times comment with my real name, if I chose to. Fortunately, most viewers of adult content are there to enjoy. 

If anyone rats on a person they recognize, it begs the question as to why they were themselves watching in the first place.  

Depending on the profession, no one should work for an employer who intrudes into their employee's personal life, no matter how they find out.  If it does not negatively impact on their job, and if the employee is not bringing their personal life into their workplace, it's nobody's business. Yes, it's public, but because it's for a select audience who seeks out this content, and attests to being of legal age and pays a fee, it's private. 

Unless a parent is footing the bill for support of their child, it's none of their business, either.

Our government has failed us during this pandemic, and we live in a very cruel employment world that is increasingly impersonal, thanks to online job applications.  People have a right to create and watch adult content, and they have a right to make a living.  These people are taking responsibility for their lives, and I wish them luck."

As a photographer I have helped four or five girls and a guy take those initial nude pictures to post and one of the things that strikes me (and I do it pro-bono because I really feel bad for them) is the look of desperation in that first session.

Maybe we should ask more questions about why so many women are vulnerable enough to poverty that they would resort publishing explicit images online even in cases where they receive little financial return and suspect they are potentially compromising their ability to obtain more conventional employment. 

I suppose there is nothing surprising here. Women who enter the pornography industry generally leave after a short tenure, and with very little in earnings. Someone is making money off pornography, but it is not the women who are used in its production. Without the naivete and desperation of such women, the industry would founder."

But it does make me extremely sad to see women doing it out of desperation and worrying that it will come back to haunt them in terms of their future careers, because it likely will. If they land a good job and someone finds out—well, there’s a certain type of man that thinks they own you if they’ve seen you naked. Others will blackmail you. Can’t just confidently toss your head and say “so what? Go boil your head!” Then please, find another way.

The fact that anyone in the richest country on earth NEEDS to do this is a whole other disgrace."
2021-01-13 15:09,"The oldest profession has gone virtual like everything else.  Phone sex, OnlyFans, pornography in advertising--I guess we're all being reminded that ""sex sells.""  

But so does liquor or drugs.  Anything addicting, even overeating, can be used to turn a profit by some entrepreneurs.

So, two takeways:  a social safety net is sorely needed in this country; and the willpower to avoid addiction in the beginning would serve us all well."

2021-01-13 14:27,"What I find most frustrating is the hypocritical nature of our society. On one side, a mother who can't make ends meet, due to low wages or unemployment, is seen as a failure. This very mother now finds a way to stay afloat with an Only Fans account. Now because this work is taboo, despite the huge numbers of Americans that happily consume it, this mother has to be worried about not be employable in future jobs outside of sex work. All together, it is totally infuriating and ridiculous."

Our country is deeply broken when virtually selling ones body is valued more than being a paramedic helping actual bodies get to life saving treatment. The outrage should not be in shaming these women, who had little recourse, but in the system of exploitation that got them there. Our society needs to treat motherhood and parenthood as the vital work it is and pay accordingly to help eliminate childhood poverty and cover childhood healthcare."

Sadly, immigrants who are undocumented currently compete for jobs, under cut labor organizing, and further accelerating a downward wage spiral. This has led to some of the violence by working people, and was our past president’s siren call. That southern wall was the perceived salvation of living wages in our country. 
We need strong unions to enforce living wages, enforced by law, across all states. We need sharply increased minimum wages, nationally, enforced. 
(And while we have our resident thousands of desperate immigrants, we need border controls.)
And yes, taxation scams must be controlled, and the billionaire class must step up, or be made to."
2021-01-13 15:32,"This comment is entirely non-judgmental, as no one has the right to criticize others...without knowing their desperate circumstances to make a buck...to survive treacherous times. What must be said is that a system that pushes somebody to do what otherwise would be regrettable, even shameful, to themselves, is akin to violence from an unjust system unwilling to give an alternative, something we may be agreeable with, even deserving, as part of a wealthy society. Who are we, really, to allow slave-like behavior, and 'look the other way'?"
2021-01-13 15:32,"Unbelievable that a paramedic makes $13.30/hr.  A person who can literally save your life, who faces blood and other bodily fluids, who puts their health in jeopardy to assist others, makes an annualized salary of  less than $28K a year?  Using that hourly rate, the same $700 made from OnlyFans would have taken Ms. Hall over a week of work.

The most 'shameful' part of this article is how we, as a society, pay and treat others, especially those doing such important work."
2021-01-13 15:32,"Is anybody thinking that $13.30 an hour in *normal* times is enough to feed and house a family in decent circumstances? For those who asked, the fathers aren't paying their child support; that's the *second* oldest story in the world. 

It's the 1 percenters who have the money to pay for the pictures, and any other little amusements they may fancy, and those 1 percenters are not going to let that turn into 1.5 or 2 percent. They like the power of holding dignity just out of reach, especially the reach of women.

Times don't change; human nature doesn't change. For women who do well in this work, who enjoy this work and celebrate the loveliness of their bodies, good on you! For those under the thumb of economic oppression, it *is* degrading and shouldn't be allowed to happen. As we've all said about one thing or another this week, ""Not in this country.""

2021-01-13 15:53,"So, what is the ""solution"" to this, and why is this important to read about, exactly? Women have turned to sex-work especially in times of economic upheaval and social unrest. It is the last bastion for the lowest skilled and those of least means. The New Yorker wrote about this in May of 2020. This work will always be marginalized, but kept in demand by a persistent contingent of need driven by human nature. It is neither noteworthy, laudable, nor something to aspire to. ""FIx"" this by making sure people have education, opportunities, and options - and that way only those certain few who really enjoy sharing themselves in this way can opt to go this way, instead of ""having to"", to make ends meet."
2021-01-13 16:00,"I am pro choice in many ways, including a woman's right to choose to sell access to her body- either online or in person. But, what I am reading here does not strike me as empowerment given that all the women profiled entered sex work as a career of last resort, unable to support themselves in their other profession. I am glad for Ms. Benavidez that she has found success, but for the other women, there need to be others ways to be economically secure, so that only those women who feel empowered by sex work can choose to enter the field."
2021-01-13 16:03,"The next revolution needs to be about UNIONIZATION, A GOOD LIVING WAGE, A GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM, AFFORDABLE HOUSING and UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE INSURANCE FOR ALL. All of the above issues have caused such an article being written, high homelessness, high evictions, depression, health issues, people living in hotels and not being able to save money for a rainy day, let alone a vacation. Then we have people working 2-3 low paying jobs and still not able to pay bills, people using their cars to pick up strangers, people using their homes to make money (and destroy neighborhoods in the process) and a broken public school system, where most children do not get a proper education. All this while a few make all the money to buy 15 cars and 5-6 mega homes. Plenty of blame to go around, including politicians (both Republicans and Democrats), irresponsible companies who turned their back on the USA to move their companies to other countries and people like Jeff Bezos. Look at all the small cities/communities destroyed because of companies closing their plants to move to Mexico, China, etc. Cities that look like war torn countries that once were the backbone of the middle class. Ironic this article appears in newspaper where making $70,000 barely gets you anything and a corrupt Mayor deBlasio ran on a Tale of Two Cities and made it even worse. Hate to be pessimistic, but this has been very slow in the making for decades. Make America Great, at this point I would settle for fairly good."
2021-01-13 16:07,"Biden agenda is full.

This is a very good example of how women's unemployment causes this way of learning money Because desperation is an unspeakable level. Once it passed, these thing s will trickle down when these women try to get another job and it may create problems.

Of course, according to Republicans, Trump is nothing to do with this one, he leads the greatest job creation. That was before the Pandemic. This dislike talking about how good your home was before the house fire, We understand that, but House burned. 

The loss is horrendous."
2021-01-13 16:26,"I practice psychiatry.  I had never heard of OnlyFans until a patient mentioned she had an account and was hoping to make enough to pay her rent after her roommate left.  Since then, I've learned of many other patients--and their family members and friends--doing the same.  I consider myself very sex-positive, hard to offend and even harder to shock.  I don't judge people's sexual choices (that aren't predatory).  But I am so sad and angry that so many people find sex work to be the best option available to them.  I know a hard-working social worker who now relies on OnlyFans to cover her utility bill.  But her customers pay to see her lesions.  She does not consider this sex work, though she knows that she has customers who are sexually aroused by her wounds.  Who have we become?"

2021-01-13 16:38,The article really makes this seem like abuse but the first girl made 64K in 5 months and she just started. That will go up. Lots of these women who treat it as a job make six figures a month. Some are making a million a month. They’re not even really famous. It beats flipping burgers for ten bucks an hour. Minimum wage is more degrading to me. I’m not going to begrudge someone making an honest living.
2021-01-13 16:38,"Having read comment after comment here, taking time to comment on one, what saddens me most is the judgmental tone of so many. First, let's be clear, it's not only women who post regularly to OnlyFans. The posters are people , male female, LBGTQ and the rest. Note; first category is PEOPLE, human beings.

Second, it is unfortunate that many felt ""forced"" into this situation. When ""polite society"" and government don't respond to need, people will find a way, a different avenue. 

Third, again, polite society and government have not established humane rules. $13.30 an hour for life-saving work? Are you kidding me?

Fourth, and essential to this whole matter, what's wrong with nudity or, for that matter, sex? Even more to the point, what's the issue of ""using"" nudity (or sexual content) commercially? Goya worked on commission, so did Caravagio, so did many, many others. Sculptors for over 3,000 years have celebrated the nude form.

Ladies , gentlemen, all others (naked or not)who have OnlyFans accounts:  unless you want to accept the title of ""pornographer"", don't. Models, artists, and all are just fine. It's the rest of ""polite society"" that wants to faint, clutch its (whatever) and pretend that they have no interest in the beauty of the human form. So sad, for them ..."
2021-01-13 16:41,"The desperation that causes this career choice for many is a disheartening portrait of women in our society. It speaks volumes about work disparity, dignity and purpose. It is far past time we do better, and reward women for their real value as human beings."

Of course, TikTok is algorithm driven so soon it made it seem like everyone was doing it."
2021-01-13 16:57,"The desperation of these women can be easily traced to the $13 per hour paid to a first responder.  Everyone in the medical community to whom she hands off the patient makes at least twice that amount.
In Arizona teachers make under $30,000 PER YEAR for the first five years.  
Until the pie is shared in proportion to the importance of the job we will have this kind of not-so-quiet desperation in our country.

Yes, nice behavior for your friends/family; but why not save for the next rainy day?   And yeah, I'm sure the account is still open and receiving cash, because it's apparently so horrible for that person. It sounds like a good opportunity they are leveraging."

It sounds like a creative outlet and if I made money while doing it fine.
But I hate the idea of working hard for so little while the risk is so astronomical.

There is just too much cash to be made, and, after the current administration, there isn't anything anyone can do that will shame a person, their families or friends except be caught making a racial, sexual or religious slur. Even the President of the United States isn't ashamed of helping start a riot in which 5 people died. 

When I was 31 I did test shots for (this notorious women's skin magazine) and would have gone through with it except for the paltry pay of $500, which would be gone in less than a month, and the thought of people seeing my naked body in years to come, and what might they think? What penalty might I pay?

In the 90s, it mattered. In 2021,anything goes and I would be proud to have those old pics out there. I looked great and people were willing to pay cash. I was painting apartments at the time and my girlfriend, who worked at Billy's Topless on 23rd, came home one morning at 6 AM and bam! $600 cash on the dining room table. ""I'm in the wrong business,"" I thought.

It's also not funny...I am friends with many webmodels, I mean in real life, over years, and some of the dudes are pretty vile, disgusting, misogynistic and have turned a lot of them off to men, period, and reinforced stereotypes.

I apologize for those bozos. We're not all like that."
2021-01-13 16:20,"Not quite sure from this article as to what ""Only Fans"" is.  Is it silent or do those who post images talk  as in phone sex?  (  Is there a way to keep minors from posting on the site.  Certainly, there are plenty of magazines showing nudes and actual porn.  Is it stills or videos?  

I am curious about things like the cost of housing.  Wage doesn't matter much if other costs are reasonable but it's become de rigueur to raise the price of apartments in all sort of locales in the USA. (While the price of housing in many places goes down.. I am thinking of Detroit.. as well as small cities.)  

We have a crazy economy where everyone is supposed to be a stock market, bitcoin millionaire.  

When calling for a rise in wages one also needs to consider that a large number of people (retired) live on what is called a fixed income or social security.. Pennies can be pinched but only so far.   BTW when people are evicted who is going to occupy the empty spaces??"
2021-01-13 17:14,"I do not understand why high schools, nationwide, have not focused on teaching young people that the Internet is forever.

For the people who are so desperate and doing this, or thinking of doing it, imagine your future self. Imagine explaining the pictures to your future spouse, or your future children, or your future grandchildren. 

Plus, these photos  probably become the property of Only Fans once you post them. If Only Fans owns them, what will Only Fans do with them in the future? How will they distribute them to make money?

These sites are like a Pyramid Scheme. A few people at the top make a lot of money while everyone else gives up so much privacy to get very little in return. 

Maybe the new administration will be willing to write some laws to regulate this industry and make Only Fans have plain language, easy-to-understand legal agreements that describe in clear, transparent language what participants are LOSING when they upload photos and other content? 

Don't give your photos or other content away to ANYONE. Don't give them to Only Fans, or Facebook, or anyone. If you really want to sell photos, print them up as posters, create  a website yourself, sell the posters there, and collect whatever money you can make from them all for yourself alone.  

Maybe the reality of printing them up as posters will cause some to think twice about the potential long-term harm of selling nude self-portraits."

OnlyFans has more to do with neo-feminist movement and the narcissistic nature of social media in general. If one was to examine the Instagram/Facebook accounts of most of these women, they were already in this space. That space being online voyeurism, stripping and similar “professions”. Many of the OnlyFans accounts are notable female influencers who have tremendous incomes who are known for earning money and sponsorships for wearing less online.

But  what is troubling is that this economy has failed the working class, and women are being driving into doing something that is not a choice but their only way to pay their bills. It's not just Nude modeling, many have turned to prostitution as well. This economy that is so celebrated by the upper classes has destroyed the middle class  family and family values! Stanley Kubrick version of The Shining, depicted the abuses of Native Americans, Africans and women by the Wealthy, all to make a buck.

2021-01-13 15:17,"The Nytimes is a wonderful publication but its biases are just too much sometimes.

The title of the article suggests this is about job losses due to covid, and economic desperation among women forcing them to sell racy photos of themselves online. And the lead photo is of a woman who started selling such racy photos ""after losing her job as a medical biller."" But right there in the first paragraph it says that she did not lose her job; she QUIT her job to stay home with her 2 year old son. In other words, her decision had nothing to do with covid, or job losses, at all. The premise of the article's title is unsupported by the very first case given.

That is consistent with the several women I've known who have engaged in this kind of work. I'm a psychiatrist, so I've worked with 4 such women. None did it out of economic desperation. Sure, they enjoyed the extra money, but they all had other jobs that paid well enough, or were briefly between jobs when they started but willingly continued the work even after they found a new job. What these women had in common was a history of trauma, and/or very unhappy relationships or marriages, and in one case an expensive drug habit. It's overly simplistic and probably incorrect to attribute the growth in online webcamming to covid economic consequences, just as we don't attribute the explosion in TikTok and before that Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram to covid. We live in an era of oversharing. Webcamming is just another example."

2021-01-13 17:17,"United States stands out as one of the few advanced industrialized countries that have made sex work illegal with very tiny exceptions (namely, in rural Nevada). One wonders if this outlier status has to with America's Victorian virtues, its commitment to gender equality, or its economic abundance. I think it's becoming ever more clear that the answer is its assumption of economic abundance: the operating assumption is that with a robust labor market and social safety net for girls and women (primarily through Aid to Families with Children) women can be legally barred from engaging in sexual work for money to survive. Any reasonable person would, at this point, concede that nations that are far more committed to women's rights (New Zealand and Scandanavian counties come to mind) and other nations that are socially conservative (Singapore and Japan) legally allow and regulate various forms of sexual work within their borders. Given all the pressures on the American economy and society made acute during this economic crisis, we may be tittering on the verge of wide(r) spread and normalization of sexual work in our country. A wise nation would face the reality that the choice of sex workers is either above ground or underground. Decades of erosion in the American labor market from outsourcing, automation, retreat of labor unions, disinvestment in public education, commodification of sex and sexuality in media and the Internet has brought us to this place."

These women are Americans, and there has not been a war here, but their financial situations are just about as desperate as those survivors of war.  

This is a crisis for women, and also for the men in their lives and their  communities.   So-called ""ordinary"" men were last week goaded into committing insurrection at the US Capitol.

Of course not."

The solution isn't to regulate OnlyFans, the solution is to provide a decent enough safety net for all citizens that they don't have to do sex work without wanting to. And this is safe sex work, or at least, with no risk of immediate harm. Think of the workers and the homeless who do much more for much less, out of desperation.

Having worked in the industry, what I saw was lots of drug and alcohol abuse. Disassociation. Many started out as strippers than “graduated” into domination, prostitution and escort work. Of course time, addiction, and mental illness take a toll. The once flowing money isn’t so much later. These ladies (and men) have addictions to be fed, so some turn to petty crime such as shoplifting or credit card fraud when sex work is no longer tenable. Soon they have a criminal record and face kicking drugs in jail. 
It’s a hard cycle to break free, but it can be done. Outside support helps. Criminal justice reform, free mental health and drug treatment and job training for those without advanced degrees. 
When the GOP says they’re the party of law and order, it means they solve society’s problems by arresting people. They are willing to spend money on law enforcement and jails, but not on helping people. This is labeled “socialism,” even though it’s more cost effective and humane than a rotating jail door. The GOP donors know their big money can buy a good lawyer to keep them out of jail when their white collars stray. Tax cuts are harder to justify when social programs need funding."

Roommates is a start, not ""independent"" or desirable, but it is done and done often.

That is a big step down from what a working person aspired to after college. It is however also realistic. Many people in the past ""got a room"" instead of a house.

But we have now gone into a future where the woman is enabled and encouraged to exploit herself. I feel pretty certain most of them don't want to. Their comments reflect reluctance, shame, worry about their futures and frustrations. 
The income is not even reliable given the effort, time and some risks. And no one has said that it is an  ego syntonic and an empowering way to spend the day. They say that they are pushed to the financial brink. Thank you for this reporting. We need to look ourselves in the face and heart.

Without this, it is not like women are not pressed into sex work, or bad relationship choices.   But this is a vast improvement over any in person sex work in terms of safety, autonomy and control that the worker has.  Note, these are not not necessarily about hard core pornography.  The worker sets the boundaries based on the market and what they have to offer.  Lesions?  Girl friend?  Beats turning tricks, or hanging from a pole at a strip club trying to milk tips out of customers within touching range.  And where is the line on what we want to stigmatize?  What if I'm writing pornographic stories for people who I know aren't reading for their literary value.  What if I'm a programmer, and I put together a sexy avatar and sell ""her"" ""services"" online, ie she shows here simulated and body, leaving nothing to the imagination,  and talks to customers in loving and/or flirtatious ways?

Amd it has all of the flaws that a dingy, small-footed idol typically does, but worship we must. And only some pay obeisance in a satisfactory way, so our god doesn't reward everybody, but that is to be expected. And if this god lets you down, remember that it is always YOUR fault.

That was so a man could walk down the other side from a woman and not get a gratuitous ankle-glimpse.) Even the bikini bathing suit once was scandalous!

Our notions of what's embarrassing change constantly. A woman (or man) should be free to share or sell whatever images they want, completely without shame. The idea of modesty is a social construct - mostly propagated by people who don't like they way they look naked. 

Someone who fires or declines to hire an otherwise qualified employee or candidate simply because of the existence of nude photos is simply a prude, but much more importantly - an incompetent businessperson who is (hopefully) soon to be put out of business by a more enlightened competitor."

Is this any worse than what Playboy and Penthouse models did for many years?  You might call it 'sex work', but there's no physical contact at all, with anyone.   So, in an era of rampant STDs, this is actually the safest 'sex' of all.  Our television screens are already full of soft porn as it is, so maybe it's time to put that Puritanical mindset off to the side.

2021-01-13 16:36,"Doing this out of desperation? This should sound familiar. A study by the Prostitution Research Institute found that the vast majority of women in legal brothels in Nevada were there because of economic distress.

This conforms with similar studies in India and New Zealand where there is legal prostitution.

The porn industry, and that’s what OnlyFans is, makes billions from the economic desperation of women. Are there some women who readily choose this “work”? 

Of course, but again the data shows them to be a distinct minority. Yet their voice is typically heard while the women who have little or no choice to survive are relegated to the background.

The real issue here is what kind of society have we created? Or more pointedly, what kind of economic system pushes so many women into such desperate straits that they sell themselves as objects of male fantasy’s or worse?

And yes, when your next employer does a media search and discovers your previous “work” you will either not get hired or be expected to satisfy male fantasies in the office.

The nature of capitalism is to maximize profit by exploiting workers. With women the range of exploitation knows no limits.

This is not me moralizing or expressing sexual conservatism. It is time we called out this exploitation for the human rights abuses that it is and to recognize that these are our mothers, sisters and daughters. They deserve better.

OnlyFans and Patreon, another site with creators selling explicit photos of themselves, were born out of necessity as a next step beyond Instagram. They didn't develop within a bubble, the demand is there, and people (creators) have responded. There are models, male and female, on Instagram who have been stalked, attacked, even attempted rape.

Similarly to liquor sales, casinos, and illegal drugs: 80% of the revenue comes from 20% of the customers, many of whom have a troubled relationship with the 'product.'

On OF, these ""20%"" customers will tip big money for a more intimate online relationship, where they can engage in online role-play, commission tailored content, and generally have personal access to the models via text, video calls, etc.

Oftentimes, the more deviant the customer's taste, the more they pay the model to engage in it.

That's how the sausage is made. That's where the real money comes in.

There is no 'clocking out' at the end of the day. And successful models could be maintaining dozens of these relationships across their top customers.

Needless to say, it requires a certain ability to compartmentalize that goes beyond merely posing for racy pics. Many of the successful models were already sex workers.

Meanwhile, the models are inundated wth unsolicited messages from aggressive fans, scammers, blackmail artists, and internet trolls. 

There is no retreating from it. The business model depends on constant promotion. Every day you wake up and plough forward knowing it will invite even MORE of the above.

I can't agree with the well-meaning comments that echo the 'sex work is just like normal work' meme. This is something else."

In the third world, many women are being forced and trafficked against thier will to provide such services and often much more dangerous ones as well. It's  a survival situation. For every one American who feel liberated and in charge of the comodification of thier bodies there are hundreds if not thousands  of others that are not.

why would this be true?  viewing (almost always by males) and posting (almost always of females) adult nudity online and pornography more generally are legal, if distasteful to some.  

religious authorities might say that nudity is nakedness--as in original sin and immorality and shame--but that is not the argument in this case.

the article describes the age-old conundrum of what to do about female sexuality (more specifically, photos of nude bodies with XX chromosomes, nipples, bikinis, lingerie, short skirts, legs, hair,...) updated for the internet and populist age. this is like your grandfather's playboy, except that it is so popular and common. 

more generally (for both sexes), there is the conundrum of the separation of the public spheres and the private spheres, as in the right to privacy.  boundaries are especially difficult to define in the internet age, with internet snooping.  

editor's note:  ""jobless"" and ""struggling"" and ""not earn much"" in the title and subtitle have little to do with the general issue.  the general issue deals with human sexuality, nudity, eroticism and pornography; although some people say that money is sexy.  i am very confident that even the gainfully employed and rich post and view nude photos electronically, as well as write and read articles about such topics."

Is it morally acceptable as a society to sanction this form of vice, especially when there are already plenty of opportunities for vice out there?

Many of these women are ""choosing"" sex work in the same way a person would ""choose"" not to starve or go homeless. 

The fact that OnlyFans and this business model has become normalized in the US isn't a testament to our sexual liberation. Instead, it shows how desensitized we've become to the commodification and dehumanizing features of our late stage capitalism. The idea that a person needs to exhaust all means at their disposable to finance their right to life coupled with the extreme wealth inequality we see today in the US should be abhorrent to anyone with a conscience.

No one should be fired because they have engaged or are engaging in online sex work. Unfortunately, our federal government (specifically the GOP) decided to bar online sex workers from receiving small-business loans under the CARES Act (it was referred to as ""live performances of a prurient sexual nature""). The language is telling. The word ""prurient"" has negative connotations; it implies a certain amount of excess. So, in the middle of a pandemic in the year of our lord 2020, our representatives (mainly GOP) still see fit to intervene in Americans' sex lives. They don't seem terribly worried about the multiple billions of dollars of forgivable loans that were handed out to scammers and crooks. But sex work. . .god forbid!

Like the article says, this work isn't easy money. A lot (perhaps most) of the individuals making money through OnlyFans are still struggling. Of course, our federal government (the GOP again) doesn't really care about the financial struggles of most Americans. Again, they're more worried about themselves and their ultra-wealthy benefactors.

Political leadership matters. That is more apparent now than ever. I can only hope that these narrow-minded people will be voted out of the federal government in the coming years. Our country wants to move on. They keep holding us back. Let's stop pandering to conservatism."

2021-01-11 14:49,"What I have found is the most common misconception of the PPP program is a belief that it is intended to help small businesses survive.  While that is a worthy goal, that is not, and never was, the primary intent of the PPP program.  The primary intent is that employees continue to receive a Paycheck.
For the Sole Prop, while there are non-cash expenses for depreciation (I'm not a Tax CPA so there may be other things), mostly net income is the owner's income.  Running a Sole Prop is not easy (I had one years ago), but from my understanding of PPP there is no intent to disadvantage Sole Prop Owners compared to other borrowers.  Their circumstances are different, and so they are treated differently, but that does not necessarily mean unfairly."
2021-01-11 15:01,"I'm a small business owner. I understand the logic behind this ... sort of. Many sole proprietorships or single-member LLCs are shell companies, and it would be a mistake to allow companies like that to get tax-free grants from the government.

But what _doesn't_ make sense to me is that the PPP loan system is supposed to be just that, a loan. It only is supposed to flip to a grant when the business owner can demonstrate that the money was actually spent on an approved expense such as payroll. This seems like it'd be a good mechanism for enforcement. 

And it seems like a fix would be easy: just have a floor. Make the minimum PPP loan $50,000. This would be far more acceptable for banks and borrowers alike. To flip this to a grant, a legitimate borrower would have to run that money through payroll or otherwise demonstrate that the cash was going into their pocket (or another approved PPP expense). 

Final point: Some of the commenters on here saying that a cash-positive small business couldn't possibly be posting a loss on their taxes need to talk to an accountant! Tons of legitimate expenses are tax deductible -- asset depreciation, for example, or previous business losses -- and have nothing to do with cash flow or annual profitability. We could get into why our tax code is so complicated but that's a different story ..."

This next round isn’t going to help those small businesses either as it is based on lost revenues year over year but you still need payroll expenses to qualify."

   I eventually figured out the source of his ire.  Not only was he not sent a $1200 stimulus check (he didn't realize that he might still recoup it in taxes), he could not apply for self-employed unemployment because he had four employees.  When I asked if he had applied for PPP he said he had spent hours doing so and, after three months received $1500 for him, his four employees and his business.  I never told him that his compensation was about equal to what, as a self employed person who missed three weeks of business, I got (not counting the $2400 my wife and I got)."

You can get ""business"" health insurance for your family and deduct the entire amount as a business expense, your can write off depreciation on the part of your house used for business, etc etc.

The big reason to do this is the 15.3% self-employment tax, which is more burdensome for sole proprietors than income tax.

Eschewing the costly and constraining problems of insurance and electronic medical records (don't get me started), I kept hand-written charts and provided both medication and counseling, as opposed to the now common practice of telling patients, ""If you want to discuss your problems, go tell it to a therapist.""  I charged a sliding fee, including waiving the fee when needed.  I practice in small-town Iowa, but have patients who travel three hours one way to see me.  I answer my (flip) phone at all hours.  I do house calls.  I've never made much profit, but I provide the kind of care I'd want my own family to get.  The financial burden of the last 9 months has driven me under.

That 'gig' worker and the flagrant abuse of sub contractor designations to avoid employment taxes and mandated benefits is as widespread as it is just muddies the waters further. 

 If you report an income as a sole proprietor and you have records to prove it, your income, based on your tax filings, should be enough to verify your status. The business's loss of income over comparative periods should be the calculator for the loan amount. These so called loans should never have been loans at all, they should have been grants and the application process clear and  simple. They were and are anything but.

2021-01-11 21:28,"I've been a sole proprietor for 20+ years and this article correctly points out the problem for us: the loan was calculated based on 'payroll', but SP's don't run payroll. The Treasury arbitrarily decided after the law was passed that payroll for SP's = Schedule C, Line 31 on your 2019 taxes and nothing else.

So corporations got to pad their loans with their business rent, utilities, their employee's healthcare, retirement contributions in ADDITION to their payroll and didn't have to prove a single cent in any metric of profit. 

I was told by my credit union that none of my similar expenses were able to be taken into consideration according to the rules, I could only get 2.5 times Line 31 divided by 12 - no exceptions, no discussion, no other documentation would be considered. 

My loan amount wasn't quite the slap in the face it was for these people, but it was still a joke.

For independent operators, it should have been calculated based on Schedule C revenue, not profit. That's money that for most small business people goes directly back into the economy (or like these people interviewed - ALL of it goes back into the economy!). Unlike all the WFH salaried people padding their savings accounts with that same PPP money.

I find that it exposes the level of tax cheating and fraud that these Americans engage in on a regular basis.  In fact, the IRS should obtain these applications from the SBA and audit all of these folks.  

Let's be very clear - if your Schedule C income for a sole proprietorship (which means that you have NO employees and you are not paying payroll taxes) is so low that only show $100 in income - one of two things is at play:

1. You're not in a business that's making you any money at all.  For example, my wife files a Schedule C every year for less than $100 in royalties from a book published in 1999. In that case, you will almost certainly need some other form of income, unless you are depleting your savings. 

2. You're committing some form of tax fraud or other tax manipulation/evasion (remember what other famous figure only made $100 per year) which results in your being able to remove enough income from your business enterprise to survive, while not paying taxes. 

The PPP exists neither to prop up business failures or support frauds.  Sole proprietors are just that - one person businesses with NO employees.  There's no big scheme here.  

I see little way that a consultant of ANY type can have $100 or less of Schedule C income, and certainly NO way a practicing chiropractor could. No travesty - just fraud."

As we have started collecting Social Security their tax strategies have come back to haunt them. Having minimized their income for years, they find themselves with small Social Security Checks. The problem described here may be another result of minimizing ones income to avoid taxes.

I do not intend to condemn every sole proprietor but we have (at least for a few more days) a president who is proud of not paying taxes and sees 'besting the tax man"" as an achievement. Unfortunately, on a smaller scale, that is exactly what some of my friends thought.

The government needs all of us to pay a fair share of taxes. I am  not saying that all of these people have aggressively minimized their taxes but doing so is very common - it goes along with the belief that NOT paying taxes is a good thing. If you pay less because you take aggressive deductions don't be surprised when you receive less. And please, don't complain."
2021-01-14 14:05,"Add Cleveland Clinic to this list. Employees who work at home and have no patient interaction at all (nor even any interaction with other staff members) are being vaccinated. In fact, some employee's SOLE contact with a CCF facility, staff or patients will be when they arrive for their vaccination.

I had expected an institution like CCF to recognize and prioritize the medical need for these vaccinations in at-risk populations. I was wrong."
2021-01-14 14:48,"NYU Langone has been forcing their employees to return to office since summer 2020 despite employee protests–no accommodations were given for people who had high-risks members at home. These employees were not medical staff, they could have done their jobs at home easily. No surprise that they were one of the ones who decided to give these vaccines out to regular office staff, instead of letting them work from home to protect the community."
2021-01-14 14:49,"My 29 year old niece who is a NYU researcher and not a medical doctor has been vaccinated last week at NYU. She goes to university lab some days for work, mostly works from home. She has NO contact with any hospital staff ever. She doesn’t even go to the hospital, just goes to university lab. My 82 year old father is waiting."
2021-01-14 14:55,"With all the articles that are coming about about vaccines expiring due to mismanagement, I'm less concerned with employees of the hospitals holding the vaccines getting theirs ""out of turn"". Vaccines in arms, whatever arm is available, and until we can get our scheduling and management systems under control, if that means vaccinating people outside the currently-approved CDC guidelines that's perfectly fine with me."
2021-01-14 15:27,"At my hospital, we’ve gone so far as to vaccinate our nutrition/food service and environmental service staff members. I’d rather see the vaccine go to good use than be wasted to expiration. 

Unfortunately, our surplus is partly due to a lower than expected turnout. Many of my coworkers are still skeptical about the vaccine."
2021-01-14 15:32,"Another one: my sister, who works for Mayo at home and *never* comes close to a clinic or a patient, has been vaccinated. She didn't feel good about it. 

Meanwhile, the assisted living facility where our mother resides reports that only 40 percent of the staff who have been offered the vaccine thus far have been vaccinated. They're refusing because of all the anti-vax stories out there. Unbelievable."
2021-01-14 15:39,"It is truly outrageous that this is happening. In my own circle, psychologists at a Manhattan clinic have received their first shot even though NONE of them are seeing patients in person & many don’t have underlying medical conditions. But my 78 year old husband, who has Leukemia cannot get an appointment."
2021-01-14 15:40,"I am not patient facing and have the option to work from home. It’s not optimal to work from home and get my job done so with permission (and signing a waiver), I go in 3-4 days a week to my hospital connected office-outpatient building cubicle. I usually have to go over to another area in the hospital at least once a day.

I was informed yesterday I qualify to be vaccinated because of patient exposure in our building and at the hospital. I was happily surprised and signed up to get it  later today. Now I’m on the fence after reading this because I’m middle aged and healthy. I asked them to confirm I wasn’t “cutting the line” because I’m willing to wait and was told vaccinations in our area are going smoothly and the qualifications are expanding. I have helped numerous older folks (65 ) sign up to be vaccinated and most have gotten an appointment within 2 days. All our frontline docs, nurses etc. have been offered the vaccinations and those who took it are getting their second doses this week.
 
I don’t know, though, I’m going to have to think about this, there’s still time to cancel and open up the slot for someone else. Lol this is not an ethical choice scenario I’d ever predicted a year ago. Life is weird."
2021-01-14 15:43,This is not perfect. I get it. But if we demonize every error this will slow down the roll out. Every vaccine given is a potential life saved.
2021-01-14 15:53,"I fully support any hospital on-site employees to get vaccinated whether it’s a doctor or a student or daycare teacher at the hospital nursery. The hospital relies on more than medical staff and this is for everyone’s safety. However, vaccinating staff working from home to get them to go back to working on site when they can do their job perfectly well from home is not good."
2021-01-14 16:08,"As a physician who does qualify because of direct patient care, and who has completed the vaccination program. I completely agree with allowing administrators, graduate students and anyone working in the hospital system to get vaccinated immediately. 
There are a few realities here - everyone should get vaccinated at the end of the day, and with an ideal rollout we would be moving at a much faster speed. But there have been roadblocks and mismanagement at the federal level. If these individuals were not to get vaccinated, the vaccines would likely be sitting in storage until someone made a decision about what to do with them. Who that someone would be remains unclear. 
Second, not everyone in the healthcare system is taking the vaccine. Many are refusing.  So then why not give it to others within the system who are willing to take it?
Lastly, we are advised that it is possible the virus could be airborne. So when we are in the hospital, even when not in patient rooms, we are now told to wear an eye shield, in addition to a protective facemask, simply when walking about the hospital system. If this is true, then administrators and grad students within the system face some of the same risks as we do."
2021-01-14 16:59,"At least the doses aren't sitting in a vial waiting to be used. A vaccine sitting in the refrigerator offers no protection for anyone, vaccines administered to someone, regardless of if they are high risk, offers gradually increased protection to the overall community. I would much rather see vaccines being utilized than see them sit on a shelf as they are at the moment. Let's stop worrying about who gets them first or who is jumping the line and just get them out."
2021-01-14 17:00,"As a vaccinated physician in a large academic medical center, I've witnessed first-hand just how tricky this roll-out can be. The Pfizer vaccine is stored and -80C. Once thawed, a multi-use vial needs to be used in a short time window.

Rather than wasting doses and letting perfect be the enemy of the good, we need to use the immunizations on whoever is there and able to be vaccinated on short notice.

Going forward, there should definitely be a system to have community groups who are at high risk on standby, but our fragmented healthcare system has made this very difficult."
2021-01-14 17:02,"If we're worried about the speed of the rollout we can't wait for a team to go through 80,000 employees and say, ""Dr. Smith has a grant and is no longer seeing patients.  No vaccine.""  ""Dave in IT works from home but has to drive in if one of the telemetry devices in the ER goes down.  Vaccine.""  ""Betty is an administrator.  No vaccine.""  ""Betty is a licensed RN and is working shift on the floor due to the surge.""  ""Oh, sorry Betty, here is your vaccine.""

This nit picking is just not productive."
2021-01-14 14:12,What is wrong with these institutions?  Are they ignoring science?
2021-01-14 14:17,"Any health care worker who can work from home, like a psychiatrist for instance, should not have priority.

Base eligibility on age alone, and let’s vaccinate as many people as possible."
2021-01-14 14:43,"At least someone’s getting it. So, this is worse than it going to waste? Let’s just hasten the distribution and open it up to whoever wants it."
2021-01-14 15:56,"This is ridiculous. Working in health care, patient facing or not, is on par with coal mining (especially in administrative roles). This is a small but appreciated reward people who keep hospitals operating are entitled to for their efforts. Doctors and nurses can’t work without the teams behind the scenes!

Please don’t pretend to care about “skipping the line” and just get the vaccine. We all need it eventually and this performative gesture of declining so others who are “more deserving” is self serving and obnoxious. Just get it and move on."
2021-01-14 17:13,"Once again, the system is biased for the haves."
2021-01-14 18:16,"University of Florida Health has been doing this. The entirety of their marketing department has had the vaccine - 80+ individuals who very rarely are patient facing, are mostly young and healthy, and could very well work from home. 

Not only are they getting them, they are showing off their cards like an “I voted” sticker.

I used to work with these people several years ago, and I thought I was just being cynical and petty until I read this article. Now I realize its a matter of privilege."
2021-01-14 18:30,"I would be more upset if everything had been going well and these were just people taking advantage of the system. However, things have been going poorly and it makes sense to keep hospitals and labs going strong. Just because someone is in an office doesn’t mean they aren’t an important part of keeping the institution running! And we absolutely know that deaths go up if our medical infrastructures are not running effectively. If a medical facility requires a person to physically come in, then that person should be protected. (Neither I nor my family works in medicine, just to be clear.)"
2021-01-14 19:45,"Add Weill Cornell Medicine researchers with no patient-facing roles, no chance of patient contact, and who aren’t directly involved in COVID-related research to the list. These aren’t individuals that “keep the hospital running”. Apparently, there’s even a “script” for what to say in the vaccination line so that one can legitimize getting their first dose. If the vaccine were going to go to waste, that’s one thing. But some of these individuals knowingly do not meet the criteria for the current priority group and have decided they’re deserving anyway. What many people outside of the academic research world don’t know is that people who do cutting-edge research at big name institutions are often the most self-serving, self-preservationists you’ll ever meet. The field has created monsters out of once thoughtful, conscientious humans due to the cut-throat environment that promotes self-preservationist behavior. I’m not surprised AT ALL that this is happening. Desperate times call for desperate measures, no??"
2021-01-14 20:00,"Who's surprised?

This is the United States of America where there are millions of folks who have no medical insurance at all, are underinsured or don't have access to basic care.

Does anyone think those people are surprised that the vaccine is going first to the very privileged, wealthy and connected?

I went more than a decade in the 1990s, in my 40s, with pre-existing conditions that went largely untreated and drove me into bankruptcy because no insurance company would sell me health insurance - even though I could pay for it. Those companies believed it was better for their bottom line to exclude people like me from their risk pool.

This chaos with access to the vaccine is proving to the millions of have-nots once again that the haves in this country come first and they're willing to trample every one else in order to protect themselves.

The CDC and federal government set this process up in such a way that it could easily be corrupted by those in power.

Surprise!  It's corrupted.

This is how things work in America.

Don't be surprised."
2021-01-14 20:14,"There should be no such thing as an ""elite medical center"" in the US; classism is exactly the problem with the health care industry."
2021-01-14 20:44,"Simple is better. It’s already playing out this way, so I’ll spell it out:

1. All healthcare and long-term care workers, including nursing homes.
2. Administer by age, 65 and older first. Then 55 and older, etc., all the way to small children. Move on to the next interval when the previous one has less of a line.

That’s it. Since we’re already to #2, all anyone needs for a vaccination is a valid ID.

Everything else is noise, including this article."
2021-01-14 20:54,"They work in hospitals. That's not essential enough? 

Should we stratify the priority list into sub-groups, and sub-sub groups, and then have a government committee spend a week reviewing every individual case where it's not 100% clear which sub-sub-sub group they fit into, or rank every American from 1 to 340m based on a multivariate matrix of how essential they are, and how exposed they are, and how old they are, and how careful they are, and how healthy they are? We could set up an appeals process for anyone who doesn't agree with their own or anyone else's rank, and an army of investigators would examine every appeal. We could get everyone vaccinated by the year 2060."
2021-01-14 21:38,"It's very frustrating - I have some friends that work for health systems but they have not been at work since March 2020. 

They have now been vaccinated.

They are young and in their 30s with no health issues and freely admit that they only got it because they work for the system.

Meanwhile, none of my family members who are over 75 or essential employees have even had the chance and it will probably be months before they do.  

I've already resigned myself to being at the very end of the line (thanks to the NYTimes tool) which means my 14-year-old son will be eligible before me (I'm 52) even though it's not yet approved for children.  

But people who are not in contact with the public or who have been WFH since the beginning are getting priority right now and that wrong."
2021-01-14 21:40,"All of this squabbling over who goes first, who goes second, etc. is not productive.  Get the vaccine into someones arm as quickly as you can and go after more supplies.  Ration a little more stringently when the numbers start going down.  Where is the sense of urgency?  Where are the contingency plans for slow production?  The T rump era can't be gone soon enough.  I have a pre-existing condition and at almost 60 I am willing to hunker down for a while longer and vaccinate those most likely to spread the disease."
2021-01-14 22:00,"The focus needs to be on getting shots in arms - enough of this academic discussion of how to prioritize some tiny, specific group relative to some other tiny, specific group.

If we're going to hit +1 million people vaccinated per day, we need mass clinics in sports stadiums, convention centers, and the like. Check IDs to verify age. Forgot your ID but look ""old""? That's fine! I see no problem with hospitals using spare doses for students, admin staff, or anyone else who happens to be around.  More people immune gets us that much closer to herd immunity.

Vaccine doses sitting in freezers equals people dying unnecessarily. The lack of urgency here is really infuriating."

Cuomo has done an AWFUL job of organizing vaccine rollout and would rather watch MILLIONS of vaccine doses expire than to give the vaccine to the “wrong person”. Loosening the (Byzantine) eligibility restrictions was the right decision, and while the focus should be on vaccinating frontline workers and seniors, the main focus should be getting as many people vaccinated as possible and not tying the hands of (or trying to punish) the healthcare workers delivering said vaccine. Cuomo has proven himself time and again to be an absolute failure in response to this pandemic and it’s a damn shame, because people continue to die due to his inability to lead."
2021-01-14 15:07,at the very least. they should NOT receive the second vaccination....go to the back of the line!
2021-01-14 17:44,"To learn the truth about how the vaccines are being given out, the Times should send reporters to the for-profit nursing homes here in California.

I have two close friends -- one a registered nurse, one a janitor -- employed by a nursing home where the first ones to receive the vaccine on January 4th were not the nurses, not the doctors, not the janitorial staff who clean the patients' rooms, and not anyone who provided patient care.  No, the first ones in line were the owners of and investors in these nursing homes, followed by office administrators who never see a patient, ever.

Because those management folks had made the arrangements with the pharmacy chain that was brought on site to administer the vaccine, those same management folks dictated who would be given the vaccine and in what order.  Health care workers who actually provide patient care stood in the rain for two hours (yes it was raining that day in southern California) while the management mucky-mucks and owners of the place got their vaccines. 
 
Name of the joint? Five Star Healthcare, Thousand Oaks CA.  You can bet your last dollar it is not the only nursing home in the country where this abomination occurred."
2021-01-14 17:51,"Jeez, can’t we maintain discipline and fairness in anything in this country?"
2021-01-14 18:02,"Anyone can spread the virus.

It's better to give vaccine to someone rather than letting it go to waste, as New York State mandates.

Careful prioritization exacts a price in inefficiency.  The ""undeserving"" low-priority recipient is still prevented from spreading the virus.

Cuomo wants to throw out unused doses at the end of the day.  That makes no sense at all."

2021-01-14 22:06,I am wondering why does the article support the premise that the state guidelines are effective? Isn’t journalism supposed to question premises rather than support them blindly and ask: why has getting a vaccine become such a complicated ordeal that more vaccines are sitting on shelves than are being injected into people’s arms?
2021-01-14 22:08,My neighbor is an attorney for the University of Michigan and works from home.  He got the vaccine!
2021-01-14 22:10,A lot of jealousy in these comments. The ship is sinking and the goal is to get everyone in a lifeboat. Many will die if we waste time fretting over who’s worthy or not. Line up and get onboard!
2021-01-14 22:18,"This can't be the first time anyone has tried to solve the distribution problem of (1) prioritizing those who most need a perishable or time-sensitive material, while (2) never letting that material go to waste.  

Would the mathematician or economist who has already solved this problem and published it please speak up."
2021-01-14 22:54,"I am one of these people who has gotten vaccinated “ahead of my turn” through the large health system that I work for, which is the county distributor for Los Angeles. I am young and healthy, working in the hospital’s IT department. An email came into my inbox unexpectedly last week that some employee vaccination slots were open and I jumped at the chance to get vaccinated the same day. Do I feel incredibly lucky to have gotten vaccinated so early in the rollout? No doubt about it. Do I think this makes me a bad or selfish person? Not in the slightest. 

The vaccines rationed for the day must get used as they are not shelf stable, and many people are opting out of vaccination so optimizing an efficient rollout in which no dose is wasted is a daily evolving challenge. And if the eventual goal is to gain herd immunity within the whole community then I am helping to reach that goal. 

I empathize with those who are distressed with their calculated wait time to inoculation and agree that there should be better standards of equity to distribute the available doses to the whole population. But it’s hardly surprising that the health system wants to protect all of its staff first - we each contribute our parts to the smooth function of patient treatment, including the next stages of vaccine rollout to the community at large. We are all in this together, and to focus on this as a zero sum game does not make the convoluted and difficult process of distribution any easier."
2021-01-15 0:35,It is administration mismanagement. It is not as though a researcher at a hospital can say 'please give my dose to a nursing home resident'. These 'elite' hospitals have excellent distribution plans. The same issue was present with covid tests. Harvard was able to test every employee weekly for covid just because they had the resources. There was/is no current way to facilitate/ move these resources to those who truly need it. It is a lack of communication and ability to facilitate a truly fair roll out.
2021-01-15 0:38,"I am a physician with direct contact with patients. I have no hospital affiliation, so I could not receive the vaccine. I have been checking daily, and have not been able to secure an appointment.

2021-01-15 0:47,"I wonder if alternates are scheduled so that doses for missed appointments can be given to more people who better meet state and federal guideline criteria? Regardless, I hope these ""shaming"" articles don't prevent people from getting their second shots, since everyone properly vaccinated helps to slow the spread for all. In the meantime, we can help by wearing our masks (or two) while waiting. (I'll patiently wait alone, as someone who will be in one of the last groups). Be safe, all!"
2021-01-15 1:14,"In contrast, Pfizer has announced that the only employees who will receive the vaccine outside of state public health vaccination programs are those essential to the manufacturing and supply chain of medications. Not even the company executives or board members will receive the vaccine ahead of the CDC recommended priority groups. Moderna on the other hand is offering the vaccine to all their employees and their family members. To be fair, they have a lot fewer. But that said, would still have been easy for Pfizer to do without disrupting their supply commitments and they could use any number of excuses to justify this. At least someone seems to want to do the right thing here."
2021-01-14 22:41,"Let's not get our knickers in a knot over who gets the shot when. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Especially when they're throwing out vaccine because they can't get them into the ""right"" arms fast enough. Go faster!"
2021-01-14 23:41,"Selflessness, ethics and morality take a vacation and a""me first"" attitude will always raise its ugly head in a crisis when guidelines are not clearly stated or enforced, especially when distribution of a coveted item is up for grabs. There is no legitimate rationalization for accepting a dose of the vaccine which is in short supply when there are others who are in greater need."

2021-01-15 1:16,"Remote work does not apply to work in science research and medicine, so a need to vaccinate everyone in a teaching hospital is crucial to insure a work place is safe. The Covid19 is spreading like wild fire all over the country and the current vaccine guidelines is to inoculate as many people as vaccine available stocks."

2021-01-15 1:52,"'Elite' medical centers have proven to be highly efficient at distributing the vaccine that has been allocated to them.  The national average is less than 1/3 of the distributed vaccine has been administered.   Medical centers have now learned to streamline their vaccination processes, while incurring the costs of paying nurses, and buying needles and syringes and handling the medical waste.  They are rapidly becoming a go to for vaccine distribution to the public and will do so a lot more efficiently than can possibly happen at a local drug store.  The Pfizer vaccine is the one that has been primarily distributed to medical centers and it requires ultralow temperature freezer storage.  Its distribution would go badly if not for medical centers that are equipped to handle it.  I applaud medical centers for their work.  The real problem is a lack of any organized national distribution plan.  Remember when the military was going to do it?  Maybe they will beginning January 21st."
2021-01-15 2:19,"I am an academic whose office is in an outpatient clinical building at a major medical school. I am working from home and have no contact with patients or specimens.  Because of my official bureaucratic record of work residence, I get emails saying that I am ""eligible"" for the vaccine.  However, when I click the email's link to schedule a vaccine, I am taken to the state's Dept Health site, which asks me if I meet criteria, which I do not.  But broader point being, large health systems cannot easily parse who is eligible on a case-by-case basis. I can totally understand how med school systems in other states are giving vaccines writ large because their data systems aren't designed for systemically identifying eligible individuals.  Please do not demonize healthcare entities and linked medical university systems for imperfections in their implementation on short notice.  A better target would be the shambles of a federal plan for rollout of the vaccine."
2021-01-15 2:34,"CDC and HHS have performed poorly in formulating and communicating strategy around the tiering of risk groups and their prioritization.  It’s clear that our government experts failed to game out the implementation adequately.  

As much as I hate to give FL and TX any accolades for their risk management, they improved the strategy by going immediately to 65  on rollout of the first tier.  That said, health systems that aren’t following a clearly defined and approved policy, which would presumably require deliberation over rationale, may be underserving their communities.  

All in all, some flexibility is required to ensure the most efficient utilization of available vaccine.  Every vaccination given is a step in the right direction toward quelling the pandemic.  Moreover, those under 30 seem to be the most prolific spreaders.  So, a mosaic of age groups getting vaccinated could be quite beneficial, depending on local demographics.  Let’s be satisfied, if local implementation seems utilitarian and mostly fair, if not always fair."
2021-01-15 2:34,"As a physician at a teaching hospital in NYC who has received the vaccine, I think that at the end of the day, everyone working in the hospital should be getting the vaccine. The question is who goes first (ideally everyone in the ER, those working in ICUs and the COVID units, etc). And the vaccine should not be going to waste. Yes, people should not be jumping the line at their institution and the vaccine should go first to those with clinical duties and those who are interacting with patients or are in patient rooms. But everyone working in the hospital needs to get vaccinated."
2021-01-15 2:47,Just vaccinate people. If they're near the needle  stick it in their arm. That's less people spreading the virus.
2021-01-15 2:54,Look at Stanford medical school
2021-01-15 2:31,"I guess that it is great that we have this sort of small scale « investigative reporting », but considering that elsewhere there are stories of people working in the health profession that refuse to get vaccinated, leading, quite probably, others to wonder what they know... all this sort of « stirring controversy », when there’s not any super huge problem, it doesn’t seem helpful.

It’s amazing anything ever gets done, because anytime one does anything there is always somebody that is going to stand up and say, « hey, hey, hey, what’s going on here ??? »"
2021-01-09 18:44,"It’s a travesty that vaccines sit unused or have to be discarded while thousands die every day from COVID-19. There are many, like myself, who are retired health care professionals with active licenses who would volunteer to administer the vaccines but no one has reached out to us. There has to be much more effort put into coordination and distribution so that we can finally get this pandemic under control."
2021-01-09 19:30,"We need a simple clear system to guide allocating vaccination.   A purely age based system is appropriate now that medical workers have had a month of vaccine access.   Start with those 75 and up, then as more doses are available, move to those 65 and up, then 55 and so on.   

A simple age based system addresses the most key factor in death risk from Covid.   Age is well documented and respected.   A simple clear system will reduce chaos and maximize fairness."
2021-01-09 19:38,"There are at least three things wrong with the vaccination plans. One is that they rested on the assumption that the bottleneck was going to be vaccine scarcity. That turned out not to be true. In many cases, health care workers, particularly nursing home staffers, refused to get vaccinated, and because no one had anticipated having leftover doses, no one had a plan for how to use them.

The second problem was a failure to provide money and organization. The states needed resources to do the job, but Trump told them that they were on their own.

The third problem is more subtle. The vaccination effort is being hamstrung because the people in charge decided that it was more important to make sure that the wrong people didn't jump the line than to get as many people vaccinated as possible. The obsession with making sure that the undeserving don't receive a public good has long been a feature of the right. In this case, the left, driven by a  misguided interpretation of social justice, is responsible for disaster. Many, many people who could have been saved are going to suffer and die because of well intentioned but impractical restrictions on who is allowed to get the vaccine when. Ironically, most of those people are going to be exactly those the restrictions were intended to protect."
2021-01-09 19:41,"Time is the enemy here.  Armed with some knowledge about who is most at risk, the mission is to get the vaccine into as many arms as possible without delay.  If people don’t immediately line up in priority order, just keep going, do the best you can with what you have.  It’s the old problem of what to do if you come upon a river full of people who are drowning:  no time for analysis and reflection, just jump in and save them, do what you can.  And the process now has to be as simple as possible.  Just a signed/dated slip of paper or a stamp on your permanent inoculation record, if you have one, and a corresponding SIMPLE record for health department record-keeping, should be enough.  We are trying to save lives, not satisfy the needs of future historians.  If we fail, there may not be any historians left."
2021-01-09 19:41,"My family and I are more than ready for the vaccine. States should give priority to people who want to get it. Start with those 65 and older and after 3 days, open up to anyone who wants to get vaccinated. This should be a 24/7 operation. NO vaccines should be wasted."
2021-01-09 19:51,"I am an RN.  For the past 3 weeks I have helped staff a hospital vaccine clinic.  At present the quantity of available vaccine exceeds the ability for it to be administered.  There needs to be a 2-pronged approach:  vaccination of masses of the young and mobile, without medical conditions or hx of anaphylaxis, who can make themselves available via drive through (at stadium or airport lots, w EMTs on site) on relatively short notice, and facility-based appointments for people who desire or require counseling.  Work from both ends towards the middle....trickle down based on risk stratification will take forever."
2021-01-09 20:01,"I agree that health care workers (including doctors, nurses, lab technicians, etc. who have the highest risk of being infected) should go first.  I am saddened by the large number of people in this country who view the elderly as 'disposable' because they have lived long lives, and have outlived their usefulness to society, as they are currently not employed.  I have also noted that the majority of elderly have publicly indicated they can wait and would choose others to go first.   Whether an older person is safe at home and retired, the reality is all hospitals and care facilities are struggling to admit new patients.  Logic dictates to relieve the pressure on hospitals and health care workers, elderly and people with severe underlying conditions should be in the next vaccination group after health care workers, which would relieve the pressure in hospitals and healthcare workers.  Whether someone has lived a full life, can isolate in place, are retired, or teach others or not is irrelevant.  Currently, even victims of car accidents, heart attacks, strokes, and people (of all ages) needing care for serious illnesses may not be able to receive care, or if they do, may have to be shuttled to other hospitals and have life-saving care delayed because hospitals are full, and health care workers may simply not be available to treat them.  This is why many healthcare workers say the elderly and individuals with severe comorbidities should be vaccinated first."
2021-01-09 20:01,"The CDC official guidance puts 110+ millon ""essential"" workers on the same tier as adults aged 65-74. This has nothing to do with saving the most lives (their own models say their plan will lead to more deaths).

The simplest and most obvious thing to do is make the vaccine available by age. Simple to implement, and it saves the most lives."
2021-01-09 20:19,AZ has done a few hundred thousand vaccination despite receiving millions of doses! Banner Health boasts 60 vaccinations per hour - an eight hour day - 480 vaccinations. A five day work week means 2400 vaccinations. Clearly they need to increase the number of stations! Officials tout Walgreens and CVS but pharmacies do not have waiting space and the wait for a standard flu vaccine is 30 min! The Tucson and Phoenix have outdoor stadiums - perfect for large groups in open spaces. The universities have qualified medical staff and nursing and medical schools. What’s the problem?
2021-01-09 20:43,"The untold story here is that a significant portion of healthcare workers are choosing not to have the vaccine, a fact that is not pointed out in the article.  People don't want to say it out loud, but in many states, that's the reason there is a real risk of vaccine not being used if the population is not expanded."
2021-01-09 20:56,"As an inpatient healthcare provider I’ve received my first shot, but only last week. I was a bit disappointed when visiting our vaccine clinic. Our clinic was basically empty and we have plenty vaccine available. We vaccinated about four to five employees an hour. While the initial rollout was slow, and reasonably so, I see no reason the vaccine should not be distributed and administered as quickly as possible. The permitted groups should be expanded but with priority given to those that are in a more vulnerable group.
To add the federal government must provide funds to administer the vaccine. For instance, I’d gladly administer it for free however my union contract says I must be paid. Hospitals and clinics will need to come up with the funding to establish clinics and administer the vaccine when the healthcare system is strained and losing billions. Not to mention that most healthcare workers are already exhausted. If the the government is interested in getting the vaccine to the public, it needs to provide the funds."
2021-01-09 20:59,"This is what I believe should happen:
- move all non-mask wearing, party-going, traveling, COVID-denying people to the very end of the line, regardless of age, or any other co-morbitities - hence this would include Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, etc. 
vaccinate first: 
-) ANYONE who works in a hospital and doctor's and interacts with patients (this means cleaning staff) but NOT administrators
-) people working with customers in the grocery stores
-) people working on farms, meat processing pants, etc.
-) imprisoned people
-) caretakers (e.g. home health aides)
-) bus drivers
then you can expand it to other professions and other people"

2021-01-09 20:49,The oldest are the modest at risk of death. They should have priority in vaccinations. Slow walking the vaccines is a disgrace.
2021-01-09 20:11,"The degree to which this project has been mishandled is disgusting.  The Trump Administration has deliberately foregone securing more supplies, despite having first dibs from Pfizer on 100 million additional doses.  They have completely abdicated on doing any planning to rally vaccination drives, and get the other logistics in play for doing shots.  And, as usual, this incompetence has come against the backdrop of so much chest-puffing and inflated expectations - remember the original promise was to have 100 million Americans fully vaccinated by New Year's Day.

Also, because this can't go unacknowledged:  You can't see Governor DeSantis's full right hand in the picture accompanying this article, but this is one of the most disgusting things I've seen.  Given all DeSantis had been doing to get that woman killed this past year, he might as well be stabbing her in the back with that hand."
2021-01-09 20:25,"All of this simply amplifies the mendacity and ineptness of the trump administration.

The country has wasted two months dithering around vaccination: first creating a fictitious triage of who gets vaccinated first, then shipping millions of doses to states that were unprepared to vaccinate, and now those that are ready and willing to be vaccinated sit and sit wondering when or if we will actually be vaccinated.

This albatross could not be more confusing and poorly mismanaged. 

I certainly hope the next administration has a better plan.

Meanwhile hundreds of thousands get sick daily and thousands die.

This whole fiasco illuminates the incompetence of the trump administration and the Republican Party."

80% of deaths from Covid are in people 65 and older."
2021-01-09 21:05,"Just how does vaccinating young healthy people ahead of those constrained to hunkering down at home or worried sick while having to go to work due to comorbidities make sense? 

Why not vaccinate those in high exposure essential jobs followed by those with comorbidities likely to result in hospitalization and higher risks of death?"
2021-01-09 21:08,"Many facilities are purposely wasting vaccine, because they have a few doses left over, which they are afraid to use on another group for fear of government retribution. This is easily fixable with the following mandate:
Any extra doses of vaccine that may need to be wasted may be used on appropriate individuals as determined by the lead healthcare professional on site."
2021-01-09 21:30,"The goal is to get vaccinated. Which plan is most expedient? Look around the world. It is going by age for rapid rollout. At least people in Florida know that vaccines are getting used quickly.

We, in America, are having problems getting healthcare and nursing homes vaccinated, the easiest due to their location. Hospitals and nursing centers should be quick.  

Being over 65, I can only wonder how long I will the more challenging groups up next in the rollout. 

Rather than the ACIP committee of the CDC, healthcare professionals, we should have employed those trained in logistics. Trump didn’t do it and I also have little hope Biden can. 

Mr. Biden is now urging all doses out, without respecting science and even Dr. Fauci’s wisdom.  We must follow guidelines to ensure our second shot is given on time for maximum protection. Yes, more doses welcome if a second shot is reserved. However, vaccines are waiting for people not the other way around. 

Another critical question yet not known. Does the vaccine protect the vaccinated person from spreading the covid virus to others. We know it protects the vaccinated person from showing symptoms, thus they could be asymptomatic vaccinated spreaders. Just what those last in line need."
2021-01-09 21:44,"Do it like the airlines when they load planes. If there aren’t enough people in the highest risk category available, open it up to the next highest risk group. Then when more people in the highest risk group come along, they can immediately get in line (or move to the front of the line)."
2021-01-09 21:50,"I think there should be high priority groups.  However, from what I hear from colleagues in the health care field in NYS there is a vaccine inventory waiting for health care staff to decide be inoculated. I am a physician by training and a public health specialist.  I think it is time to ""open the gates"" to the general population.  People in the priority groups should have preference at the vaccination sites but other people should be allowed to get their vaccines.  Waiting until the summer for the ""other groups"" to get their vaccines is not a good public health strategy.  I urge Gov. Andrew Cuomo to ""open the gate"" right now."
2021-01-09 21:51,"I was wondering if the epidemiological analysis supports larger age brackets in some states. 

For example, Colorado has a relatively low rate of (a) obesity and (b) diabetes, which are by far the two risk factors that are the largest, population-wise.  We are sometimes #1 in the US in our low rate of these categories.

In that case, the age brackets emerge as a weightier risk factor.  

That is, if you look at severe COVID cases, deaths, in a state, in a relatively healthier state like CO, a greater percentage of those severe cases/deaths are attributable to age than to the other risk factors.

Hence, making the age brackets bigger (going to age 60+, which our Governor is planning to do in  late February after the 70+ are finished), is the best way to reduce the burden on the health care system as well as save more lives."

I know over a dozen people in health care roles that have already gotten the vaccine, some have gotten their second dose as well. If other health care employees don’t want the vaccine then move RIGHT AWAY to the next group. Leaving vaccines in freezers while people die is unfathomable."
2021-01-09 22:31,I think 65+ should come before “underlying conditions.” The latter has to be weighed carefully. The former just needs a driver’s license.
2021-01-09 22:40,"I think part of the problem is that governors desperately want to avoid a situation where the wealthy and connected get access first. (There are already wealthy spineless snakes here in Manhattan trying to slither their way into the front of the line.)

Essential workers and the elderly should absolutely have the right to go first, though this 1A, 1B, 1C, etc approach is atrociously inefficient. Let it open to larger groups."
2021-01-09 22:48,"Everyone on Medicare should be vaccinated first and assigned an appointment automatically and immediately.  This would cover everyone over 65 and include nursing home residents and cover any concerns about billing.  And anyone under 65 should be able to wait in person on standby if there are no-shows are extra capacity.  Lastly, physicians should be able to exercise their professional judgment to vaccinate their their more vulnerable patients.  However, if this was actually a well run and resourced program there should just be giant tents set up in parks and parking lots in every community where you can walk in, get the shot, and walk out as fast as possible.  The inefficiency of what we are doing now is breathtaking."
2021-01-09 23:00,"I will be in the minority here but I think that everyone should have equal access regardless of age, health, or job. I am 70 and yes, I would like to get vaccinated quickly, but we need the younger people back in work and their kids back in school more than we need us retired people to be vaccinated. The economy does not depend on retirees. Just make the whole thing a lottery, like the Vietnam era draft, based on your birthday."
2021-01-09 23:04,"I'm over 65 and I must say that I am not happy with the idea of getting just one inoculation initially--and then having to wait months for a second.  While I'd love to get out of my house, finally, I'm not going to be fully protected with just one shot.  So, I'm going to remain sequestered anyway.  One shot doesn't really help me.  So, while it might be useful to provide a modicum of protection to younger people who are less susceptible to COVID's more serious manifestations by giving them just one injection now, it really doesn't make much difference to us seniors (who are far more likely to suffer serious consequences from the coronavirus) if we're offered one inoculation now but have to wait months for a second before we're fully protected.  I'm not resuming normal activities until I'm fully protected."
2021-01-09 21:37,"In a week where we’ve seen many stupid things, here’s another contender. Vaccines sit in freezers while thousands of Americans die every day while the people in charge argue about who should get vaccinated. Our government, up and down the ladder, must focus on one thing: saving American lives. That includes figuring out how to vaccinate as many people as fast as they can, and get more vaccine made. If some unapproved people manage to slink their way into line, so be it. I’d much rather be alive to complain about them than dead while the vaccine sits in freezers"
2021-01-09 21:27,"Dying seniors are collapsing our hospital system, leading to the shut down of our economy.   This is because 75 year old has 450 times the chance of dying of covid-19  compared to a 25 year old.  

The following countries are a small sample of those who vaccinate in order of descending age: 

 UK, JAPAN, INDIA, SWITZERLAND, GERMANY, SPAIN, ITALY, FRANCE, DENMARK, NORWAY, BELGIUM, SWEDEN, MEXICO.

The following are the ones that prioritizing younger workers: 

UNITED STATES,  RUSSIA

There is a reason that the vast majority of countries prioritize seniors.  

Only 16% of our nation is over 65.  Yet the number of people that the CDC has designated as ""essential workers/medical workers"" is 108 million.  Since there are only about 130 million full time workers in the U.S., the CDC as designated almost all workers as ""essential workers"".  

In addition, the United States' expansive list of ""medical"" workers,  includes non-front line workers who have no more chance of contracting covid-19 than average, from hospital administrators and clerks and podiatrists' office staff and speech  therapists.

The CDC committee acknowledged that their system would result in more deaths, but said that it created more ""social equity"".   Nonsense.  The vast majority of the Blacks and Hispanics who are dying are seniors, and they are dying in disproportionate numbers.  Our current system is resulting in needless deaths of POC.

It's time to vaccinate seniors first."

2021-01-09 22:32,"In Illinois, we have called for overlap of phase 1A with phase 1B to help address both vaccine hesitancy and save lives. Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers is high leading to a slower deployment of vaccine in 1A. While roots of hesitancy are multifaceted and certainly do involve a legacy of mistrust in our Black communities, some are just nervous about going first and want others to get. Seeing seniors in the community who want the shot to get the shot will be helpful for all and save lives.  Because hospitals and healthcare facilities are stuck in 1A, vaccine is on the shelf or being used for non patient facing employees when it could go to those who need it in the community. We have asked the Governor and Mayor to act as soon as they can. Our statement is up at @impact4hc"

2021-01-09 22:37,"It’s dismaying that Ms. Goodnough neglects to mention that some states are altering the criteria for vaccine eligibility to create racial preferences, and hence acting counter to the race-blind CDC guidelines. For example, in Illinois, the 1B group has been widened dramatically to include much younger individuals — down to 65 years old — explicitly in an attempt to create a priority for people in the black community. This will have the effect of substantially delaying the vaccine for those 75 and older (of all races) who need it most. See for yourself at the Illinois Dept. of Public Health website: <a href=""http://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/vaccine-distribution"" target=""_blank"">http://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/vaccine-distribution</a>"

The implications of slowing down the vaccination process means among other things that 1) more people will die, 2) overworked front line medical personnel will remain at or beyond their breaking points for longer periods of time, 3) overwhelmed hospitals will be unable to perform procedures for other people that need them, 4) schools will remain closed for longer than necessary, imperiling the learning progress of vulnerable populations, 5) the virus will spread to more people, thus giving it a greater opportunity to mutate into more dangerous forms, and 6) the economy will remain sluggish thus keeping more people out of work and in dire financial straits. All this in the name of fairness and equity? By all means prioritize groups but don't adhere to it so slavishly that you slow down vaccine distribution. I hope that anyone who believes that fairness/equity trumps efficient vaccine distribution gives up their position in the vaccine line and goes to the end of the line. I also hope that members of the federal committee that voted to prioritize fairness/equity will wait to the end to take the vaccine, but I suspect the opposite--they used their influence/position to get the vaccine as quickly as possible. In other words, it's fine that other people don't get the vaccine quickly as long as they get it expeditiously."

2021-01-09 23:21,"While I do understand the need to vaccinate healthcare workers and nursing home residents as soon as possible, I simply cannot understand why those with serious medical conditions or those over 65 but younger than 75 are going to be relegated to the last priority group, after so many others who are much more likely to survive the virus without complications are eligible to receive a vaccine. A 20 year old teacher who is working remotely or even hybrid vs. a 50 year old cancer patient? Or do we assume cancer patients don't have to work, or raise children or shop and that they can simply sequester forever? Why aren't we trying to protect the lives of the vulnerable?"
2021-01-09 23:21,"Every state/healthcare system currently has the ability to administer a certain number of vaccine shots per day. If a certain system is consistently failing to reach their capacity because of a lack of eligible volunteers who want to take the vaccine, then the eligibility criteria obviously needs to be expanded. On the other hand, if a system is consistently administering shots at their maximum capacity to those already eligible, then they should wait to expand eligibility criteria. 

All systems need to focus on expanding their ability to give shots to more people per day. This will be needed when vaccine production ramps up.

Vaccines do not do anyone any good if they are sitting in a freezer, waiting to get expired. Better for two people to jump the queue than for one dose to get wasted. This is a critical resource. It is criminal to waste it."

2021-01-09 23:29,"If doctors and our for-profit healthcare system are so smart, why are we in this mess? Some years ago, I earned a Project Management Professional certificate. I am shocked by the lack of planning around vaccine distribution.  At the start of the pandemic, why were governors (we know the Feds were incompetent) not planning for the vaccine distribution that would allow them to safely ""reopen the economy"" (read sales tax receipts that keep state governments running). If that was/is so important, where was the plan to make the virus go away through vaccination? Those plans could have started with ""assuming we have a vaccine"" (they could also substitute ice cream bars for vaccine, the logistics are not that much different) until such vaccines became available. I assume the answer is ""We didn't/don't have the resources for planning"". State of Colorado, for example, employs almost 100 cattle brand inspectors (I'm sure all state governments have some comparable function that could be put off until the pandemic passes). Why were state budgets/bureaucracies not altered to substitute Vaccine Planners for cattle brand inspectors? The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment website reveals a one slide vaccination schedule by the seasons. I might be eligible for a vaccine in ""Spring"", but it does not say what year."
2021-01-09 23:32,"It’s insane that the states waited until now to open up vaccinations to larger categories of people, even when over 10 million doses are just sitting around or have spoiled in this country. 

It’s like boarding an airplane, except that the gate agents in this scenario were told by the airline management to keep passengers waiting at the gate while they go about the airport to run down first class passengers to get them to board first. Instead of keeping other passengers waiting and watching in frustration, any normal airline would have called the business class passengers to start boarding already. First class passengers will still have their priority boarding lane when they do show up, but the gate agents should not hold up the process just waiting for them and should, instead, keep the boarding process going as smoothly and as continuously as possible. 

For the airlines, fast and efficient boarding means the flights can depart faster and more passengers can be served. In a mass vaccinations campaign during a raging pandemic, a fast and efficient rollout means the curve can be flattened much faster, hospital accesses can be preserved, and more lives can be saved."

Well, in Oregon, Governor Brown's skewed priorities will put many seniors at risk of dying in order to serve the educational system first.  She has decided that educators and associates should receive the vaccine before older people. Of course, education is extremely important but the lives of seniors should not be sacrificed to open schools.  The remarks by  Dan Patrick created a furor and such a political backlash that he changed his tune.  Let us hope that Governor Brown will realize that her position is not humane."

2021-01-10 1:30,"I have spoken to the Public Health Department, numerous pharmacists, and physicians.  California is mired in a heavily bureaucratic system of covid vaccination that prevents older people from getting the vaccine they need. There are no 24 hour vaccination clinics in Southern California. Very hard to find on weekends. California has only used 25 percent of the doses distributed, according to Bloomberg.  Willie Brown just wrote a column in the San Francisco Chronicle begging Governor Gavin Newsome to follow current CDC recommendations to vaccinate more than one tier simultaneously.  California’s vaccination program is almost the worst in the country, while the rate of death and COVID infection is completely out of control. Governor Newsome has been stuck in category 1a, while other states such as North Dakota, Iowa, and Florida are getting covid vaccines into people’s arms far more rapidly. Former Mayor Brown has correctly called California the most dangerous state in which to get infected with covid."

After vainly calling numerous pharmacies and clinics trying to be put on a waitlist, I learned at least half the vaccines were discarded due to refrigeration issues.

So far they destroyed lives, livelihoods, and education but absolutely did not flatten any infection curve. Why is anyone surprised that with leaders like these anything should go well?

2021-01-10 0:22,"There is only one reason why daily death counts and hospitalizations since January 1 have been rising instead of steadily falling......because of the unethical, immoral orders by medical workers of CDC to give vaccine priority to all the many millions of medical workers instead of only to medical workers over age 60.  And, the CDC ordered that all medical workers be prioritized even though the vast majority never get near a Covid patient

The ethical, moral priority should have been only front-line medical workers over age 60 prioritized, and then the older general public, oldest first  

90% of Covid deaths are people over age 60 (97% of deaths are people over age 50)

70% of Covid hospitalizations are people over age 60

People under age 50 usually suffer only mild illness, many have no symptoms at all

If vaccination of the oldest Americans had begun back in mid-December, then by January 1, daily deaths and hospitalizations would have begun to fall.  By the end of February, every American over age 60 could have been vaccinated resulting in Covid deaths falling by 90%

Instead, the unethical, immoral CDC has ordered vaccine be denied to Americans as old as 74 in order to vaccinate young teachers, young cops, and who knows what other occupations CDC will come up with

Now, the CDC and medical workers nationwide have quit providing medical care based upon medical need.  Now the CDC and medical workers nationwide provide medical care based upon social standing (occupation)"

Vitamin D:

• Stimulates ""the innate immune response, which provides frontline protection against infectious agents.""

• Increases expression of antimicrobial peptides in your monocytes and neutrophils — both of which play important roles in COVID-19.

• Enhances expression of an antimicrobial peptide called human cathelicidin, ""which is of specific importance in host defenses against respiratory tract pathogens."" 

• COVID-19 is far more common in vitamin D deficient individuals — In one study, 82.2% of COVID-19 patients tested were deficient in vitamin D, compared to 47.2% of population-based controls.

• They also found that blood levels of vitamin D inversely correlated to D-dimer levels (a measure of blood coagulation). Many COVID-19 patients have elevated D-dimer levels, which are associated with blood clots. 

• Vitamin D status influences C19 severity — C19 patients who have higher vitamin D levels tend to have milder illness and better outcomes. One study found the risk of severe C19 and related deaths virtually disappeared when vitamin D levels were above 30 ng/mL. 

• In another study, C19 patients with a vitamin D level between 21 ng/mL and 29 ng/mL had a 12.5 times higher risk of death than those with a level above 30 ng/mL.

I'm in my late 60s with 2 co-morbidities which could lead to my death if I get COVID.

The vaccine response in Virginia is abysmal.

Virginia is going to be stuck in phase 1A for weeks to come. 

The state of Virginia is ""being cautious"" said the person in charge of the COVID vaccine.  The state is only releasing 100,000 doses per week as they try to figure how well their vaccination program is working.  This means if they're using all the vaccine released x 2 doses, they're vaccinating 200,000 Virginians per month.

This in a state where the population is over 8.5 million people.  I despair about getting vaccinated for COVID.  

At the present rate, Virginia's program as of now will be stuck in Phase 1A for months to come.  My 91 year old mother in assisted living still has not be vaccinated.  She doesn't know why her facility is taking so long.

5 minutes away in Washington D.C. -  D.C. has opened a website so those over 65 can sign up - and many people I know have signed up.  Starting tomorrow, anyone 65 and over who has signed up to receive the vaccine is eligible to get vaccinated Monday.

There is no information on the Virginia State Health Dept. website other than ""Vaccine is available for 1A.""  Nothing else.

At this rate, Virginia is maybe a month away from the kind of disaster we've seen in Florida and, eventually, California.

Where is the accountability, Governor Northam?"
2021-01-10 2:55,The vaccine rollout in this country has turned into a Wild West show. It wouldn’t surprise me if soon we see people fighting in the streets. There is no strategy governing these vaccines and every state is doing it differently. Florida is not only allowing people from other states and countries to come to the state and get the vaccine ahead of residents. The plan in Florida says people 65 and older. Yet when you see some of the people getting shots there is no way they are over 65. And what about healthcare workers? Severely immune comprised patients? It’s a disaster. Trump has been a disaster in this area of governing also.

State governments need to make the vaccine (pretend) limited and many folks will want it.  Create a schedule programming system, similar to the kinds my doctor uses.

In addition, has anyone noticed that NYS provides detail metrics on COVID cases and deaths by age, gender, race, economic status, and location but very little (if any) on employment status?

A simple, verifiable, aged-based prioritization would not be perfect, but clearly remove one of the bottlenecks in the process.

Really, a plastic surgeon (for wealthy clients) receive vaccination before 70 year-old cancer patients.

   This is a sad situation and unforgivable. 70 percent of distributed vaccines are still sitting on the pharmacy shelves.
   Perfection should not be the enemy of the good. The focus at this point should be to vaccinate more people rather than who is getting the shots even though the initial focus was on vaccinating health care workers and nursing home residents.
   Senior citizens should be vaccinated along with health care workers as quickly as possible to give relief to hospital workers who are overwhelmed with these vulnerable senior citizens who end up in hospitals more than any other group. Does it not make sense?
   Also, give the first dose to as many people as possible. By delaying the second dose more people can have at least one shot sooner. More lives will be saved. This is being done in the UK."

But it may not mean anyone actually getting vaccinated sooner.

Utah stopped publishing most of the vaccination data that had been on its coronavirus website until a few days ago, including shipment quantities received and doses administered for each of our 20 health departments. There’s merely a statewide summary figure for doses now. no explanation for the change, and nothing in the Salt Lake Tribune, a media outfit I’d expect to perk up immediately.

The only thing clear to me is that like testing, masks and limitations on business activity, the vaccines have been politicized. This chaotic situation will ultimately improve, but don’t expect anything too soon."

In 2020 the pace of vaccinating for covid is moving at a snail's pace. The reasons, as the article points out are manifold. But people are dying.. There has been inadequate leadership in Washington and President-elect Biden has wisely made the pandemic one of his three priorities. If we get bogged down in an impeachment, without conviction, it will cost hundreds of thousands of lives. If there are not 17 Republican votes to convict I think it best to hand it over to a US Attorney rather than paralyze Congress and the White House. They can then decide who gets it, end waste and provide more leadership since states seem not up to the job. People are dying."

The reality is that at some point facts have to be turned into governmental policies.  There are multiple  and different external factors leading to different possibile outcomes.  At the moment, we have hospitals overrun with COVID-19 patients.  If the vaccines can reduce the severity of symptoms, then use them to reduce the hospital load rather than to guarantee long-term immunity against SARS CoV-2.  The facts remain the same.  The purpose of the vaccines changes.  The administration of the vaccines changes.  The outcome should be more lives saved."

Virginia and my county have mostly adopted the CDC priorities and added to the groups.  Now they're opening up for appointments for group 1B.There are over a million people in this group in Virginia.  Suddenly today the one hospital in Arlington started taking appointments.  Surprise!  In 2 hours, the system crashed.  I know everyone's been under exceptional stress for a year, but someone has to be able to say ""if we do it like this, it's a disaster.""   You have to subdivide the groups in some manner so it's manageable."

People of color in the 65-74 age group need the vaccines before their younger family members. Washington State's plan is sensible in that its 1B group is age 70 and up, and multigen household members age 50 and up. 1C is critical frontline workers age 50 and up. Then another group of seniors, more essential workers, etc. Much more nuanced and scientific plan."

I am 70 years old undergoing chemotherapy which will prevent me from being vaccinated for months. Yet, my 70 year old husband will have to wait until late February, March or April to be vaccinated putting me at risk. Further, my daughter and her husband, who now live with us, will not be able to vaccinated until late spring. This is absurd. There is no excuse for this mess. I hope that on January 20 when competence is finally installed in the White House this disaster will be ended and we will finally see a nationwide vaccine program moving."
2021-01-10 5:27,"The deliberative efforts by our public officials here in California to create politically correct (equitable) based vaccine distribution are ignoring the fact that most of the people ending up in hospital ICU and critical care wards are over 70 and this is placing a tremendous burden on our hospitals and its healthcare workers.  Shouldn't the near term objectives be to reduce morbidity and mortality as well as mitigate virus spread?   I would recommend that frontline healthcare personnel and those over 70 with significant pre-existing conditions, be vaccinated first to help ensure that our hospitals and associated healthcare facilities can cope with the deluge of people seeking medical care."
2021-01-10 8:14,"Well, Biden said he’d follow the science, but here he is suggesting guidelines that insure second shots in a timely manner be ignored. Gambling upon unproven hope that one partially effective shot for many will be better than guaranteed 95 percent immunity for half as many."

I feel that at least in California the governor and his clan enjoys the power of controlling all aspects of our lives. Now the vaccine has arrived and the party is over but they just can't seem to let go, therefore, this roll out is facing a bureaucratic delay. I even heard talk that once everyone is vaccinated we still have to wear masks. Really, so there is no end to this thing?"
2021-01-10 8:58,"The unelected group of sadists on the CDC advisory committee made very flawed recommendations which will maximize death and hospitalizations of the elderly under age 75 if they are followed by the states. It was a hard decision, but we need to prioritize young  teachers engaged in remote learning, nannies for the rich, persons caring for children occasionally and youngsters marginally attached to food service because it is almost impossible to limit the priority to actual full time permanent workers who have significant risk on their jobs. It is social justice to allow elderly and minorities under age 75 to die and be hospitalized in droves. The deaths and hospitalizations are social justice whether new vaccines are authorized next month or our vulnerable persons over 65 have an 10 month wait for a first dose of the vaccine. Yes, let’s vaccinate prisoners in their 20s and anyone in a group setting before those over 65. The age 65-74 group should get the same priority as 2/3s of the population. The science that the elderly will die and become disabled at many times the rate of the young is not important. What is important is the unelected sadists’ views of social justice. Because these people have medical or health degrees they are uniquely qualified to make the recommendation that the elderly must die on behalf of the American people. How did our government inflict this failed process and failed recommendations on the American people?"
2021-01-10 10:46,"The DeSantis model of vaccinating the elderly has more to do with his political ambitions than any appropriate distribution of vaccinations and serves the elderly's ambitions to stay alive forever. In both cases the morality is questionable.

That any health are workers refuse the vaccinations without personal good cause is confounding. These people supposedly understand science, or do they?

Not a single dose of vaccine should be wasted, so if no one else eligible is around to take a shot, go out into the street and muster anyone available and willing."

These are people who are active, many still working by choice or by necessity (or were working before the pandemic). Other than Tulsi Gabbard, who left the Congress, I haven't heard any politician talk about this group. The one person I know who died directly from COVID was a working artist, aged 73, who also did arts outreach in the schools. He died just a month ago. In New York City, many live in high density, near communal spaces. The fact that there is a vaccine gives some a feeling that it's all over. Yet for people in this age range it is an illusion. As the virus surges to what, over 9%? and a new variant almost surely has reached the City, this group waits in limbo to get sick."

On the one hand, I am considered ""high risk,"" though I have no comorbidities. On the other hand, I am quite able to avoid public places than many lower income essential workers. The only place I currently go other than for outside walks is the grocery story where virtually everyone wears a mask appropriately. 

So many folks, including the grocery workers, bus drivers etc., etc., are putting themselves at risk daily. Should I, who am relatively safe despite my age, go ahead of them because of my age? 

My one concern is that if I don't go when my group is called I might have a hard time getting the shot down the line."

2021-01-10 14:05,"Azar is right; we need to get the vaccine into as many people, as quickly as possible. So far it appears limiting who can get it has only slowed things down. To my view, it would be far better to simply vaccinate anyone and everyone than to have two-thirds of our available vaccines sitting around in freezers. The *only* way we beat this thing is if enough people get the shot; that's just not happening under the current rules."
2021-01-10 14:13,"We need to get this vaccine to the age 55 plus group who are still out there working, and all people working with an underlying health risk, including those with obesity and family members at high risk.

But if reports are true, a surprisingly high per cent of front line workers are refusing vaccinations.  This is disheartening, to say the least.  Absent a medical justification, I think it is irresponsible to have the people caring for us doubling down on the risk of exposing us still further, and they are slowing down the line.  In my wildest dreams I did not expect to side with Azar, but I say if you have vaccine available and willing people, let's get a move on.  The focus on prioritizing risk has clearly come at the expense of speed - and both are critical"
2021-01-10 14:31,"In this state, only 25% of the vaccine that has been delivered has been put into arms.  Sec. Mandy Cohen states that the state has delivered quantities of vaccine to CVS and Walgreens for their program to vaccinate the elderly and staff in nursing homes and long term care facilities...but she does not have access to that data because the Feds are preventing it from being sent back to the state.  

This is ridiculous.  I know it's because the funding is not coming from the Feds.  If the state has received 22 million doses, then those 22 million doses should be divided up and sent to every county immediately.  It should not be sitting in a freezer in Raleigh.  I want the vaccine, am in the at-risk age group, and am more than willing to go get it right away - whether that is to my PCP's office, board of health parking lot, county fairground or neighborhood drugstore.  

Surely the National Guard and the governors of each state can figure out a method of immunizing people in their cars?  Use the Red Cross, nursing schools, vets and dentists, and even private ambulance services.  I remember getting vaccines at school in the 1960's, and it shouldn't be this hard."
2021-01-10 14:37,"Here in PA, according to the PA Dept of Health,  they are vaccinating about 180k people/day - on a good day, many days far less. At this rate it will take over 3 years to vaccinate everybody."
2021-01-10 14:46,"yes the priority is overly complex.  Yes on a given day you have x numbers of doses. You should administer some percentage of them. If priority people are there and available they get first access. In lieu of that you just go down the list. If I'm 55 health, at the end of the line, and no one else is behind me,  and theres an open vial, that has to be used. give me a shot.  Waste not. This has slowed down vaccinations. I mean is it that hard to find nursing homes? its the 65 plus with conditions group that doesn't seem to be getting the message.  But the more we get vaccinated the lower the transmission, the greater chance we have to get to people before the get ill."
2021-01-10 14:50,"Short cutting the CDC guidelines is flat out bad decision making.    In some states there is now a free-for-all for vaccination that does not protect the most at risk and the most vulnerable.    There is a marked difference in health and in COVID mortality between a typical 65-70 year old and a typical 75-80 year old.    The photos show vigorous 65-year olds in line for a vaccine.    Where are the wheel chair bound?   Where are the frontline and essential workers?   No doubt the latter are helping make life even more pleasant for the now-vaccinated 65 year olds, with not enough time to join the free-for-all themselves.  When the Capitol was breached, is this some of what commentators were thinking of with the epithet banana republic?"
2021-01-10 14:57,"As the article and several comments have pointed out, this is a multi-faceted issue that needs to be addressed at the root-cause level.
Funding and staffing resources are clearly needed, along with the ability to make determinations on the spot for using doses left over in vials so they aren’t wasted.
The other part I can’t understand- is how the private and public health care institutions are allowing their employees to take a wait and see approach? If we can’t even convince the health care workers that the vaccine is safe, will protect them and the people who’s care we entrust to them, then we are nowhere. And I can’t imagine it’s ok with these entities to let health care workers who may be at high risk of exposure to run around inside these institutions without having taken the now available protective cautions? Should they also be allowed to do their jobs without masks and other PPE? What a terrible message, it’s the same as having excess masks that they refuse to wear on the job - NOT ok."
2021-01-10 14:59,"The issue is our nation's institutions being obsessed with a focus on a negative approach (""who doesn't get it yet"") and not a positive approach (""how did we reach everyone eligible""). The result is withholding vaccines from a large percentage of those eligible to ensure not a single person gets it out of order instead of getting all available doses into arms, even if a few people get it sightly early. Our medical system has become so used to being a gatekeeper of treatment instead of a willing provider, and this shows the result."
2021-01-10 15:00,"Here’s an idea.

Expand drive through testing centers to 24/7 and include the inoculations. 

Have multiple lines: one for at risk groups and healthcare workers, this line is highest priority, another line for the next group and so on. Each day ALL of the available vaccines must be put in arms.

Enact the war powers act and require all vaccine stay in America until everyone is vaccinated; if possible, expand production and solve supply chain issues including expanding the production of glass vials.

This is a war and needs to be treated as such."
2021-01-10 15:01,"The first act of the Biden administration should be to discredit the CDC priority recommendations for the vaccine. The highly vulnerable age 65 - 74 age group will not be vaccinated until the summer in states that follow the CDC guidelines, giving ages 65-74 the same priority as two thirds of the population.  Delivery of vaccines will not be sufficient to vaccinate phase 1c, where the elderly under age 75 are prioritized, before the summer, unless new vaccines are approved by the FDA.  The news summaries posted by HHS stated that the US ordered enough vaccine to vaccinate 100 million of the 330 million people over age 16 for delivery in the first quarter of 2021.  The vaccines to vaccinate the next 100 million people are not required to be delivered until June 30 and July 30.  Because Phase 1c includes a third of the population age 16-64 with some type of medical condition that makes them susceptible to worse COVID outcomes and a large group of remote workers in areas like finance and law, once distribution opens up for phase 1c, the elderly will have to battle a large group of younger people at much lower risk for severe outcome to sign up.  States that follow the CDC recommendations can and will cause many unnecessary deaths and hospitalizations.  The CDC's putting a third of the population age 16-65 in the high risk category of phase 1c ignores the much higher risks of those 65-74.  A lot of elderly people will die unnecessarily in states following the CDC guidelines."
2021-01-10 15:07,"I'm almost 80 with comorbidities. The distribution of these vaccines seems very random.  I was told that I probably won't get the vaccine until April.  I have friends my age in other states who have gotten theirs.  Our state was not given what it requested so it seems that the distribution is willy nilly.  I know someone in town who is healthy and in her 30s, a day care provider who got hers already.  Some of our health workers took theirs; some didn't.  Some of our nursing homes have gotten their first shot.  I  suppose I'll just have to wait for Astra Zenica and Johnson and Johnson to approve their vaccines."
2021-01-10 15:09,"To date, I have not heard of any supplies of the vaccines that had to be discarded due to being outdated. I hope I never will. The vaccines seem to be getting to the states OK but the bottlenecks are occurring at the state and local level. The underlying issue is simply that there is not enough vaccine to go around. But if people who are entitled to receive the vaccine now do not take it, then make it available to anyone wanting it on a first come - first served basis with advanced reservations required to control long lines. It would be criminal to see expired vaccine discarded."
2021-01-10 15:27,"Priority 1: Vaccines in arms
Priority 2: Vaccines in arms in the best order

Health policy and ethics people focused way too much on priority 2, not on priority 1. Most states have vaccine going unused. It is obvious but painful to discuss that it is easier and more efficient to vaccinate healthy, mobile people than more at-risk groups. If you’re struggling with priority 1, you need to open it up. The other big issue is many of these groups are poorly defined. A hospital has IDs. How does a primary care practice of 10 people identify at a vaccination site. How does a grocery store worker identify as such. For age, you can use drivers licenses, birth certificates.  One great idea RI has currently implemented is open vaccination clinics in the worst hit zip codes which favors minority and low-wage workers and goes for the biggest reduction in spread. They can identify by drivers license or government mail."
2021-01-10 15:38,"Personally, I feel that the authorities should just open it up to all comers.   One shot in the arm now and a booster (and getting a lot of protection) much later is better than large swathes  of the population remaining at risk due to rigid protocols."
2021-01-10 15:38,"As the article mentioned, this week Governor Hogan of Maryland announced changes to the phases / priority groups to be eligible for the vaccine. I was rather surprised at some of the groups that have priority over others.

The state has so far vaccinated 1.27 % of the population, and Hogan seems to acknowledge that it could have been higher by now."
2021-01-10 15:43,"Florida has allowed vaccines for those 65 and up, but the rollout has not been smooth: long lines of cars, even though appointments were timed. I received the first dose, but the return has no particular time, just a date. Some have waited as long as 5 hours in their cars (the process took me 3 hours from beginning to end). I'm grateful to have started the process, but it wasn't well organized, and, as one reads here, appointments were snatched up and the site for registration quickly closed."
2021-01-10 15:44,"We’re over 75 with several risk factors. Theoretically, we qualify, especially since in Texas, our Governor has decreed that seniors over 65 qualify, and the state health department’s website  has provided us with a map. That’s it- a map. We’re on our own to figure out where and how to get vaccinated. There are only 3 providers for our entire mostly rural county, and currently they are only vaccinating healthcare workers and nursing home residents. Camping out in our car overnight in hopes of winning this chaotic vaccine lobby isn’t a plan. January 20th can’t come soon enough."
2021-01-10 15:47,"Distribution problems vary by state. Here in Texas, awful communication is the main problem. It's not that people don't want the vaccine; it's that they can't take it because the government isn't telling us where it is and doesn't allow appointments until it's too late. We can't even join a waitlist! How hard is it for people to get into an electronic line? In other states, wasted vaccine is a problem.  Once again, a waitlist would be helpful. Forget 1A/1B priority, get the vaccine in whomever's arm. In other states, people aren't willing to get it. Here, better vaccine education is helpful. We need to address the root cause of poor distribution depending on the specific state."
2021-01-10 15:47,In this case the CDC guidelines need to be junked in favor of the common sense. Here in NYC until about 2 days ago about 66% (!!!) of the available vaccine sat unused because the criteria and the bureaucratic procedures were too strict. Now they are finally opening up the vaccination to more people including those over 75 and adding a whole lot more locations where vaccination will be available. I think they should start adding people with specific medical conditions to the list of those eligible for vaccination a whole lot faster too.
2021-01-10 15:48,"Up until yesterday I had been fairly lucky. Although some of my friends and my cousin who was convalescing in a nursing home have had Covid-19, none have succumbed to the virus. What long-range health issues they will have remains to be seen. But  I learned that my cousin's sister-in-law who has been a life-long resident in a care facility died yesterday morning from Covid-19.

My wife and I have been living like monks in isolation for fear of getting sick with this dreaded disease, something that at our age, and especially with my wife's asthma, neither of us can afford to catch.

But I am willing for us to go on as we have for as long as necessary waiting in line for our vaccinations because I know that with proper precautions I have a decent chance of evading the virus. It's these poor people in care facilities who are sitting ducks and our most vulnerable citizens next to our health-care workers. They must be at the front of the line for inoculation!

I also think that Joe Biden's plan to not hold in reserve enough vaccines for the necessary second booster injections needs to be rethought. He is gambling that the supply and ability to distribute it will be there in time for that necessary second dose. But based on what I have seen, this could result in completely wasting all of the vaccines. For if that second booster is not within the correct time frame, nobody really knows how long the immunity from the first inoculation, which is diminished to begin with, will last."
2021-01-10 15:49,"The rollout of the vaccines seems to have run up against bureaucracy best described as Dickensian. 

In our state, with progressive leaders even, vaccines have been dispensed throughout large hospital organizations  and to some nursing homes.

But my 89 year old father in law, can’t get a vaccine yet, and he’s in living in a 2 bedroom apartment with his wife who just tested positive last week.

And the healthcare laundry which I work for, which processes the majority of hospital laundry in our state, hasn’t received a response yet on our request to get our workforce vaccinated. 

Poor planning x 50. You can’t just rely on healthcare bureaucracies to get a vaccine out in an efficient manner. No thanks to our shamble of a federal government."
2021-01-10 15:50,"Here in South Carolina the governor, Henry McMaster,  said the state is abandoning the CDC guidelines and will give health care workers until Jan. 15 to get vaccinated. Otherwise, they'll go to the back of the line. What's needed here is that sort of sense of urgency rather than bureaucratic formulas for distribution that seem to move at a snail's pace compared to the accelerating spread of this virus."
2021-01-10 15:55,"They are so concerned with doing it in the right order that they are endangering more lives than they're saving. Vaccinated communities prevent community spread, even to those you haven't reached. Shots in arms should be the priority, but more vulnerable individuals should get moved to the front of the line if and when they show up."
2021-01-10 16:06,"Keep working to get the vaccine to old folks homes.  

But as for the rest of us: just identify as many venues as can be staffed and tell people to start lining up."
2021-01-10 16:22,"At this point, the virus is becoming so widespread that vaccinating whoever is not vaccinated will help.   Ask those who are able to isolate, retired people and work-at-homers, to wait a while longer.

Los Angeles has a much-photographed location at Dodger Stadium doing testing.  We need the same all over the country doing vaccinations."
2021-01-10 16:40,"Vaccines were developed at warp speed but the planning at the state, local and community level to administer the vaccine is disorganized and falling behind schedule. All of the planning to pay for and administer the vaccines is a huge task and should have been done months ago.  While our private-public health system delivers state of the art care for the most part it is a system that is functionally disorganized when compared to Israel or the United Kingdom.  The failure at organizing the effort starts at the federal level.  Our President, Vice President, Dr Fauci, and Dr Bryx had plenty of photo ops but the hard work at the junior level just wasn’t done.  We will get there but the extra number of lives lost do to our failure to organize is terribly sad and disgraceful."
2021-01-10 16:47,"My husband who is 80 with some pre-existing conditions (Group 1b) was notified Jan. 4th and given his 1st dose of the vaccine January 6th in Albuquerque after he pre-registered on-line Dec. 26th.  NM said that it is notifying those in group 1b who had pre-registered because there were doses unused by the group in 1a.  I agree with that, but to be honest most citizens in NM do not know how to register for the vaccine with their medical and job information.  NM failed to do a broad advance communication campaign that would reach many more of our citizens on how to pre-register once the vaccine arrived.  We found out when a friend sent us an email with the pre-registration link.  Dept. of Health finally provided a telephone number and call-center last week for those who did not have internet access (perhaps 1/3 or more of NM citizens).  My husband was happy that the vaccine he got was efficiently administered to him; we were scheduled for 2PM and he got the vaccine at 2:02PM in a drive-through manner because of his mobility issues. I was told that they were doing 300 vaccinations an hour at that one location (NM Expo).  Our 70-ish friends, one with a compromised immune system, in California told us this week that they had no idea how to get the vaccine.  So communication is the main problem with the distribution."
2021-01-10 16:50,"We need nothing complicated. Open it up. Train fire, police, retired, etc. then use public schools, most neighborhoods have them and mass inoculation for all. Like yesterday.

Confusing, nonsensical otherwise. Fewer mistakes by not trying to follow complicated requirements"
2021-01-10 17:02,"We should ask our best in class logistics companies to volunteer staff from their teams to form tiger teams at the county level. Walmart, Amazon, Toyota design their logistics and manufacturing processes for speed, quality and cost every day.

But people lack discipline. When I do my shopping at Sam’s Club during senior hours, the store is empty. Everyone seems to shop at peak hours."
2021-01-10 17:33,"Vaccines should go to the old vulnerable first. The data clearly shows that the severity of the disease goes multiples high as decades are added to age.

Also, the Johnson and Johnson and Novavax vaccine trial results will be coming up by the end of Jan or early Feb. There will be vaccines for all sometime by mid March if the trials are successful.

I posted in NYTimes articles that it also doesn't make sense to hold back half the doses for the second dose now. The need of the hour is to vaccinate more folks by age and comorbidities now. The second dose will come from the increased rolling manufacturing output in next 21 days for Pfizer and 28days for Moderna.

Please vaccinate the vulnerable old first. 

And let's patiently wait for the trail results of Johnson and Johnson and Novavax."
2021-01-10 17:43,"If, as the article states 'more health care workers than expected' are refusing to get the vaccine, does it really make sense not to provide it to other vulnerable segments of the population?

We need to follow the order that actually keeps our society going. I cannot for the life of me imagine why anyone would possibly think elderly should go before healthcare workers?? There goes the foolish notion that we don’t care about the elderly, we’ve literally stopped the world for them and now may even be willing to risk healthcare workers lives so they can get vaccinated and stay alive, because somehow they’re being deemed more important than the workers that have risked all to keep them alive??"
2021-01-10 15:41,Trying to slice the priority list too finely just leads to inefficiency. Time to worry a bit less about exact priority and start getting it to as many people as possible. Getting the whole population immunized helps everyone. Working through politically correct priority lists leads to waste. Just get ‘er done.
2021-01-10 16:25,"If vaccine had been administered since the beginning only according to age, oldest first, then by Jan 1 daily Covid deaths and hospitalizations would have begun to rapidly decline.

Instead, unethical medical workers at CDC dictated vaccine priority to many millions of medical workers of all ages, even though the vast majority never get within 100 yards of a Covid patient.  And so, Covid deaths are now around 4000/day and many hospitals are full.....all so privileged medical workers in their 20s, 30s, and 40s get vaccinated even though they would only suffer mild illness if they got infected.

And CDC has already dictated that many more millions of young teachers and young cops must be vaccinated while vaccine is denied to general public as old as 74.

90% of Covid deaths are people over age 60
70% of Covid hospitalizations are people over age 60

The medical workers at CDC are unethical and immoral.  The medical workers under age 60 who accept priority vaccination are unethical and immoral.  The medical workers of all ages who administer vaccine to persons under age 60 are unethical and immoral.

This is a war, but not just a war against this virus.  It has been made also a war against the medical community that has turned its back on ethics, turned its back on morality, and turned its back on the public they claim to serve."
2021-01-10 9:41,Nice to hear states are going to allow the elderly to receive the as yet nonexistent doses of vaccine.
2021-01-10 17:22,"Let's tart vaccinating an one who likes one? at least one place in every state while we vaccinate others as per CDC guidelines.
Allow small business worked, retail  workers, teachers, police, fire fighters, anyone who has a job in public service with direct exposure to multiple humans every day to take one. This will help bring economy back quickly and we don't have to close cities, states or our country."
2021-01-10 12:03,Florida has been excellent at making appointments (resident only need appy) for receiving the vaccine. However the site that I was on insisted I provide my health insurance to pay for it. No copay nor the site and personnel compensation is neccessay. But I suspect many people down here have lost their insurance from their jobs or independant contractors lost buisness during the pandemic can no longer afford health insurance. Florida has been very successful in get their citizens vacinated and are looking to roll out far more sites such as the Supermarket Publics that has a huge presence everywhere.
2021-01-10 16:29,"Stop handwringing.  It's a numbers game.  The more innoculated people, the less it spreads. This virus is spreading silently through the general population.  You know, that general population that has to get up every morning and go to work and mingle with customers, clients, co-workers, and other members of the general public.  Society as a whole is much better off getting the vaccine into the arm of anybody that is willing to camp in a line to get it."

2021-01-10 14:45,"I hope that more vaccine is being made and that production will be ramped up once Biden takes the helm, and Republican chaos and horror is finally swept from office. I want policy from the top to the states on the vaccine roll out, not the wild west. Let Fauci tell us, and follow orders. If it's nursing homes and medical people first, fine. Set a timeline. Three weeks after getting the vaccines to do the next group. If you refuse, we move on. I would love to go back to school in a sane way. Teachers could potentially get the vaccines in March and we could fully go back to school by the end of the year if we could organize the production, method, and roll out.

America is no different than any other third world country when it comes to equality between those that matter and those that do not.

In republican controlled states you are asking people that have gone to court to get rid of the ACA because they did not want particular ""groups' in their states to have health care. 

Most of these same states have seen the data as to which ""groups"" were being hit the hardest by the virus and like the white house they ignored the numbers and did nothing to save those ""groups"" or worse ignored them all together.

It's been that way in this Country for a very long time.

It's been as clear as the nose on your face if you took the time to pay attention."
2021-01-10 14:47,"Thank God we let private industry develop the vaccine with backing of government.   Now look what happens when government gets too involved with something that needs to be streamlined and efficient, the delivery of the vaccine.  Cuomo threatening millions of dollars in fine, great, threaten to kick the health systems in the gut while they are struggling and watch them go into insolvency but only to have the state bail them out.  Makes sense ?! Healthcare workers and those most likely to get the virus and be hospitalized and expose healthcare workers should be first.  If 20-30% of healthcare workers are sick or on quarantine, the pandemonium would be epic.   Now everyone wants a vaccine after a decade of anti vaxers getting the attention and influencing even smart healthcare workers not to get the vaccine.  We cannot have a super spreader event of people congregating in mass to get vaccinated makes this even more of a daunting task.  Get a plan to vaccinate those most vulnerable and roll it out quickly and supply the states and clinic with as much vaccine as they need.  The sooner we are all vaccinated we will watch the incidence of COVID 19 infections plummet.  The more we dawdle, the more deaths and sickness and overcrowded hospitals.  Image if you have a serious non COVID medical emergency and you cannot get treatment as the hospitals are full as are the ICUs and 20% of the healthcare workers are out sick and you may die over something as simple as appendicitis."

The moating of excess vaccine within organizations which were incapable of administering it promptly and having it potentially spoil is a disgrace.  Cuomo’s staff has been unbelievably clueless on this issue. Time is of the essence. EVERY additional person who is vaccinated makes the rest of the population that much safer.  The priority should be to bang the vaccine into as many arms as possible in the shortest time frame. I don’t mind if the elderly are given priority for a limited period of time, as long as it doesn’t slow the process down. But under no circumstances should vaccine be sitting around more than a day or two."
2021-01-10 14:57,"Honestly, with the accompanying article that NYU, Columbia, and Harvard vaccinated employees who shouldn't be eligible, it's clear that we shouldn't have trusted our elite institutions with this responsibility.

They should immediately lose all federal funding, and the vaccination should be managed by a federal organization. Shameful."

It is really a sad commentary on our society that so many are out for only their own selfish needs. I hope they sleep well knowing that the shot they took from someone who really needed it could cost that other person their life. The hospitals should be fined for such behavior. These are major institutions and ones that people trust. It truly disgusts me."

2021-01-10 6:55,"Remember ACT UP, the movement of AIDS patients from 1987? 

Back then, the government was withholding essential medicines from patients and people were dying by the thousands. Sound familiar? ACT UP held noisy protests, which led to the FDA and the drug companies increasing the availability, and lowering the prices, of AIDS medicines.

In my state, and maybe other places, seniors under 75 have been quietly deprioritized. Most don't know that first dibs on the vaccine are going to younger, less-at-risk-of-death groups who have more political clout than they do.

Is the solution to show up at the state Dept. of Health with whistles, like the ACT UP protesters from back in the day? That would be against social distancing.

Instead, if you're a senior, or you know or love a senior, contact your elected officials and policymakers and demand shots in arms."

Now we’re seeking to cordon off access to vaccines for their sole benefit? It’s insane and counterproductive how the elderly have a total stranglehold over society to the detriment of children and productive-age adults by sole virtue of being a reliable voting bloc.

Everyone dies someday. At 90, if it’s not Covid, it’s cancer, heart disease, dementia, a fall. Open up the vaccines so we can get society back on track."

BTW, I'm pretty sure the people who stormed the Capitol don't care about other people who might get covid and die because of their actions."
2021-01-10 13:49,"COVID-19 is out of control in the US, due to the incompetence and denial of Donald Trump.
The US has more than 1/3 of the new COVID infections in the entire world, with 1/25 of the world population.  So this is now the Trump plague, which is being spread from the US throughout the world.

The US has a responsibility to vaccinate as many Americans as soon as possible, which President Biden will be promoting.  See the recent NY Times article
“Biden plans to release nearly all available vaccine doses in an attempt to speed delivery”
<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/world/biden-vaccine.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/world/biden-vaccine.html</a>"
2021-01-10 17:29,"250,000 of the DEAD from Covid 19 were under age 60, age SIXTY.
                    In NC 80% of the vaccinations  have  gone to WHITE people, age 25 to 50.
This is agism  and racists,.
I'm 72 and can't get a vaccine  until  summer, if I live that long.Thats my guess because they haven't even made an estimate yet when under 75 can get a vaccine.  
My personal PCP and his nurses  can't get one because he isn't part of a large hospital practice.                                      Gov Cooper has let us all down as NC is one of the worst states for handling vaccinations.  Dr  Mandy Cohn  of health dept.is deciding that if you are old you have to wait.
We are the ones dying!, 250.000 so far."
2021-01-10 9:56,"The CDC should be charged with genocide, for their socially engineered decision to sacrifice the lives of those between 60 and 
75.  The specific individuals who are responsible for the upcoming massacre of this age group should be named and shamed. The odds of dying from covid rise dramatically after age 60.  Everyone over 60 should be given priority in vaccination over young healthy people no matter how ""essential"" the politically correct deem them to be."
2021-01-10 14:18,"One of the main problems with vaccine distribution is more staff is needed to get shots into arms. This should have been a federal effort. More money should have been allocated to states in order to train staff to vaccinate. There should have been better coordination between federal agencies, states and cities! They need to have a clear plan to bring every retired health care profession out to get trained and vaccinate people. Also, you need hundreds of vaccination “camps” set up in schools, churches, city offices, colleges across America, so in less than three months the entire country is vaccinated! You could have one single app, I heard Dr. Wen say similar to Israel, for sign ups and vaccine distribution. Instead, they are using Eventbrite or other event apps which is not ideal. Trump and CDC should have thought and planned this out better!  As I watched 60 minutes couple of months ago, I was hopeful watching the Army  Corps of Engineers head say they had a great plan and it was going to be done effectively. How wrong they were! Hopefully, Biden’s administration will do a better job!"
2021-01-10 15:47,Any willing arm is a good arm. Enough is enough.
2021-01-10 13:30,"Well, of course, the nation has no distribution plan for the vaccines. Trump and his apologists are too busy trying to launch a coup against the republic."
2021-01-10 15:57,"This just pathetic. If you want to control a pandemic you need to vaccinate as many people as you can as quickly as you can.  By all means, prioritize health care workers, but thereafter get it out to all comers. 
Letting incompetent politicians (no matter which party) control this is simply a recipe for disaster. As we are seeing every day."
2021-01-10 16:16,"Meanwhile, in another article, the Times ""exposes"" the fact that office workers and researchers in ""elite"" hospitals were vaccinated, contrary to the CDC guidelines. Big deal. It's headlines like these that will lead to expired vaccines."
2021-01-10 8:54,"Cuomo and De Santis have created the perfect storm for a New York State pension system bomb. The best option for a 66 year old member of the New York State retirement system, who wants to get vaccinated, is to retire...to Florida."
2021-01-10 14:53,"Just give the vaccine!  

Vaccine getting dumped?  A healthcare sin."
2021-01-10 16:15,"Once again the main issue is the incompetent Trump administration.
The vax was just tossed over the fence - with no rules.  Some locals are competent - some not."
2021-01-10 6:46,"There are’t logistics issues. There are WOKE issues. Family in other states - Kentucky (Democratic governor and def backwards in almost all ways) my in-laws were vaccinated this week. Both under 75. My brother and sister in law in Texas (late 30s) will get it next week because her sister is a nurse and the hospital was going to end up wasting doses if they didn’t expand the pool. Here in the NE we are so busy fighting over who is in charge and if it’s equitable we can’t see the forest for the trees - Cuomo the dictator must have final say on all matters - no DeBlasio fan but seriously Cuomo is a child.  It’s embarrassing to say the least that a mega center in NY is 2,000 doses and my in-laws tell me their KY hospital is administering 1,000 does a day. As you can imagine the populations certainly are not near a 2:1 ratio."
2021-01-10 9:21,"Delaware has set the age for group 1b at 65, not 75.  Why?  ""On Dec. 22, the State Ethics Advisory Group voted to recommend adopting the ACIP Phase 1b approach.  However, DPH decided to lower the age the state would consider eligible in Phase 1b from 75 to 65 based on statewide COVID-related deaths.  While the median age for deaths among White and Asian persons is 82 and 83 respectively, the median age for deaths among Blacks is 74 and it is 66 for Hispanic individuals.""  Setting the age eligibility for the shot at 75, when a majority of both Black and ""Hispanic"" deaths occur prior to that age, is a classic example of the institutionalized racism White America so constantly ignores."
2021-01-10 14:24,"Shame shame on Illinois!!  First it was one of the bravest states facing the pandemic. Now it has become a militaristic State that refuses Covid vaccines to its public unless they have an appropriate soldierly number.
I am a very old lady living at home. I have multiple predisposing health issues but because I am labeled 
Ias a helpless  1B,  I am not qualified for the vaccination that I deserve.
Covid vaccinations should be for any Illinois citizen 
Who Wants one. Will I ever get one?"
2021-01-10 15:35,"From the USA Today today: ""Anger and frustration are surging across the country as the federal government leaves states to handle the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. Through Friday, states had received 22.1 million doses of the vaccines. Of those about 6.7 million - less than one-third - had been administered."" 

Oh I guess states haven't already failed us: Just look at the rocketing rising illness and death rates (almost 400,000! 400,000 dead from this disease!) Once again the federal government lets the people of this country down. Once again. So not only has Trump divided this country in a way that is truly impeachable, he should be prosecuted for murder of everyone who dies who should have been in a high-priority group and received some of the 2/3rds of the ""surplus"" supply of the vaccines, IMMEDIATELY. 

""Federal government"" in the United States is a euphemism  for irresponsibility, neglect, greed and failure to act in the best interest of the people who pay their exorbitant salaries and provide for all of their perks. And this is not limited to just the right side of the house."
2021-01-10 11:57,"More politicized gobbledygook from the CDC. This really isn't that hard of a problem. Drops the politics and bring in ALL  relevant experts. Once the second group is 85% complete, deny federal funds to any state that doesn't completely reopen its economy to include schools, not that they shouldn't be open right now because they should, nation wide. 

First group - aka, biggest bang for the buck

1. LTCF staff should get the vaccine first. They are the vector to the 3 million residents under their care. The residents can wait. 
2. Emergency responders to include emergency room staffs. Unlike most medical workers they can't entirely control their surroundings. 
3. Prison Staff. Much like LTCF residents, the staff are the vector. Protect the staff protect the inmates. 

Second Group

1. 85 years and older. Look at the numbers, the death rate under 85 is much different than older 85.
2. High risk populations 16 to 85. This covers the remaining populations that need the most protection. 

Third Group

1. Remaining medical staff
2. Military
3. Teachers

Fourth Group

1. General population moving backwards in age."
2021-01-10 3:28,"Simple
1. Doctors nurses actual frontline health workers
2. Nursing homes long term care police fire emt
Then everybody else narrow age bands
3 a. 85 and up
   b. 80-84
   c. 75-79
   d. 70-74
    Etc.
Track number of does in each age band
Develop second shot schedule as you go
Compare to number of doses arriving from drug companies to number of vaccinations in age band 
Driver license to verify age
Scan license into computer for tracking 
Develop monthly appointment charts 
I’m available to chart this 
The cdc recommendation will go down in medical history as the most stupid anti science vaccination protocol of all time"
2021-01-10 4:11,"So this is where we are.  We have a failed executive branch of a Federal government that has ground to a halt.  We have more infections and more deaths than any other nation in the world.  We have thousands of vaccinations in deep freezers and no way to get it into the arms of our vulnerable population.
Please, lets get over this deadly strategy of delegating everything to the states and please, Mr. Biden take the reins and get us vaccinated!"
2021-01-10 5:29,"There is no excuse for the problems with the roll out of the vaccines.In Florida the move to vaccinate. people 65 and over was a disaster.There are 5 million people in Florida over the age of 65.
The vaccine should be given first to people over 85 to get the number of Peo[le more in line with the available doses.I also think Bidden is right to suggest not holding back available vaccines and keep them in storage for a second dose."
2021-01-10 16:09,"""But a handful of the nation’s most prestigious academic hospitals have already taken the notion much further. Workers who have nothing to do with patient care, and who are not 75 or older, have been offered the shots. Some of the institutions were among the first recipients of the limited supplies in the United States."" from: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/health/coronavirus-hospitals-vaccinations.html?action=click&module=Top"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/health/coronavirus-hospitals-vaccinations.html?action=click&module=Top</a>%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage. The complicated Tier system not only failed to get vaccines out of fridges into arms, but also failed in its own ethical goals. But no one responsible has even admitted they have a problem. This is what robs the system of credibility."
2021-01-10 7:00,"Day by day we see more evidence of the lunacy that was the ""herd immunity"" philosophy of trump/atlas.

We have learned that it was indeed foolish to believe that immunity would be imparted when 10-15% of a population had been infected. We now see that intentionally infecting people, even ""young"" people, floods our hospitals with the sick and dying, clogs the emergency response system and deprives those not sick with COVID of the care they need. It threatens to breach what few defenses set up to protect the elderly and co-morbid.

Even worse, it is consuming staff needed to administer vaccines.

Now an even more dire outgrowth of this bankrupt theory has become apparent. The longer this virus is allowed to exist in the human population, the more time it has to mutate and evolve. So far, it has become much more contagious. Will it progress to a more deadly form? Will it metamorphose to a vaccine resistant variant?

This is the legacy of trump ignorance and disdain."
2021-01-10 16:55,"Responding and organizing to a nation-wide calamity is what we have a federal government for. 

It's too bad the states aren't able to make up for the complete abdication of responsibility from Trump, Mich McConnell, and their immoral sycophants, but this is what people--particularly these older voters that are so vulnerable--voted for: 

no masks, no organization, you're on your own. #MAGA

I wear a mask to protect them, not for me. I happily pay taxes to help the vulnerable. Meanwhile they are afraid of black people voting. SIGH."
2021-01-10 12:55,Lowering the age requirement in IL was also based on equity considerations. The median age of death from COVID is 81 for white people in IL but 68 for Hispanic and 70-something for Black people.
2021-01-10 11:36,"NYS is doing the worst . Eligibility to be vaccinated starts at age of 75 years. Underlying causes like asthma, cardiovascular conditions and diabetes do not matter. This is ridiculous . People 65 years in other states got vaccines. It is frustrating and confusing."
2021-01-10 13:24,this is the same ignorance that enables the virus to spread. does anyone play by the rules anymore? the  demonstration in the capital has nothing on the lack of concern for the virus.
2021-01-10 4:10,"Just start vaccinating every willing person. There is a tsunami of virus overtaking us. Vaccinate as many people as possible, as fast as possible--before the whole country/economy collapses. Dithering  and virtue signaling are responsible for people dying. This pandemic response (and ongoing vaccine debacle) are the greatest failure of government in United States history. Disgraceful."
2021-01-10 11:02,Those over 60 should get the shots first. Over 80 percent of the deaths from covid are in seniors over 60.  Now 4000 people are dying everyday of covid in the USA.   By vaccinating seniors first we could cut down on this enormous death rate and free up emergency rooms and intensive care units in the hospitals which are now overwhelmed with dying Covid patients.
2021-01-10 16:40,"It is time to declare the COVID pandemic in the US what it truly is---a national emergency.  Mobilize the military to vaccinate.  They possess superior logistic abilities and they have the resources to get the job done expeditiously (unlike the States and localities who are starved for funds and hospitals who are overwhelmed in caring for COVID patients). If there was ever a need for a national effort in defense of the American people, this is it."

2021-01-13 15:23,"This is long overdue. Best of luck, Dr. Nunez-Smith!"
2021-01-13 15:55,Congratulations Dr. Nunez Smith!  I am so proud of you and thrilled to know you are at the helm and leading such important work.
2021-01-13 16:24,"Congratulations to Dr. Nunez-Smith. Addressing and correcting the social inequities that drive serious and persistent chronic health conditions and health care disparities in minority communities will take more than increased access to better health care (physical and behavioral). It will take educational, financial, law enforcement, housing, labor, and environmental initiatives - to name a few - to begin to level things out. Without social equity, you can't have health equity. I expect Dr. Nunez-Smith understands this. She will need a cross-agency, multi-disciplinary team of experts, especially those from affected minority communities, to develop and implement an effective strategy to initiate change."
2021-01-13 22:12,This is excellent. Is this the Doctor who was interview on NPR by Kurt Anderson a couple of years ago? I hope so because she had her stuff together and was fascinating to hear.
2021-01-13 22:17,"Knowing Dr. Nunez-Smith professionally, I can't think of a more capable and motivated candidate for this crucial work.  Her ethics and passion are deeply rooted and genuine.  She is a force for change and a force for good.  And she is truly a force.  We've all met a few people in our careers who can get more done in a week than even the average top performers can do in months - that's Dr. Nunez-Smith.  Inertia and subconscious resistance will be her greatest obstacles, and she's the right kind of captain for that type of problem."
2021-01-13 17:34,Thank goodness we will have people like this - who believe in science and facts and people - guiding our COVID-19 response. A tragedy that so many have died due to an incompetent response in 2020 fueled by ideology and narcissism.
2021-01-13 19:36,"Only a week or so ago an NYT article stated that the disparities in US health care are not racial but economic. 

That is, which distinguishes those who receive poor health care is not their race or ethnic group but their income.

In the US there are more poor Hispanics than poor Blacks, and more poor Whites than poor Blacks. 

Dr. Nunes sound well qualified and experience for her position, and I hope she and her two other co-chairs understand that poor health care is a serious and common problem for ALL poor people, not just Blacks."
2021-01-13 20:50,I do not believe in racial gaps. But there are obviously financial gaps.
2021-01-13 17:43,"Racial gaps surely exist and hopefully Dr. Nunez-Smith will work effectively to dramatically reduce or eliminate them.  But will personal responsibility even be a part of the discussion about a solution?  Can anyone truly deny that poverty, poor education, poor health and numerous other problems are caused by the extremely high percentage of African-American babies born to unwed teenage mothers.  Senator Moynihan pointed out the problem in 1965, but was vilified as a racist.  However, many African-American leaders, including, most notably, President Obama, acknowledged that the problem could not simply be attributed to systemic racism and they tried to confront the problem in their communities.  Unfortunately, however, any discussion about personal responsibility has been eliminated in the wake of what the Times refers to as ""the national reckoning on race"" as a result of the outrageous murders by police of George Floyd and other African-Americans.  Solutions to the problems identified in this article will prove to be elusive until the percentage of babies born to unwed teenage mothers is substantially reduced."
2021-01-14 2:53,"Health disparities is not confined to health care.  It touches on every aspect of society - jobs, education, housing, transportation, the environment, public safety, etc. In other words, it is what the mission of government is all about - creating opportunities for every resident to live in a safe and supportive environment, from cradle to grave. 

So will Biden give this task force the resources and power to direct the Cabinet to allocate resources in order to ensure equal opportunities for everyone, including universal access to health care or will this be yet another window dressing with a nice title and recommendations that sit on a shelf?  We can only hope that Biden sees the wisdom of health in all policies."
