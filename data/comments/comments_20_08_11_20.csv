2020-08-20 0:18,Let’s just hope that Mr. Helpful-in-Chief doesn’t find out before the medicos do! Seriously!
2020-08-20 14:27,I am curious about broadly neutralizing antibodies which I have heard discussed by leading infectious disease researchers. I hope the NYT science writers follow up on this novel method of harnessing a patient's own immune system.
2020-08-20 14:38,"Fasting, either intermittent or extended, also reduces inflammation and can prevent cytokine storms. Is anyone looking into layering fasting over current therapies?"
2020-08-20 5:19,"I am disappointed and dismayed that the most promising therapeutic, Leronlimab, is not part of any federally supported trials. Leronlimab is an immune modulator, a monoclonal antibody which blocks CCR5 receptors on a range of immune cells, such as macrophages, eosinophils and t-lymphocytes. Blocking CCR5 prevents the movement of these cells to areas of inflammation, stopping the runway inflammatory cascade of the cytokine storm. 

Leronlimab reduced disease progression in moderate covid patients, with 50% of Leronlimab treated patients showing improvement, versus 20% in placebo, p=0.02

Leronlimab is awaiting Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA and Fast Track designation by the UK regulatory authorities. With approval, this can bridge the gap until effective vaccines are developed, manufactured and distributed widely."
2020-08-20 9:39,"We need to avoid the Trumpian hype with these new drugs and interventions. Let the physicians and researchers test their hypotheses without making a media spectacle out of every preliminary find.

Yes, drug discovery and best treatment protocols take time to develop, and be established, and this virus ain’t goin’ nowhere fast.

In the meantime we must mask up, social distance, and watch what surfaces you touch. We must realize that there will be an end to this crisis... although a little help from the US government would be nice."
2020-08-20 11:54,"Let’s take stock here. 

On one hand you have remdesivir. A patented drug, owned and marketed by Gilead, which showed NO mortality benefit but quickly gained emergency authorization from FDA. 

On the other, yesterday we hear about the rejection of emergency authorization for convalescent plasma, which has shown to be safe in over 200K patients, has shown efficacy in early non-randomized trials, but is not intellectual property and owned by no one. 

Hum what do you think explains this disparate behavior from FDA?$$$"
2020-08-20 17:20,"Please note that the trial is known as ACTT (Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial) and not ACCT, as listed in the fifth paragraph."
2020-08-20 10:15,Testing the efficacy of a Medical treatment using sound scientific methods. Let's hope that this continues without interference from Donald Trump.
2020-08-20 16:18,"""In a large clinical trial, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, remdesivir was shown to modestly shorten recovery time, by four days, on average, but it did not reduce deaths.""

But it *did* reduce deaths. This is scientifically illiterate coverage. Deaths fell by about 30% in the remdesivir treatment group, vs. the control. This decline barely missed the arbitrary p=.05 cut-off, at p=.06 (that is, there is a 6% chance such a decline in mortality could have been random chance as opposed to a 5% chance that it was due to chance). 

If a study to be unable to determine if a 30% decline in mortality is due to random chance, according to the (arbitrary) p=.05 standpoint it suggests that the study was too small, not that the drug is ineffective.  

This is very bad journalism, and disservice to readers who should know that there are drugs out there that have significant benefits to mortality."
2020-08-21 8:54,Hi New York Times community- Sorry to send this text so late but my daughter just called me tonight to tell me her grandpa just died of Covid 19.  I just got off the phone with her.  She is inconsolable. He died alone- I'm talking to her paternal family right now and they are heartbroken. So sad. Trump must be held accountable.
2020-08-24 13:39,"Health literacy - an idea whose time has come! The public doesn't need to believe farfetched ideas about health. Folks don't need to be scientists to understand and critically review unsubstantiated claims about benefits of products. Simple message: include health literacy in science classes; reinforce the learning process with public health messaging and via social media. ""No evidence of benefit? No proof there's no harm? Reject claims that can't be proven."" Don't we already do this in the realm of commerce?"
2020-08-24 15:44,"Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites. They are absolutely dependent on cell functions for their replication. Covid-19 codes for 29 proteins, meaning there are potentially 29 virus specific drug targets. The human cell codes for about 25,000 proteins meaning there are potentially 25,000 cellular targets.  In most cases where a chemical compound appears to be active in tissue culture against a virus, it is statistically far more likely that compound in question is attacking a cellular target than a viral target. It follows that when antiviral activity is discovered in tissue, while it may be interesting, it is a very long way from being an antiviral drug."
2020-08-24 14:14,"Why are we even giving time to this snake oil salesman??? He sells pillows, for goodness sake. Can we please stay on course with the science behind any potential Covid cures and listen to the scientists?? Honestly, it's not that difficult."
2020-08-24 14:19,"In the 19th Century they used to be called ""snake oil salesmen"". Science has advanced over the past century and we are now beginning to see real cures for all sorts of incurable diseases. And then we have Donald Trump with his unproven claims of Covid-19 cures by Hydroxychloroquine or injection of toxic disinfectants. Trump is the 21st Century equivalent of a ""snake-oil salesman"" ; millions who should have been educated by science are still buying his HOAXES. America is doomed if so many voters can be duped so easily by such a fraudster."
2020-08-24 14:42,"I’ve seen the commercials for those pillows and eventually bought one. I couldn’t tell the difference from other brands. Hucksterism, I think. Same for this miracle drug."
2020-08-24 15:09,"Poor President Trump.  He seems to have such trouble finding scientifically credible people for his efforts.

I wonder why."
2020-08-24 15:55,"The pillow guy merely ""misspoke"" when he repeatedly and hyperbolically told Anderson Cooper about (nonexistent) promising study results of a Covid ""cure.' So says the director of the company that makes the ""cure"" and where the pillow guy has a financial stake and is a board member. USA Today reported in 2017 that the BBB revoked MyPillow's accreditation at that time based on false advertising. And the pillow shown on some boxes was more deluxe than the one inside. This guy wants to sell me a pill made from poison, I'll pass."
2020-08-24 15:55,I would like to nominate Mr. Lindell to participate in the drug trial.
2020-08-24 13:02,"This guy only knows how to create wealth - out of pillows.  That talent, however, enables him to do other things.  While being inclined to truly celebrate the creation of wealth, anything ELSE coming out of his mouth should be taken with a grain of - VERY, VERY SKEPTICAL - salt!"
2020-08-24 14:03,"If someone testing a drug/compound is already ""sure"" it's effective, there's a problem ..."
2020-08-24 14:22,"While it's important info that no studies have shown it's safe or effective, the fact that it's sourced from a poisonous plant is completely meaningless and I don't understand why this is mentioned.

Lots of drugs that are approved for various uses are sourced from various poisonous sources."
2020-08-24 15:23,"Someone who says this: ""I backed the greatest president this country has ever seen in history,"" failing to see the redundancy, is someone who should not be listened to."
2020-08-24 17:32,"Lindell has the same disease as many entrepreneurs.  He is good at rationalizing anything that he perceives as making him money.  What drives him and other wealthy libertarians is the mistaken notion that undoing governance will increase profit.  

That might be true for a very short term zero sum game but but long term planning is better for most people who don't have so much wealth.  The zero sum game that Lindell and others like to play actually reduces the size of the collective economic pie over time.  

By enabling the success of people like Lindell we enable more like him.  We need enterprise that profits from long term stewardship as well as short term profit.  That is usually not in the nature of corporate business so the government has to regulate corporate governance, directly or by incentive, to do better for us all.  That's why the wealthy cannot be in charge of our democracy."
2020-08-24 16:40,"I heard this story as I was making arrangements to have removed the 50' oleanders surrounding my house.  These plants are so toxic that the soil within 20' will kill any plant.  They are so flammable that a single spark will ignite the entire row and likely take out all the houses on the street.  I've known children to be cut on oleanders and end up in the hospital, fighting for life.  Should twigs drop into the yard and be mouthed by my Dog, the convulsions would kill him.  Oleanders are just about the most toxic plant grown.  Refine its toxin as a cure for COVID-19?  That's just insane."
2020-08-24 16:23,"Charlatans abound, especially at a time when dangerous demagogues 'a la Trump' roam freely and try to cheat on us. How in the world can we tolerate this insult to our ability to think, and reason?"
2020-08-24 16:29,"I believe Anderson Cooper pointed out that his compound is sold as a ""supplement'. As such this means there is little, if any, regulation of this product. Yet, it is being hawked by Lindell as if it is a pharmaceutical. And he stands to make a lot of money off of this product. This is, at best, unethical, and potentially criminal."
2020-08-24 16:46,"The scariest part of this article is that PB’s Whitney is looking into selling this possibly dangerous & likely ineffective substance as an OTC supplement which requires no form of review or testing by the FDA!
As a result of my brief search for info on this company I find no products available from them & that they list themselves as a 20yr. old company but elsewhere they are listed as starting up in either 2003 or 2010, neither of which is 20 yrs. ago (sorry for stating the obvious but there are some who need that).
We know there are dangerous & useless products sold OTC now for dieting, miracle brain renewal, eternal youth, etc. but add in a U.S. president shilling for the company & some people will be harmed...but $$ will be made!"
2020-08-24 16:49,There's no way I'm trying this stuff. I'm sticking with injecting Mr. Clean.
2020-08-24 17:06,"How much longer do we have to put up with giving time to people for their recommendations for medical cures, remedies & procedures fir which they  have no training or expertise to even understand. Skip this one!!"
2020-08-24 16:04,"Hopefully everyone who can identify this terribly common landscape plant also knows that it's poisonous. I still remember my mother telling us little kids not to eat these plants, which some oblivious developer had used to landscape all the yards in our brand new, post-war SoCal neighborhood. Luckily my baby sister never tried the snails (only the ants.)

For Trump to mention this drug publicly is gross negligence."
2020-08-24 16:29,"Yes, it will give you a cleansing from the inside.  It works in one minute; one minute!!
You will not live to see it work, but your coronavirus infection will be cured."
2020-08-24 16:51,"Man, that looks like a sloppy study. No placebo arm, no blinding, subjects self select to treatment/no treatment, and not nearly enough study subjects, since the measured outcome is death, and you might anticipate, say, three deaths in a group of a hundred, but the number would be 0-6, with a p>.05, etc, etc."
2020-08-24 17:16,"re: ""Mr. Lindell repeatedly stated that oleandrin was shown to be safe in a study of 1,000 people. But that is misleading: No known study examining the safety of oleandrin as a treatment for coronavirus or anything else has ever been conducted in such a large group.""

'Misleading?' How about an outright lie."
2020-08-24 17:25,"Maybe I can help.

Fundamentalist Christians now style themselves ""evangelicals"" since the past 20 years kind of ruined the word ""fundamentalist."" But it was not long ago -- Jerry Falwell Sr. thought of his movement as fundamentalism.

Fundamentalists eschew dancing, drinking, tobacco, sex before marriage, and ... movies. The majority do not watch much culture at all except their own, and the Hallmark Channel.

But it is hard to hide from culture. It filters through, though much the way sound filters out from a football stadium during a game. You hear the sounds, but no context.

I would bet good money this guy heard about the ""forsythia"" farce from Contagion somehow, took it seriously, did not realize it was from a movie, would not really understand ""from a movie"" means anyway, did his own ""research"" and came up with his own plant extract.

Never trust serious things to people whose religion prohibits knowing much about many things, or even the difference between reality and a line from a movie they never saw.

And fundamentalism is not religion. It is a pathology of religion. And it currently is no dominant form of Protestant Christianity in this country. They just call themselves evangelicals now, because the old bed, well they messed that one up, too."
2020-08-24 18:42,"Notwithstanding the remainder of the article, the notion that oleandrin can’t possibly be evaluated as a medicine because it and the plant from which it is derived is poisonous is a misunderstanding of pharmacology.  Many, perhaps most, medications are poisonous in the wrong dosage or setting. A classic example is the medication digitalis which is derived from the poisonous foxglove plant."
2020-08-24 19:22,I watched the interview and when he could not provide any evidence to back his claims he went right to the conspiracy claims.
2020-08-24 20:13,"Oleander is a well-known remedy in homeopathic care, but there is no material presence of the plant in its preparation, hence zero toxicity. That is the whole premise of homeopathic treatment: follow the Hippocratic oath: Do no harm.  Only the electron pattern from the mother tincture remains, 

Unfortunately blind studies yield no proof of its efficacy, since treatment is based on individual constitutional differentials, from patient to patient, whereas pharmaceuticals treat only symptoms without considering constitutional types."
2020-08-24 20:16,"Once again, we can thank Senator Orrin Hatch for allowing ""supplements"" that are useless or deadly or both to be sold in drugstores and grocery stores all over the country under the auspices of the legislation named the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA 1994). Anyone who wants the real story on dietary supplements can get if from the Center for Science in the Public Interest. They test these fraudulent products and publish their results."
2020-08-24 20:35,"Many years ago I scratched the cornea in my left eye on an oleander leaf as I bent over to water the potted plant. It was very painful, but eventually, and after a trip to the ER, the scratch healed.  A few months later I read in a newspaper about another woman who'd scratched her cornea in the same way, and she died.  The leaf I encountered was whole, and apparently hers was torn."
2020-08-24 22:14,"This is a good moment/place to note the emphasis with which the much maligned FDA places on the purity and consistent manufacturing procedures for drugs.  For example, foxglove contains several chemical forms of the digitalis family of compounds (and related plants containing those compounds).  Several of these digitalis compounds have vastly different bioavailability and half-lives in the human.  William Withering's patients (he discovered the efficacious effects of foxglove extracts in heart failure in the 18th century) probably benefited from the plant extract, although some may have died from digitalis toxicity.  We've done considerably better under the protection of the FDA since the early 20th century."
2020-08-24 22:14,"Oleander was long the plant of choice I wanted to pepper all through my garden. It would be an annual here, but I thought maybe if the deer sampled a bit I’d be able to get them to bypass my garden. Deerbane doesn’t exist but maybe they’d nibble a bit on a out of zone newcomer.

I just have to say that the idea of trusting a guy who makes bedding with serious consideration of a pharmaceutical product made from the most toxic common garden plant I know seems like a leap into another reality. I can’t see the idea getting too far with the Sharks on Shark Tank, but our Apprentice in Chief laps it up.

I just keep asking myself how anyone can actually check Trumps name on a ballot without getting nauseous. Trump and oleander - perfect together."
2020-08-24 13:38,"If Lindell and Trump are hot to trot about these dangerous ""drugs"", they should be willing to wolf them down in public.  Either put up or shut up."
2020-08-24 13:53,You can stop reading the article after the words “Trump donor”. Not sure why the Times runs articles that are essentially placed ads for snake oil salesmen. It’s not news.
2020-08-24 21:05,"We have a pillow salesman pitching toxic virus ""cures"" from the White House.

VOTE."
2020-08-24 22:10,"I just took one look at this guy, skipped the article and went straight to the comments."
2020-08-24 14:17,"Any gardener knows about this plant.  And hey, if President Tweety wants to try it, by all means let him.  Then we will see how effective it is for, say, terminal ignorance."
2020-08-24 15:07,We should have the My Pillow guy and the President test it on themselves.
2020-08-24 18:06,From My Pillows to My Poison
2020-08-24 18:23,"If you CALL NOW, you’ll get a FREE PILLOW with your miracle cure!"
2020-08-24 20:20,Maybe Trump would like to test it first!
2020-08-24 20:58,Perhaps Mr. Lindell could pitch this miracle drug this way: “Well if it don’t cure your Covid it sure will solve any sleeping problem!”
2020-08-24 21:45,Trump is surrounded by crazy people.
2020-08-24 12:55,"The smoke of the oleander is also poisonous.

""Let's kill off some more of our own voters!"""
2020-08-24 13:48,Can “snake oil” also cure Covid?  Just asking.

2020-08-24 17:02,"Only in America!  

Shysters, con-persons, carpetbaggers, Bernie Maddofs, and Donald Trumps—only in America are such people routinely glamorized, made fabulously rich, and toasted as community pillars (or should I say pillows?). 

It’s a deep-seated national illness of the blood, and it’ll be the end of us. 

Not too long ago we were still a robust, self-respecting, reasonably honest, fair-minded people. 

Then came government of the people, by anti democratic, egomaniacal liars, for monopolistic business purposes—a trend that became mainstream in the 1950s, with the UK-USA-led 1953 coup in Iran."
2020-08-24 19:24,The idea that you pitch a cure to the President who has no medical knowledge is entirely insane. The politics over science is killing people...
2020-08-24 13:30,"Just another huckster selling snake oil. This is what modern conservatism has devolved into. Lie, cheat, steal, as long as you can make a buck."
2020-08-24 14:10,Let’s hope Fox doesn’t pick this up. People who voted for a bankrupt reality show star for president might actually start munching poisonous shrubbery because a pillow salesman told them to.
2020-08-24 15:18,"Oh, for Pete's sake... how many times to we have to go through this? 

One would assume that by now the Trump family has a controlling interest in the My Pillow company... and that Mr. Trump will hold up a pretty little, MAGA-branded bottle of his new favorite poison -- I mean, miracle cure -- at the GOP convention, on the White House lawn, with a phone number you can call to get your very own miracle elixir.  Call now!

2020-08-24 15:30,"If this plant extract doesn't work, you can always shoot bleach into your veins, according to Trump."
2020-08-24 17:15,"I watched Mr Lindell get called a liar on national TV and not respond, except to keep the fast talking going. He’s good. A good liar."
2020-08-24 19:01,"I just received a message from Thanos that he wants me to pass along.

2020-08-24 13:14,"Thanks anyway, but I’ll stick to my Pirin tablets to ward off ills..."
2020-08-24 13:22,"This is almost certainly useless garbage as a drug, but the fact that the bush that produces it is toxic is irrelevant.   Many naturally occurring drugs, and foods, have plant parts that are toxic.   Also, I think it's well past time that the Times started to use the verb ""to lie"" when appropriate.  ""misinformation"" and""misleading"" can be stretched just so far."
2020-08-24 15:36,Shouldn’t there be stronger penalties for outright lying about the effectiveness of a product? Evidently we can shoot people for suspected property crimes of twenty bucks but if you scam millions with a fake apnea claim you just pay a tiny portion of your ill gotten gains and move on. Particularly if the president likes you.

2020-08-24 16:09,"Science in the age of Trump -

Climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese (who also created the “China Virus” to get President Trump).

Forest fires are caused by not raking the forest floors.

Windmill noise causes cancer and it is safe to look directly at a solar eclipse.

We have the cleanest air and water despite allowing more pollution than has been allowed for many years.

Scientists should study ways to introduce lights into the human body to kill the coronavirus and also study the use of ingesting disinfectants to undo the lung damage the virus has caused.

So, of course, it makes sense that the My Pillow guy, a recovering drug addict who believes God talks to him and stands to profit from this miraculous cure, would be considered a credible source of medical information.  His scientific expertise is discounted by the elites and lamestream media only because he believes that Trump is the greatest President in American history.

The results - we have the highest numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths in the world.  A country that has always lead the world in medical and scientific innovation now leads the world in medical and scientific failure.

There are many factual questions and considerable confusion between the plant Oleander and the extract, Oleandrin. I suspect the Emory people are totally confused as I don't think Oleandrin was ever found to be toxic in humans in a ug.02 /ml dose  One question could be answered if someone would take the trouble to ask the US Army for its data on its Oleandrin assays. The University of Texas assays indicated activity against COVID 19. They did use Vero cells, but this appears to be the consensus antiviral approach. What the US Army did is not known but a diligent reporter could find out.
All that said I do agree that Olenadrin as a supplement is a bad idea and should not be permitted. But Oleandrin, if it is successful in Phase 2, needs to go into Phase 3. the larger the patient number the better."

2020-08-25 0:26,"I'm reading a lot of uninformed comments here.  It's obvious our education system is failing us!  Pharma uses all sorts of ""poisonous"" plant and animal substances, from snake venom to Belladonna to elleviate many ailments. Obviously not in quantities that kill people!!   It's certaily not a stretch that oleander could have curative benefits.  I will remind all of the NYT commenters that Foxglove, a highly poisonous plant, is used to treat heart conditions, and the Yew tree which is poisonous is now effectively used to treat breast cancers and Kaposi sarcoma."
2020-08-25 1:52,"Foxglove is a poisonous plant in the genus Digitalis.  Digitalis is also the name of a heart medicine that kept my father's atrial fibrillation under control for years, essentially keeping him alive.  The drug is extracted from the plant.

Please do not sink to a Trumpian level of disinformation by implying that it is impossible to extract effective medicine from dangerous plants."
2020-08-25 1:22,"The fact that the shrub from which this purported cure for COVID-19 and “miracle of all time” (something so hyperbolic and moronic it could only come from Trump, or someone in his circles) is poisonous is kind of beside the point; the deadly venom in a gila monster’s saliva is a potent anti diabetic in the right dose, and rat poison is used as a blood thinner to prevent strokes (though too much of it will kill the patient). 

What’s alarming to me is the CEO of a company that makes a product called “my pillow”, who has no medical experience and a huge conflict of interest with his stake in the company that makes oleandrin, is getting multiple pulpits to preach his nonsense from, and that millions of Americans will follow his advice because A) they lack critical thinking skills, and B) they want to “stick it to the libs”."

For example digitalis used to treat heart conditions comes from a plant that is poisonous to humans.  Many drugs in high concentrations can be dangerous so plants that may contain them can be dangerous, but in the correct dosage they can be beneficial.  The focus should have been on the fact that there is no evidence to support the use of the drug, not on where the drug came from."

It is less heartening to see few comments as most are reacting to more “interesting” news.
Long term care facilities are the focus of deaths from Covid and need the focus of more help and ideas. The time has come to understand, address and fix the problems with the homes for many of our aging population...one we will all find ourselves a part of some day."

2020-08-18 15:07,"Great idea; funding for such teams is important - we as a society should be willing to pay for such care of our seniors (presumably it is not reimbursed under Medicare etc.). Ghandi said ""The greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated."" This sentiment applies with equal force to the matter of how a nation treats its vulnerable seniors in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.  When it became obvious that tens of thousands of seniors in such facilities were dying due to the Covid-19 outbreak, we could and should have sent in the National Guard and/or military to assist; this was a tragically missed opportunity."
2020-08-18 15:18,"Many thanks to members of Strike Teams and the organizers who have come up with an appropriate response that can benefit of the care homes, their residents and staff, the local hospitals, and the local community.  My heartfelt thanks for response “tailor made”  to the problem.

My godmother, a resident in long term care, died 10 days ago. Within a week of her death, more than half the residents in her small facility tested positive.  We don’t know the cause of her death, as she was never tested.  The facility had provided excellent care and now is in great crisis.  I hope they are receiving appropriate intervention like the strike team described."

However, they have informed the strike team members after the face that they did not have the money to pay them. This needs to be fixed immediately. Our society cannot afford a massive walk off of medical staff as well as teachers and other educators due to personal risk and lack of compensation."
2020-08-18 22:53,Clear article about a smart strategy to deal with Covid in residential settings  - and probably other emergencies to come. And it's the first time I've read about it. It might also provide a template for other kinds of care in clustered settings.
2020-08-18 13:31,"Opening schools at this point in time is ridiculous. Sending your kid to school is akin to child abuse. And it's not just sick kids that we need to be worried about, it's also kids who become carriers of The Virus and bring it home to more vulnerable family members like parents, grandparents, siblings, others. 

Inevitably, if schools are opened people will get sick and die. It's not worth it. So this is what we do:

When I was in grad school I attended a double summer session and thereby made up a half-year of study and I graduated a half-year early.

I say keep the schools shut until we have a cure and a vaccination. Do video classes as much as possible. Put everything live on hold. When this is all over we can make up the lost time by having summer sessions or longer school days. It may take a  couple of years to completely catch up but I'd rather see schools open in the summertime and after-hours than sick and dead kids and teachers. If everyone is doing this then no one will fall behind. It's not a competition, it's survival. 

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures!"

Are these decrepit buildings magically going to have ventilation, hand washing stations and clean bathrooms? Kids crisscross the city to attend school, taking the subway, bus. Has this been taken into account?

Is there a robust contact tracing program in place to track any student case clusters? Is there adequate testing sites in all neighborhoods? 

It’s great that NYC has controlled infection rates, but how can the last few months be enough time to roll back years of neglect and underfunding of both public health and public schools? 

I truly believe DeBlasio has proved to be one of the most narcissistic leaders. He didn’t understand the seriousness of the pandemic in March , and now in August, he still doesn’t get it!"

Her personal touch was meant for morning circle in person nurturing, not some pathetic version of Kahnacadamy."
2020-08-18 14:03,But what is South Korea doing?
2020-08-18 14:50,"Why is NYC on course to open ALL schools at once? De Blasio doesn’t seem to have the creative thought process to take a nuanced and careful approach to match this virus and the months this city has spent taking careful steps to mitigate it. Honestly, what is the push? Is it stubbornness/ego? Is it for funding? Is there not a way to postpone in-person opening and still get funding? Technically if teachers are teaching and kids are signing in, just as they did from March-June, the schools are open. The transparency of the De Blasio and Carranza approach to the March school closing debacle is questionable at best, so why should we trust the reasoning behind this push to reopen?"
2020-08-18 14:57,"Once again, the column underscores the lack of cohesive national policy. Pitting special interests against one another has become the backbone of the culture. Guess what. It ain't working. 

While Governors are legally bound for each of their respective states, there is only one way to make the stories moot. Cut off the virus and then kill it. That will take some measure of sacrifice.

It is a ""lockdown."" All you need do is replicate New Zealand and other countries that paid the price up front.

If you can shrink the infective pool, then establish immediate containment (testing, isolation, tracing) around new cases & local outbreaks, population-level measures can be relaxed. Rt=>0, virus is deprived of hosts, and broader spread is avoided. That's how SARS ""disappeared.""

The symptom of our disease is Donald Trump. But, it is our lack of national will and discipline that remains the disease. 

We now have the worst of all possible worlds. A slowly leaking economy and and a steady stream of 1000 deaths a day. 

Start over. You can pay me now or pay me ( more) later."
2020-08-18 16:09,"The mayor's efforts should be focused on getting elementary school kids in the classroom, as they are the ones who need in person education the most. I am a parent of two children in one of the city's more affluent elementary schools. Our principals have been working non-stop to make this work, and I have full faith in their efforts. As far as I know, most of our teachers are eager to return to in person teaching. And there are plenty of parents who have chosen to opt for remote learning, which is preferable for them and helps to reduce the number of people in the school, making it safer.

For young children, in person education is critical. I am willing to take the calculated risk to make this work, as I think much of the risk has been mitigated. If my children were older, I might feel differently. Unfortunately, we are at the mercy of the mayor and the overall school district."
2020-08-18 16:24,"We have the lowest infection rates in the country, one of the lowest in the world. Why are we comparing ourselves with what is happening in Georgia and North Carolina? It would be insane not to open, nothing is going to change the coming months. We don’t know when the vaccine will be her and given how we botched the testing initially, I have very little hope that the distribution of vaccines will go smoothly."
2020-08-18 18:08,"People seem to have this idea that if re-opening (schools, business, or anything else) doesn't work, all we have to do is flip a switch, and we can undo the effects. But everything I have read from epidemiologists suggests pandemics don't work that way. The mitigating measures that work when you have 1000 cases don't work anymore when you have 100,000 cases, and what worked with 100,000 cases might not work when you have 1 million cases. Once the pandemic spreads past a certain point, you can't go back. There are only ever more drastic measures. In other words, the longer we refuse to take our medicine, the more bitter that medicine gets."
2020-08-18 17:43,"I remember all the comments confidently proclaiming the US ready for re-opening back in late May/early June. People in states like Texas touted their low number of cases as justification. Those comments have aged rather poorly.

Now it feels like New York wants to repeat that tragic farce: spike the ball and declare victory because of a spell of calm  has lasted a few months in one city. That seems risky given most countries that have had good results have also had case spikes when vigilance slacks. I wonder if the people who want to gamble with their kids, their own, and their city's health now will own up to their role in this if things turn tragic in a couple of months? Or will they point their fingers at everybody else except themselves?"
2020-08-18 17:13,"""China on Tuesday reported no new locally transmitted cases of the virus on the mainland for the second consecutive day.""

2020-08-18 17:57,It's certainly possible the Chinese government is manipulating both their domestic and international perception of the state of their pandemic. But that really should not be the concern for the US right now. I think it's enough to know that some of the information coming out of China should be taken with a grain of salt. Our epidemic management is so much of a mess by any measure that we should be concerned about saving actual American lives and not some ridiculous international image contest with China.
2020-08-18 17:36,"California prisons, long overcrowded, have done a terrible job of keeping their populations safe.  Through neglect and indifference, and in the face of medical authorities, prisons have spread virus from institution to institution, among prisoners and staff to the communities at large where these prisons locations.
Thus, California prisons continue to fail to keep  the public safe while squandering state resources during a downturn.
Prison are not places of disproportionately black brown and poor white individuals whose life chances have been crushed by instititutionalized racism they are racism institutionalized in a literal manifestation of the abstract term.  Thus, prisons condemn to death black and brown prisoners with indifference daily.
Black lives matter.  Depopulate the prisons.

2020-08-18 19:09,"It is because of China. More specifically, it is because China's  successes against COVID have been largely unmentionable by the US government and the US media. We refuse to acknowledge the effectiveness of a rational, science based response undertaken by country of a billion plus souls. I believe that this has been a huge obstacle in mounting our own successful response. When faced with science doubters, economic alarmists and mask refusers, we have been unwilling to say, ""Look, we know these measures work, we know they are economically survivable, we know that we can mitigate this terrible pandemic, because it worked in China, not just a tiny island nation like New Zealand, but China. Therefore it will work here"". The virus is bound by physics and biology and any effective measures must take into account the same. We must not let ideological differences confuse us around the appropriate response. Perhaps this analogy will help. Let's say that a bitter pill has to be swallowed to cure an illness. One parent might cajole, another bribe, while a third holds the child's nose so that she must swallow. We might disagree over which parental approach is best, but we must not lose sight of the need for the medicine."

2020-08-18 19:40,"Mandatory isolation orders for those who test positive are essential. Australia and similarly advanced countries use them. It’s not the number of tests alone that matters, it is what a country does with the testing data. If positive test recipients immediately go back to work, thereby sickening and killing coworkers, no disease containment will ever occur, and death rates will continue to spin out of control.  Governors are too weak to enforce such orders. Must come from the federal government.  Australia uses this technique, and police contact positive test recipients to make sure they are where they should be, at home.  Australia pays people not covered by sick leave.

Further, the federal government needs to team up with Yale University School of Medicine to immediately promulgate the new saliva test developed at Yale.  Saliva tests are almost as accurate as the nasal swab, have same day results, and speed in testing matters, so that the sick can be isolated.

Finally, as Dr. Fauci has stated, all bars need to close indoor service.

These are elementary no-brainer steps that would immediately help.  Of course, America has become a nation of partiers, people willing to gamble their lives away for no reason.

In addition, the lack of masking and social distancing together with reckless openings of hot spots has destroyed our ability to contain this contagion.  the knowledge of how to do this is not new.

I often speak about a ""high degree of assurance, not absolute assurance."" Absolute assurance is never possible, and I hope FDA's critics aren't holding them to this impossible standard.

We are in difficult times now. One of FDA's responsibilities is to assure that a biologic (like plasma) works against the target disease.  If plasma isn't therapeutic against Covid-19, propose a proven alternative. There isn't one. 

We don't want people to take ineffective drug products, because it's a waste of time and money. It also prolongs suffering, particularly if an effective product is available.

Finally, many drug products were discovered by serendipity, i.e., a ""desirable discovery found by accident."" Just look at Pfizer's Viagra...it was originally intended for the heart and major vessels nearby. The ""side effect"" became the benefit!

The science of the transfer of virus from animals to humans has been proved. There will be more pandemics originating from China as long as China’s livestock industry is unregulated.

China’s export-driven economy, built on using a large pool of cheap labor which has driven most competitors out of the export market, has amassed a fortune of US$3.12 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves since the early 1970s.

There must be a debate at the WHO and UN on the damage and destruction caused by China’s gift to the world that keeps on giving and is taking away and destroying lives and world economies.

Indeed, with almost four years of the Trump administration, we as Americans had our share of information roadblock as National Security Agency to the venerable American CDC withholding or eliding important but inconvenient information ranging from bounty on American soldiers in the Middle East to the insanity over hydroxychloroquine and face masks.

Furthermore, the recruitment problem for clinical trials for convalescent plasmas would get much worse once FDA gives an emergency use authorization for such treatments. After the emergency authorization, it would become much more difficult for double-blind clinical trials to recruit new patients, for no one interested in getting it would want to face the possibility of being given only placebos by enrolling in a double-blind clinical trial anymore.

2020-08-19 22:02,"University of Pittsburgh today sent out a scolding letter to its students that basically said, ""don't ruin this for everyone else"" and also announced extension of online only until mid September.

2020-08-19 21:46,"Not trying to sound dark but I’m thinking those Wuhan scientists will be part of China’s next “Real Bodies” exhibit. 
Just a guess."
2020-08-19 21:12,"What seems clear is young people are fueling spread of the virus. If I was a teacher you couldn't pay me enough to go back in the classroom right now, and comparing teachers to Navy Seals is ludicrous.

Teachers are already over-worked, underpaid and many use their own money to help poor students. Putting a gun to their heads and forcing teachers back into classroom in a pandemic is way above and beyond their call of duty."
2020-08-19 21:59,"Like the evils emanating from Pandora’s Box, the virus is out of the civet and in the world. It doesn’t matter much who covered up what and back-guessing about what Beijing knew, didn’t know, covered up, opened up, and when and where it was first done is really no longer important. This country must do everything it can anchored in the best scientific research, and stop knee-jerk attention and reactions to every crackpot idea coming out of Trump and his administration. Focusing attention and anger on China gives play to more distractions: do people really think China will pay “reparations” for a disease that could arguably have started in New York City? Do we really think the US government will sanction China? Let us not be drawn into this silly story like our President will be, instead let us focus on ensuring our children, parents, teachers, healthcare workers, and everyone in our communities is as safe as possible, knows as much as possible about keeping healthy, and support the challenged in every way."
2020-08-19 22:25,"The article should correct or clarify Cuomo's misstatement: he apparently meant to say either, ""We were wrong [to suggest] that people who didn't have symptoms COULDN'T infect other people,"" or ""We [didn't yet understand] that people who didn't have symptoms COULD infect other people.""

Unfortunately, in the heat of the moment he combined the two in an illogical mishmash."
2020-08-19 22:30,"Does revelation that the officials in Wuhan hid the beginnings of the Covid-19 outbreak from higher authorities in Beijing surprise anyone still?
       More than just that--- just exactly where and how did the virus appear?  Was it in the wet section of the Wuhan market, or was it in a petri dish in a top-secret lab in Biohazard Safety Level 4 government institute?
        That seems to be the playbook in repressive regimes: keep the people in a need-to-know-basis. Venezuela and Philippines stand out.
         The Great Leader --- as he is referred to by a newspaper columnist --- assembled a cabinet of ministers who are retired military generals and a sprinkling of university academics. Thus it seems that the government was gearing to wage war against dissenters, drug syndicates, leftist activists, and terrorists.
          The few academics and medical doctors who have knowledge of the science of epidemiology and infectious diseases had muted voices. Spokespersons put on a ""business-as-usual"" and ""we-have-your-back""  cheerful mien.         
           Pandemics, cover-ups, corruption, rising mortality and hopelessness are almost foregone outcomes of repressive regimes anywhere. Very sad."
2020-08-19 23:21,"Excuse me, but in order to “...undermine the nation’s Covid-19 response...” wouldn’t we really need to have a national response first?"
2020-08-19 23:33,Its been 4 weeks since trump promised the latest republican health plan. Can’t wait to see it.
2020-08-19 23:05,Regarding the school re-openings: did anyone really expect a different outcome?!
2020-08-20 0:11,"Of course the GOP is trying to cut coronavirus assistance to ordinary Americans.   What else would anybody expect of them?   They have jobs, incomes, long vacations, and superior health insurance.  

SO:  What would ever move the Trumpists to think beyond themselves and the election:   Nothing and nobody else matters to the GOP."
2020-08-19 22:37,"If DeBlasio and Carranza had closed the schools two weeks earlier than they did, quite a number of people would still be alive today. The self righteous stubbornness, especially of Richard Carranza, cost lives and it will do so again. What New York has achieved in controlling Covid can disappear overnight. And no one is talking about the impact hundreds of thousands of children, teachers, and staff will have on public transportation. Exactly how are all these kids and adults getting to school? What preparation has NYC made for that?"
2020-08-20 0:37,"Whatever the details about who kept what from whom in China, the fact remains that the most corrupt Administration in this nation's history had plenty of information, and early enough, to act to contain the virus.

That did not happen, and in fact the actions taken by the Trump Administration can easily be construed as assisting the spread of the virus broadly into the US population."
2020-08-20 0:32,"If you're not willing to take a year off to save your life, don't complain if you die.

Those willing to take the risk need to stop bullying people who value life more than money. 

Some of us would rather trust the science than put our faith in political decisions made for the benefit of a few."
2020-08-20 0:39,"So, Trump was right, that China hid important evidence from scrutiny. That cost American lives. The news media and the American people should be outraged that China did that! It wasn't just in the US, it was all over the world. The WHO defended China. Trump was correct in pulling out of the WHO. There needs to be a reckoning for the news media because they bolstered the negative reactions against Trump. What else are the news media networks wrong aboiut?"
2020-08-19 14:31,I used to think the US was exceptional. It is - just in a very different way I imagined.
2020-08-20 0:57,"Strongmen are no leaders, and in an interconnected world, demagogues pose global risks.  That is what the China's opaqueness about the pandemic and the US indifference to its spread within our shores should remind us of.  

It is silly to think that we can shield ourselves from dangerous pathogens that can travel around the world in a few hours on flights that can transport people from one corner of the world to another.  Instead we rely on open communication, trust and some level of internal mitigation to stop and control the spread of wider damage.  

Trump clearly failed the litmus test of leadership (surprise !) and we defeat him in this election.  Our health care system was found to be lacking in basic fire fighting skills and so as an electorate we demand it be fixed.

What about China though ?  How is it going to be held accountable ?  

In the aftermath of this pandemic, Xi has increased his stranglehold even more.  That means his party subordinates are even less likely than before to share information with the central bureau due to fear of reprisals.  In a country known to be the source of many infectious diseases and dangerous pathogens, is this not dangerously alarming ?

How can we knowingly continue to allow flights from China? What if ?"
2020-08-20 1:58,"My friend’s relative teaches at one of the Georgia schools featured in the news recently. He has asthma and is very sick with Covid-19 now. I am very angry that dedicated teachers were placed in harm’s way.

Yes, opening the schools is a huge priority. With able leadership, we could have planned for that, worn masks, gotten the numbers down, and done it safely."
2020-08-20 2:17,"Opening of schools and especially colleges and universities will be an unmitigated disaster. 
The college kids arty and spread the virus to the vulnerable. It’s as if they were perpetrators of germ warfare."
2020-08-20 3:35,"Pre-pandemic Public school buildings were woefully neglected and maintained only through the grit, creativity and personal investments made by teachers, staff and parents to supply basic necessities like hand soap.
Many teachers and principals are parents of school aged children themselves. Teaching remotely will not be easy for them as they will have to simultaneously supervise their own children while they learn remotely. If they are not willing to send their own kids into these buildings why would anyone else think it’s safe?
The big take away here should be that under investment of public schools has resulted in school buildings that were barely safe prior to this pandemic. Hopefully we can look forward to a future in which we value our children’s health, safety, social, emotional and academic development and think of school as more than free child care."
2020-08-20 9:01,"As a retired teachers, I considered myself an essential worker. Now as others are taking steps to ensure the safety and well being for all, many teachers and the union are clearly interested in one thing, teachers. If schools are open and teachers refuse to work are the going to expect to be paid, and should the community Pat their health insurance?"
2020-08-20 10:24,"So new cases are declining?  Fake news. Testing is declining. Real news. The dissemination of information should be consolidated within the Democratic Party, coordinated just like the republicans do. Their voice is very effective because they stay on message. I hear so much garbled information/nonsense from the Democrats that I tune it out. Black issues are important but not the only important issue. Trying to win the black vote by constantly harassing others is not a winning formula.  Believe me. It is getting old."
2020-08-20 9:47,"Emergency approval of plasma by the FDA for antiviral treatment of newly infected persons could aid the immune system of the infected individual's own immune system to come up to speed. As long as the plasma is free of any infectious agents, it should do no harm to the recipient. It is called prophylaxis or passive immunization. The plasma can be given in combination with remdesivir following suspected exposure or confirmed positive symptomatic or asymptomatic stage. I have no idea why the experts are ganging up on the FDA.

Time is of the essence and saving lives should always be a priority and in doing so preventing virus from using the lungs as fodder and slowly destroying its functionality should be avoided at all cost. Have not learned enough in the 8 months that the pandemic has killed over half a million around the globe and 170,000 in the USA alone that we have limited ammunition. Further limiting the treatments that could benefit some because it will not benefit all is unfair to those who can benefit. FDA should approve the germ-free plasma treatment and let the decision to administer or not administer it to the infectious disease specialist who is entrusted with ensuring the survival of the patient. 

Why did Russia approve a vaccine to prevent Coronavirus 2?They felt that it was safe and effective for their people. They knew that they cannot wait until cows come home to contain the virus spread. They don't have to wait for US FDA approval. Is the FDA perfect?"
2020-08-20 8:53,"The coming tsunami of eviction, foreclosure, homelessness, and hunger will just make this disease spread like wildfire. Homeless people cannot wash their hands, wear masks, or socially distance. A whole lot more people will get sick. The social unrest unleashed will make the George Floyd protests seem like a stroll in the park.

Are Republicans, faced with a coming big defeat in 2020, trying to sabotage the whole nation now so they can blame Democrats for the mess in 2024? They're sure doing a good job of that."
2020-08-20 3:35,"Strike, strike, strike!

Teachers must hold a nationwide strike against unsafe working conditions for themselves, their students and staff.

Striking for safe working conditions is a right in this country and should never take back seat to politicians and their desire to unsafely reopen the economy.

Solidarity will be the only force that will drive decision makers to do the right things to defeat this virus and lead the nation back from the precipice of catastrophe, sickness and unimaginable deaths."
2020-08-20 7:32,"Obama could not have prevented the explosion  of Coronavirus across the USA. Our nation is too fractured, mostly thanks to employer sponsored health insurance,  a form of employer and insurer oppression marketed as a benefit, and it's gladly accepted by naive workers for the significant income and payroll tax savings. This ship is going down."
2020-08-20 9:18,"""Medical products that may be considered for an EUA are those that ""may be effective"" to prevent, diagnose, or treat serious or life-threatening diseases [...] The ""may be effective"" standard for EUAs provides for a lower level of evidence than the ""effectiveness"" standard that FDA uses for product approvals"" (FDA guidelines on EUA)

“The three of us are pretty aligned on the importance of robust data through randomized control trials, and that a pandemic does not change that”

Shameful."
2020-08-20 9:39,"All schools need to be online for the next academic year.  There is nothing to debate.  Teachers need to stream live lessons thru Zoom or similar platform from their homes and parents need to make sure their kids have internet and are connected, if you can't provide basics like that for your kids you really should not have kids."
2020-08-20 5:52,Have we (the country) seen any COVID figures related to the quarter of a million motorcycle rally in South Dakota? Could some of the college figures be related to that two week event? Not that college age students spend much time on motorcycles...
2020-08-20 7:33,"I am so lucky to not have children and live in a state that isn’t demanding schools reopen or give up their funding. We’ve worked so hard to stay home and if these types of policies are pushed, everything we’ve already sacrificed is for nothing.

2020-08-17 14:08,LA Unified School District is starting testing of students and staff but why is there no mention of how the data will be analyzed and what will be done with the metrics? Will it be used to help reopen schools? Or will the teachers union use the data as a political football?
2020-08-17 14:02,"Republican logic at its best—

It is safe to reopen schools.

Barron Trump will stay home until the pandemic is over."
2020-08-17 13:48,"How despicable and decadent! If you are rich enough or politically well connected you can get a rapid test to ease your fears that you may have Covid-19-but if you are a teacher or a bus driver or a care giver in a Nursing Home you don’t have that luxury.You mask up and isolate and keep your fingers crossed and hope that you neither get nor give the infection.Trump and his minions are tested frequently-that is why they are dismissive of the virus’s danger.If Trump doesn’t allow people to vote by mail, how about equipping all polling places with rapid tests so people will feel safe voting in person-average people should have the same protection fromCoronavirus that the rich and famous do!"

2020-08-17 13:39,Well this announced LAUSD mass testing plan sounds intriguing.  Maybe something like a cross between picture day at school and getting a copy of the mandated TB test results into the right hand downtown to keep ones status cleared.  Schlepping over to Kaiser to get the TB test was easy compared to trying to get my special ed students to sit still for the camera and smile with their misshapen faces to the satisfaction of the portrait taker.  I can’t wait to see their reaction to that long swab up their noses.
2020-08-17 15:44,"I'm a teacher with LAUSD.  The bureaucracy can get a lot of things wrong.  They're getting this right.  Bravo.

trump party: this is what leadership looks like."
2020-08-17 16:17,"California, and indeed Los Angeles  County itself does not have anything that resembles an effective contact tracing  system. The idea that LAUSD can implement an effective testing system of its 700,000 students, teachers, staff and administrators in daunting! 

Going back to in person education should be voluntary for teachers and students. It should require that the immediate families of those who want their kids in in-person school be part of the testing as well. Failure to respond to  contact tracing and Covid-19 safety procedures should result in the immediate removal of these students and families from in person education. 

The second largest school district has significant challenges just performing its core functions. Let’s not add more responsibilities. With thousands of unemployed people the County, City and State should put the systems and resources in place manage this gargantuan task. 

That a School Superintendent steps up to offer solutions due to the lack of real leadership in other government areas is no surprise but let’s get real."
2020-08-17 16:37,"So too many believe our President, who isn’t a doctor but plays one on TV, over the real men and women who study and toil for years to earn the expertise to care for the lives of the people who come to them for help? 

Trump really has convinced people that he is the only one who understands them, the only one who can save them. He has made himself into their only hope.

Seems to me that they have fallen for a false idol. And the President has set himself up to be that golden calf. 

Unfortunately, we are all harmed by this idol worship since those who don’t believe the virus is real can still spread it to those of us who trust our doctors."
2020-08-17 16:52,"Humans have always had the tendency to believe what they want to hear.  The difference is that in the good old days, if you went to your doctor and he gave you medical advice, you accepted it unless you went for a second opinion, in which case you almost always accepted what one or the other doctor advised.  Doctors didn't have to worry that when the patient left the office he/she would be bombarded with, or look for contrary advise from, non-professionals or professionals with no responsibility for treating individual patients.  Doctors need to have discussions with their patients to preempt their exposure to the tons of  misinformation about there, and not just about coronavirus.  And that probably will only have a limited effect.   TMMI (too much mis-information) is a real problem."
2020-08-17 16:54,"That doctor is wearing a mask with a valve, which, according to everything I've heard protects the wearer but not people nearby.  Pretty shocking."

Wh? They pick the goofy narrative they want to believe, then grey claim they are being skeptical. Yet these same people are too lazy or ill informed to do proper research. The more sound information you present to them the more they dig in their heels since they cannot admit they have been duped.

We are unable to discern bad information, we believe conspiracy theories and junk science without thinking about the source, we have little understanding of how politics and democracy works and too many of us don’t even know how to register to vote among other things. 

Furthermore, we are not producing capable citizens that are employable for the 21st century.

Recently there have been articles on antibodies barely being around for three months. Aerosol distribution that sounds alarming. And folks talk of vaccinations and herd immunity in the same breath. I am at a loss as a watcher outside research, the medical community or thankfully the so far suffering population of covid positive folks. I only hope the discordant information is due to the inability of news writing folks to patiently tease out the data in a systematic manner and convey it simply. Can someone not connected to big pharma or politics, please write an intelligible article on what is understood about this disease?

As someone who believes in some of the amazing vaccines, I also have a healthy disregard for the recent call to get the influenza vaccine. How do we know that it will not leave us protected against some strains of influenza but more vulnerable to covid. Show me the data from last winter where folks had the influenza vaccine and had only covid, or had no illness. Till then I will not be in any hurry to take any vaccine touted by any present governmental organizations. 

Democrats, please all our lives depend on it, please get behind one coherent plan for all Democrat controlled states. Shut schools down. Analyze all the available data."
2020-08-17 16:58,"New York, including NYC, have been especially fortunate not to have had a resurgence of covid-19.  It is almost a miracle when you read what is going on in the states around them.  What I see Governor Cuomo doing is like being on a diet.  Say you have lost the 100 pound that has been threatening your life.  First you have an Italian dinner, and a wonderful desert, just once, and you don’t gain weight.  Then you add two calorie heavy dinners to your diet three times a week, and ad a pancake breakfast only once on week ends.  One night you open a forbidden bag of chips intending to eat only a few, and before you know it the bag is consumed.  And so goes the growth of your calorie intake, and your road back to obesity. Without stopping your high calorie intake you are doomed.  That is the way I see what is happening in NY. When  I just read that gyms will now reopen,  and it is expected schools will reopen, and even I have enjoyed eating at a few restaurants more than a few times with other people without our masks, because we wouldn’t be able to chew, something is going to happen. It is my opinion that by Halloween, right before Election Day, covid-19 will be back.  Just as too many calories will make a person who has lost weight fat again, covid is going to attack all of those people educated in mitigation, who say   
to themselves they are safe again.  I hope Governor Cuomo knows something that defies logic.  He seems very wise."

A reputable medical site is just as easy to access as those purveying some miracle unproven cure (such as the latest; oleander extract). 

Only last week The Times reported on individuals who refused to wear mask, claiming that if they became infected, it was God's will.   I don't believe it is God's will that I become infected from their careless actions so I will avoid them as should anyone else with a grain of common sense and any sense of patriotism."

I asked her about it and she said she had had Covid already and that there was no evidence she could get it again. 

She told me masks don’t really work, and that the most important thing was that I take 25 mg of zinc daily and other “immune boosters.” 

She was asymptomatic, so didn’t know she had had it until many months later, when she did antibody testing. She says three in the practice tested positive. This is a very large and established practice in an area of 500,000 people. It sent out no emails or letters to patients about the situation. 

On NextDoor in our city, there are medical techs, phlebotomists, etc. telling people not to worry -- some of them have also had Covid and says “it’s not a big deal.”

When medical professionals spread disinformation, which they are on the internet, too, this is highly problematic."

2020-08-17 17:20,"From a book titled ""A World Lit Only by Fire"" - by William Manchester 


""The Densest of the medieval centuries—the six hundred years between, roughly, A.D. 400 and
A.D. 1000—are still widely known as the Dark Ages.

[...]

...literacy was scorned; when a cardinal corrected the Latin of the emperor Sigismund,
Charlemagne’s forty-seventh successor, Sigismund rudely replied, “Ego sum rex Romanus et super grammatica”—as “king of Rome,” he was “above grammar.”

[...]

...it is undeniable that most of what is known about the period is unlovely. After the extant
fragments have been fitted together, the portrait which emerges is a mélange of incessant warfare,
corruption, lawlessness, obsession with strange myths, and an almost impenetrable mindlessness.

The Dark Ages were stark in every dimension. Famines and plague, culminating in the plague and its recurring pandemics, repeatedly thinned the population. Rickets afflicted the survivors. 

Extraordinary climatic changes brought storms and floods...

[...]

2020-08-17 17:20,"There is a lot of misconceptions about herd immunity including the thought that it is a threshold - when in fact it is a continuous variable.  

The concept is mathematically very simple.  Let's say the characteristics of the virus (infectivity) and our human behavior (masks, distancing etc.) makes for a situation where every 100 infected people transfer the virus to 125 other people.  If 20% of the population are immune then that would only be 100 ""productive"" transfers.  If 40% of the population are immune then it would only be 75 productive (disease causing) transfers for every 100 new infections.  

So the larger the % of immune protected individuals the more help from herd immunity in bringing down R0.  If R0 is below 1.00 we have a waning epidemic, if it is above then we have a growing epidemic.  Anything that can bring R0 down is helpful no matter where it was and where it ends up.  So any level of herd immunity is helpful.  But immunity is just one of the things that affects R0.  Masks, social distancing, hand washing and isolation are other tools that can bring R0 down.  If we give up on those, then the % infected/protected needed to control the epidemic will be much higher.  

Let's not forget the there is no proof that protective immunity will last more than 3 months.   So we may need 90% of the population to get COVID-19 about 4 times a year in order to provide us all the ""freedom"" from masks."

Meanwhile, the most disastrous President in our history bloviates, preens and brags about the great job he’s done. 

All that blather about ‘securing the border’ is now a long-forgotten, pathetic joke. The rest of the world has closed its borders  to us, the pervasively diseased residents of the United States. We’ve become the pariahs now; our nation is a fallen idol incapable of even delivering the mail and holding a fair, open election if our President and his cynical, corrupt entourage get their way.

Make a deal.

Every inmate who donates blood/plasma after he got infected and fought off the disease gets his penalty reduced by 10%. It's not as outlandish as it sounds, giving your own blood for society and community should count as ""good behavior"", which is a valid reason to reduce a sentence.

2020-08-17 21:46,"Enough with this talk of ""herd immunity"".

First, no immunity is imparted. Repeat, no immunity is imparted. This has nothing to do with immunity, it has to do with complex and arcane calculations of probability of infection. This 'solution"" to COVID19 is not a solution at all. It is an unfeeling ,amoral, acceptance of continued contagion, illness and death. As more people get infected they either die or they may attain some form of temporary/semi-permanent immunity. (They MAY attain we don't know for sure yet.) Contagion rates slow down because the virus has more difficulty finding an victim.
It will continue to live until it infects every living being and the new born as well. We haven't killed the virus, just learned to live (and die) with it.
Second: Before this ""solution"" ensues, many members of the ""herd"" will die, many more will suffer consequence of the illness not yet fully understood. These include but are not limited to: heart inflammation, brain damage, strokes, and limb amputation. Yes, older and co-morbid patients die in greater numbers but the young are not immune to any degree. In the US thousands below age 60 have died and as yet uncounted thousands suffer from the above side-effects.

Any discussion of this mislabeled ""solution"" is premature and should be confined to those responsible for planning for the contingency of vaccine unavailability.

1) They'll get some money from students being on campus. Even if they end up refunding most students fees and room and board, students will still have been there for a couple weeks spending money at food courts, the book store, etc., and that's better than nothing. And they'll have lured some students to register with the promise of face-to-face classes who wouldn't have done it for online classes, and those students will stick around and finish the semester online once they've already put a couple weeks of work in.

2) They'll be able to blame the students for going online, since it will have been the irresponsible behavior of the students that precipitates the move. That way, the administration could avoid being the ""bad guy"" and can say, ""We tried to give you what you wanted, but you screwed it up."""

2020-08-20 9:59,"How predictable can you get?   Dance companies try and fail.  Schools try and fail.  Wake up kids...there is no way to have what we are used to having now.  This virus will win every time until there is a safe and effective vaccine.  Meanwhile ALL need to mask, distance and wash hands.  ALL Businesses, Banks, etc.  need to require masks on in their premises.  No MASK, NO ENTRANCE, as simple as that.  Discipline, maturity,  intelligence  and willingness to support the Greater Good , even if the maskis slightly uncomfortable to you,  may save your life and the lives of your loved ones. Ignoring this required regimen, for ANY reason, only strengthens the virus and puts all, including yourself at greater risk of infection and lifelong impairment IF you manage to survive.

This is a matter of life and death, dear dancers and everyone else.  You have very little choice here if you want to remain in your  fully functional and now very fit physical body. This virus does not care who you are, what you do , or  how much you want to continue doing it.  Sorry..that is just the way it is...like any other pandemic, warfare, natural disaster.  This requires surrender to the situation and adaptation to the realities of the time.  You will not succeed with half way measures that meet your need for convenience or habit.  How much do you want to stay healthy?

And, by the way, in 1965, when I was in Nursing School at Cornell U., we learned that a sneeze carries viral particles 30 feet...so this myth about 6 feet being effective distancing is nonsense and has been since the very start of this COVID-19 time.  Just like all the absurd public health messages that masks WERE NOT REALLY HELPFUL!!!!!....Had we all been masked in March a lot more people would still be alive today.  A mask may save your life if you wear it properly....and distance yourself from others as much as possible...go the distance!"

2020-08-18 14:00,"I am very much looking forward to nearly every college in America being sued for being myopically stupid. 

Tens of thousands of kids/parents are spending money to move to campus. Within 3 weeks, Universities will be forced to shut down for off-site learning for at least the fall semester. All those kids will be forced off campus at their own expense and suffer serious disruption to their academic year. 

There will also be lawsuits, that Universities will lose, related to Universities not fulfilling their obligations. The University of Michigan's law school was sued by a student who wanted money back because of snow closures. He argued that he paid for X number of classes, and that he shouldn't pay for classes that weren't held. Guess what. He won. 

This is going to be far worse for universities than they are acknowledging."

Yes."
2020-08-18 14:04,"You should have written an update on the University of Washington story. The outbreak happened in late June and is actually a success story.  The same 1000 kids have continued living on campus and the outbreak was contained.  The rest of the summer has been fine with limited to zero cases.  This shows that testing, tracing and containment strategies can work. Why focus on only the outbreak when the full story is actually good news?"

2020-08-18 16:23,"The frat and sorority problem is just a symptom of two bigger problems.

One, the universities feel compelled to open in order to retain their income stream, and/or (as is the case in North Carolina) due to ideological pressure from Republican governing boards.

Two, because of the lack of federal leadership, which has trickled down into the state capitol offices, there is no budgetary relief that could be used to fund responsible opening plans. What university would seriously consider opening without testing every single student, and then isolating them until a negative result was returned? Answer:  one without the funding to test to that extent, or to isolate effectively. 

The conditions have been ripe for universities to chart their own path. The results are not surprising - some have credible plans, many do not."
2020-08-18 14:56,"I have always been of the view that fraternities should be abolished.  They have always been organizations that are based on the pillars of exclusion, bias, and misbehavior.  Not only that, but these reprehensible pillars are unabashedly embraced by those who join the fraternities.  

Fraternities license their members to get drunk and engage in generally antisocial behavior (excessive noise being the most benevolent example).  It is time to abolish them once and for all.  Whatever causes this happy result is fine with me.  They are allowing COVID to spread, they perpetuate racism, they encourage the destruction of property, they promote activities like binge drinking that kill people.  

Universities should be held liable in negligence for even allowing fraternities, let alone allowing them the kind of conduct in which their members are allowed (and encouraged) to engage."

Well, here's a bulletin from Port Angeles, WA, a small town three hours from UW. One of our stupider citizens attended the notorious frat party, picked up a viral souvenir, and brought it back to our town.    Our rural county, with limited medical resources, and home to several Native American tribes, is now a Covid hotspot. 

That kid is not responsible for all, or even most, of Clallam County's cases. Plenty of local bars, restaurants, families, and churches have shown a terrible lack of judgement regarding the epidemic. But the good fraternity brothers of UW played a part in a distant tragedy whose victims they will never know."

Frats sometimes like to give the impression that they’re worth something through activities such as meager efforts at volunteering. When I went to UMaine, they were known for rape and as a source of drugs for the college population.

And if you’ve been to one frat party, you’ve been to all of them. Hundreds of people in a cramped room, a sticky floor, watered-down drinks, and music so loud you can’t have a conversation without yelling.

Are you kidding? You cannot prevent tightly packed sorority and fraternity houses from turning into virus clusters. Shut them down. Period.

Ethically wrong to do otherwise."
2020-08-18 16:30,"It is simply not the case that a college/university cannot control behavior at a fraternity/sorority.  The traditional barrier has been concern about upsetting alumni, not minor issues like who owns the property.   In this case, if an institution wants to aggressively manage their Greek system, no holds are barred.  Kicking out a fraternity after some freshman drinks themselves to death has worked to control hazing on several campuses.  Seems like making an example of one of the jock frats might be better than having to send everyone home to learn on video."

They keep on doing or working. At some point, we have to understand the foundational freedoms of our country and develop policies that meet people in the middle.

Not that schools or sororities needed that recommendation to know what to do. They’ve chosen to do the wrong thing, and I know that a good many of the healthy young girls I see walking in groups, no one masked, will soon be sick. I’m a nurse; I have an adult daughter who works on campus. This irresponsibility and selfishness makes me ill, too."
2020-08-18 16:48,"As an older person that was not in a sorority in college, I still find it a little bit laughable that many commenters here act as though Greek life is the only possible group of young people acting irresponsibly on or off campus and also as though they were never young themselves.

Please, fellow boomers, remember the 60’s."
2020-08-18 16:34,"Seems as if universities need to involve the national headquarters of these fraternities and sororities, and make it clear that a house which violates health and safety protocols will be shut down and that chapter will be banned from campus."
2020-08-18 16:38,"Are there really any informed people who believe it is possible to produce a vaccine that's safer for college students than actually getting the virus has proven to be? If not, then the type of insular households made up by the Geek system could be good not bad in allowing the virus to work its way toward community immunity without exposing vulnerable populations.

If you did further research you would see that the girls participating in sorority rush were masked.  I am not sure how Covid will play out at college campuses-there will be cases, but I know UA has a plan in place  with testing and contact tracing that will hopefully help the spread of cases.  These are unprecedented times and the sororities are doing the best they can under these circumstances.  It is not business as usual!"
2020-08-18 17:01,"I recently graduated from college and lived in a sorority house. When a few students had a cold or the flu, within two weeks, at least a fifth of the sorority house was sick. The people who partied with us also got sick. Anyone who has recently lived in a tightly packed dorm can relate to this.

Dorms, especially sorority and fraternity houses, are cesspools. Kids share food and drink, makeup and clothes, and sneeze and cough on each other. Covid won’t change those

Unfortunately, kids will be kids—the onus was and is on the adults in the room to be adults, rather than engage in magical thinking. The colleges are in deep trouble now. They assumed community spread would be lower and that the states would have ratcheted up testing. They planned for the best rather than hoping for the best but planning for the worst. Now school admin is looking to pass the buck to the kids. Not a good look. Even if students strictly abided by the proposed mitigation tactics, outbreaks would surely occur within dorms. The colleges rightfully feared their budgets being decimated by a lack of tuition income if students failed to arrive this fall. The colleges and surrounding communities will pay dearly for admins’ hubris."
2020-08-18 15:15,OMG what do they expect? All the schools can do is protect staff. Or *should.*
2020-08-18 18:13,"Wow, so much sanctimoniousness and finger-pointing both in the story and in these comments. 

Greek houses are no different than dorms, packing students in to small spaces and close quarters. If schools decide to reopen to on-campus, in-person instruction, members of fraternity and sorority life will move into their housing. If the colleges don't like it, they shouldn't have opened."

I guess a lot of these kids will graduate Summa Cum Covid."

2020-08-18 15:14,This is why I’m not going back on campus this fall... stupid people in fraternity and sorority are going to have their “corona reunion parties” from Monday to Sunday now that most classes are online. I remember last Spring seeing many Corona-themed parties on campus even as thousands were infected in Europe and elsewhere on a daily base. Such lack of basic human decency and common sense is even more alarming since mine is one of the Ivy-leagues. To think that these rich frats are one day going to become the “leaders” of our society as the college advertised!
2020-08-18 17:08,"Here's a thought - maybe frats have outlived whatever usefulness they used to have. From this stupidity to the misogyny, to the racism, to the hazing, need I go on? These are clubs that bring out the worst in people and colleges and universities should just shut them down."
2020-08-18 14:08,"Here's a thought. Forget rush. If someone wants to join, let them. Oh, but wait. That's what it's all about. Exclusion. Keeping out all but the mainstream. Drinking, hazing, and in too many cases, sexual harrassment and rape. As a high school teacher, when students returned for a visit after the first semester, I witnessed the broken hearts of those who weren't good enough or rich enough or besutiful/handsome enough to be chosen. Who needs that?!?!?!  I also heard the stories of the despicable behavior and the harm it caused.
Sorry. I know there are good kids in the greek life, but seriously, if we are looking to a more fair and just society, why have these exclusive clubs on campuses?"
2020-08-18 18:14,"All of this was totally foreseeable; the decisions to go ahead, with the colleges thinking they had it under control, totally irresponsible.  Next stop: the revolving door of opening and closing public schools."
2020-08-18 18:54,"Of all of these cases reported on campus, how many of these students ended up in the hospital? How severe were the cases? I'd really like to see more information as to how these numbers break down AFTER there are confirmed cases. It's clear people respond to this virus differently, some with life-threatening symptoms, other with more mild and short-lived symptoms. Of course just being tested positive means you can spread it, but are the universities requiring these students to quarantine for two weeks or more after they have tested positive?"
2020-08-18 17:02,"Why attribute reckless, base, immoral, and to say the least, immature human behaviors to a culture (Greek) that contributed so much good to civilizations across the world.  Libraries (Alexandria), for example, have been  a gathering place of scholastic knowledge.  The purpose of a fraternity or a sorority, the basis for their existence, is their self proclaimed shared initiatives of scholarship, leadership development, service to others and fellowship among members, presumably all for well being and not harm of anyone involved.  To this end, they have applied for and been recognized as self governing bodies in educational communities.  They stated a commitment to values we cherish.   

The purpose and, no doubt,  good work that many fraternities and sororities commit to do and achieve, unfortunately, is overshadowed by  the corrosive behaviors of dangerous fools among their members.  The frats are not being frats, Mr. Richards.  As you describe them, they are the antithesis of frats, and you are a poor spokesman for your university in my opinion.  

Sororities and fraternities shouldn't be identified  pejoratively as  ""Greek system"" and ""Greek life"" anywhere and certainly not in the media.  If the authors want to  talk about sorority or fraternity-based lifestyle, say it.  These writers know nothing about ""Greek system"" and ""Greek life"", and to give it such negative meaning in this context is inexcusable.  

Talk about college student social life responsibly please."
2020-08-18 17:48,"If you think you are going to escape this virus, I ask you how many of your friends, family and acquaintances have lived even a single year without suffering at least one case of common cold or influenza. Public health authorities have pretended nothing different - social distancing and masks are meant to slow the spread of Covid so that hospitals are not overwhelmed. Even with a vaccine, it is doubtful that more than a small minority of people will forever avoid this disease.

At the same time, according to an expert quoted just the other day, the mortality rate for Covid is not much better than for the Spanish Flu of 1919, when there were no ICUs or ventilators. Not surprising when you consider that most people do not die from the illness even when completely untreated, and for those suffering a severe case, the ventilator may only prolong the inevitable.

These young people are indeed thoughtless and reckless, but to lay the blame on them for future deaths and debilities is out of line.  As it is, the world they will enter will in many ways be a sad shadow of what previous generations enjoyed.  No need to cast them as junior grim reapers just because they went to a party. 

Especially when so many 'essential workers' have gotten sick, and sometimes died, providing goods and services for all you virtuous people who have the privilege of sheltering in place."
2020-08-18 17:13,"I still don’t understand why these things are supported by colleges in the first place. I went to College to learn, not to waste my time with parties, drugs, and hazing rituals. At my Wife’s pharmacy school, it was well known that the frats all existed to help each other cheat their way through the next test. I expect that behavior is widespread. They’re probably looking for ways to cheat on their Covid tests too so they can keep the parties going."
2020-08-18 19:54,"According to the book ""Class,"" 80% of college students attend institutions that, although they call themselves ""colleges,"" do NOT offer college-level courses.  As long as these fake ""colleges"" exist, they will continue to be populated by students who do not have the ability to do college-level work and are there for mainly a social experience.

Given the watered-down courses and low admissions standards of these colleges, it is no surprise that most college graduates are poorly educated.  However, as Malcolm X showed when he self-educated himself in prison, to become educated requires only the reading of good books and practice emulating their writing style -- all of which any intelligent person can and should do on their own.

Unlike K-12 education, there is no need for the nation's colleges to serve as a warehousing system (so that parents can go off to work) or to pander to students' desires for socialization.  Therefore, with a few exceptions (such as laboratory courses), colleges should offer a strictly online course curriculum.  Then, even if the colleges' course content continues to be watered down to allow everyone to pass, at least the lack of socialization available in an online format will deter the unserious adolescent from enrolling."

2020-08-18 20:07,"I honestly don't understand how, in this day and age, the Greek system is still even a thing. Of what benefit are they? All they do is party, haze, harass, and be snobs. And now, apparently, they're a public health crisis. Someone please explain the 21st century appeal of fraternities and sororities to me."
2020-08-18 19:33,"On the problem of antisocial behavior (yes, it is) worsened by some members of some fraternities' and sororities' houses, writing an article with such broad and lax criteria as to use cultural terms like ""Greek system"" and ""Greek life"" where it can deepen negative bias or prejudice against a people, a culture or groups, like fraternities and sororities needs comment.

I get it.  I know the term is used to describe these groups in general and without bias.  But this article describes a particular subset of human behaviors that show stupidity, lack of self control, are base, mindless, dangerous, and paradoxical to the stated purpose and missions of fraternities and sororities.  

 If this article stated the positive purpose for these organizations it would help. I believe in general they exist and state formally their intention to promote scholarship, leadership, philanthropy and friendship through community service and social initiatives.  Because they are shared things highly valued traditionally, fraternities and sororities are recognized as self governing bodies in educational communities.  No doubt the majority of them follow through and achieve a lot of good.  But they will suffer condemnation for the corrosive damage of those members who are undermining their value from within if they don't demonstrate leadership here and now when its needed most.

The Greeks past on a lot of good things to civilizations, like libraries.  Folks behaving badly is not their fault."
2020-08-18 20:13,Oh for crying out loud if this is such a concern then cancel all in person classes for the semester!!!  It's not that hard to figure out.  People have to understand that it's not only sorority and fraternity houses you have to be concerned about.  College dormatories are prime spots for viruses to spread along large lecture halls.  Plus there are plenty of other places outside Greek life where students gather and mingle.
2020-08-18 21:24,"The solution is easy: simply shut them all down. No exceptions. Close them until the threat has diminished. Colleges and universities have one overarching goal: education.

2020-08-18 21:10,"This article states that “more than 13,000 students, faculty and staff members at colleges” have been infected and that the Times has identified at least 251 cases tied to Greek life. If I’m doing the math correctly that’s less than 2%. Fraternity and sorority culture has its problems, to be sure, but it feels like this article is trying to blame only these organizations for a much larger truth that we all saw coming: College life in general (in person classes, dorm living, dining halls) is ill suited to social distancing. The kids partying are being selfish and irresponsible but so are the university heads who knew this would happen and opened the doors anyway."
2020-08-18 19:27,"The frat alumni are so rich, powerful  and connected that universities are largely hobbled in controlling the ""Greek"" system (that whole anachronistic pseudo-Greek affectation is as tasteless and offensive now as it was in the days of Stover at Yale.)  

I won't go into the selfish, phony character of those who participate in these exclusionary little cults and their specious community service activities, but I don't have to. They speak (and act) for themselves. Not the most endearing set of upcoming little Babbits. 

So how much do they care if they make others sick? Answer: they care zero. As far as getting sick themselves, they are so used to being hungover, throwing up and passing out I honestly doubt they can tell the difference between a morning after and COVID-19.

It's also a fact that most frat rats et al hail from right-wing families to begin with, so they would be among those who deny the value of masking and social distancing. They are, I am sure, pumped full of conservative screed from home by this age. So they even believe they have valid rationales for following their whims.

2020-08-19 1:26,"In “Frats are Being Frats: Greek Life is Stoking the Virus on Some Campuses”, I was reminded of the aspects of college life that don’t revolve around education, and how they are being treated during the era of Covid-19.
As I watch some of my friends send their older siblings off to college, I have wondered what they are being sent into. How will classes be regulated and students be kept apart? In my high school, this seems easier, as controlling where students go is already done regularly. But in college? Where students are free to roam? It seemed stepping into an open campus environment like this would be risky. What I didn’t consider was the risks social life, like fraternities and sororities, would present as well.
“Greek Life” in schools around the country is active despite this risk. Colleges starting the school year both online and in class have people living in sorority and fraternity houses. Consequently, places like the University of Washington at Seattle have seen more than 50% of reported Covid cases coming from these places. Furthermore, as Matthew Hugley points out, “Fraternity and sorority homes have long functioned as a kind of ‘no-fly zone’ for university administrations,” (11), leaving them under little control.
Sorority and fraternity houses being “open” is unnecessarily risky. These spaces that appear to be Covid hot spots and are not regulated by universities are not a place I would spend my time in, especially during this pandemic."

In Oregon, the U of O, where I went, has weak Greek system. At OSU, it's a big deal. Like everything, it's yet one more thing that does not matter at all later in life, save for the very rare ""connections"" - probably a little overrated too. I am glad to hear about houses that help people in need, but it seems to me that these communities could be continued if the overall system were either abolished or reformed and regulated."
2020-08-19 8:15,"How about the following....

 When a frat or sorority incubates a covid outbreak that forces a university to switch to on-line learning the following happens.

1. Local chapter looses its certification for that university.  If the university owns the house, the local chapter also looses the permission to occupy the the house.

2.  The national organization of the local chapter, and their wealthy alumni, are invoiced for tuition refunds for the rest of the students who were following the health safety rules and did not cause the expensive problem."

Colleges may enroll many diverse peoples but those who reach the top echelon in life will have made important connections and those connections are still the pathway to success. 

Decades ago I eschewed association with Greek Society. While my career was successful the reality is that while did well and achieved a lot, others used those Greek Connections despite what they had and had not learned in college.

Silly me. I always thought that Greek life and particularly the study of Greek life related to the Greco-Hellenistic world. 

Choosing a letter in Greek for a fraternity or sorority house and calling what goes on there Greek life makes a mockery of Greek life, of any kind and any time.

You want Greek life: visit Athens. Read Plato."
2020-08-19 6:17,"Not sure why everyone digs on the Greek system so much... fraternities and sororities are not monolithic. I am involved with a fraternity that is both diverse racially and socioeconomically. Paying dues by yourself with a side job is easily achievable. I know this doesn't apply to some fraternities (e.g. SEC schools). If you don't like the Greek system, simply don't join it. That's your decision. 

As for the COVID-19 issue, I really doubt fraternities contribute any more than other students on campus. I would go on a limb to say that regardless of the existence of fraternities, there would still be parties going on. Schools without fraternity systems still party, do they not? This is not an issue of Greek life but rather an issue of college-aged students wanting to party. If anything, Greek life parties would be better than normal public parties because they are often closed to small communities that already hang out all the time anyways as opposed to random strangers. Silly article."
2020-08-19 8:48,"I am amazed and appalled at how many people here are missing the forest for the trees. Sure, it is easy to sneer at fraternity and sorority kids, especially if they are in parts of the country we are happy to dislike. But forget the so-called “Greek” organizations.

Living near a major university offers an ideal vantage point from which to observe the college species known as party Americanus whose keepers are heavily influenced by money and sports. Opening these places to in person classes on campus will infect entire communities and cause even more spread of  the virus when they return home to infect their own communities."
2020-08-19 10:44,There is one simple solution but no school would have the guts to carry it out: ban the Greek system. Period. No exemptions. No recognition on campus and if anyone is found to be playing at it off-campus consider it a breach of school disciplinary standards and begin expelling the miscreants.
2020-08-19 13:07,"Campuses should reopen. But students should sign a waiver indicating that they accept that the university cannot insure that all spaces can be free of infection, especially dorms and greek houses.

But universities should also agree as part of that waiver to a. provide testing free of charge, b. develop social distance and basic sanitary rules, c. establish in class protocols and d. allow students to opt out of an in person class and instead take an on line version of the class.

Student medical services will have to be improved, including utilizing all the latest treatment methods for those who come down with Covid-19. They will need financial support to do this given the paltry nature of most campus clinics.

But everyone has to accept some degree of responsibility and realize that there are good, common sense choices, but no perfect solutions."
2020-08-19 13:21,"I retired on July 1 after a 37 year career as a professor of biochemistry.  The current chaos in higher education comes as no surprise to anyone who understands human brain development and psychology.  Adolescence starts and puberty and continues until the mid-twenties for most people.  During the college years, the brain is developing the centers which are required for judgement and decision making.

In addition to my teaching duties, I also advised student extracurricular clubs.  Some of the students were adults, but most of them were large children.  Adolescence is a time when children develop judgement, impulse control, the ability to delay gratification and a concern for their future.

Most college students are also experiencing their first time without parental supervision.  In normal times, they'll make mistakes and learn from them.  During the pandemic, those mistakes can cause them to become very ill and possible develop lifetime disabilities.  They'll also spread the virus to faculty, staff, community members and their families, many of whom are at risk of dying.

Many colleges and universities have wisely opted for remote learning, which is far from ideal, but better than getting serious ill and spreading the virus.  On an almost daily basis, other institutions who tried to reopen are joining them to minimize the damage.  

There are no good choices here, but we need to pick the ones that do the least harm.  People's lives and futures are on the line."

2020-08-19 12:55,"I have a suggestion. How about just letting it be. Young people will socialize. Most will be asymptomatic, a few will get a cold, and a tiny handful will become seriously ill. Just like with any other illness that goes through dorms, fraternity houses, etc. Instead, give the lazy, whiny faculty N95 masks and make them go back to in person teaching like always, you know, the two classes per week, one in a lecture hall where they are 50 feet from the nearest student and half don’t show up because they tied one on the previous night. They have microphones in the lecture halls to help with the mask issue and there are always the published class notes, now simultaneously available on line. They can require that a student wear a mask during office hours, as they will themselves. Except if she's pretty and needing more personal attention. People will socialize whether whiners, liberals, and especially university administrators like it or not. And the evidence is becoming clearer by the day that the virus will largely die out over the next few months as there are fewer uninfected and more with T cell immunity due to precisely these kinds of gatherings. Enough from the Debbie Downer’s trying to regulate every aspect of people’s lives."

2020-08-20 14:16,"Austria uses work sharing extensively and the benefits are exactly as described in the article.

One additional point to emphasize: work sharing in Austria and other European countries is used widely all the time and is not utilized only as a tool for bad economic times. It allows people to stay involved in the work force on a part time basis and to receive work benefits (e.g. training, insurance, etc.). The psychological benefits of having a job, even if part time, cannot be underestimated.

A few years ago my niece in the US, a schoolteacher, was told by her principal that she could no longer share her job with another teacher after successfully doing so. What happened? She left the work force and no longer makes a contribution. A waste of valuable resources made by someone with little foresight. 

Meanwhile, a friend of mine in Switzerland became a teacher in her 40s. She shares the job with another person of similar circumstances. A win win situation in Switzerland but not so in the US.

In Louisiana, the state paid out $5.4 billion in unemployment benefits (state & federal) between mid-March and mid-August, compared to around $150 million for all of 2019.

The weak shutdowns are causing a prolonged economic pain even as other hard hit areas in Europe brought their case levels down to baseline and are rebounding. 

A large number of people are restricting their activity to be safe, but a similarly large number of people are continue to spread the virus within the community. 

We will continue at these levels of depressed economic activity until community spread is sufficiently low as to allow people to feel completely safe. 

Unless we have increased restrictions (including on socializing between different families in private homes), we had better get used to things staying like this well into 2021..."

Again, not as big a factor in Massachusetts where people have the luxury and privilege of working from home, shopping from home, etc..

2020-08-19 18:55,"Thank you for this excellent analysis of select economic impacts of Covid19. I find it fascinating that the mention of economics 101 isn't expanded further. I would love to read about the potential impacts to the models that drive our economic system - that unique brand of capitalism that is based on ""win-lose"" proposition. Economists, and ""big business"" persist in making statements about ""back to normal"". IMO the traditional economic models are irreparable. A third variable has emerged, that of relevance. Supply-Demand-Relevance. Metrics driving demand are significant indicators that a new economic model is worth pursuing."
2020-08-19 15:42,"Im not sure it’s just the fear of contracting the virus that is keeping people at home. We are definitely spending less because we are concerned that this recession is going to last for years and our jobs may be at stake. Instead of spending extra money, we are padding our savings in anticipation of the economy getting worse and our jobs tanking. I would suspect that we are not the only ones fortunate enough to still have jobs who are saving for the day we don’t have one."

I've met Steve Jobs, had dinner with him, and even though he was a true capitalist I do not believe he would have abandoned his country and fellow citizens just to line the pockets of wealth investors.  Steve and Steve started Apple in a garage that belonged to their middle class parents.  Those people have been forgotten by Apple's corporate greed.

Nothing as it turns out, you have to buy a $75 dongle on top of the $2,200 laptop. They do promise that it will fit a lot of stuff years from now though. Just not now, now it fits nothing. Now to warranty this laptop after a year they want another almost $400. Applecare.

It’s like the latest products aren’t that much different from the old products.  My laptop is 5 years old and I’m still using it.  I’ve looked at new ones and they’re too expensive and not much different than what I have.  My phone is over a year old and I don’t see any new phones out there that are worth buying to replace it.  It even seems like some of the new products are not as good as the old products.  I'm not picking on Apple, because I don't have an iPhone, but maybe you've noticed this.  They'll give you a smaller battery and then try to convince you that it's a better product, because it's the latest model."

Theoretically a split changes nothing, but it does create a psychological rationale for expected earnings growth and greater demand for shares at a cheaper price.

And shares of Apple took off for the sky where they are today.

It has two ports; one is needed for the power. I've tried two hubs but both overheat apparently because of the laptop, and won't power my external monitor if I have my memory back up device plugged in at the same time.

2020-08-18 23:22,"I'm glad. Stock prices reflect the perceived value of American businesses. So I take this as a sign that investors believe the value of American enterprise is intact even under these circumstances. I can think of three important reasons: (1) As stated, a vaccine is coming; (2) Many businesses and employees are adapting: and (3) There isn't anything structurally wrong to prevent people from coming back to work when they can, they are qualified and provide value, and they want to return. So I don't think it's strange that individual stock values are high even though much of the economy is dormant."
2020-08-18 23:23,"As Taleb said in The Black Swan,  the only more unexpected market Black Swan than the one day drop of 25% in October 1987 was the more rapid recovery.   Markets are not predictable and can only be understood retrospectively."
2020-08-18 23:29,"Several factors are at play:

1. Fed printing billions of dollars every month. In the last 10 years, since the financial crisis, we have the emergence of the financial economy in addition to the real economy. 

2. Low interest rates which are forcing insurance companies/ retirement / pension funds which had promised fixed benefits ( based on rosy bond yields ) which can no longer be delivered since the 2008/9 crisis, to enter the equity markets and push these higher.

3. Share buybacks. Companies like Microsoft and Apple generate huge cashflows, which they use to buy back their own stocks. They also issue long term debt at very low rates, to buy back stock. 

4. The equity market (indices) gains are being driven by a handful of companies like AMZN, AAPL, MSFT etc. This isn’t a broad based rally. 


Too much money chasing very few good opportunities."
2020-08-18 23:32,"Firstly:  The market lives and dies with the Fed.
And the Fed is doing whatever it takes to hold up
the market .  Including buying Junk Bonds Mutual
Funds.

Second: Paul Krugman (P.K.) , interviewed in the NYT (May 21, 2020)  Spencer Bokat-Lindell (S.B.L.) stated this

"" if we’re taking the 1918 flu as our baseline, the economy did in fact come roaring back. It was nothing like the sustained depressed economy after 2008.

S.B.L.: So you don’t see this downturn rivaling the Great Depression, as some economists have predicted?

P.K.: I don’t think that’s going to happen. If the virus hangs on that long, even if we don’t have a revolution, I suspect people will learn to live with it. Somebody said, if you don’t think Americans can live with the constant threat of mass death, think about school shootings. It’s just become part of the background. It’s a horrible thing to say, but I think that even if we totally mess up the immunological response, the economy will recover a lot faster than it did from the 2008 crisis""

P.K.'s prediction about the market are not alway's correct (he predicted the stock market would collapse after Trump was elected) but in this case, he is more likely than not to be correct."
2020-08-18 23:35,Something that I don’t think Donald Trump realizes - the stock market isn’t the economy. The forces that are causing the stock market to stay strong don’t help the “economy” for the most part and don’t help the millions of people who are out of work and losing their savings and homes.
2020-08-18 23:40,"The real question is why wouldn't the stock market be doing great?
No matter Customer demand, if the Treasury will bail them out at the expense of interest rates, the market will attract t more money."
2020-08-18 23:46,It’s a government-approved gambling ring. Why would rich people gambling with each other be affected by a pandemic whose worst impacts are on “essential workers”? What’s clear is: Wall Street workers are NOT essential.

2020-08-19 0:25,"The Fed has control of liquidity in the financial markets by printing money and giving it to debt ridden poorly run corps.  Meanwhile Congress who has the ability to inject liquidity for the broader economy thru expanded unemployment benefits, 'whiffs', and takes a two week vacation.  Anyone wonder why its called corporate socialism?"
2020-08-19 0:32,"The underlying assumption here is the S&P500 is a true representation of the country's well-being. That is simply not true: it's a flawed index that has been adopted as the economy's ideal measuring stick without further investigation. 

The reason why the index is up this much because the companies that substantially dictate its mathematical calculation (Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook) have arguably been helped by the pandemic. In that respect, the new high on the index makes sense. What doesn't make sense is the index itself."
2020-08-19 0:34,"The 2008 Global Financial Meltdown was blamed on the US housing market, back then what started the ball rolling back at the end of 2005 was a report that new home vacancy rates increased from 450,000 newly built vacant homes up to 2 million newly built vacant homes in just one year by 2006.  

The market still pumped home mortgages as AAA rated to keep it afloat, but there were plenty at the top that knew it was a house of cards and shorted the housing market.  Now there are 1.5 million new homes to come on the market by the beginning of next year, added to the number of available homes from the death of homeowners from COVID going on the market, and up to 40 million facing evictions and not having renters which will make mortgaged home owners default and the homes be taken by the banks and dumped on the market as well.

So the market increase because of July new home builds is just a repeat of 2007 followed by next year's housing bubble burst. Wall Street is counting on another bailout and rescue and yet they were told after the last bailout that there wouldn't be another one because the rest of the world is no longer heavily invested in the US housing market.

I am amazed that investors cannot see this surge as just the beginning of another large pump 'n dump scheme."
2020-08-19 0:42,The Federal Reserve is creating a moral hazard our children will rue.  It is trying to eliminate recessions to the point of creating an ever greater bubble.  The beneficiary here is Donald Trump.  A president who the rich don’t want to fail.  Trump would be history but for a Fed that insulates the economy with new fake money.
2020-08-19 0:44,"I think a lot of people are missing the fact that there aren't a lot of viable options to park your money right now. Stock prices are really just a comparison between the value of the stock and the dollar. The value of the US fiat dollar can fluctuate like any other asset, though we rarely hear about this feature of money. It's not unreasonable to believe that owning a chunk of big companies will be more valuable than owning cash issued by an unstable government."
2020-08-19 0:47,For quite some time the markets have ceased to be a measure of how the economy is doing. They are now a measure of how the very wealthy are doing.

2020-08-19 0:51,"Reading these comments it becomes clear why many will still be voting for the Republican party this coming election. It may be concerning to conservatives to see how the redistribution machinery could be put into high gear if the majority in the senate changed.

Is it the US capitalism, the Fed or Jeff Bezos that is responsible for the German Dax approaching record highs?"
2020-08-19 0:54,"The FED prints the money. There are no large scale investments neither by government nor private companies. So all that money slushing around has to go somewhere. Under the mattress perhaps? Or if that fails into the stock market. For a short period of time it is a reasonable bet. All these companies investing into nothing get their junk bonds bought up by the FED. No bankruptcies thus. When it ends, heavens have mercy."

2020-08-19 1:04,Wall Street has always benefited from friends in high places and that is unlikely to change. Many who speak out against it have also benefited from Wall Street. Consumers drive our economy and I’m certain that the recent stimulus checks played a role in the recent disconnect between the unemployment numbers and earnings numbers. It’s is as crazy as it is counterintuitive.

Hundreds of millions of doses of several vaccines each are being manufactured now in anticipation of a clinical success in Q4 or Q1. Investors are betting one of these will succeed, creating a big market surge."
2020-08-19 1:17,"Why is it a surprise? Wall Street serves the .0001%, who are profiting off of our suffering as always.

2020-08-19 1:25,"In a zero interest rate environment, you will have an overpriced stock market. Some may be thinking we're half way to a vaccine. Maybe some thinking a Trump premanent dissolution of employer and employee FICA payments. Maybe pricing in a Biden win."
2020-08-19 1:25,This is all part of the very rich controlling the government and the financial markets for their benefit. They don't need to worry about trivial things like unemployment (except to maybe beef up their security). They don't make their money from job employment anyway. They just pay people to gamble in the stock market and it's curious how that's become detached from the hard financial reality on the ground.
2020-08-19 1:35,"The ""exuberance"" of the market unequivocally illustrates that there is no free market.  The stock market is a reflection of the profound corruption of our society by corporate power over government. All the money that trump and the republicans have lavished on the wealthy has to go somewhere so it is simply plowed back into the market.  At some point it will crash and all that money will be lost.

If we don't do something about the corporate bribery system that keeps our politicians dependent on contributions from the wealthy, we will continue to slide into a state of absolute oligarchy.  Democracy however poorly it has fulfilled its mandate will be more and more diminished."
2020-08-19 1:37,"Let's be really clear what this is.  It is simply the Fed's backstopping of the stock and debt markets, which is an epic subsidy to those top 10% who already own 90% of the financial assets in the country, and who were bailed out in the last financial crisis as well. So once again, literally trillions of dollars are being given to those who have everything, while those swelling millions who have nothing can line up at food pantries. But the real tragedy--and the NY Times is no help in this--is that we continue to treat this as though it's some sort of serious economic policy, when really it's nothing but a vivid expression of the corruption of our political system and poverty of our thinking."
2020-08-19 1:39,"When quantitative easing following the ‘great recession’ first rolled out it was the straw that broke the camel’s back.
Cheap money is cheap capital / investment funds, and primarily privileges investing over labor.  I don’t recall anyone talking about that in the media at the time, but ‘rescuing the banks’ essentially meant putting the financial markets and their participants (investors) above workers (taxpayers) in the country’s priorities.

Not surprisingly this is a government policy the very wealthy have enjoyed very much, so it has continued - even when there was no ‘urgent’ justification for it (eg a growing economy).
And now we’re here again, with another justification for pouring more money into the markets.  As usual we will balance the books by ensuring that hundreds of millions of ordinary Americans who work for a living and pay taxes will get poorer.  Only this way can we ensure there is no inflationary side effect which would result in the investments being overpriced and less profitable."
2020-08-19 1:50,People that question why the stock market is doing well or claim it is devoid of reality have absolutely no idea what the market is predicated on. The market is predicated on the future and potential. Investors believe the pandemic will pass. It is a single shock theory playing out in reality.
2020-08-19 1:52,"It's telling how many readers think the stock market is rising in anticipation of Biden winning.  Isn't the conventional wisdom that a Democrat will require the rich to pay the taxes they can easily afford, while restoring some minimal regulations on the country's health and safety?  This sounds like an apocalypse for Wall Street.  

Even with a Biden win and a readily available vaccine, employment will not return to previous levels for many months if not years.  If someone is looking to buy low and sell high, I don't think that window of opportunity has passed."
2020-08-19 1:54,Why is the FED supporting the market that has reached a record high? Isn’t record a signal that no further support is needed?
2020-08-19 1:55,"Prior to the virus you may remember countless predictions of a recession that did not happen.  That set the stage for grossly inaccurate predictions of market performance as the virus hit. 

Every day, however the market moves, there’s a commentator to tell us why. And there is always another commentator saying the opposite.

 Articles like this, purporting to give us the big picture and to explain it all are a dime a dozen. If you want to know whether that’s likely to go up to 11 cents a dozen or down to 9 cents, talk to two commentators."

2020-08-19 2:17,"Soon or later the rubber will meet the road, and Wall Street ""smart traders"" will have to face reality.

Ask the Japanese, Nikkei Index was about 40,000 in 1989 then after 30 years it is now about 22,000. Why? Because Japanese companies stopped making money, and Japanese consumers ceased spending money...

US companies will see their business tank starting now to who knows when. Check the market performance after 2008, and see how long did it take the market truly recovered and started growing...

And we may face another wave of pandemic in the winter..."
2020-08-19 2:17,"This is not that hard to explain. The question is, where do people with money invest put it? What are their choices? Bonds are paying next to nothing and if you adjust for inflation, most bonds have an effectively negative yield. That means when you buy a ten year US Government bond at .7% (7/10 of 1%), you are effectively paying the government to lend it money. The government is running deficits as a percentage of GDP that have no historical precedent at the same time it is also driving down interest rates. (Yes, the Federal Reserve is part of the government.) And compounding all this is that the government is printing money like water. Investors have begun to grasp that there is a real danger of inflation down the road which would be very good for those in debt, and very bad for creditors (i.e. bond holders). By contrast the S&P 500 index is currently yielding around 1.7%, and stocks tend to rise in value with inflation, unlike bonds. The other indicator is the price of gold, which as I type is slightly over $2000/oz. Gold is the only form of money you can't print. Clearly investors are expecting a policy of inflation and currency debasement, which given the level of debt is probably realistic."

2020-08-19 2:29,"The stock market only represents a fraction of American businesses. Most companies are privately held, such as many of the local small businesses in your community. And the gains in the S&P and other indices are because of certain large cap stocks such as Amazon and Apple. Many individual stocks and many whole sectors are doing poorly, such as retail, financials, and the energy sector. The economic recession is real if you actually look at the entire stock market. A market cap weighted index doesn’t tell the whole story. And stock prices do go down. Sector rotation does occur. Sentiment can turn pretty quickly. Bubbles do burst."

It reflects that the American capitalism works only for top 2% of America  and is an illusion for Americans.  Delusional Donald Trump has no clue where America is heading.

How much new money are we talking about? How do you create new money? Is is just digital? Where does it go? Do politics influence which bonds get bought with this invented money? Has this ever happened at this scale before? Is there any danger in minting an extra $3 Trillion out of thin air? Why is there no real coverage of this New Money anywhere?"

And though the warning is to never bet against the Fed, my guess is that, at some point, this is going to get really, really ugly.

That said, I'm a little worried that something could happen that sends interest rates suddenly higher, so I've become a little more defensive.  What bothers me is the international trade tensions.  There's a lot of back and forth right now.  Something could happen.  Maybe China announces they won't buy US debt anymore.  If the 10-year went to just 2% tomorrow, look out below."

As an investment banker told me a long time ago ""The greater the rise in any market the more inevitable and more severe the eventual downturn will be."" At some point the market will go down, but no one knows when.  The only thing that we do know is that in the end the rich will be richer and the poor poorer."
2020-08-19 7:07,"While the Fed makes sure the top 10% continue to enjoy market gains, it's tragic for the majority of Americans who don't own much stock, and are literally living day-to-day.  They're unemployed or under-employed, have lost their work-subsidized healthcare, and can not become re-employed if their kids' elementary schools are closed due to Covid and they don't have affordable child care options."
2020-08-19 7:27,"The market is betting on the Fed. It's a ""there is no downside, we're covered by the Fed"" scenario. But the real threat is, a digital transformation is happening and digital giants are rapidly prospering at the expense of small businesses decimating en masse. 

The markets no longer represent the economical fabric of society, there is a social transformation going on and in the not-so-distant future, many small business owners will lose their businesses and turn into delivery people or warehouse associates at Amazon.

It's a different version of 1984. The authority that watches and controls everyone will not be the government but ""the market,"" say top 250 companies and their shareholders. (The governments will be in the business of creating and supporting this ""private sector."")

So much for the tide that lifts them all, this is a tsunami for the little people."
2020-08-19 7:49,"In 1972, Chile, a communist president, Allende, elected by the people, campaigned on an economic program to help the poor classes.  The idea was to transfer wealth from rich to poor.  Allende's administration lacked the skill to run the economy, and did things that seemed to help the poor but ruined the economy in the meantime. Shortly after taking power, Allende's  program caused runaway inflation.  The inflation successfully transferred wealth from the rich, but left the economy in ruins so that everyone suffered.  The lesson learned is that messing around with the economy requires skill and knowledge.  Trump is not a communist, and his goal is quite different from Allende's.  But he is less knowledgeable than Allende was in dealing with the economy.    When the pandemic hit, Trump wanted to to sustain a strong economy that would assure his reelection.  Like Allende, he stubbornly followed a flawed program ignoring signs of disaster.  By keeping businesses and schools open, he fostered the spreading of the virus, thereby extending the need to close them.   The economy and stock market will stabilize after the virus has been defeated, not before.  Trump MAGA is the hoax, not the virus.  Trump has brought us to the worst economic crisis since 1929, much as Allende created the worst crisis in Chilean history, but in a different way.  The market indices do not reflect the true economic damage that Trump has caused to the US."
2020-08-19 8:26,This is a tale of inequality. Due to corona the economy is in trouble and the government is injecting massive amounts of money to keep it afloat. Unfortunately too much of that money is ending up in the pockets of the rich. And they need to invest it somewhere...

 the wealthy."

2020-08-19 9:55,"The almost total disconnect between the stock market and actual production of goods and services exemplifies the concentration of wealth in the hands of the one-percenters. The expansion of the money supply and Federal debt go to the largest banks, which lend and invest it at a profit to corporations, hedge and private equity funds, dominated by billionaire investors. The three-fourths of Americans struggling to survive month by month in the real economy of factories, schools, transportation, get next to none of this wealth. This level of inequality is deeply unstable, not only politically but economically. Debt generated growth disconnected from productivity is bound to crash. How will Americans who believe honest hard work should be rewarded with a decent standard of living react?"

2020-08-19 10:43,"You mention ' in the American psyche, the stock market is not a particularly good reflection of the broader U.S. economy'.  The U.S. Stockmarket is the American economy.  Since the days of Lewis Powell and the advent of ALEC, nearly every piece of legislation has favoured profits over investment or labour.  In recent cycles, the speed with which profits have recovered must suggest an excessive degree of market concentration and indirect transfers from Government.  GSEs, drug pricing, excessive market concentration in the airline and finance industries amongst many industries all speak of rent extraction and are not a product of markets but of legislation that has discriminated against the consumer and public goods.  
Such brittleness may explain the speed with which financial capitalism began to break down, endogenously, in 2001, 2008 and again earlier this year; each time necessitating the Federal Reserve to come to its rescue."

With physical distancing, spending declined significantly - no restaurants, movies, shopping sprees, travel, hotels, etc. Why buy new clothes if you are not going out, even to the office? Americans savings rate skyrocketed from a baseline of 7.5% to 33.5% in April and 19% in June. For the lucky ones sitting on a growing pile of cash, there are not a lot of attractive options other than buying stocks. With the fed pouring money into the system, cash and bonds are not attractive options."

If history if a guide the economic end will come. The only question is when and how bad.

Covid has complicated things and it will most likely make it come sooner than later.

In fact we may already be in it, ie even after covid dies down the economic collapse will continue."
2020-08-19 12:22,"We are all dependent on the stock market, but when you see these ongoing additions to the money supply, inflation should be getting a lot more attention - it is like heart disease, i.e., it is an invisible killer. People have been lulled into an ongoing state of disconnect by the so-called basket of goods measurement system, which is problematic as, intentionally or not, by lumping mass produced consumer goods and luxury items in the same basket with necessities, it distorts the pain people in the bottom 80% have been feeling when it comes to housing, food, medicine and higher education costs outpacing service economy wages.

I highly suggest folks revisit the book Bad Money by Kevin Philips. He is one of the *very* few people who called the economic collapse of 2007/2008, and the biggest takeaway from the book, backed with clear-eyed historical economic analysis spanning decades, is the danger that moving from a manufacturing economy to a white collar has brought. You can't have a healthy economy when productivity gains are hoarded in the top quintile of the population. We need a return to a vastly more progressive income tax system, to close the corporate loopholes that offshore the fruits of labor, and to look far more closely at the estate tax and investment earnings."
2020-08-19 12:55,"The stock market is now a reflection of politics. 3 trillion in two stimulus packages on top of 1.2 trillion tax cuts, on top of near zero interest rates and a 4 trillion increase in Federal reserve balance sheet. Pretty high on the high wire. Many say there is no inflation. What do you think is happening in the stock market, deflation? The problem now is you can't judge stocks based on economics but must judge them based on whether there's going to be more stimulus or fed continuing low or lower rates and continue to buy treasury bonds to support deficit. Hard to know what to do with your money. Nothing for your money and get no interest, invest in stocks at riskier asset prices, gold? Or just sit and see what happens? Good luck and be ready to sell fast."

Investors make judgments not based upon the strength of a company but on and expectation that the market will go up or down for reasons completely unrelated to the economy.

The constant increase in prices at one of the worst of economic times proves the point."

Republicans base of suburban voters were not affect by layoffs as much as renters 2.) 12-month forbearance and low rates means homeowners are fine for the the foreseeable future and 3.) ZIRP means their retirement accounts have bounced back. There is no reason for any Republicans in Congress to come back to the negotiating table.
2020-08-19 14:01,"Possibly the markets are looking at earnings, interest rates and the potential for inflation. Reporters and editorialists can foam at the mouth about the pandemic, racial inequity and Trump, but the markets are not driven by that. Many companies have had a good quarter with the prospect of better ones ahead, the stimulus portends inflation, interest rates are absurdly low. Given all of that, the rising stock market may make sense. Sitting on cash is okay but not forever.  Plus, some sectors have had a tough time, which also makes sense. A correction is inevitable, as always, but I don't buy the idea that what is happening is nuts."

2020-08-19 14:58,"This is a consequence of inadequate fiscal policy response, so that the Fed ends up doing truly massive amounts of monetary stimulus (including direct purchases of private assets). This was the pattern during the 2008-2010 Great Recession, and it's being repeated now. I don't know what else the Fed can do -- the alternative is economic disaster even worse than what we've got -- but it's much worse from a distributional and even a production perspective than properly defined fiscal stimulus. Fed's expansionary monetary policy increases inequality, and can't yield long-term productivity benefits like infrastructure investments could do. Oh -- and the Fed is not democratically elected, unlike Congress."

The stock market matters to him above all else because the continuation of his Presidency now depends almost entirely on it.

When Trump came along, businesses and millions of well-to-do people saw a con-artist who would give them lower taxes; was promising to spend lavishly on the military and the infrastructure; had no interest in controlling budget deficits and inflation; would cast a cold eye on the need for health and safety measures in the workplace; and would ignore the effects of climate change.

But, many other influences were at work.  Their cumulative effect was to produce waves of panic selling that, by late April, had largely abated.  And, like a punched pillow, prices rebounded; but for how long?  No one knows.

“The Market” is less a predictor — a see’er, or foreseer — than a mechanism to liquidate “secure” assets (hence “securities”, mostly imaginary, virtual representations of wealth, vs “real estate”, which is usually mortgaged and illiquid; also, selling it is an expensive, complicated process.  On the other hand, “securities trading” is comparatively quick and easy; also dominated by a subset of activities called “derivate trading”.

Confidence is linked to the feelings of the wealthy but not to the rest, whose stocks are controlled by pension managers and so seek the Fed bubble.  The loss of jobs or poor people does not undermine 'confidence' because it only applies to the wealthy with the globalization of jobs helping.

Lastly, I have seen that the third largest use for stimulus payments for those earning between $45,000 and $75,000 has been stock speculation.

The massive stock buy backs and money thrown into vaccine development are just some of the examples that have created an insider trading/stock price manipulation playground for plutocrats.  Add in the huge defense budget and so money is poring into stock prices.  With the corporate tax cuts and the tax giveaways in capital gains tax rates these people are cashing in while the rest of the country faces hard times.   The unprecedented amount of money flowing to the beneficiaries of this plutocrat bonanza is seriously harming the country.

And, here we go again: from September 2019 to March 2020, the Fed poured $9 TRILLION into the banks and the big businesses that owed them money. This bailout for a meltdown that hinted it's beginning in Spring 2019, and began in earnest in September when the Fed began holding interest down in the repo market (well before there was any sign of a virus), has continued steadily. We need fundamental money system change from a system that deliberately shifts wealth from the many to the few, values profits over people, and promotes the degradation and exploitation of people and the planet.

2020-08-19 9:33,"Matt Philips seems to think that the Fed “essentially” creates money by stating that  the financing of its programs  takes place “by essentially creating new money” and he also seems to think that liquidity is the same as money when he states “the Fed keeps the river of freshly created money — what’s known on Wall Street as liquidity — flowing into financial markets.”  Fact: Over 95% of the money that is created is created by banks, mostly privately-owned banking systems, through the so-called fractional reserve system. The Fed creates liquidity, not money, in the present debt-based financial system by buying securities and other debt measures.


It might have been appropriate for Mr. Philips to have at least mentioned the diametrically opposing view of money-based financial system or public money proposed by adherents of the Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) with emphasis on the sovereign right of nations to create money and to reclaim money creation of banks. The Alliance for Just Money’s goal is “to bring about an understanding of the need for and the means to return the sovereignty of money creation to the government in the public interest.

It's played-NOT-""invested in"" by smart rich ones, like megacorp owners and execs, and foolish rich ones like those who are used by[sic] the ""app"" that dishonestly calls itself Robinhood, and while Americans suffer, both groups are above the critical mass to sit back and watch their money make more of itself.

Both groups (a) are already too rich to suffer consequences from the defective-by-design economy, (b) are further protected for some bizarre reason from economic plight by socialism-for-the-rich mislaws like the Job Cuts and Taxes Act, and (c) have a vested interest in soaking the taxes that the non-rich (especially ""illegal"" immigrants!), unlike them, pay.

(b) and (c) in particular ensure that the economy trickles UP cash on them, and trickles down some entirely different green substance on us.

The loser in the White House, his boss putin, and his enablers like carl icahnfireyou and Moscow mitch, have further interests in keeping it that way.  Their goal is to corrupt and harm government as much as possible to make as much cash from our burning Rome as possible, so getting ""share"" chips in the stock casino helps them make it faster; with their inside info as government office-squatters, they can decide when to cash out before everyone else; and putin's blackmail material and lack of honor among fellow vile-gop thieves both force them to paranoically keep a growing war chest."

Step back further and see that Americans are just 4.3% of all humans , a tiny minority surrounded by 200 other nations that are increasingly distrusting of the US dollar as the reserve currency. This great privilege was the prize for being the dominant nation post WWII. Since Nixon broke the link from the USD to gold, our money is just paper backed by a promise from the Feds. The USA now owe over 100% of the US annual GDP and the Fed Reserve has taken on trillions of debt to inflate the ill stock equities. This is the path each and every dominant empire has taken in the last 500 years as they decline in power and wealth. By debasing your own currency you now invite the majority of the outside nations to consider NOT using the USD as the main currency ; this will suddenly drop the value of the USD and greatly inflate the cost of any debts owed to foreigners as you cannot simply print more of your own paper to pay off the debts to OPEC, Japan, China and all the US investors who hold US Treasury bonds.  Few Americans understand that 2/3 of all US currency is held by non-Americans , thus the fate of the American dollar is held by foreigners.

I agree that without robotic automation there's no upside to US based manufacturing although the combination of 3D printing, robots and e-bikes represents the future.

When I lived in Taiwan (78-83) I needed a bigger frame than was available locally so I went with a friend to the KHS factory in the Taichung area and they brazed me up a 25.5"" frame using 531. I still have it. Later Giant opened an office / storefront in Taipei and I would occasionally ride over and visit the guys there. It's been a long time, but we'd talk about biking in the U.S. Bicycling and bicycles have evolved and come a long way since then. There were a lot of great rides beyond the city limits. My only regret was not being able to get the gearing that would have made climbing some of the steep mountain roads a lot easier. Great memories. Support Taiwan!"

There is a small bike shop near me I ran into to get inner tubes, which they luckily still had in my bike size. The shop was packed with bikes waiting to be repaired, pulled out of a basement/closet/garage that had been neglected for years. They only have one mechanic and the wait list is about 5 weeks to get the bike repaired. I commented to him  that business is booming and he said ""Yes, but everyone is mad at me for taking too long"". Come on people, it is bad enough without your being rude to your friendly neighborhood bike guy (who looks about 65 years old) who has stayed open to help you.

Recently I've seen people ride by with their two year old balanced in a seat in front of the handlebars - the child seat they were using is meant to be attached to the rear wheel not the front. Safety equipment works best when used properly. it is almost impossible to prevent a child from being injured when they ride forward.

The second wave was people who wanted bikes to replace their lost gym-time.  The third wave was people looking to buy commuter bikes.  Anyway, her shop was stripped of everything but bikes costing $2,000 or more.  And she figured she would sell all of those too.

Just as roads were built to accommodate cars and trucks, bikes will proliferate as well.  It's a natural progression that increased health awareness being met by infrastructure construction will spread the idea readily. Giant should be building, not hesitating. The shock of the Covid-19 pandemic will teach many lessons worldwide and improving health is one of them. It may be a question of business ""Supply and Demand"", but to me, that only means they control prices by limiting production to keep prices high. So, that will eventually lead to greater production and engineering innovation, and more competition, so Giant should understand that and expand production and invest in engineering to innovate to bring prices lower with mass production and excellent engineering. Henry Ford built Detroit with the Model T. The cars were all the same down to the color and that greatly reduced tooling and production costs. Look at Detroit now; a new model every year that is becoming unaffordable and their businesses don't even understand that foreign competition is using Henry Ford's basic ideas.

A bike is simple, if you ride long distances you have to know how to do simple repairs such as a flat, chain break or derailment on your own.  Even my newer electric bike only adds only a few extra parts, the motor, battery and switch.  But a skilled technician can keep a bike running indefinitely by replacing worn parts as needed.

Maybe out of reach financial for many, but cheaper than a car and can definitely satisfy the wind in your face desire, and could hold the answer to carpooling and mass transit attempts that never really seem to be embraced here in San Diego.

Soon they will need to address licensing the riders though, as most I see are not wearing helmets and many are teenagers who surely haven’t had a drivers education course yet but are out in traffic.

Caveat emptor, sure, but a secondhand bike is pretty easy to inspect and any reputable seller will encourage you to take a test ride before buying.  Yes, a small percentage of used bikes for sale are stolen, but just deploy your common sense and a quick serial number check on Bike Index.  Problem (mostly) solved.

2020-08-18 1:49,"The saddest part of this is that ms tu basically said US labor and lack of manufacturing expertise (robots) would prevent making bikes here. Pathetic.

2020-08-18 3:31,"I took my old 10-speed—one that I purchased at a box store about 16 years ago—to one of my local bike shops for an overhaul just last Thursday. I asked for a tune-up, new tires and a new seat. I was told then that they can’t get seats right now.  That was fine. My old one is still in good condition. 

The shop was so loaded down they couldn’t get to mine until today, which is when they called to tell me they can’t get tires but that my existing ones had a lot of life in them. They would, instead, replace the inner tubes. So, the only thing I requested that they can grant is the tune up. 

Hence this news story and the other letters here are all confirming what we each suspected:  it’s the same everywhere. It’s great that our nation is on a bike kick and that our locally run stores have more business than they can handle, and by patronizing them we can breathe more money into our local economies. What isn’t great is that these shops can’t contribute to the American economy at large because the manufacturing of bikes and parts has disappeared along with most other manufacturing."

2020-08-18 5:39,"I wish this article had also covered how the shortage in the supply of bikes from Taiwan has led to all sorts of phantom bikes being offered for sale on Amazon etc.  

Over recent months, Amazon has routinely listed bikes from various ""sellers"" with listings say that it'll take 2 months to receive (presumably in transit from abroad), you pay, wait, and then NOTHING arrives!   Akin to profiteering with black market and fake brands.  Why is a major selling venue like Amazon allowed to get away with listing non-existent items or counterfeit ones on an ongoing basis.  

And of course what the bike shortage says about the state of manufacturing says it all about the state of the economy in Trumpland with all it's ""winning""!"

2020-08-18 14:34,This pandemic bike boom will fade just like the virus. Part of the reason people are riding bikes now is because its become so much safer to be on a road where auto traffic has shrunk by at least 50% on most roads in USA. As soon as auto traffic returns to normal most people will never touch that bike again. This is not Europe where biking is normal and respected. American drivers are simply to dangerous to share a road with.
2020-08-18 15:49,"giant and their sub-brands should make their bikes in the US - at least their high end ""luxury"" models for a lack of a better term. a lot of the high end bikes - whether for road or mountain or electric - are worth more than decent used cars. in VT i frequently see downhill mountain bikes on cars worth half as much as the bike! 

i dont for a second think americans would be unwilling to pay an extra few dollars for american-made bikes when theyre already spending quite a large chunk of money on a bike anyways. whats another couple hundred on top of a bike thats already a few grand? 

and on top of that giant wouldnt have to worry about trade issues, or the cost of shipping across oceans. the bikes would be ""greener"" and the money made by the workers would stay local, boosting our economy. i personally see e-bikes being the way of the future for people who live in or near small cities and dont want to break a sweat or pay tens of thousands of dollars plus insurance, taxes and fees for a car. 

i go out of my way to buy american made, even if it costs a little more."
2020-08-18 17:04,"All those saying we parents should spend ""a few extra dollars"" buying made-in-the-US bikes are really asking for us to spend a LOT more dollars.

There are VERY few families that can afford that kind of money for any bikes, let along bikes out of which their kids will grow. We take good care of ours and pass them down, etc. but Giant bikes are already a huge cost step above the cheap-o Walmart/Target bikes."

Part of the Monopolization of Everything in the U.S. meant that the bike monopolists sold out to foreign manufacturers, who can make bikes cheaply because of the cost of labor. I can envision government--either state or federal--subsidizing the creation of a bicycle manufacturing industry in the U.S., comprised of small shops of designers and manufacturers, serving locally or regionally."

When I bike, I am by myself, in nature, seeing beautiful landscapes at a speed that is not too fast (like in a car) and not too slow (like walking).

2020-08-15 17:49,"Online education isn’t the same as in class education.  It is substandard.  Basically schools are asking students to accept a lower quality education at the same price. It seems reasonable to charge less, if it costs the schools less to produce the educational product.  While some of their costs are sunk costs (Buildings, maintenance, etc), the most significant savings they could find is furloughing non-teaching staff.  If schools were run like a business, they would make necessary cuts to staff and other expenses and be able to pass on the savings to their customers.  But, most schools aren’t run like businesses and have little accountability."
2020-08-15 17:51,"What, exactly, do parents/students believe is less expensive about online learning. Should professors & staff be paid less? (In many, many instances they are.) Do the buildings & grounds cost less to maintain even if no one is there (buildings must still be heated, grass cut, etc.)? Every administrator & teacher I know has been working all summer to adjust to the changing situation & prepare to offer the best educational experience possible in a difficult situation."
2020-08-15 17:55,"There should be a big refund. Online classes are great, but much more economical to produce. I studied a semester online at the London School of Economics for 2.500 USD, or 1800 pounds and the quality was top-notch, world-known professors.  The US wants to charge 10 or 20 times for the same thing."
2020-08-15 17:55,"In a different timeline in which we had a competent federal government, I think the solution would have been for the government to encourage all colleges to go fully online (or least as much as possible), give students a discount on tuition, and then have a government guarantee to cover any financial shortfalls that universities experience. 

As it is, many colleges, already feeling themselves to be on shaky ground prior to the pandemic, are making decisions purely based on financial considerations (for themselves as institutions, not for their students, faculty, or staff) and largely ignoring any concerns about public health or the educational value being provided."
2020-08-15 17:57,"Colleges and universities are like health care. Often, third party payer. Yes there are education loans to re-pay but the payment feels third party at the time you're making a decision on a college.

There's lack of any transparency or accountability in why it costs what it costs.

Having said that, I'm aware many faculty are underpaid. Some colleges struggle, while others are richly endowed. 

It all adds to the questions about how these institutions are financially managed."
2020-08-15 17:59,"I have participated in distance learning and would give a thumbs-up to distance learning.

I did have the unpleasant experience of attending UC Berkeley.  At UC Berkeley I attended lectures and discussion sections.  In the lectures, the professor summarizes the required reading.  In the discussion sections, a graduate student instructor summarizes the professor’s lecture.

The UC Berkeley education model is OBSOLETE (and costly). Students are required to live in the VERY EXPENSIVE area around Berkeley and physically attend class in large OBSOLETE (and costly to maintain) lecture halls. The MODERN Distance Learning education model does not require your physical presence or large lecture halls."

There is huge potential for consolidation.
10 great instructors could work together to produce better work than any individual and then this could be sold to 10,000 students at a lower price than typical tuition."
2020-08-15 18:14,"The pandemic will not last forever, although it sometimes feels that way.  I hear so many parents at my daughter’s university complain about the cost of tuition, having to pay building maintenance fees “when we’re not using the buildings,” etc.  Running a large university is expensive - and they’re dealing not only with the cost of quickly adapting to the needs created by the pandemic, but keeping the university’s faculty, staff, and facilities in place and ready for when we can return to something resembling a “normal” situation."
2020-08-15 18:16,"It is daylight robbery if colleges charge the same high fees for remote learning as in-class education. Parents have every right to demand markedly reduced fees if colleges move classes online. A Harvard online degree is not the same as Harvard campus learning. All colleges henceforth should reduce tuition significantly as much as 75% if teaching is going to be online. 

Also if public schools that are supported by property taxes then they should not be entitled to the same level of tax payer support. Locally on the November ballot in our Jefferson county school system there is a move to increase property taxes while preferring to go online.

I have been an educator most of my adult life and I have taught in class rooms almost all the time and only once I have taught an entire course on line. If I was a parent of these students who are being or will be entirely taught online in college, I would be appalled and angry. Online learning is an equalizer and an education at Harvard or Howard should cost the same. It is time that the cost of college education is brought down significantly so that the tax payer supported federal loan program stays viable and sustainable. This could be one of the good things that could come out of the pandemic that should have happened years ago."
2020-08-15 18:17,"The reality is that colleges will incur substantially greater costs, and professors and TAs invest far more time, in delivering nearly the same educational experience online as face-to-face.

And the older professors will face a quite substantial chance of getting hospitalized – and dying – if they teach F2F courses.

And yet students and their families want to pay less.  Sounds like all the costs haven't been considered."

Note that in-person classes for the benefit of student socializing seems a high prize to pay for putting faculty, and staff, at risk. We all want to go back to our normal lives, but we just can't right now."
2020-08-15 18:18,"What's crushing schools is not having students on campus.  Room and board fees are a school's bread and butter.  Once a dorm is built it churns cash with very few expenses.  Food service is alo highly profitable.  Normally in the summer schools have sports camps and pre-college programs that generate large profits.  That's all gone now.  

I totally agree that online learning isn't the same and certainly some professors have not stepped up.  That said I'm not expecting a nickel back from my kids' schools.  If they do, great, a nice good faith gesture.  But their schools don't have billion dollar endowments to keep them afloat.   I'm cutting them a little slack for now."
2020-08-15 18:18,"While I can understand how students and parents feel, I don't agree.

An online class from Phoenix or Western something or other will be generic (or it should be).  The faculty are competent (or should be).

But that's about it.  Any class at a top private school (Ivy or any good liberal arts college) should be better: a more expert professor, more advanced and up to date readings (not textbooks), and (hopefully) interaction with more motivated students.

I have taught in an Ivy and a community college.  There's a difference.  Most of that difference will recur even when the course is online.  

But I do agree a little bit, and draw different conclusions: online courses should not be taught by taking advantage of an underclass of adjuncts.  If they are good they should be paid like any full-time tenure track professor, given a decent teaching load, and required to contribute to their field.  Otherwise the move online will result in intellectual weakening of all subjects."
2020-08-15 18:25,"Many of the decisions colleges are making are ill thought through and rightly unpopular.
The bigger problem, however, is the skipping back and forth between fall plans that plays with students' hopes and is blind to the financial constraints many families are facing amidst a global pandemic."
2020-08-15 18:27,"Having put three kids through college I can sympathize with the difficult dilemma that students, parents and colleges face this fall. I was grateful my kids received an excellent education. But now all the options are dire. What a mess. But I do think the pandemic may bring about a needed reevaluation of higher education in America. There is an assumption in the U.S. that kids should go to college, when vocational school would be a better option for many. Why do we saddle parents and students with enormous debt for an education that for some reason includes a four-year stay at the equivalent of a high-end resort? We need to look to the European model where admission is based on a national exam, tuition is free, there are no college sports and there is no such thing as a development office. And it wouldn’t hurt kids to require a gap year of public service."

2020-08-15 18:00,"My kids are too young to worry about this yet, but as a parent I certainly would not want to pay the high cost of college for them to sit at home reading text on a screen, or listening to what amounts to a YouTube video.  You don't need college for that.

In fact, as the teachers' union in Austin holds the city's families hostage, we are considering opting out of public education as well.  We can home-school or children better than they could ""learn"" playing  whatever video games were sold to the idiot school administrators as ""educational.""  

This whole thing is making us reconsider education as a whole.  At this point Americans are getting very little value for all of the money they pay.  That goes for every level of education across the country."

2020-08-15 18:21,"This is a good thing.  Colleges and universities are facing their ""emperor has no clothes"" moment; they are being called to account for what exactly justifies those ridiculous tuitions.  Tuition has been rising at an average of 8% per year; anyone familiar with the rule of 72 knows that means that in 9 years, average college tuition has doubled.  But higher education has used its august standing, and its role as gatekeeper to the good life, to intimidate families against asking about where their money is going.  To fund diversity and inclusion bureaucracies?  Or microaggression investigators?  Or fashionably obscure fields of grievance study that produce research of the kind exposed in Sokal squared?   And all the while turning a blind eye to such travesties as what happened at Evergreen College, the Yale Halloween incident, ""safe spaces"" and trigger warnings.  As long as the pie was growing, colleges and universities could afford to pay for increasingly extreme, left-leaning fields of study to appease liberal faculties and students.  Now they'll need to make choices.  Why was it that Ohio University chose to furlough instructors in its women's, gender and sexuality studies department?   The pervasive vibe I get from higher education is that the country that allowed them to flourish, the economic system of that country, and the majority of its people, are worthy of shame.  That's poor customer service."
2020-08-15 17:53,"“'This crisis is demonstrating that there is real value in face-to-face instruction,” agreed David Feldman, an economist at William & Mary in Virginia'....""

Sixty years ago when I went to college, there were waiting lists for second rate colleges. Most students didn't major in business and marketing, or what was referred to then as majors in ""basket weaving."" And students didn't take on obscene amounts of debt because tuition was reasonable.

As David unintentionally points out, college has become nothing more than another business. And most of these businesses are selling chevys at cadillac prices."
2020-08-15 17:47,"I share the sentiment that online teaching is not equivalent to in-person teaching. I'm not quite so impressed by the claimed ""intangibles"" of being on campus -- parties, service clubs, etc. If one is looking to drive down college costs, look no further than the multiplying of useless administrators and the craven attempt to make campuses into country clubs. Oh, and then there is sports . . . . The problem isn't that you are being changed too much not to be there; it is that it is needlessly expensive in the first place. On the other hand, most students are not interested in learning, but rather in receiving the imprimatur of a purportedly high-end school. You can get that remote, since it only loosely tracks intellectual quality. Sorry for being obstreperous, but the debate is happening at the wrong level."

2020-08-15 18:00,"This problem has been brewing for a very long time.  Years of tuition and fee increases far in excess of inflation are one root cause.  The other is keeping up with competitors on enhancements such as recreation centers, new dorms and an impressive array of services beyond instruction.  

The shake out will be severe but I suspect the impact on athletic programs will be the most evident change.  That will hit the public that already is unaware that few athletic programs ever break even and already operate with huge deficits.  This industry is about to become completely battered by multiple crises.  It will be very ugly."
2020-08-15 17:51,"there is an interesting and somewhat hidden anti-academic nature to these complaints that reflects the hatred of education and faculty widespread in the US.

the students in this piece, and their parents, repeatedly say that their tuition dollars ""pay for in-person education."" I don't think that is clear from a contractual perspective, but put that aside. As a budgetary matter, tuition dollars overwhelmingly pay for faculty salaries (I think the figure is typically around 80-90%). People choose to pay tuition to Harvard or Yale because of the quality of the faculty who teach there. That's where the money goes. 

Once we get into the weeds of the in-person issue, things get complicated--but in general, there are entirely separate fees associated with being in residence: rent and dining fees, for example. Students not coming to campus this semester aren't paying those at all. So they *are* getting substantial discounts specifically because they aren't going to be on campus. 

The fact that students and parents don't understand what tuition dollars pay for isn't entirely surprising, but the fact that they don't even suspect that those dollars might pay faculty salaries commensurate with their accomplishment and status seems telling. 

However, it doesn't seem to have occurred to the article author either, which is too bad."

2.  Nothing is preventing you from having highly intellectual conversations at said fast food joint or a local park.  There is also a device called a telephone which enables you to converse.

3.  Again, not attending school on-site is not stopping anyone from calling up a friend at 1:00 AM and meeting up for an ice cream.

I see no reason why schools should be offering a discount unless they feel a reason to do so.  People seem to have lost sight of the concept that the primary reason for going to school is to get an education."
2020-08-15 17:47,"Colleges have been operating as a business and not educational institutions for past few decades if not more.  The problem is that they are trying to maintain their in-person educational system and add another layer of online education.  

Students are paying for the costs of both in-person and an online educational system.  Why should they bear those costs?  That's not their business.  If they are only getting an online education, that's what they should be paying for.  Universities need to layoff teachers and cut their pay and sell some real estate assets.  They operate the system as a business and profit of all the students, so when business is bad, they need to bear those costs and not the students.  Or shut down."
2020-08-15 17:57,"It is not quite as easy and clearcut....Let us assume an institution wants to offer in person classes, then add the inside distancing requirements and you run immediately out of classroom space. A 300 person auditorium will hold maybe 40, smaller classrooms maybe 10 where you used to have a 40 person class. But you still have to pay to clean, and maintain those classrooms. Set up electronics to allow class recording with decent quality. Teaching an online class reasonably well requires about twice the preparation time, recording, office hours, discussions groups, setting up some interaction within zoom.... all of this is immensely time consuming on the teaching side. It is an illusion that just because it is online that it is also cheap to make. Yes, coursera puts out free lectures - they have corporate funding sources. And - is it really going to be a great in person experience to sit in a classroom with masks and social distancing? Everybody being a little tense?

And you cannot fire your faculty - well, one would like to keep them, but not pay them for making online content? And I can hear everybody shouting but why should this be the case, why not fire and rehire faculty? Yes, this is done with adjuncts sadly, but to teach well at the leading edge of your field, you need to develop expertise.

And why is online learning so horrible when everybody is happy to use youtube videos to learn a new skill? From knitting to python programming..."
2020-08-15 18:31,"This is a classic dilemma.
On the one hand, colleges' and universities' costs to provide online education are almost the same as F2F learning.  Sure, some infrastructure cost savings, but also while schools are losing other revenue sources (sports, events, parking, etc.).  And should educators get a salary haircut?  That would be cruel.

On the other hand, students are definitely getting FAR LESS for their higher-education money.  My daughter at the best public university in the land isn't on campus interacting, getting exposure, meeting new people, seeing new things in a different way.  They myriad things a college experience usually provide are simply not available through distance learning.  

I feel terrible for the incoming freshmen who will not have the typical and formative incoming class experience.  This is usually a huge step in a young adult's life and leaves one with cherished memories for life.  So much of my first-year dorm experience is permanently etched into my psyche.  

So parents and students have every right to demand reduced tuition.  

But I see the other side.  Each is struggling financially and deserves redress.  But what would be ideal?  Subsidy from outside would provide the needed relief.  Corporations sitting on piles of cash - made off the backs of well-educated professionals - are the ones who should ""give back"" to the society that enabled them to amass such riches."
2020-08-15 18:33,"If cost were a real concern for these parents and students, then perhaps they would cease prioritizing facilities, new buildings and grounds, and campus life over academics, all of which cost a huge sum of money. If higher ed focused on just its core competencies and felt no pressure to have the prettiest, flashiest buildings and grounds, they might be more able to price adjust. But the customers (students/parents) have long been demanding otherwise. And now they don’t want to pay for it. You can’t have it both ways."
2020-08-15 18:35,"If the cost of a university degree was reasonable than there wouldn't be such an outcry about a refund or discount. The cost of a four year degree shouldn't be nearly $300K,  no matter what school you graduate from unless you are guaranteed employment in a high paying field like medical or dental schools. Even most law  and business schools are way over priced except for the top 10 to 20 schools as there is a glut of lawyers and MBA's and ever diminishing need for them due to AI. The emphasis on student activities, sports facilities and lavish on campus housing is a relatively new phenomena that has driven up the cost of education that the students have to pay back throughout their lives. The ROI for the individual is nearly zero except for the entertainment and comfort provided that is unnecessary but is typical of the instant gratification that is endemic to the modern american culture. It's too late to change this as most of these are sunk costs but unfortunately many colleges will face bankruptcies as the cost vs value equation has long ago become untenable. The pandemic is just going to accelerate the culling."
2020-08-15 18:49,"The value of a college education is both the experience of going, and the value that the degree and degree granting institution confers. 

So, sure, a student is not getting a semester of a Harvard education, BUT they are certainly going to benefit from having a degree from Harvard. 

My MFA is from one of the most prestigious schools in the country, but in my 4 years there we had 5 Chairs, faculty turnover and disenchanted students.... The place was a mess (before a new Dean turned it around). Yet that degree certainly continues to matter in my professional career. That's value. 

IF a student chooses a good school and good major, one semester online isn't going to diminish the value of the degree. Or their education. It stinks- no two ways about it, and offering a 10% discount seems like an honorable thing to do- but let's not put too much on a single semester. 

Besides, if you want cheaper, go to a community college for two years, then transfer to a State School- my most successful students did this and save a ton of money."
2020-08-15 18:50,"The universities are  hard hit and, as a result,  freezing staff salaries and cutting benefits ( no matches for retirement or other funds) and in many cases lowering their match for health insurance. And those health insurance costs may be higher. 

 If parents have already put aside or planned for the costs of tuition, please keep in mind that many of those who teach your young adults are already being hurt. Perhaps professors at Ivy League schools have large salaries. But many, many professors do not.  

When school resumes in person, who do you want teaching your kids? I hope some of you want seasoned professors who are standouts in their field . I do not mean  tenured professors who do little but rest in their laurels. I DO refer to professors who love to teach, have excellent reputations  but are at risk of being let go if tuition is slashed. Some of those professors are younger but with underlying  health risks."
2020-08-15 19:00,"The thing about online education is that I can get it for free, or maybe for $9.99 a month if I don’t want to see ads. I learned multivariable calculus this way from a guy who‘s arguably one of the best math teachers on the planet (Professor Leonard). I’ve also found outstanding free content on physics, tensors, and history. 

The people who make these videos love the subjects they teach, and this enthusiasm is obvious. The  most they ask for is a donation to help cover costs. 

Other very low cost alternatives offer credit for a class: community colleges are one example. 

This is what a university asking for $55,000 is competing with. There are no lazy rivers and no fancy new athletic facilities online. And suddenly, it’s possible to take a class at a community college in New Mexico from your kitchen table in Hawaii. 

People pay for in-person college because it offers more than just information. If the colleges can’t see this, that’s honestly their problem. It’s time for colleges to take a hard look at what they’ve done to create this mess (spiraling costs, too many administrators, student loan debt...). When the pandemic is finally over, the survivors will have to reform."
2020-08-15 19:01,"I am a tenured professor at a large public university. The state budget has been devastated by the present crisis and the university is reeling. I desperately tried to keep my courses “f2f” — students *need* the ability to share thoughts freely and extemporaneously in a personal and relatively intimate space in order to be able to learn.  But when the full extent of the crisis became clear, I moved my courses online. It is the only sensible thing to do.  However, I do not think that it is possible to meet the same learning objectives in an online setting. In fact it is impossible.  My niece was accepted to a very prestigious university for the fall semester. I have advised her to take a gap year.
Universities have embraced a neoliberal model of education as “service delivery” for the past thirty years. The result has been the replacement of full time tenured professors with overworked, underpaid adjuncts, larger class sizes, and a very thick layer of over-paid administrators at the top of the pile. The present crisis has revealed how bankrupt that model actually is.  But the answer is not more austerity and more cost-cutting: our society needs to recognize higher education as the public good that it is, and needs to fund it adequately. Teachers need to be given more support right now, not less (with the administrators sharpening their knives, I can assure you morale on campus is low!). Students should not be asked to foot the bill in the form of bloated tuition payments."
2020-08-15 19:03,"Yes, students, we are in a pandemic. College won't be like it was in the past.  Accept it.  No one likes living through this mess. In the spring, I think we thought it would be under control by now.  But, unfortunately, it's not.  

At the same time, costs to universities are not declining, in fact, as many have pointed out, costs are up due to technology upgrades, and for those trying to bring people to campus, the various safety measures.  And, add to this, for state universities, the declining percentage of state support.  With state budgets stretched, that is unlikely to change anytime soon. 

Most colleges and universities are trying to provide as good of a virtual learning option as possible, while balancing the safety to students, faculty, and staff.  Faculty and instructors are working harder than ever to make this happen.  As a faculty member myself, it adds to the burden in a profession that is generally underpaid.  And, we, too, are living in these uncertain times.  Teaching in person during this could put faculty (who are generally more at risk than students) in jeopardy.

I'm disappointed that adults have not stepped up to the plate and said it's simply too dangerous to have university classes in person ANYWHERE in the U.S. right now.  Hopefully, we will get a vaccine and move past this stage in history.  In the meantime, I think college students should accept that college and universities are generally doing the best that they can, or take a year off."

2020-08-15 18:54,"Conservatives fall over themselves to bail out big business when the least whiff of trouble strikes. Even when there's no problem at all, it's still tax cuts and corporate welfare to the tune of a trillion dollars of wealth transfer every time. But somehow higher education's problems are all of its own making, and don't deserve the same flexibility. What hypocrisy.

Our society has broken down precisely because so many ill-informed folks, who think they know more about economics than they do (much less the many ways universities operate), believe everything should run like a business. The goal of higher education is to create---FOR THE LONG TERM--a productive, educated citizenry. Not to jack a stock price for another quarter of investor satisfaction. Doing so gives back in spades; it's why for several decades we had one of the highest standards of living in the world. For awhile we were all investors in higher education. It worked. No longer, and not anymore.

So here we are: colleges that spend more on gyms than classrooms precisely because consumer-minded parents and their coddled offspring demand those things. Meanwhile, colleges can't rely on public funding because morons in state and federal government never fail to defer long term leadership for short term soundbites. Or even just want a population of unthinking dullards to work menial jobs in our ever-expanding service industry."

All of that is gotten by living on campus and has nothing to do with classes. So how does missing out on CVS connect with a tuition rebate???

Yes, I know she wants it, but the logic fails.

She does save the room and board cost. One can buy a lot of ice cream at CVS with that."

If every college/university employee making over say 175K/year took a 10-20% salary cut (after all they still have their jobs!) and rich institutions dipped into part of their huge endowments, they could easily pass this along in tuition and fee rebates."

A) Purge the bloated administrations of this universities, which have been among the fastest growing and largest sources of cost in the past two decades

B) For those universities that we've never heard of (quite a few listed in this article), let them die. The labor market needs to be corrected where employers no longer demand a bachelors degree as a prerequisite where it's not of high relevance to the job. The way to do this is to let those no-name universities giving out high priced degrees to fade into the dust. If we're being honest with ourselves, you really have no place going to college and can't make good use of a degree if the only schools you're able to get into have over a 30% acceptance rate. The people who really can make the best use of higher ed are the ones who are already competitive enough to get into top 50 schools. It's time to kill the ""you need a bachelors degree in something to get ahead"" mentality, and this is the perfect time to do it... contrary to the whole ""let's make college free for everyone and pay off everyone's debt"" attitude that as of late has become rather pervasive"

2020-08-15 18:41,"There's one thing that I'm surprised hasn't been mentioned in any of the articles or comments on this topic. If you're at a school where staying home is an option and you're on financial aid, staying home doesn't lower your cost one bit. On the other hand, if you're a full-pay student, staying home saves you the entire cost of room and board. Why? Because if you're on financial aid, the idea is that you pay as much as they think your family can afford, no matter what the sticker price is. Let's suppose under normal circumstances the tuition is 50,000 and room and board is an additional 15,000. If they think you can only pay 20,000 of that, then 20,000 is what you pay. But suppose you stay home, so room and board doesn't appear in your bill for this year. Your bill is just for the 50,000 tuition, and they still think you can pay 20,000 of that, so 20,000 is what you pay. But a full-pay student who stays home is having their bill reduced from 65,000 to 50,000 and is paying that new full amount, thereby saving 15,000. One upshot of this is that full-pay students have a financial incentive to stay home during the pandemic but students on financial aid don't. So guess who's more likely to bear the risk of coming to campus and living in crowded dorms?"
2020-08-15 18:34,"Parents should also consider launching a class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration — for failing to react quickly enough to the coronavirus pandemic, resulting in the current disastrous state of affairs for higher education.

It’s a total debacle, one that could have been largely avoided had Trump taken it seriously. No such luck."
2020-08-15 18:58,"Many people here seem to believe that colleges and universities are businesses, and should operate as such. They appear to believe this is a superior model. 
For many entities, it is. However, education is not a business. Professors and college/university staff do not work for a business. They are employed by institutions of higher learning.
Families find themselves in the unfortunate situation of living in a society which now unofficially requires a bachelors degree to allow young people even a chance at a modicum of success. This degree is also so ridiculously overpriced that only the wealthiest (say, those that can pay for $1200 a month apartments for their children in addition to tuition) are able to afford it without going into ruinous debt. The wealthy tend to think they know what the price of every minute should be. It is dismaying, but not surprising, that they now believe themselves to be paying for an inferior ""product"". 
If one wishes to pay for a ""product"", perhaps they should enroll their children in a for-profit venture, such as the Great Courses, Rosetta Stone, etc. Failing that, they should encourage their children to defer admission for a year, when a vaccine is more likely to be available.
Education is not a business. Just like government is not a business, a fact which we are learning, to our mortal peril, on an hourly basis."
2020-08-15 19:07,"I sympathize with students who cannot start at or return to their college campuses. Yes, the experience will not be the same, and they are being short-changed. But not by online instruction. As other college professors have said here, online classes can be just as rigorous and rewarding as face-to-face classes. Also, if students pass these classes, they count toward the same degree with the same university's name on it. So let me ask this: Should graduates who hold degrees for which they took online classes not make as much money when hired for the same jobs as graduates who took all their classes in person? After all, if the argument is that online classes should be cheaper because they're of lesser quality, then isn't the final degree also lesser? Would students and their parents really argue that a degree from Harvard or the University of Virginia or Chapman now be considered less valuable because some students took online classes to earn it?"

2020-08-15 18:40,"I am currently an adult masters student in Denver University’s Online program.  I wanted to switch to the on campus program but thanks to the mismanagement of the pandemic, there is no point now.

Anyone who thinks the vast majority of students are rejecting the enormous price tag of online classes because they are missing the “campus experience” of partying and bar hopping is mistaken.  

In the age of online bootcamps where a full 6 month online education program costs less than $10K, it is hard to justify the price tag I’m paying of over $4K per 10 week class.  Some top universities like Georgia Tech offers an entire online masters degree for just $9K.

If we were paying for the use of campus facilities, the educational amenities, the research and networking opportunities on campus it could be justified.  But asking a student to pay some $25-60K a year to take say 8 classes where they watch some poorly prepared videos and then have a teacher jump on zoom 4 hours a week is basically highway robbery.

The problem for me is that so much outside of classes matters to college students now--not like when I was in college: clubs, meals, parties, study and game spaces, gyms, etc. etc. (I did a lot of reading in my shabby dorm room, when I wasn't working or in class.) Their dorm rooms are like apartments and though I love my students, I'm not sure they need this much cosseting.

I was often mentally exhausted afterward. Individual student tutorials, though, worked just fine online, and seemed even more intimate than usual. Faculty are working harder for their salary under these conditions, not getting a break.

If the students are getting less from it, it is often because they let themselves tune out. Many turned off their video, and I have no idea what they were doing while I was lecturing; others became more passive about class dialogue. The students need to step up to the challenge as well. This semester I'll be teaching hybrid classes, part live and part online, and expect to put even more work into it.

Buildings still must be maintained.  Libraries have tremendous overhead for materials that are not digitized. Laboratories are hugely expensive.  Work still goes on on campus regardless of the presence of students.  

I have little patience with all of you who are complaining.  Education is a tremendous bargain.

2020-08-15 18:31,"Several years ago I was a Graduate Assistant at a major university. I'd also been a high school teacher for over 20 years, and was taking graduate classes to get another degree. My GPA was roughly 3.8, and I was feeling very good about myself and my experience. I was asked to teach an evening class. I spent hours preparing for the class and felt more than ready to do the work. The day before I taught, another graduate student and I were taken into a room by two professors. They closed the door and said, ""This doesn't leave the room, but when you grade your students, give them A's and B's. Don't push it too hard. That's just the way things are these days."" Then the other professor added, ""You didn't hear this from us."" I was shocked. I also ignored their advice and graded the students as I saw fit. I gave some A's, several B's, a couple of C's, a D and I failed two students. Regardless of my high ratings by the students, I was never asked to teach there again. I also quit the degree program. After all, was my high GPA simply a matter of being patronized so they could make money? I think this Covid-19 experience is an opportunity for a great correction in America. Schooling costs way too much, and if people are being patronized rather than challenged, they are not getting the education they deserve. It's time for a reimagining of American education at the university level. Families are right to question the cost of online classes. Indeed, are they really classes? I have doubts."

Not to mention administrative bloat and dumping permanent faculty in favor of adjuncts (55% adjuncts at Chapman according to collegefactual.com).  Lazy rivers, new sports complexes, seven figure salaries for coaches...and education being seen as an “investment sector” have all contributed to this problem. 

Colleges and universities are supposed to educate people and be places for new research discoveries. Had they stuck to this model rather than the current one that glorifies sports and offers facilities better left to resorts, they’d be in a much better position right now.

My tenured professors, from Diplomatic History of Europe to Political Parties, from Government and Administration of the USSR, to Defense Policy and Nuclear Weapons were top notch. UMCP was close to D.C. and attracted great talent in political science and international affairs. The degree was a good investment. Now, on average at least 1/3 of the professors are adjunct and the universities complain of high costs. Who are they kidding? They are not paying top dollar the the most important people - those who teach. How is a struggling professor going to persuade students that their degree is good value for their money? The talent thins when you scoop the desperate and pay them a miserly $3,000 or $4,000 per class per semester. Universities are needed. Knowledge is critical. But the model is broken. My son graduated from The College of William and Mary. His degree cost me (and his mother) a total of $160,000 dollars. If we had not paid for it his students loans would be the size a small a mortgage loan at the tender age of 22. Colleges need to get their act together, revisit this business model, and provide a good service at decent prices.

In recent years while faculty positions have been cut across the nation's campuses, new layers of deans, assistant deans, and vice-presidents of 'fill in the blank' have been added at salary levels that could be better purposed for those who actually provide the intellectual training which is the purpose of college in the first place."

2020-08-15 19:49,"As a college professor, for the life of me, I do not understand how on earth on line learning could possibly cost more than on campus instruction.
All the on line learning technology my schools use are free for (non-profit) universities.
I have yet met to meet a professor who does not have an up to date computer (often provided by the university) and a reliable internet connection.
The person who explained to us how to use the technology necessary for on line teaching is a full-time employee who otherwise would have been resolving problems on campus.

The campus was closed. Little electricity, little water, photocopier etc unused, reduced maintenance and cleaning, the company to whom the cafeteria is outsourced provided a refund.

True, I spent twice as much time preparing and 3 hour classes quickly became 5 hour classes, but as is stipulated in our contracts (I have tenure at one university, but not at the other) we are paid to do a job and not to count our hours. Preparation, research, corrections, meetings - all part of the job.

Obviously, for lab work and certain engineering students, virtual instruction cannot replace the real thing.

But otherwise, honestly, I don't understand where the extra costs come from. Both my schools saved money."
2020-08-15 19:50,"While I generally agree that online education is an inferior method of learning, I find it baffling that colleges (and K-12 schools) cannot figure out how to take advantages of the scale that the digital models allow. 

It’s not as if dedicated online schools have 1 teacher per 10 students. Things like teacher/student ratio CAN be adjusted; if not on the faculty side, the school should be trying to get more students enrolled - even at reduced cost."
2020-08-15 19:53,"The biggest loss is the social aspects - this is an especially significant value add In a higher end school. Not being taught by a TA while the prof is off at a conference isn’t much of a loss. I have recently attended a couple of online technical conferences. While the AV was excellent the complete lack of social interaction significantly diminished the value of the experience. This was compensated by time saved on travel and a registration fee that was less than the cost of one night in typical conference hotel. 

Last time I looked, the supply-demand curve put universities very much in a position to dictate unreasonable terms. With <10% acceptance rate at top schools the price still had plenty of headroom for the vendor. It will be interesting to see if Covid finally breaks the business model."
2020-08-15 20:05,"I have spent all summer on demonstration videos for my class (it's hands-on information). All summer. For no compensation. Which I will do because I want to be prepared.

That said, in cases of topics where hands-on material is being taught, nothing substitutes for in-person instruction. Nothing.

Perhaps topics such as mathematics or history can be successfully taught online, but disciplines where hands-on information is being conveyed, not so much. I understand students wanting some sort of compensation for not getting the full experience."
2020-08-15 20:05,"There are costs other than those on a price tag to consider
I teach undergraduate courses in a business-related area that includes required on-hands labs for assignments and projects.
These are foundation courses that impact skills and comprehension that continue in advanced courses and for the life of the careers these students are headed for.
Reduced tuition fees for teaching and learning these courses remotely won't compensate for the loss of learning vital hands-on skills that resulting in students being less prepared for advanced courses, and for meeting the competition ahead in their careers.
How does one calculate those costs? Those losses?
There was plenty of time to consider reworking curriculum so that students in these types of courses took other courses more fitting to the online experience and hold off on these hands-on lab courses until later on, wherever possible.
However, I am not aware of any school being creative enough to consider alternate solutions to curriculum design, so that reduced tuition now doesn't end up costing students more later on."
2020-08-15 20:08,"“Who wants to pay $25,000 a year for glorified Skype?”

I also taught a graduate seminar this summer and, again, student feedback was very positive.

If instructors are as enthusiastic, prepared, and responsive to students' ideas and needs, the online classroom experience can be quite good.

It's not as good as being in person, but if both the instructor and students are willing to give their best effort, there is no reason why the quality of their education needs to be inferior.  (With the exception of certain subjects requiring work in labs, studios, etc.: the sciences, the fine arts, nursing, etc.).

The large majority of my students remained engaged in my courses last spring, and we had some excellent discussions in my grad seminar this summer. So it can be done. It takes an open attitude and hard work on both the students' and the instructors' parts."

I have less sympathy for the schools. Although it may be true that the cost of converting to online instructions is expensive, the cries of their financial hardship are falling on deaf ears. Those costs should be covered by the school's endowment. 

If a college is in perilous financial shape they shouldn't be in the business of running a school. The stock market is just fine given the initial devastating effects of the pandemic back in March, so unless the schools have hired poor money managers there should be endowment funds available to cover the expenses  cited in this story.

We have designated staff activities leaders, a wellness expert, diversity and inclusion specialists, a whole team of well-heeled fundraisers. It runs much like a bloated corporate headquarters.

Why do universities spend so much on fancy dorms, rec centers, food services,  all arranged on carefully manicured bucolic grounds?  These criteria turn out to be quite important to many perspective students and their parents when making the final decision about which university to choose.  The social (party) scene and a nationally famous winning football program can also be an attraction.  And how many of the students attracted by these ""features"" will really dig into their courses beyond the grade, managing their time sensibly, attend faculty office hours, ask lots of questions in class?

All the faculty at the top-10 university where I work are dedicated and diligent about the creation and development of online learning for students. I am sure it so at universities across the country.

No one is happy about this situation. 

But if we penalize universities with fee adjustments and lawsuits, we may lose the entire system for future generations. While students are learning online, universities and colleges must maintain the infrastructure, continue to pay staff and faculty, PLUS develop online presence. All this takes time and money.

Yes, sure, part of college is the interaction in classrooms and access to labs, the experience of being away from home, the sports, the socializing, the hands-on experiences. No one is taking that away, just postponing it for a time. 

Better that we all look at this as a necessary hiatus and learn from it. The institutions, faculty, and staff are trying their best. Let's work together."
2020-08-15 20:39,"One of the most valuable aspects of a college education is that it enables you to interact on a daily basis with people whose backgrounds, experiences, and beliefs are different from your own. This aspect will, at best, be severely limited for many, many students who are taking classes online or who are living on a campus with multiple restrictions on normal social interaction. If I had a child who was planning to attend college this year I would be strongly encouraging them to take a leave of absence for a year if the school will allow it, not only to protect their health but also to make it possible for them to have a more enriching experience when they do attend their college or university. I realize this is an option that is not open to all, but for those who can do it I think it makes sense."
2020-08-15 20:41,"People asking for tuition rebates are confused about why they pay tuition. Tuition is paid for an education. That education has not changed when classes move to a delivery mode that happens outside a traditional classroom. Professors have to teach in different ways, but most universities already offered many on-line and hybrid learning course options. Students and their families didn't ask for refunds in the past when students chose classes that did not meet in a classroom, so why make these requests now?

I'll go back to my first point: they are confused about the role of tuition. They think tuition covers a college experience (living on campus, going to the student center, seeing concerts on campus, getting drunk with friends at parties, joining a fraternity or sorority). Student fees, which are separate from tuition, cover some of the activities in this list. Those fees aren't tuition. Dorms are charged separately. Again, not tuition. Getting drunk with friends isn't included with tuition. Meeting new friends isn't covered by tuition.

Tuition covers classes and learning. Administrators set tuition costs based on total costs for the university, but the only part of the ""college experience"" included in tuition is access to classes. That doesn't change when classes are offered outside a traditional classroom. I really do feel for the students. The total college experience is important, but paying tuition isn't like paying for entry to Disneyland."

A mid size university has about 2,000-5,000 employees. A larger university around 20,000 - 30,000. What do you want to pay the leaders of these schools? Typical professors have spent >10 years of their lives achieving mastery in their fields.  What should we pay them that would make the commentariat happy?

I'm sure it's possible to receive a fine legal education from online lectures. However, there's an implicit understanding that  academic prestige and networking are the reasons students remain willing to pay so much. Making organic connections with superstar professors is much harder online, as is attending hiring receptions, and interacting with famous speakers. 

To be blunt, online school is an inferior product since it can't fully replicate one of the most important parts of the experience. People are still going into six-figure debt, but without one of the largest benefits from the tradeoff. Students are rightfully angry at this farce. With any hope, the pandemic will prompt a rethinking of the cost of higher education in this country."
2020-08-15 21:01,"As a lecturer, I will not be teaching this upcoming semester.  The extra work required to prepare and redesign the course is too expensive and the pay is extremely low.  In most cases, it less than 2 credit hours.
I have a problem with the cost of US universities, which has no relation with the country median income.  Who can afford $60,000 a year, even if your parents have an income of $200,000, and when the median income is around $55,000?  The price force the next generation to become trapped:  cannot get married, cannot buy a house, take the first job given to pay the loan, and reduce mobility.
I believe we are going backward to the Middle 
Age , who the only people who had access to higher education were either rich or priests.  What a loss of talent!"
2020-08-15 20:47,I love to see the educational model being disrupted. It has been long overdue. Too many sacred cows and costs are too high. Love reading the comments most likely from professors about how people don’t understand. Sorry like other industries that have been forced to be lean you too will be lean. I think the educators are the ones that don’t understand. Technology and efficiencies are coming for you!
2020-08-15 20:49,"Look no further than the way financial aid is doled out, no questions asked.  

Decades ago when I was in college, there was a hard cap on a relatively low amount of federal student aid you could get and students and colleges needed to live within those constraints.  No more. Colleges simply learned how to game the new financial aid environment at the expense of students both being able to and encouraged to take on too much debt. Colleges have perfected capturing all of the “consumer surplus” of this reckless financial aid they teach in their Economics 101 class, ie follow the money. 

Fix it by simply restricting the source of easy money for colleges while at the same time protecting students from the unintended consequences of taking on a ridiculous amount of student debt."
2020-08-15 20:56,"College has been overpriced for decades. 

Spending on sports and other non-educational activities had perverted the experience of going to college with misguided spending budgets. 

Overpaid presidents, staff, and the tenure system has guaranteed to keep the price of admission escalating. 

The pandemic should be an opportunity to reflect upon these practices and make adjustments. I hope the students and parents of today are up to the challenge."
2020-08-15 21:05,"Well I am a Professor and the parent of a college student. We are paying high rent for an apartment in Berkeley CA that we can’t get out of. We are paying full tuition.
I am spending an insane amount of time to get my classes ready for zoom.
Universities still need to pay salaries. I am hoping the coming cuts are restricted to administrators rather than teaching faculty and the IT people who make off of this possible."
2020-08-15 21:06,"Non-classroom learning can be a very efficient way for motivated students to cover vast amounts of material. It’s what I did in the first 2 years of med school: powerpoints and recorded lectures, studied at home, with time to stop and look up things as needed. Sequencing multiple consecutive lectures for the same class gave better continuity. As I got more efficient, I stopped going to class, and my grades improved. I went to class for only one faculty member, who was an exceptional teacher and where the in-person lecture made a difference.
On the other hand, if the goal is the actual process of thinking, investigating, and learning how to debate, how to question, and how to follow scientific inquiry, how to manage challenges and disagreements, that does require interaction with others, and there is no substitute."
2020-08-15 21:08,"These schools need to reevaluate. 

First, many of them have endowments that are huge. What exactly is that money for? Do they think that they will have earned goodwill by doing what they are doing now to continue to build those funds? No. 

Second, while many of these schools (Columbia was one) dangled and promised at least some in-person learning, they pulled the plug at the last minute. Many of the students, if not all, had rented apartments and entered into leases in reliance on the representations of the schools. This is detrimental reliance, and is actionable. 

The schools should be revisiting their decisions. Long-term thinking is required and large discounts to compensate for what is missed as part of the school experience. Otherwise, those class actions will likely be successful and result in the same outcome without any of the potential goodwill from trying to get in front of the problem. The action they take now will result in either a positive or negative outcome; delaying a tuition increase, for example, as a way to compensate for going to 100 percent on-line is insulting. 

The schools that can afford it e.g. endowment rich schools, should be free or maybe a small tuition. The rests should reevaluate their programs and what their long-term goals are and consider substantial modifications. Maybe their models, that include huge salaries for staff, are the problem. Maybe their sports programs are too expensive. Maybe they aren't viable."
2020-08-15 21:03,"The upper echelon of colleges serve the ruling classes. 60% of students at elite institutions are scions of the wealthiest 1%. The so-called world class education they obtain there is a shell game. These rich kids party and cheat their way thru undergrad years, forming exclusive cliques, with internships and 6-figure jobs secured thru family connections. The undergrads from the lower 90 percentile get to parlay their degree and 50-100K in loan debt into a barista job at Starbucks paying $15 an hour."
2020-08-15 21:03,The cost of higher ed is a run-away train that is running out of track. The pandemic has highlighted in the last 6 months what we have been living through for the last 40 years. Profits over people.
2020-08-15 21:07,"The tenor of these comments is truly sad. The negative view of parents and students as entitled, pampered and selfish for feeling that their needs in this pandemic should also be considered is disheartening. The fact that so many of the people espousing these thoughts are educators is even worse. Many commenters disparage parents/students as only concerned about the physical plant for parties and clubs etc. However that completely ignores the fact that there are actual ""facilities"" - laboratories, libraries, studios, theaters - that are vital for certain disciplines and absolutely cannot be replicated with an online experience. The suggestion that students take a year off and ""travel"" or get other experiences DURING A PANDEMIC when the American passport is worthless and internships non-existent is equally myopic and selfish to an extreme. It presupposes that those opportunities exist for those who can still afford them (they don't), that most students on financial aid could do that (they can't) and that universities would allow it for every single student (they won't). If that's the answer, then the universities should have just all closed for the year. Completely. We will start up again in 2021 and the professors can just wait to be paid."
2020-08-15 21:12,"My sons graduated from two schools mentioned in the article.  Rather than saddle the men with an enormous debt, I took on the vast majority of the cost using federal loans.  These federal loans and the amount allocated for students have fed the universities to raise prices to fit the funding: all boats rise in a tide.  My sons had great experiences and are happy and productive.  But schools lamenting about costs with no real evidence (a survey is not evidence) and not discounting for online classes shows how out of touch the academe remains."
2020-08-15 21:08,"Grade inflation is just universities (and high schools) reacting to the pubic's wants.  Grade too harshly (while accurately) then increase the chance of lawsuits.  In high school (where I've taught for 22 years) parents increasingly cite schools' and teachers' failures over their own students' poor effort.
 Then there are the ethereal 'School Ratings' that were driven by politicos saying The Public deserves to know schools aren't wasting money (which helps Politicos get votes) but having a ranking system - a system that does include the lack of [parent involvement, parent/student discipline, nor student efforts]  as why a schools mark is low. Nope, it must be all the schools fault. Well, being a school Admin is a job (from State all the way down to a school site) and folks want to keep their jobs. So... why is anyone surprised then that schools 'inflate grades' to counter the lack of [PI, PSD, SE]?  The public folks (homeowners especially) want to see a good rating number for school rather than a low number. 
Ultimately, the public demands for easy accountability without funding these demands is what got us to this place of grade inflation."
2020-08-15 21:16,"The author neglects to mention the significant cost savings these colleges will realize by not opening up the classroom buildings on campus. Electric, water, heating, security and maintenance costs will all be a fraction of what they would normally be."
2020-08-15 21:16,"Covid has completely disrupted the educational business model and it will never be the same. Barriers to entry into a college have come tumbling down as each and every university has forced classes on line and the campus experience has been eliminated from the experience and the applicant's calculation. Now, there is no excuse for limited enrollment. Why can't Harvard admit everyone now that there are no classroom sizes? And why can't the cost of that education dramatically decline given the new reality?  Few can afford the escalating cost of tuition among private schools, let alone the Ivy's.The ongoing pandemic will force all Universities to end their aspirational tuitions or lose enrollment to smarter, less expensive schools. The value of an Ivy degree will decline along with the absence of the in-persons networking opportunities  which are the primary, if not only reason applicants seek admission. Schools will have to focus on only their primary mission: education. After Covid, will things return to what was normal in the past? Perhaps. But I doubt it."
2020-08-15 21:31,"What many people fail to realize is that with the move towards online instruction there are more costs associated with offering classes.  At the same time there is less revenue in the form of dorm fees, etc. This is putting institutions of higher education- especially the public funded ones with lower tuition costs - behind the financial eight ball.  Instead of fighting over tuition we are counting the savings we have from not paying cost of living expenses associated with living away from home.  

Give universities a break.  They are scrambling to get classes online, redoing their pedagogy, losing revenue and funding research into Covid all at the same time."
2020-08-15 21:35,"This is such a hard thing, for students, parents, college presidents and provosts and their staff, and faculty. None of it is easy. i'm a professor at a small liberal arts women's college, yes, an elite one, and I must weigh in about my experience as I taught online from March last fall, and now will do so again.  Everyone wants it to be in person--but it is not our fault (but our government and its failures and the failures of those who insist they have freedom not to wear masks or distance), and the costs have to somehow be borne. People have been furloughed at the college, students are unhappy at having to have a remote fall seminar. Totally understandable. But you also need to know not just the enormous costs involved in putting things on line, training, sanitation, etc. AND what us faculty are also doing above and beyond. Last semester, I not only taught all my classes, but made myself available to talk to my students individually whenever they wanted.  I gave them my cell phone. They could text any time, but even more important I let them face time with me for as long as they wanted.  I also have continued to do advising to them over the summer, to anyone that wanted to talk. There are ways to make this work. Next fall, I will do everything to make myself available to my students, so they can have as intimate and personal experience as possible. They are our future."
2020-08-15 21:36,"This might be glib, but...

2020-08-15 21:28,"The article quotes a Seton Hall professor as saying universities are having to resort to mass faculty layoffs. Leave the faculty alone (tenured and non-tenured). Whack those bloated administrator jobs, cut the huge salaries of those coaches (in Div I football programs, for instance), and dig deep into your endowments to come up with the cash. Cutting faculty and essential staff who keep the campus running should be avoided at all costs."
2020-08-15 21:19,"I hope the Times will follow up with a detailed survey of college and university enrollments sometime this fall, well after the start of classes.  Will students pay-up for a watered down, online experience at their primary institution, or will they opt for a cheaper alternative, at least for this year?"
2020-08-15 21:27,"I'm a staffer at a university. My thoughts after reading this (and after I calmed down) are:

1. College is overpriced not because of classes or actual research services. They are overpriced because of mega-gyms, rec centers, overpriced layers of administration and sports. Get rid of the sports.

2. If I have to hear one more undergrad whine about missing out on the social experience I'm going to vomit. Not because I think that's unimportant, but we're IN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. We all miss our friends, family, concerts, cookouts, etc. But guess what? We need to put on our masks and stay away from one another for a while so that we can return to doing those things in whatever form they will eventually take. 

3. Tuition refunds and cuts will mean one thing: staff job cuts. I had so many colleagues at my institution and others go through a summer furlough. They were unemployed May, June and July. Trying to get unemployment benefits. Working part time jobs. That's part of why there's been a mad scramble with re-opening. There was little planning because no one was working! And big cuts in fees and costs will hit the staff and lower admins and the adjuncts. No one else. 

4. Any student who says an online class is a glorified Skype as no appreciation for modes of learning, knowledge and expertise, and frankly should go do something else."
2020-08-15 21:39,Higher Education at higher cost is no longer feasible . Covid 19 has brought the equation into focus. Now let’s see how our colleges and universities respond!  They are experiencing the same impact live streaming has had on other service industries.  There are no sports or  campus experience to sell and like other brick and mortar businesses must re-examine their pricing.
2020-08-15 21:40,"“We are paying a lot of money for tuition, and our students are not getting what we paid for."" It's a good point, but as a part-time college instructor, I can tell you that teaching remotely affords no shortcuts or reduction of time and effort on the part of those doing it. The class discussions I led were the same on Zoom as they would have been in a classroom. The amount of time spent grading and commenting on student work was the same. And office hours were held online. Nothing can replace the experience of being in a classroom, at least I hope not, but I am certain my own students did not learn less online than they would have in-person. What they're missing out on, then, is campus life -- cramped dorms, bad dining-hall food, and making the best friends they'll ever have. Calculating what percentage of the college experience that is and then putting a dollar value on it won't be easy."
2020-08-15 21:41,"Come on, no one is going to pay full price for online courses, especially with the price schools reached lately. They will be lucky to get a quarter of the $50,000 and that many charge now and that will be basically just for the school name on the degree."
2020-08-15 21:41,"My job is to create online curriculum for higher education. I've been doing it since 2004 at dozens of universities, including Johns Hopkins. To be sure, the overwhelming majorities of institutions going online are doing so with very little in the way of instructional design or faculty training. Because online education is so different in its delivery requirements, in order to make a positive online experience for students and faculty, the administration must be trained, there needs to be a centralized leader with authority, and faculty should adhere to best practices as outlined by research. They usually also need 6-9 months of development time with an instructional designer to make an online course, in addition to the costs associated with purchasing additional technology to support the endeavor.

Because of this disconnect, I believe most consumers have every right to question the level of education they're getting. Online education is every bit as rigorous as the best on-ground examples in almost all subjects, but without committing the resources, the probability that a crisis will shutter the doors of dozens (if not hundreds) of institutions is unfortunately high. It has been shocking to see how little prepared our institutions are from this crisis: I honestly expected much more demand for instructional design the longer the virus lasted. Without students, schools cannot exist."
2020-08-15 21:42,"I'm a professor at a college that will be online in the fall. I've spent the past two months attending all kinds of virtual training sessions for online pedagogy, and technology, so that I can provide an excellent class for my students. I am not paid in the summers. I expect I will be devoting at least double the number of hours I usually do this semester for my teaching, if last spring was any indication. If students make the effort (meaning that they show up for class, do the work, and take advantage of the many office hours provided) they should get a lot out of their classes this term. For those of us who are knocking ourselves out to try to make the best of a rotten situation it's incredibly disheartening to hear the griping from students and families who place a whole lot more value on the perks (fancy cafeterias, posh dorm rooms, midnight runs for ice cream, sports, etc. ) than the actual academics."
2020-08-15 21:35,"My college student is remote learning now.  I’ve seen the difference.  I will happily pay full boat for his degree, & I will be happy about the airfare, bus fare, & housing expenses I am not paying out.

Bless the educators.  Show some empathy & respect."
2020-08-15 21:15,"What is one paying for when one coughs up the tuition at a school like Harvard?  First and foremost, one is paying for community.  The community of scholars is critical, but even more important is the community of classmates, the people one is going to encounter for the rest of one's life.  

For this, in person education is vital.  On line education simply cannot provide the excitement, the community, or the knowledge that in person education supplies.  

The idea that schools are charging the same for in person and for virtual education is offensive and ludicrous.  It also makes them hypocrites.  They know that the Harvard (or Yale, or Princeton, or any top school) education is not the same when it is long distance.  Asserting that it is just as good, and worth just as much money, is a lie.  And Harvard knows it.  What's the point of being on campus at all, if long distance is just as good as being there?  

The bottom line is that any school that pretends that long distance is just as good as being there has revealed itself as selling a name on a diploma, and not an education at all."
2020-08-15 21:51,A big part of the college experience is the transition to independence- undergrad offers an expensive sheltered environment for students to spread their wings with plenty of safety nets. Parents don’t mind casting them out of the house for similar reasons. Taking this angle away makes it feel like less of a ‘bargain.’
2020-08-15 21:49,"The scam may be over.
   Our elite universities no longer simply teach a set of professional skills to students, but waste far too much of the students' time teaching the professors' personal politics.

    And since progressive-Marxist professors team up to keep non-Leftists untenured, the faculties end up with far less than even a tenth of them not being dedicated hard-core socialists or worse. 
   Periodic surveys of faculty member often find as many admitted communists-to-Marxists as moderates-to-conservatives.
   Lets Defund Universities."
2020-08-15 21:49,"University of Vermont actually raised the Comprehensive Fee and no tuiton reduction. Burlington, Vermont real estate market is based on student rentals.

2020-08-15 22:08,"Just because a product is expensive to create, it doesn't mean customers are willing to pay more for them.  And typically the more that a customer pays, the more the customer demands.

So it can be true that both colleges are incurring more costs by offering courses online AND the students are willing to pay even less.

That's just the way things are.  Some colleges will have to fold and some students have to trim their expectation of what a college is."
2020-08-15 21:16,Finally! The nytimes is talking about this. I was screaming back in March that I’m not paying for remote learning!
2020-08-15 22:18,"I understand about some of the salary issues and this is an excellent time to reign them in. Still, universities and colleges are trying to protect their entire staff and professors, building up keep and all other overhead for when this is over. And one day it will be. Do these same parents want to settle for Skype then? I didn't think so."
2020-08-15 22:23,"The delivery cost of a University education is not fixed. Like everyone else in the world, professors are having to work harder and smarter to adjust to meet the needs of their students. Why should we feel sorry for them?  Business owners are working harder and smarter too in meet the needs of their customers...only they don't have tenure. Education is a product that is now being delivered via an online channel that is far cheaper than the overhead of a building: many of which has been on campus for years and were paid for long ago. Of course students and parents have a legitimate gripe with schools not adjusting tuition while reaping the rewards of a lower cost structure. They are getting ripped off."
2020-08-15 22:34,"This conversational thread is proceeding as if we are talking about any cost/benefit analysis in any sector of the economy. Professors say they are working hard; administrators say the costs are virtually the same or even more online. What’s missing is that we are talking about a sector where price inflation has vastly outstripped wage growth over the last four decades. Who has $250k sitting around to pay for a child’s education over a period of only four years? And for multiple children? Incredible disconnect between cost and ability to pay, rivaled only by healthcare. The industry has been honed over the years to extract money from the middle class. And now they expect you to pay the same amount to sit in a bedroom? The sooner the reckoning for higher education, the better."
2020-08-15 22:37,"Just wondering among those demanding lower tuition/fees because college/university instruction has moved to an on-line format, how many are willing to take a significant pay cut while they're working from home.

Show of hands?"
2020-08-15 21:12,"A degree from Princeton costs 300k and climbing. If you want to be able to say for the rest of your life you graduated from an Ivy, pay the money. No one will want to hear you whine about Covid ruining your college experience."
2020-08-15 22:41,"University professor here. I have been working nearly around the clock all summer to redesign, rehaul, and thoroughly enhance my courses in order to teach them online this fall. I am full-time, tenured, full professor, over 35 years experience, teaching at a private research university in the northeast. My employer just cut my retirement benefits and froze my salary, in addition to cutting off access to my research funds--just when I needed them the most. I am only paid by my employer for nine months of work, but I put in twelve months of work every year (grad student work comes due in the summer), especially this one. My salary has grown by tiny increments (with the exception of a 10% raise when I was promoted to full professor) since the last recession of 2008. What used to be called ""cost of living increases"" are not referred to as ""merit raises."" They are consistently 2%. I work in a Humanities discipline. Just wanted to clarify that my students this fall will definitely be getting their money's worth because online instruction is not, by default, inferior to in-person instruction. I'm making sure it will in fact be better. Just FYI."
2020-08-15 22:46,"The answer to this is obvious and one that the schools will not like. Who needs 1000 different colleges trying to teach introductory chemistry online? Each school could offer a small number of classes, scale them up, and let their students take classes from other schools also. A school that focuses on physical sciences could furlough their english department, and accept the english credits from schools that choose to focus on that area. Keeps costs down and provides the best of each subject. Of course when the pandemic is over students might just decide this was a better way to go about it anyway."
2020-08-15 22:55,"I would be most concerned, from an educational perspective, about trying to do lab courses online. You can’t distance learn  or organic chemistry lab. Science students in particular have a reason to question the value of an online education. Also gone with online instruction is the ability to complete research alongside university scientists, which many of my friends who went on to obtain PhDs counted with introducing them to a love of their subject."
2020-08-15 22:31,"Why not have colleges float their own loans, backed by their endowment? If that scenario, colleges will be cutting costs including lazy rivers, multiple associate deans for social justice, and beautiful new buildings. And they will concentrate on teaching, instead of indoctrinating students about intersectionality. As it is, they have no control of costs, and they have abandoned education for ""Social Justice Sunday School."" No wonder people don't want to pay."
2020-08-15 22:50,"I teach at a major urban university. Demographic cliff of less students was 2025, accelerated to today. Add in less foreign students due to Trump, and many less Chinese students due to Trump, who all paid full tuition, it is the perfect storm indeed. Add in cheaper available online education and it is a hurricane.

Republicans wrongly believe college teaches Marxism, so there will be no federal help. Without advanced education, the US will fall further behind in tech, patents, etc. Recall the GI Bill accelerated US dominance.

As colleges became virtually all in one enterprises offering everything from food, gyms, housing, education, social services, medical care, clubs, big sports, it was bound to fail. The gilded part will fall away, as it always does when anything gets bloated and too costly in capitalism, and the many, many colleges will disappear.

Creative Destruction? or Academic Obliteration?"
2020-08-15 22:28,Families should have rebelled against the cost long ago.  The student loan(AKA Loan Sharking)  program allowed Colleges to increase their fees way beyond the rate of inflation.  Each school undoubtedly has a Dean for every day of the week as well as coaches for every known sport.  What is lacking is a commitment to learning.
2020-08-15 21:54,"I am flabbergasted by the statement of the college president that reducing his own salary from $720,000 to $576,000 constitutes a ""brutal"" cut.  If a college is going to take truly drastic measures like freezing new hires and ending the retirement match to employees, then administrators should be taking severe cuts as well.  If the president reduced his salary by 75%, to $180,000, he'd still be making a lot of money, and most Americans would be thrilled to have to get by on that.

The harsh fact about colleges and universities today is that they are not run for the benefit of the faculty (an increasing number of whom are poorly compensated adjuncts) or the students (whose tuition continues to rise well above the rate of inflation).  These institutions now exist principally for the benefit of the administrators."
2020-08-15 22:50,Very happy that our last of three college students is entering his Senior year at a SUNY school. My heart breaks for incoming Freshmen. Their college careers will be tortuous.

2020-08-15 22:45,"I’ve had discussions with my son who is half way through a liberal arts degree and we’ve come to the conclusion that he’s not going back this Autumn. And it was me who was pushing him to drop out. My eldest went to Oxford with tuition at around 12,000 dollars a year, it was difficult to understand why an obscure college in New Jersey cost almost 6 times that much before coronavirus, and now it’s plainly obvious that American University rather like American healthcare is vastly overpriced."
2020-08-15 23:17,"Students need to skip a semester or two, that will show the schools the seriousness of this. Even if they do offer a discount having classes on Zoom is not the same thing.  They should skip a semester regardless of what the school does."

2020-08-15 22:29,"Frustrated that university costs 60k a year? Well what did you expect when parents and misguided politicians (looking at you, title 9) forced the university to be a school, a private police department, a private mental health clinic, a private health club, a grant factory and whatever else rolled into one? Education is practically an afterthought for university level leadership now."
2020-08-15 23:26,"I doubt many parents knew the actual pre-COVID quality of their children’s college education or the lack there of. They only knew what they paid or borrowed and assigned a perceived value. Many parents may have wanted their kids out of the house and ensconced at college. It is probably shocking see the kids hanging around the house while they are paying full price. It is not a huge leap to get to the idea that full-price, online distance learning is perceived as less than. Fears are not rational."

The formal transmission of facts from textbooks is only a small part of what students pay tuition for.

I say this as a retired professor who has taken many online and in-person classes in recent years to keep my mind active.  Watching online lectures is no substitute for being in a small group discussion classroom setting.

The networking and resume building is what you pay for at elite universities.  Does anyone believe that the success of Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates was based on the content of math courses they took at Harvard?"
2020-08-15 23:39,"As a professor at a very non-elite community college, my concerns are different to those of high-reputation private universities. A lot of our students turned their video off during online classes last term, became apathetic very quickly, and many slipped through the cracks. In my faculty, we are trying our best to overcome with what we have. The question shouldn’t be: is higher education still worth it? The question should be: which (often the first in their family) college students will have their future lives and careers permanently altered through a lack of in-person support? The pandemic is here, is real, and if we value people’s lives we need to teach online. But there will be grave academic casualties beyond the inability to throw a kegger, or row crew, to be sure."

Let me explain. I retired after nearly 40 years of teaching at the collegiate level. On-line classes require more effort and time to develop, teach, and administer then do regular classes. A question posed in a classroom is answered, and all students hear the response, some of whom had the same question, but did not ask. On line, responses tend to be to individual students, even though they have the same question. Not efficient.

Same teachers deliver the same content, there are still office hours, and assignments to read etc. If anything it costs more: universities and schools (mostly) don't use Skype. They use fancy softwares with hefty corporate subscriptions and high quality teaching tools embedded.

As for the brick and mortar portion: yes the university will save some on electricity, water etc. But buildings still need cleaning and maintenance, nothing is being sold, buildings will need to be heated in the winter or pipe will freeze and risk bursting, and these bathrooms still need flushing if we don't want water to stagnate and legionnaire's to erupt.

College professors that receive full salary and benefits do need to teach multiple classes each semester. Or, if a college uses an adjunct professor to teach and class and pays her $10,000 for the priveledge, then the student should only pay about $400 for that class. Assuming a class of 50, this gives the school a 100% profit margin.  5 classes in a semester would be....$2000. Throw in a technology fee of $500 a semester for full time students, and a full load of 15 hours ( 5 three credit hour classes) a semester comes out to about $2500/semester. Now lets throw in more money for the school,, another $1500...I am still getting $4000 a semester, or $8000 a year.

2020-08-16 0:14,"The recent ""collapse"" of higher education in the response to the pandemic, has pushed colleges (and probably any educator above the elementary grades) kicking and screaming into the 21st century. Many educators are complaining that it takes tremendous effort to generate content for on-line classes. I have no doubt of the herculean tasks that were accomplished by a variety of educators, but a curiosity arises in that each lecture is now set in digital stone. Five, nay ten years from now that lecture will still be just as viable and alive, as when it was first delivered. From time-to-time, it might be tweaked, or new material added but the basic lecture will remain intact. The hard work is in creating the content fresh & new, after that it’s a matter of careful revision and/or editing. In the new digitized class series, the typical instructor would have time after each lecture for a live-chat Q & A session. Not everyone taking the class would be able ask a question, like the TV Show ""Jeopardy"" - 1st to punch-in gets to ask a question, freezing everyone else out. Perhaps the most interesting item in the digital class system is how much ""paperwork"" (when its digitized, it will still be known as paperwork) the instructor can grade. The  digital class system will allow a class sizes in the thousand plus range per instructor.

As for the added costs of online teaching (I need to be convinced about that), how about cuts in the administration: do there really need to be so many vice presidents, vice-provosts, and chief  officers, not to mention high-paid coaches (no intercollegiate sports this fall?

The best thing we can do for our children in this precarious moment...is be a role model for clarity, courage, and common sense and say no to a ""real"" college price tag for what amounts to as a limp, impersonal, disconnected virtual college experience and education.

Instructors cannot freely move through the room to drop in on group discussions or provide individual feedback. I return to the classroom in just over a week, and I’ll be standing behind the podium (the only place I can be while maintaining 6-feet distance) while my students are logged into Zoom from their desks (the only way to feasibly do collaborative work when they aren’t allowed to gather or move desks).

2020-08-16 1:30,"A recurring reference in the article is that remote learning has a high initial cost. That may be true, but people don't buy something for its cost - they buy it for its value. An on-line learning experience is not as valuable to the student. The interactions aren't as smooth, body language can't be read, and the informal and unplanned conversations even during lectures are less likely on Zoom than in person. This isn't anyone's fault, but it is still true. That is the disconnect, and the schools need to address that or they aren't providing the same value.
And yes, University is vastly overpriced for a wide array of reasons, and some of those extraneous costs will need to be cut to get the price back in line with the value provided. That is the business side, and that is ""management's"" responsibility. 
Most of the things I remember about school all those years ago happened outside class, but the in-class education got me a series of great jobs and the wealth to educate our children. The students need to absorb the fire hose of information for their futures, and the schools need to figure out how to make it available.

None of them said their product was the same - and having two kids in high cost higher Ed right now I can tell you the product is inferior.  They have spent decades talking about the total experience as key to the value of what is already an artificially high price.  Now that is all gone, so we are supposed to forget all that messaging?  The basic rule in any business - and lets all admit education is a business these days - is if the product quality declines the price should follow.  

All the educators spoke about (except one) was their cost not the students experience.  We will all overpay this year because of little or no alternative and the bait and switch of the last minute move to online.

2020-08-16 1:42,Having worked in the higher education sector I’ve seen the shift at schools first hand where they are replacing retired full/time faculty with adjuncts or shifting the work to other full time faculty. Along with that scenario there has been an increase in administration positions that have nothing to do with providing students education. Many schools also were not equipped or designed to offer online instructional learning i.e. small 4 year institutions. The transitioning to an online model in a short period of time this spring was very rocky to say the least. For those families looking at costs this fall have your children take courses online through a community college here in NY they are well established and definitely not as costly. Most if not all credits should be transferable and if they’re not maybe those are schools not to support or go to in the first place.
2020-08-16 1:47,"I think it’s worth mentioning that a major cause of the insane increase in the cost of higher education is the (perhaps well-intentioned but economically misguided) flow of federal student loan money. The fact that unemployed 18-year-olds have been approved for billions in student loans over the past 40  years has guaranteed a constant and ever increasing flow of money to schools who cannot help but adjust their budgets accordingly. The skyrocketing cost of tuition is a natural result of this kind of contrived economics that allows a school to overprice their product, and sell it to people who neither know the value of what they’re getting, nor are able to actually pay for it with their own money... until they finally do so many years later with interest. The bloat of college administrators and campus amenities is due in large part to the student loan money tree.

The USA offers neither. These are fundamental structural problems which along with others like tying health care to employment and lack of infrastructure investment has lead to where we are today as a country. The idea that we can simply return to ""normal"" once Biden takes office is ridiculous. Unless these issues are addressed our nation will collapse.

2020-08-16 1:59,"If businesses have decided that 16 years of education is required for most jobs in this country I would suggest that they start to subsidize the costs of a college education by paying their taxes in full instead of begging for breaks every chance they get.  Two reasons for my suggestion: many jobs do not require a college education and in many cases college is merely an extension of high school only more expensive.  Another, even more important reason is that most of what passes as a college education now is not what college is for.  

College is where students are supposed to hone their intellects, explore, learn more about the world around them, and not need remedial courses to get to the college courses.  I graduated in 1980 and even then there were plenty of students in need of remedial courses because they hadn't learned enough in high school.  

We do colleges and students a disservice when we force every student into ""higher education"" whether or not their interests require it.  We would do better by students if we provided them with a better education in grades K-12 rather than tacking on an extra 2-4 years or more.  Why should any young adult graduate with debt that cannot be forgiven, that will affect their  career choices, and shouldn't be there to begin with?

If universities give you rebates and their costs are the same or higher then the only way to make up that money is to fire the people who teach your kids.

University of Akron anyone? ""Come to our newly gutted university for the experience of a lifetime.""

Think hard before you ask for something that will produce results that you will not like.

While you are at it, consider voting for state legislators who actually value education."
2020-08-15 19:11,"I am flabbergasted by the lack of compassion from some of the comments here. I am a musician who attends one of the top performing arts schools in the country and no amount of Zoom anything is representative of a proper in-person performing arts education. Musicians can’t play in orchestra, we can’t play in small groups, and we can’t even play with a pianist if school is fully online (this is a significant issue because much of our individual instrumental repertoire that we study with our private teachers is written for our instrument with piano accompaniment). Yes, the diploma we get will be the same piece of paper whether the education was online or not, but it is entirely unfair to demand the same amount of money for a massively reduced educational experience. My school is not offering tuition deductions nor did they allow incoming first year Masters students (like myself) to defer their education—we would have to drop out and reaudition for the highly competitive program next year. So I am in the position where I am starting my graduate degree online and taking out loans while at least 25% of my degree will be severely compromised in terms of quality. How is this okay?"
2020-08-16 4:07,"I find myself having little sympathy for either side. Parents are complaining for the wrong reasons - they are misunderstanding what they’re actually paying for, which is a curated education, interaction with professors, access to online libraries and archives, networking with peers and faculty, and of course a degree - and colleges are charging high tuition for the wrong reasons - they’re spending all their money on administrators and sitting on their endowments while continuing to exploit instructors and short-change students in the same ways they did before the pandemic. 

There are several fields of study that may indeed make no sense without human contact and direct engagement with materials in a laboratory setting, just as there are many businesses that find themselves shuttered right now. There are students for whom it will make more sense to take a semester or two off than to get an inadequate education in their major. But at a time like this parents shouldn’t get angry at the college for what the pandemic is doing to all of us.

Colleges, meanwhile, have to start investing in their instructors and maximizing the online experience for their students. They need to fully commit to the adjuncts who are doing the heavy lifting and start realizing that students can no longer go into debt to fund their unsustainable business model. 

Both sides are delusional and will be shocked into a reality check at some point in the coming months."
2020-08-16 4:24,"My son will be living in the dorms while taking class online.  Missing any school to wait for 'normalization' is an opportunity cost he nor I can afford.  A junior, he will graduate into a job market that will not care if he  took Cost Accounting online.  It will only care that he has a degree.  Indeed, remote work is here to stay, so why not get good at it in school? Of course we are not happy about digital learning.  But delaying graduation is not an option.  The decision to go to school is simple math.  As for those not attending, great.  He'll take your job gladly."
2020-08-16 5:34,"Teachers will have to more, nor less work, to deliver online teaching. So costs cannot be cut. Maybe, in the future accommodation should be let to other to manage, so kids can deal with shark landlords in the wild, but otherwise the machinery needs keeping going."
2020-08-16 6:32,"My undergraduate final Senior semester tuition for 18 credits in Spring of 1975 at UW-Madison was $324 (I completed my BA Degree in just 4 years). 
 Thanks to bureaucracy and too much middle management tuition at this land-grant university, along with State funding cuts, have made the choice to attend  college a difficult one. Of course, the banks are more than happy to loan money to attend. I wonder, is it worth it now that on-site instruction has, for the most part, ended?"
2020-08-16 6:57,"As an instructor at a large public university, I can say that online is not a glorified Skype.  Our faculty has spent many hours learning how to effectively teach online (none of which we have gotten paid for).  It takes MANY more hours to put together an online course (which we don’t get paid extra for).  We would love to go back to all face to face too.  It is much harder to teach when you have never seen the faces of your students."
2020-08-16 6:58,"What are the various functions of a college education? Among them, most of us would recognize (1) forging independence by developing important but mundane life skills, (2) fostering social connections, (3) accumulating broad experience by trying rarer activities, (4) having access to extra-university programs like international tours and professional internships, (5) mastering technical skills through classroom instruction, (6) orienting oneself via the liberal arts, and, of course, (7) graduating with the now employment-requisite diploma.

The current world-wide situation is an opportunity for many young people to ask themselves whether universities are the _only_ way to achieve any of the above functions or even the _best_ way. I myself am baffled as to why the American concept of college has basically strangled out of existence all other possibly more creative or more practical or less expensive avenues of education, edification, and instruction.

Let's give apprenticeships and community colleges and company-sponsored research institutes and indie graduate-school-like programs and education bootcamps and rigorous tutoring sessions and city-sponsored reading clubs and self-learning with independent accreditation, etc a real chance.

How is it that that field that's meant to promote innovative thinking demonstrates so little itself? Why do people who prize the expansion of horizons limit themselves to the confines and homogenized red tape of 21st-c. big-box universities?"
2020-08-16 7:15,"I became a research scientest (Ph.D) and am in the thick of the covid 19 recombinant RNA vaccine research at a major university lab. I learned Biochemistry while riding the Coney Island to Manhattan D train while working, and learned physical chemistry form textbooks while riding back and forth on Amtrak from Penn station to Drexel University in Philadelphia. Night schools, used text books and desire and I have mostly Harvard and Princeton postdocs reporting to me every morning. People who pay large sums to go to Ivy league schools are part of connected rich man's tradition to try and make social and professional connections and maybe not have to learn biochemistry better than everyone else. Buy some used books open them and learn the material better than anyone around (and save your money)."
2020-08-16 7:25,"I think this will have a long-term negative effect on colleges. Parents will soon figure out that they're paying a lot of money even when their kids go to classes, and enrollment will drop (it already has). 

We wouldn't have done anything differently, but many families would and will. College enrollment will drop significantly. Many schools will shut their doors, and many others will cut costs in various ways that will hurt the students."
2020-08-16 7:36,"Several readers who teach at the college level write that it costs just as much -- more, actually -- to prepare and teach a course on-line rather than in person, and that they're not paid extra for this. I believe them. 

What's the inevitable result? Teachers will expect to be paid more, and so many schools will simply close their doors. There are several lines of work I'd not like to be involved in right now: restaurants, bars, hair salons, nail salons, commercial and residential real estate. I'd add colleges to that list. I anticipate that many of them will close."
2020-08-16 10:10,"The degree is not about the education but about the networking, more than anything you want to get the right credentials. I get it: I have those ""right"" credentials that the right name brings. That price of admission is score results, extra-curricular activities and a heap of student debt.

Stripping away the ability to network with fellow students and alumni makes this a whole lot less attractive a proposition."
2020-08-16 10:52,"For most majors, I'm not sure what the ""on campus"" experience is.  Drinking on Friday night?  Football games on Saturday afternoon?  A fully funded vacation from your parents?

2020-08-16 2:41,"I understand the students and their families. I will say as a tenured college professor who makes 70K I have been working non-stop the entire summer, teaching online is a lot of work, if done right, ... on top of that faculty were told we had to teach additional classes at no extra pay, lost all of our funding, my stipend for extra work was cut while I still have to do the work ... guess who is not making any sacrifices ... administration, they keep their cars and homes paid by the college, their salaries that are 3 times mine. And yes the fast majority of these administrators are White heterosexual men. Many of them also have done additional work, but never that much to justify not making any scarifies. And the cherry on top, in the midst of the pandemic they hired yet another (unqualified) White heterosexual man, gave him a gigantic house and a very, very generous salary. So students and families, please join your faculty in calling attention to this inequity."
2020-08-16 9:41,"University presidents make hundreds of thousands a year while the people who teach most classes (graduate students- I am a one) earn $5,000-$20,000. Don’t let them fool you into thinking you must pay now to ensure universities still exist when the pandemic is over. It’s a pyramid scheme. The higher ed system relies on exploiting adjuncts at one corner and students at the other while administrators sit on top in their mansions. Let it burn."

Make them job offers subject to their salary and benefit proposals. Hire based on technical as well as financial merit. The public will see millions in savings.

Name professors send minimum wage graduate students to run their undergraduate classes? Of course. All across the land. Get a graduate student and pay for a graduate student. Let their true students pay their true cost. Let those who get the big shot's time pay for the big shot's time. The pubic will see millions in savings.

Universities scam students big time."

2020-08-16 9:26,"Much of the higher education industry has become bloated at all levels and costs have run amuck. At the same time, the real value (rather than the resume-anchoring value of the big name schools) has significantly declined. Go to a good community college, learn some professional skills and avoid the choking debt that the industry has demanded of its customers."
2020-08-16 7:01,"The amount of fees has gotten unbelievably ridiculous especially when you don’t get any value from the fees. The “athletics” fees of almost $800/semester are just criminal. You should be able to choose whether u pay to use a college gym and we shouldn’t have to pay for athletics scholarships. When did that become ok to do to someone just looking for an education as economically as possible? And now that u can’t even go on campus and the sports are not happening, they STILL won’t refund the fees. The industry needs a strong pricing overhaul ASAP especially since a lot of the social unrest is due to not being happy with one’s lot in life. This just makes bettering urself even more out of reach. Why isn’t anything done about this from a legal standpoint?"
2020-08-16 10:25,"I am flabbergasted, each time I read about the American College System and the high tuition costs and fees in 2020.  Annual college fees as high as an annual salary ($65000)... how many parents can afford that?!?  Who can afford that?!? Only parents who are very well off. An anual salary of $720.000...serious?!? That's completely out of proportion. German Chancellor Angela Merkel earns 283.100 Euros per year. Just as a comparison. 
Higher education should not be a private issue, costing families huge amounts of money or that leave you heavily indebted after graduation. Americans need to take to the streets and demand free college tuition and fees at public universities."

2020-08-16 6:54,"Pre-college education is the solution.
I am retired professor (chemistry) who taught graduate   and undergrad classes (  10 students in Chem 401 up to 530 students in Chem 101). As anyone knows, there is no “magic personal experience “if size of the class is more than thirty. 
Let us change the entire system by scheduling all freshmen classes on line and let us  introduce pre-college education by;
•	Admit everybody who applies, no SAT, no essay, just high school diploma
•	Stay at home -no campus presence needed
•	Cut tuition to 1/5th of present cost. Even better charge per credit not per semester.
•	Schedule regular exams during pre-college terms (lasting one or up to two years)
•	Admit into further, regular college education those who make the cut based on their cumulative grade achieved during pre-college terms, and on number of admissions that college can handle while teaching students in cohorts smaller than 30 participants. Charge full tuition.
There are disciplines (medical, chemistry, engineering, music, theater) where “hands-on” experience is essential, but that instruction can be deferred to later years of study. 
I need not to enumerate advantages of this proposal. Yes, college sports and couches will suffer. Many will enroll in Ivy League (but few will make it). But we will again educate the brightest, motivated and those who can not afford it at today ‘cost."
2020-08-16 6:52,"Good. Colleges will learn to cut out the fat and become financially viable. All those tenured  faculty members making millions need to accept pay cuts. New gyms need to be slashed, instead junior faculty need to be hired and actually given healthcare (what a concept!). Wake up call for colleges. Has been a long time coming. Tuition costs need to come down."
2020-08-16 5:46,"Absent massive government support, there is no good answer here. Most schools are non-profit, but that doesn't mean they don't have to pay their bills - for the now empty classrooms, stadiums, residence halls, and a million other expenses. Plus faculty and administrators. I think this may be an extinction event given this administration and the Republican Senate."

I don’t get it."
2020-08-16 11:11,"Teaching online is harder for the professor and requires many more hours of work. While it's different from what students and parents expect, at the college level it can work. Professors need to be paid. If colleges and Universities are ever going to reopenfully and normally, they need to be paid. In my town of Middlebury, VT, the college is the main economic driver. Close it down and hundreds of folks are with out jobs that can not be picked up in another sector here. Town folks don't want the students back because they fear the virus, but down town merchants need the students back. It is very very complicated. Frankly, these complications would not exist if the government had developed clear nationwide policies for dealing with the virus and we, as a country had flattened the curve. I blame Trump, his front enablers and the GOP senators. Of course they are only interested in no one being liable."
2020-08-16 7:33,"One thing to remember in all of this is that the tuition money does not go to the professors, but to the ""business"" that has become most universities and private colleges. There are very few permanent well-paid positions for professors anymore. Phd's struggle to find job that pay enough for them to live. After 10 years of education, you wonder if some don't feel suicidal that they gave so much to have a career that doesn't exist anymore as such. Jobs are scarce, in the US, in other countries like France, as well.  University classes are taught mostly, in many institutions by adjuncts or grad students, in precarious, badly paid posts with no benefits, who barely make enough money to have a roof over their heads, and some don't even. The inhumane workload they take on to make ends meet leaves no time for research, which is important to advance in, and have mastery over complex subjects. The real scandal is that the money people pay for college and complain about does not go to education, but to administrative bloat, and to making 'playgrounds' to attract well-to-do students. There is no investment in quality pedagogy or giving professors correct working conditions to do their jobs in. France is perhaps one of the worst with only tiny amount of permanent positions opening in the whole country each year. A majority of university classes are taught by adjuncts whose state-mandated wages haven't gone up in years, but at least tuition costs little, even if the situation is shameful."

2020-08-16 3:23,"This is my family in every detail.  My college junior despises online learning.  In summer session he's already had one moderately ok and two terrible experiences with all-online classes.  As the parents footing the bill, it feels like essentially flushing tens of thousands of hard-earned dollars down the toilet.  As someone who has had to move my own business almost entirely online, I feel acutely how unsatisfactory it is.  Nobody's happy.  I suppose he'll get a degree and I suppose we'll look back on this one day with a chuckle and a shake of the head but it's quite painful right now.  Hopefully this crisis will result in some creative solutions."
2020-08-16 3:52,If this continues into the spring only the very wealthy and the people on full scholarship will continue to pay for anything beyond state school.

Meanwhile, some of the world's most advanced countries -- Germany, Denmark, Finland, etc. etc. -- have basically tuition-free higher education.  (And Canadian provinces provide budget-priced, equivalent post-secondary options.)  Taxes are levied, kids go to public schools and take exams, and those qualified and interested register for university.  They study, they work, they graduate, they move into the workplace.  Pretty simple, really.

Next point:

1. Sign here.
2. College gets government money today
3. Student gets the government  debt for years& years . 

Colleges should finance or be on the hook  for 25 to 50% of a students borrowing for an education . They have no risk or “skin in the game” as it is now.

Million dollar salaries for coaches and administrators, unnecessary  redundancies, and expenditures that have nothing to do with academics are a few of the problems.  “According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, prices for college tuition and fees were 1,411.16% higher in 2020 versus 1977 (a $282,231.63 difference in value).” This is a wake up call to an industry that has inflated costs way beyond reason."
2020-08-16 4:25,"I had a family member who went abroad to England for a semester.  The UK charged something like 8k in tuition for a semester at their (mostly publicly funded) school.

The elite private school that my sister went to obligingly paid her tuition in England, then turned around and charged her full price tuition (roughly 30,000), pocketing the 20k difference.

A few years ago the NCAA was looked at as a mostly benevolent institution, and today I think we’re a lot wiser.  I think we might be on the cusp of a similar revelation today about college tuition as a whole.  We basically have the worst system possible, where everyone ends up paying the most they can afford - because colleges put up a totally unreasonable sticker price then give discounts in the form of “aid”.  Any economist would recognize this as perfect price discrimination, which is actually revenue maximizing for the colleges and ensures that no one gets a good deal.

Colleges burn through money at an unreasonable rate and have become very good at soaking their customers.  How would this year be any different?"

It is certain that peer to peer learning is very effective. I found this to be true when learning to fly.  It explains why my fourth grade teacher would ask me to teach Chester to read.

And in many state universities, the administration is an enormous enterprise - at the Universities of California it is nearly 50% larger than then the faculty body. Oddly, those in administration are simply unemployable outside the university system and often are recruited from poorly performing faculty and cast-offs from the corporate world. Never mind that administrators work only a few hours a week. There are many other substantial expenses such as beautification of campuses that make the tuition costs high."
2020-08-16 12:43,"What we are seeing here is that universities and college have lost all good will from students and parents after decades of above inflation rate tuition increases. Charge $80,000 a year and students will naturally expect a luxury product. These institutions need to dip into their endowments, including asking donors if they are restricted. If not now then why have these tax free funds. Universities that do the right thing and lower tuition will get rewarded with alumni donations. Faculty are working hard but so will students who will need to work to pay off bloated loans. I’m still bitter that my Ivy League alma mater raised tuition by 4% in 2008 during the financial crisis knowing full well students were going to have to pay this with interest given the bleak job market at the time; I haven’t donated a cent since graduation and never will."
2020-08-16 13:50,"After two degrees at an Ivy and then U. Chicago, I see the issue of high cost relative to the quality of education.  

During the undergraduate years, students may sit in classes of 75 or more students and see the professor in front of the lecture hall twice a week for 75 minutes each.   No time for questions during class and the two hour weekly ""recitation"" session with a first year grad student is a poor substitute.

Undergraduate education in the U.S. at the ""elite colleges"" needs an overhaul.     

Somebody is making too much money (profs and/or administrators) for the services provided.  Professors teaching the same course material year after year.

Too much focus on elaborate sports facilities and arcane research. 

To charge the same amount for a Skype or Zoom class?    Better for the students to take a ""gap year"" and let the colleges think about their business model."

For us, it's the breach of contract that's the point: for whatever reason, and through the fault of none, what she signed up for isn't on offer. The campus experience, meeting up with friends, helping out at the lab - all gone. Glorified Skype indeed. The piece of paper at the end of it really means extremely little; it's how the university experience helps prepare our children to lead us into the future that matters. In the meanwhile, fees that reflect more a sharing of the burden seem the right way to go: half off perhaps? Best wishes."
2020-08-16 14:35,"I find this conversation on tuition discounts frustrating and frankly an indictment of our broader societal norms. We talk about how we need to ""all be in this together"", but as soon as it effects ""me"", individuals demand compensation - that is not ""together"". Every aspect of all of our lives right now is different, it is just the way it is. I can assure you that the leaders of any university, like the leaders of any business, are spending sleepless nights trying to save jobs, spending millions of un-budgeted dollars on new infrastructure to keep their institutions open, and ensure that the version of their college on the other side of the pandemic is the same one that all of their alumni know from pre-pandemic. If you have made a commitment to an institution of higher learning, be a committed member of that community and partner in it's success, not act like a consumer looking for a monetary compensation to every line item that seems subpar to the traditional experience. These institutions need our support to get to other side - and if you feel that strongly about the current experience you always have the power to decide to do something different until you feel the value is commensurate with your expectations."

So far we have seen no announcement of a voluntary pay-cut, just a salary freeze (Bloomberg 7/29/20). Nor any announcements of administrative cuts—why this institution still has a dean for “global engagement” when none of my students can study abroad escapes me. There are plenty of places to make up for losses in tuition and fees if only the boards of trustees and top-heavy administrations were willing to tighten their own belts."
2020-08-16 11:45,"The educational model in America is antiquated, extremely expensive, and broken.  Virtually everyone sites to the positivity of the communal out of family home living arrangement provided by colleges.  This needs to be separated from the educational experience.  A very large number of college classes are symposiums of 100 plus students, with little advantage whether viewed live in person, live via Zoom, or on demand at a later point.  Testing and grading papers can all be done via computer based technology.  For some upper level courses, or majors that require small individualized classes, a limited live experience could be presented.  For those who want group communal living, this could be done literally anywhere.  An approach like this would slash actual education expenses by 80%, while making the communal living option a cost for only those who are willing to bear that expense."
2020-08-16 13:04,"Reader comments reflect considerable and understandable emotion on both sides of this story. Still, I was disappointed that the Times story provided little of the backstory on the run-up of tuition costs. Over the last 50 years, college tuition has increased by about 20 times (+/-) while general inflation has increased by about 10 times. I believe a large part of that excess growth has been to cover the cost of ever growing college administration staffs, rather than growing teaching staff. Indeed, colleges have too often tended to hire ""adjunct"" faculty to cut teaching staff costs. Couple this background with the fact the average American family is not much better off today than 50 years ago and you have a situation ripe for strong emotions. Add in the effects of the pandemic and students and families reach the breaking point."
2020-08-16 14:32,"Gosh, could our higher education be failing to educate the next generation at a fair and equitable rate? Are there too many expensive administrators with their hands in the till? Are other countries educating their citizens at a fraction of the cost?

3. Pay attention to what worked for you in this new mode, maybe even better than regular format.  Consider by class, by professor, by methodologies used, by lots of criteria important to you.

At the end of this 1 semester, add 1, 2, and 3, and make your decision for your next step.

It’s a step.  This is not an all or nothing life decision.  Look how quickly things change!  Everyone and everything are our teachers, and we’ve got a big lesson in this really hard disappointment your facing. 

One last thought: when you’re applying for a job in the future, how will you say you used this critical time?

The question of $100,000 professors fueled by student loans raises the prospect of reducing loans along with 'forgiveness' already part of the Dem. program. Calling in outstanding loans and 'adjusting' the amounts and the ability of the student to repay them will probably be considered by Congress..........of course, Dem's will probably borrow more from China or print more' triggering inflation.  Obscure curriculum tracks, esp. at trad. liberal arts colleges like Bowdoin College may also go, but with a billion dollar endowment it could withstand this financial crisis a lot longer than other colleges and universities. 

The College is now deserted with on campus learning for first years, off-campus D.L. for 2nd and 3rd years, and mixed for 4th years.  The virtual graduation for the class of 2020, will be held in person in 2021.....they hope."

It is true that college expenses have gotten out of hand, and that it is due mostly to administrative bloat and too many capital expenses  unrelated to education (like climbing walls and lazy rivers).  This in turn is the result of the US having an oversupply of universities.  They're all competing for fewer students, and so that causes them to make more amenities to attract students, and pay more money to more administrators to save the school from bankruptcy.  That in turn raises tuition, which discourages enrollment further.  A vicious circle.  And doomed.  The virus is simply speeding up a shakeout that started with the shrinking number of students about 10-15 years ago."

Empathy would be greater were the difficulties limited to college students. Additionally the great and steady whine (not to be confused with activism) emanating from that population is nothing new, it merely has yet another cause.

Of course this is a gross misrepresentation of any number of students. Tough... what's good for the goose and all that. When in-person class is in session, these same students will complain about having to attend and long for a more modern approach.

I submit what will be taught, and one hopes, learned this semester is how to adapt. But, frankly, I don't think much of this matters since they already know everything there is  to know, anyway."

They blame it on NY quarantine issues, but that's been out there for weeks.  Furthermore, out-of-state families have gone to great lengths and expense to comply with the quarantine, renting apartments and/or housing in NY where they could quarantine.

Then, once they had collected everybody's tuition money, they pulled out the rug from under these young women.  Other schools have offered the chance to defer once the terms of their school year have materially changed.  Barnard refuses.  Instead, they're offering a $90 credit toward the ""comprehensive fee"".

It’s obscene that education is prohibitive, even state/city public colleges and universities make it hard for students with their costs .

The bottom line goal of higher education is to prepare students for the future. For most people that means the work world which has also undergone a massive shift as well to remote/distance. Stories about higher education often seem to miss this connection… whether its teaching hands-on skills or critical thinking or fostering creativity, higher education is meant to prepare students for life after higher education. The reality is that many of the skills that students will need to develop now in order to succeed academically online are the same skills they will need in the work world of the future. 
I would be more interested in stories on ways that colleges are innovating and using this opportunity to prepare students for the work world they will be facing. The schools that will survive are the schools that can be flexible and adapt to these changing needs. Yes, the college experience will change but going back to the way it was even a short time ago won't work. A fundamental shift has occurred on a global level and we need to be preparing the workforce of the future to succeed. How higher education will do that is the real question we should be asking."

I would wait until you see what you get and then decide. I understand US tuition is exorbitant compared to what we get in Canada but that means these schools should have even more resources to make this work.

Second...why would they need more aid, when they can stay home and keep their costs low? You can't have it both ways. Online learning might cost more for the university as they have to train professors to properly create online courses, pay more for licenses etc, but it should cost less for students (outside tuition, which goes to pay the universities increased costs) because they don't have to travel, pay for housing or food. This is general of course, maybe some students don't live at home, but look, everyone is hurting. Better to get out there and do some school than not at all. Lower tuition and more student aid likely means sessional instructors and graduate students get shafted. That means fewer courses available. And it spirals and then you don't have a university education at all."

Now. This semester, not sometime in the ill defined future. My grocery store is open every day. I stopped by CVS this morning to pick up a prescription. Hospitals and doctors' offices have been open non-stop. I can get my hair cut and my car repaired. Teachers are an essential service and they must teach.

And active learning, engaged with others, is key to mastering meaningful knowledge and developing critical thinking. 

It seems to me that an answer is for rising frosh to take a gap year that provides a safe, in-person experience (but not in a classroom). there are many such experiential and place-based gap year programs (Full disclosure: I run one, called CityGap-NYC). Why not take a year to explore, learn and connect to a smaller group of rising college first years, rather than pay full college tuition for ""weak tea?""

They never stop doing research, reading current publications, advising student organizations and working on committees for improving the university."" Yes, yes, yes.
When I first read this article I was appalled that Shawn Hubler didn't address the most important player in higher education: the professor. Yet a parent is quoted as mourning that her child with be missing out on the experiences of college like going CVS at 1 am to get ice cream with your roommate. What?!
I had the honor of teaching a summer intensive for a major liberal arts college a few weeks ago and it was an extraordinarily rich experience. We grew close, had in-depth discussions and everyone was surprised at the quality of the experience. Why? Because the faculty came together to discuss every aspect of the courses and how to best utilize Zoom. We must stop talking about higher education as consumer driven product because it diminishes the real purpose of education - to learn to think critically, to articulate difficult ideas, and to develop intellectual and emotional skills in order to contribute to a civil society. 
If this limited discourse about education keeps up, there may be no one there to teach the students when they return."
2020-08-16 15:47,"Several of you complain about college coaching salaries being in the $1 million range, while a college president making that much reflects some special talent, and is reasonable.

A successful college coach brings in a lot of money for the school, and has demonstrable, visible skills, both organizational and human. If the team has too many bad seasons, he’s gone.

No one knows  exactly what a ‘successful’ college president looks like. They all do pretty much the same things - hire expensive consultants, reduce proportion of tenured faculty, start the same new programs that other schools are starting, cut the same programs that other schools are cutting, put up shiny student facilities they can’t pay for, and so on. 

If they lose students, or research productivity goes down, they are not fired - there are external circumstances, demographic and cultural trends they are not responsible for, always an excuse. They are at the top of bloated administrations, most of the members of which could disappear and no one would notice.

Afterward one of my online professors emailed me to say he was teaching my ideas; nothing like that happened after eight semesters of on campus reading.

I was very impressed when the Prime minister of New Zealand announced that all in parliament would give up 20% of their salary for a few months. It is a strong, if symbolic sign of solidarity.

It will not matter if students graduate at some point far into the future. The coronavirus has interrupted life, and there will be a scarcity of jobs for college graduates until vaccines are solidly on the market. 
Maybe some students should switch their future educations to public universities, accept lottery scholarships (and keep them), do on-campus work study, become a residence hall advisor, and apply for various scholarships within their major course of study. And there is always ROTC, which pretty much pays for everything.
College doesn't have to be so expensive and students do not have to be saddled with years of debt. But determination is required.

Parents are being robbed of their hard earned money while their children are merely losing four years of earned income and being brainwashed by neo-marxist professors into terminal self loathing. If Covid-19 helps bring some sanity back to higher education, it will all have been worthwhile."
2020-08-14 18:17,"FINALLY AN ARTICLE ON THIS. Out of all the pandemic has exposed about our health care system this is the most significant. We have been unable to coordinate large scale studies, in a rapid manner, to confirm/deny safety and efficacy. Additionally, the most “promising” treatment, monoclonal antibodies, are just now undergoing clinic trials. That is NUTS. Antibody treatments have existed for over a century, and are widely regarded as safe if not always effective. Remdesivir was given emergency approval in late May after large trials. Several other drugs have gone through similar trials with varying results. That said, the most “promising” of all still hasn’t, because Big Pharma cannot put a brand name in front of it and make billions. It couldn’t be more ironic that the treatment for the virus lies within us and not a lab."
2020-08-14 18:19,"As a nation lacking political leadership, we the people need to somehow unite, pick a date, and all agree to hunker down for two weeks to put an end to this madness.  Dr. Fauci, can you suggest a date for our consideration?"
2020-08-14 18:29,"I have been running clinical trials for over 28 years. Pharma trial sponsors invariably present the most optimistic, pie-in-the-sky forecasts for study subject enrollment, data capture, data cleaning and final results. 

Everyone needs to take these promises with a truckload of salt, because clinical trials rarely, if ever, enroll as fast as predicted a priori. And these days the challenge is even greater."
2020-08-14 18:52,"The recruitment problem would get much worse once FDA gives an emergency use authorization for such treatments. After the emergency authorization, it would become much more difficult for double-blind clinical trials to recruit new patients, for no one interested in getting it would want to face the possibility of being given only placebos by enrolling in a double-blind clinical trial anymore. Hopefully the FDA thinks this through and will be vigilant in gathering data to fairly assess such treatments’ effectiveness versus their possible side-effects before granting any emergency authorization."
2020-08-14 18:55,"Is an encyclopedic article like this needed to tell us that studies on monoclonal antibodies will take longer that thought initially?Better would have been a short article with diagrams, illustrations about these products and how they work.  The article may earn high praise from some but for others, as myself, it is tedious to read."
2020-08-14 19:14,"Most clinical trials, per the FDA, require a random double-blind study with multiple recruitment sites.  One premature dose or course (even for compassionate use as Merck did with Keytruda) could seriously damage the share price if failure ensues. But patients cannot indemnify the researcher from litigation or they will not get into the trial  Most patients seeking early access to a life-saving medication with a truncated trial history or a predetermined success rate midway through a trial are told in detail orally and in writing what the potential side-effects could be. All of which include death. The patient must sign off on this document. They never describe the process as ""pie in the sky"" - particularly Big Pharma. I say this from firsthand experience with both the FDA and many Big Pharma companies in the U.S."
2020-08-14 19:22,"But, we hear no such challenges from the leaders in the vaccine race. I wonder if they have their own challenges that are slowing their progress or is this specific to these two companies?"
2020-08-14 19:25,I had high hopes for Monoclonal antibodies. They have been extremely effective against Ebola and more recently showing promise against yellow fever. It has become difficult to do studies for all the reasons stated. We are struggling with vaccine studies too in terms of enrollment. While studies are always difficult to conduct the infusion of politics into drug  effectiveness clearly creates distrust between the study subject and the investigator.
2020-08-14 18:25,Who'd have guessed there would be reluctant patients to be the guinea pigs for a fast tracked experimental drug. Shocking.
2020-08-14 18:28,"The real experts always said ""Do not expect a vaccine before 2021""; but America is the  Amazon  Mentality of  ""I want it and expect to have it tomorrow"".    Wear your mask; Social Distance; wash your hands.    Boring and slow...but...effective.   Ray Sipe"
2020-08-14 19:12,Didn’t we see this one coming! A country that couldn’t make toilet paper for the better part of half a year and still can’t make any kind of Lysol or much needed N95 masks for the general public is trying to get complicated medications and vaccines out fast. Good luck with that. We’ll probably have herd immunity (paid with many deaths) before any of this comes to fruition.
2020-08-14 19:19,"Trump's Operation Warp Speed seems to have crashed into a meteor.  How offended the president must feel to realize that scientific inquiry has to follow its own time line before safe and reliable therapeutics can be made available. Too bad, Mr. Trump. Science has dealt you yet another blow."
2020-08-14 19:30,"Trump could have ramped up testing months ago, but he was in full denial mode. So now vaccine dev is held up. But they can spend $760 billion a year on the war department and nuclear weapons to kill people. And now his enablers won’t give working people $600 unemployment benefits. The Senate is off on its summer recess. They should have their pay docked."
2020-08-14 18:39,"Warp Speed, Russia is administering a vaccine (untested) now, billions being ladled out to pharmaceutical companies for vaccines that do not exist, try the malaria drug, how about some injectable Clorox, etc. 

So many of our citizens have been encouraged to buy into magical thinking by the clergy and politicians, so many expect instant gratification in spite of the long history of how vaccines and other medications get developed. There is a vast army of childlike adults who are about to be very disappointed as the battle against this virus drags on and the deaths and sicknesses pile up. And still the monster in the White House sells deny, deny, deny the obvious ways to mitigate this unfolding disaster."
2020-08-14 19:15,"Infusion?  This is not a good treatment for early cases for many of the concerns already described in the article, such as where to get the treatment.  There is also no mention of the cost and who would pay if this is approved.  

Since the NY Times and other major media have turned their backs on cheap pills that are already approved, because Trump suggested them, we have lost a real contender.  Then again cheap generics won't bring in the cash that patented IV drugs or vaccines will, so that is a strike against them too.  This pandemic is being run by people who have let political and financial concerns drive the response.  Not all the mistakes are being made by the White House."
2020-08-14 19:26,"Google or one of these tech giants should make a website where I can find out where to go to enroll in a trial and how much I’ll get paid for it. 

I tried enrolling but gave up after going in circles around horrible government websites for about 5 minutes."
2020-08-14 20:18,"There are other companies working on drugs developed specifically for the treatment of covid-19.

For example, Molecular Partners in Zurich, Switzerland is  working on a drug with anti-viral effect.  The drug uses a molecule to block the S protein that the coronavirus uses as a key to enter the cells.  

Phase 3 trials will start in autumn.  They will collaborate with AGC Biologics of Germany to manufacture the drug.

Let's hope they succeed!"
2020-08-14 20:25,"“I guess in my hopes and dreams, we enroll the patients in a week or two, but it’s taking longer than that.”

Yup. I run clinical trials for a living. Well thought out logistics are critical to execute an efficient trial, but even with the best laid plans...trials are tricky things. I find executives rarely want to hear these realities. 

With testing and supply shortages, plus an overloaded health care system in the locations that are ideal to run the trials...the delays should have been apparent. I’m running into the same issues in my professional life. I’ve been waiting for this article."
2020-08-14 19:54,"Note that the NYTimes is trying to make Trump's great accomplishment of ""Operation Warp Speed"" look bad by citing the minor problems of a few second tier drug manufacturers. At the same time they say nothing about the soon to come certified vaccines from Moderna and Phizer. Why? Because they know that the only answer to this problem is going to be a vaccine and all this piffle over masks and distance and closures is nothing more than political bickering and biding time until the vaccine is ready. So you watch, when the vaccine comes out NYT will run articles questioning it's effectiveness. Keeping society in a perpetual state of fear plays well for Democrats."
2020-08-14 19:56,"So, yet again our efforts to deal with this virus are being hampered by the availability of widespread testing with quick results. That has been a chronic problem since late February. Then it was understandable. Now, nearly six months later, it's inexcusable, but also predictable because we're led by an idiot who continues to insist that lots of testing is a bad thing."
2020-08-14 20:01,"I hope people realize this article is about therapeutics, not a vaccine."
2020-08-14 20:11,Remember folks. Trump administration is in charge. Expect nothing but excuses and failure. The labradoodle breeder is still working with the Eli Lilly drug lobbyist at HHS. The vaccine research expert is demoted.
2020-08-14 19:40,"This excellent article neglects to mention that there are also clinical trials to test whether Vitamin D can reduce the likelihood of severe complications of COVID.  See, for example, this recent article in “The Scientist”

Note that people in nursing homes and prisons (hotbeds of COVID) are unable to go out in the sun, so supplements are necessary.  Supplements are also necessary for people with dark skins, for whom UV exposure is less effective for Vitamin D production.

Vitamin D tablets of 1000 or 2000 IU cost pennies a day, are completely safe, and are universally available.  Everyone should be taking them!"
2020-08-14 20:00,"Aye Captain the plasma conduits are gonna need to be matrix inverted and routed through the phaser array or we canna get warp speed!

See, it’s easy to explain!"
2020-08-14 20:15,Even if the vaccine is made mandatory under penalty of prison I will go to prison instead of receiving the coronavirus vaccine.
2020-08-14 20:37,"I work in clinical research, and politics aside, the likelihood that there would be a vaccine that had undergone Phase I-III trials with complete results and had FDA approval Q3 or even Q4 of 2020 is a one in a million chance. Frankly, having a fully tested and approved vaccine by Spring of 2021 will be a record, and highly ambitious. I will be shocked if any drug company develops, fully tests, and gains approval for a vaccine this year. (Again, this has nothing to do with politics, rather it’s science, and clinical research realities.)"
2020-08-14 20:38,"Trump recently learned a new word for him "" therapeutics"" and has said these drugs to treat Covid are promising and will be available ""soon"" (kind of like his  beautiful affordable health plan that will cover preexisting conditions). Monoclonal antibody treatment sounds compelling but is it realistic to expect trials to be completed 8 months into the discovery of the a disease? How much do you expect the drug maker to charge?   Remdesivir is  priced at more than $3,100 for a course of treatment-- and has only been shown to reduce hospitalization days from 15 to 10 days  in moderately ill patients and does not to cure the disease. The monoclonal antibody treatments will likely cost more than that. We can get face masks at $.08/mask and universal mask use will stop the spread of this infection.  Timely use of face masks and social distancing  will prevent airborne ""novel"" viral infections in the future and obviate the need for therapeutics, ICU beds and ventilators."
2020-08-14 20:46,Another side effect of the failures of the Trump Administration to respond based on science.    The inability to turn around lab tests haunts us.  People are also listening to Trump and likely will be unwilling to take the vaccine because of his anti-science approach.   We are going to be grinding away at this for months.
2020-08-14 21:01,"This article is not about vaccines. It is about therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, for use in treating people who are already infected with the virus. These need to be tested on people who currently have an active infection with the virus.  Vaccines are not antibodies themselves, and are intended to prevent infection in people who have not been exposed to the virus previously.  In theory, it should be possible to test treatments much more rapidly than vaccines, because you need many many fewer subjects, since they all already have the virus. This article is about why testing treatments is not as easy in practice as in theory."

Phase III trial currently going for Severe/Critical.  Are lives worth more than profits to big pharma.. stay tuned. !"
2020-08-14 21:11,"We are a failed state. Seriously, is there anything our country has done right in handling this pandemic?  I have had my eye on these trials for a few weeks. Immediately after the 4th of July, Regeneron announced their phase 3 trial, with the hope to have results by end of the summer.  A drug that might relieve suffering and death. But because our hospitals are overwhelmed with covid patients, we can't do the clinical trials?!?!?!  Where is the outrage in this country?!?!  It was so critical for us to open bars so people can drink and socialize; hospitals get overwhelmed with patients, schools are experiencing difficulties opening safely, and potentially life saving clinical trials can't get done because doctors and hospitals are swamped.  Can we be any dumber, more selfish and incompetent?"
2020-08-14 21:16,"Too slow? No, it is being rushed much too quickly. I would never get a vaccine that hasn't gone under stringent testing according to protocol."
2020-08-14 21:32,"Leronlimab, for all practical purposes, has been shown to be effective as three day turnaround for covid 19.

2020-08-14 22:07,"So many of the delays, missteps and misstatements might have had a legitimate explanation because of the unprecedented aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic. That was many months ago. Now, data are emerging that should sharpen and improve our responses and if anything, accelerate progress in controlling, treating and preventing the spread of disease.

Instead, milestones are being missed, from testing to tracing to treating Covid-19.

Off-target strategies will always happen. But the entire private and public medical establishments have been shocked and outraged at this administration's failures in leadership ignoring the data. Except perhaps for CDC."
2020-08-14 22:24,"Forget the other complaints about FDA approval, who didn’t read the article - the underlying issue is the same that is plaguing the entire US response: not enough testing resources, overwhelmed medical staff just trying to keep up
with incoming patients, such that proper clinical trials are the last priority, because too many Americans still refuse to practice caution, or continue to deny the virus is real.  Or are forced to work in hazardous conditions to avoid losing job, pay, or medical benefits (if any)"
2020-08-14 22:44,"Let me, a medical professional, correct some of the misconceptions readers have. There is a rush to develop vaccines and medications. That does not mean these drugs are not undergoing the same rigorous testing that they usually do. It means drugs developed for COVID-19  treatment are pushed to the front of the line, ahead of other drugs for other illnesses that were developed before the pandemic. The FDA is not taking safety shortcuts. 

I am a traveling healthcare worker who just enrolled in a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine study. For those of you in healthcare, please consider participating in a study. There is no risk to you, as these vaccines are synthetic, and you are compensated for your time and travel. Clinical trial labs badly need healthcare workers to join Phase II and III clinical trials since we are the profession most often exposed to the virus."
2020-08-14 23:53,How can they develop an antibody-based treatment when they can’t even develop an accurate antibody test?
2020-08-15 0:01,"Wow, out of 60 comments four of them are touting leronlimab and asking rhetorical questions: ""The world has been waiting for a safe and effective treatment.  It's Leromlimab!"".   None identify what the results are.  Google searches show only that a study was released which seems to have failed its primary endpoint (for patient reported outcome) and did have a statistically significant impact (but not stated whether magnitude was clinically relevant) on improving a predictor-of-future-sickness score (but not stated if there were actual clinical outcomes, ie actually less future sickness).   

 I may not have all the data, but so far I am left with the suspicion that these are paid stock-pumpers, or true believers who are not very skeptical of prelim, unreviewed trial reports.     

Regardless, I am sure that I will be flamed by either.  Still, a plea: if you are for real, put data in your posts, not just assertions?"
2020-08-14 23:02,"I just read that Fauci say that it is worthless to take temperatures. Also that sunlight kills the virus. That the reason we'd have a massive amount of deaths (if we waited for herd immunity), is because too many Americans are obese & diabetic with hypertension. Then I read that Florida & Calif are the latest hotspots for cases. But Florida has 426 deaths per million, and Calif has 282 per million, which makes Florida #18 and Calif #28 in death rates. Then I read that Biden/Harris think they will mandate masks. Good luck with enforcing that. Anyone else out there whose head is spinning? Maybe the media should just shut up."
2020-08-14 23:57,"We could save many months in testing if we did Human Challenge trials. In other words we would intentionally infect volunteers with Covid 19 two weeks after receiving Monoclonal Antibody therapeutic treatment.

The article did not mention Vir and Sorrento Therapeutics,  two other companies working a Covid therapeutic and an monoclonal antibody preventative cocktail. One more thing, even with the present FDA trial delays, therapeutics, will likely beat Covid vaccines to market. Also a therapeutic can be 100% successful in stopping infection, whereas a vaccine may only be 40-50% effective."
2020-08-15 0:12,"Just as Dr. Fauci said, the earliest a safe vaccine could be available is sometime in 2021. We could however make them all available to Putin, he will test it on the Russians regardless."
2020-08-14 22:21,"Despite lies, attempts to mislead and politicize the response to COVID-19 by Biden, Harris and their news media misinformation proliferators like the NYtimes, the overall development of vaccines and treatments are proceeding substantially faster when compared to the past, in part, due to actions by the Trump administration.  Fauci has mentioned this numerous times, and he does credit the actions of the federal response as having a substantial role.   Around election time, one should see a large drop in infection rates and also the cusp of many new therapeutics that will be attributed  in part to the business friendly environment encouraged by the current administration.  Unrelated to this, I am expecting Trumps polling numbers to improve starting next week due to the  drag caused by K. Harris, who is actually Trumps first pick for the democratic VP candidate,  just like Bernie was for President."

They are weeks away from interum review of the phase 3 severe/critical trial and if it show results as good as M2M they should stop the trial.  Look up Dr. Patterson and RANTES.  It has not gotten any airtime because it is a small company that threatens big pharma and is being held down because it is a HIV and cancer drug that will cost them billions.

1. India appears to be headed for a monumental disaster. New cases there continue to rise exponentially and deaths are following a familiar lagging pattern. Apparently while the shutdown imposed earlier worked well, it was proven unsustainable. There are no viable alternates available to the Madi government except letting the disease run its ugly and mortally dangerous course. This has the potential to deal independent India a fatal blow altering the region's geo-politics. Not a good thing.
2. Brazil has reached a plateau in new cases and deaths but...it is at a horrid level. This can't go on. The plateau may be reflective of their capacity to count, treat and bury rather than an actual slowing of real cases.
3. The state of Kentucky data is unusual and troubling. On its face new cases are rising while deaths are constant or even dropping slightly. Either Kentucky has discovered a wonder drug treatment or , more likely, the data needs to examined for validity.

“…The U.S. budget gap totaled $2.8 trillion from October through July, 224% bigger than the $867 billion gap during the same period a year earlier. The government has spent $5.6 trillion so far in the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30…

i.e. We spent 2X what we took in – and Mnuchin’s not through borrowing, for this fiscal year…

These number are – in turn – dwarfed by the trillions in private-sector debt that the Fed bought up…

PS

Do realize that pretty much the only strategy in town that has a “hope” of achieving needed public-sector pension returns – even before COVID:

Shorting same said debt, and then buying back for cents of the dollar…

Obfuscating the short, using derivatives...

We may be falling behind the world in AI, 5G, health care, nuclear energy, K-12 education, and transportation…

If these are not neutralizing antibodies, how can make mingling with others safe?

If they are neutralizing, what is the explanation for recurrence of covid 19 symptoms. 

Are people with recurrent covid symptoms harboring life viruses in the nasal/pharyngeal passages that can be transmitted to others?

The statement that persons with covid 19 can ""safely mingle with others for three months,"" needs to specify if this safety refers to the patient and/or others. 

Why not test for both antibodies and live virus in nasal/oral pathways simultaneously?

Now, most Americans are not prepared for emergencies that require a few hundred dollars to mitigate.

Thanks to the Republican Party, the United States is no longer meeting its obligations to its own people and the world at large and is allowing a new “aristocracy “ of wealth to dominate the national agenda. Donald J. Trump has exacerbated the situation for his benefit and set the nation on a ruinous course. Unless this trend is halted this November, the American people will find themselves in a situation not dissimilar to that of our own pre 1776 ancestors; being, not citizens, with equal protection under the law, but subjects under rule of wealth, owing their lives, sustenance and allegiance to whoever employs them, allowing them respite from poverty, hunger and disease. It will be at least a partial return to a feudal system and the end of democracy.

This reads as though I’m free to mingle for 3 months but no longer based on antibody levels. Most infectious disease specialists have made it fairly clear that immunity goes far beyond antibody levels which are the first B cell mediated immune response. Long term protection is conveyed by memory T cells which do not correlate with antibodies. Since I became ill in March, these recommendations don’t rally address all cases. Regardless, even if I feel protected, I opt to wear a mask, social distance and avoid high risk clusters indoors. If too many people who have recovered feel immune and stop wearing masks, the wrong message will be sent to others."

Declining tax revenues may well be an issue here, but it pales in comparison with the intentional damage inflicted by a President who abandoned his people as this crisis gained steam and surpassed all previous damage.

If Trump wants more tax revenues, if states want some economic breathing room get a stimulus, a meaningful stimulus not the elegant gesture of the previous one, to every adult in America ASAP.

Reinstate the unemployment boost, now.

- there is no way for a person to know if he/she is in a group of patients who are “safe” for 3 months, 1 month, or not at all
- By leading people to believe they are “safe,” when many of them are not, is setting the stage for the THIRD wave of Covid 19 

2. By seeming to give people a three month Covid 19 “get out of jail free” card if they recover from Covid 19, the CDC’s report will certainly be used to justify Covid 19 parties

A consequence of this is that there will be no herd immunity accomplished by people getting infected.  Herd immunity can exist for this virus only if there is developed a vaccine that provides protection for at least many months.

This information also reveals how evil has been the epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, leading the Sweden government's program that intentionally kept schools, restaurants, etc. open and refused to impose mask requirements, thus promoting spread of infection and leading Sweden to have a much higher death rate from this virus than the US."

Wasn’t until I ran the water over my wrist did I realize what was happening. If I actually have antibodies they need to get on the job. Three months immunity? I think I had about two weeks. IMHO, all these studies are rushed- the media report them before they are reviewed and results replicated; in this article there are differing results and opinions on the  duration of “immunity”. Some say three months, some say a year and some say there is no immunity at all. Rushed research is poor research and leads to distrust.

The law in California is that the state budget must be balanced on a year to year basis.  This is in the State Constitution.  Pensions are contracts negotiated between employees and the State.  One would assume Constitutional law takes precedent, meaning that if necessary pension contracts can be renegotiated out of necessity especially if they are out of line with other pension plans, including social security.  

There should be an agreed upon yardstick to measure this.  That's the hard part.  Not in figuring out what the yardstick should be by an independent commission, but in the political process to select the commission members and getting both sides, taxpayers and pensioners to agree to abide by it.

Two things here:  The pension funds in the last 40 years have been the beneficiary of out sized market gains.  The yardstick on the income side should ignore these gains in future projections, as well as comparing them to amounts in 
 non-market invested funds, which should be considered the norm.  And it should be emphasized that markets go up AND down, with no guarantee of increase.

Overall, contracts should reflect paid in equal paid out on a yearly basis."

demand a lot of legal hardball gamesmanship to cut 
through the HHS obfuscation and disclosure charade. 

So the question is how will this information seep through
the iron curtain of HHS, set up  to keep all prying eyes and curious minds from finding out, reasonably soon,  about yet another inexplicably inept and   tawdry feature of this administration's loathsome and bizarrely clueless  conduct during the  pandemic. 

You don't go to all the trouble HHS went to by  imposing  this

Why does it always seem like when people are told not to do something, people pay defy the rules at their own and their children's detriment?  It's the ""you can't tell me what to do"" rebellion attitude.  

Rather than rage against the machine individually, there needs to be collective action to embrace the safe route e.g. and update Ed tech distance learning to be more of an ecosystem of experiences so that we can hold student's attention.

I’d welcome more stories about how schools/districts could do a better job supporting teachers to instruct virtually in an engaging way that moves the learning needle."
2020-08-14 12:28,"In answer to the question below the headline: yes, public schools should pay for small group learning at home, especially for special needs children. They get first priority. Autistic kids cannot learn on a computer, period, especially younger ones."
2020-08-14 12:26,"Will the students who don't ""fit in"" be kicked out? Or not accepted anywhere? 

I don't fault parents who are trying to do their best for their children, but this is a terrible model for a good society. We really don't want to live this way."
2020-08-14 12:32,"I think there's a lot of material here for some excellent investigative reporting, assuming the reporters have the stomach to write about the truth and not whitewash the role teachers and the teachers union are playing in this.

Here some questions I would love answered?
1.) I personally know so many parents that are forming pods that it's clear me that some public school teachers are planning to moonlight and double dip come fall.  There just aren't that many tutors available and as we know the private school teachers will all be working in the fall because like normal white collar professionals, they don't hide behind unions to skip work.
2.) How's Success Academy doing with online learning?  DOE teachers averaged 30 minutes of live instruction a day. Did Success Academy outperform?  Let's hear about it.  Could be a learning for all of us.  My gut tells me that Eva cracked this code and Carranza should be following her lead.

The teachers union has really jumped the shark here. Abby is totally right about the ""cottage industry"" aspect of this.  The only equitable thing we should be doing right now given that Carranza cannot figure out how to educate our most at risk population is to give families on free lunch vouchers to fund pods.  And we should furlough teachers who refuse to provide live online instruction for the entire school (ex lunch and recess) and use that money to fund pods for poor families.

That's what you do when you care about kids and not about politics."
2020-08-14 12:33,Maybe this will be the end of public schools and the rise of CHOICE!
2020-08-14 12:46,"Can we please make a distinction between certified, experienced classroom teachers and “instructors” or “tutors” being hired to provide child care with incidental homework help? Hiring recent college grads to babysit kids is not even remotely the same as having a qualified educator design and implement instruction. While I am all for rethinking our approach to education, let’s not conflate child care with actual teaching."
2020-08-14 12:52,"Reading this article would lead you to believe that there is not money available to help these parents.  But there is.  California gives $100B annually to its schools--nearly all of that coming from the state budget.  Pandemic or not, it's been going to pay the salaries of administrators, pensions, and, yes, the teachers who are offering a few meager hours of instruction per day.  It would not be impossible to furlough those non-working educators and offer this money to private tutors who could help low-income parents.  Eventually, it comes down to this--either the teachers earn their salaries, or, like restaurants and other services that have shut their doors, the money funding them needs to be redirected to a better outcome."
2020-08-14 12:03,"Can we all please openly acknowledge that both the federal and state governments badly failed students, parents, and teachers by not prioritizing the reopening of schools over bars and indoor dining? That being the case, it’s not fair to fault individual patents or teachers for doing whatever is best for them now. Teachers shouldn’t be made to feel that they are sacrificing their lives to reopen schools and parents shouldn’t be made to feel that they have to sacrifice their children’s’ educations and futures."
2020-08-14 12:57,"If you are white and affluent and you marched for Black Lives Matter this spring but do nothing to address systemic inequity this fall, you must face the truth: you are someone who talks the talks but does not walk the walk. True protest is what happens after we put the signs downs and lead our day-to-day lives.

I will be tutoring underserved high school students online this fall. I will try to support students in my town who are low income, which inevitably means that many, but not all, will be Black. 

If you marched in the spring, the time to walk the walk is this fall."
2020-08-14 13:11,"Not everyone has a computer or internet but almost everyone has a television.  How about we set up television channels that broadcast curriculum?  For example, as a former science teacher, I would be glad to videotape middle school or high school science lessons and demos, and provide them for free.  I am sure a lot of teachers and retired teachers would pitch in for such an effort.  It would not be a perfect solution but would help a lot of families."
2020-08-14 13:14,"I've seen this idea floated elsewhere, but no serious discussion of it.  Why can't one of the major broadcast networks be paid to televise live teaching sessions on weekdays.  They could trade, ABC Mondays, NBC Tuesdays, etc.  The teachers could also be paid to give and grade tests, safely, from home.  Since soap operas, talk shows, and other daytime programming are mostly on hiatus, it shouldn't interfere that much, and the networks could be compensated for their air (or not, since the public owns the airwaves and merely ""rents"" them to content providers.  I can see 10 reasons why we can' pull this off, but 20 reasons why we can, and should."
2020-08-14 13:17,"Yes, @alittlegrumpy, Well said, in fact I have reached out to members of my faith community, the Baha'i faith to look at how we as a community might serve to create diverse pods in our own neighborhoods that will enrich and enhance the educational process of our neighbors and their children.  We seek to adopt a humble posture of learning in this process.  Ultimately the goal is the recognition that we are one human family.  Our process is knowledge, consultation, planning, action, repeat.  this process is done in cycles of 90 days so that we can adjust every 3 months learn from our mistakes, verify outcomes. in the end we will all go from crisis to victory, after all we are one human family."
2020-08-14 13:18,"This is a collective action problem. Stop putting it on parents. We’re all struggling, affluent or not. My public school student will get the benefit of oversight by 2 PhD parents with university teaching experience and flexible schedules - but we couldn’t take on a larger group and continue to function in our demanding jobs. American families are stressed to the breaking point. Stop assigning blame and start showing us solutions or shut up."
2020-08-14 13:25,"In France, every class in each grade in each school has the same lesson on the day, as part of the country's national curriculum. The US could offer the same, broadcast online and across the airwaves. To actually educate children, it would have to feature science and math instead of Jesus though, which could make it difficult for people in red states to embrace."
2020-08-14 13:27,"Ms. Goodnough's story highlights what I warned my freshman sociology students about over a decade ago during 'social stratification' week: namely, that North America's so-called ""free market economy"" is increasingly a stacked deck.

We are now seeing irrefutable evidence that the decisions of our Congresspersons and Presidents for over three generations to favor corporations and wealthy individuals who pay little to no taxes, while working-class people support vital public services, struggle to buy groceries, pay rent, educate their children, and are forced to buy lousy, overpriced health insurance (my policy is $1,670 a month just for my wife and myself). 

In short, the trickle-down economic policy that Republicans continue to peddle--and their working-class base continues to faithfully support--has hurt the very Americans who pay for vital social services and fight the needless wars that enrich leaders like Dick Cheney. 

The pandemic has drawn back the curtain, and it is high time that all Americans take a hard look at who is standing behind it, throwing the levers and stuffing their pockets."
2020-08-14 13:24,"If states are unable or unwilling to open tax-payer funded public schools, they should stop this travesty of online learning, furlough the teachers and, more importantly, the administrators, and redistribute funds to families with kids. They can then use those funds to hire tutors who are willing to teach and not stand on the corner with the “i can’t teach from the grave” sign."
2020-08-14 13:04,"Yes, school districts should provide space, teachers & money for small group instruction. I say this as a special ed teacher.

Teaching is a creative & dynamic profession. This moment is extraordinary not just in the context of your town, community, state or country - but to the whole of humanity. It, therefore, requires extraordinarily dynamic & creative solutions. Small group instruction for students of low income families is one area that needs to be addressed. There’s also the 7.1 million American kids who report to public school every day & require special ed services. There’s also students who suffer anxiety & depression. There’s students who receive free breakfast & lunch at school...the list goes on. 

This moment is showing how the whole of education needs to be addressed - and not just public schools. Our kids should be viewed as our number one priority. Clearly we’ve got work to do."
2020-08-14 13:11,State or county provided teachers should be made available for small group learning pods for interested parents. It's too risky to expose students and teachers to large classrooms.
2020-08-14 13:23,"What a great idea! 

Hire several thousand teachers (recruited and vetted and trained and supervised by whom?) to run learning pods for the millions of NYC schoolkids whose parents can’t afford it.

Just where is NYC going to find these hundreds of millions of dollars in the face of enormous Covid-related expenses, and huge drops in tax income caused by the exodus of people from the city due to Covid, riots, looting arson, destruction?

It is clearly beyond the means of the NYC school system to start a parallel education system (learning pods); what the school system really needs to do is to focus on how to make its existing online education programs so good that the gaps between pod and non-pod students are minimized.

Yes, there will still be some gaps, but surely all those highly-paid administrators at the NYC Dept of Ed can figure out how to accomplish this."
2020-08-14 13:21,"Personally, I'd like to see a program that matches families working from home with families that have to work away from the home so that the children have a place to go during the day for online school and child care."
2020-08-14 14:29,"All of this hand-wringing over parents spending several hundred dollars a week on pods yet nary a peep about the fact that daycare has a similar going rate. I get that parents bank on their kids aging out of daycare and into regular schooling, but this is a major disconnect for me in this conversation. Again, what are parents supposed to do? I love crowdsourcing different options to ensure more children have opportunities for the fall, but demanding personal accountability for a systemic problem gets a no from me."
2020-08-14 14:31,my husband and I are essential workers. We go to work.  We have hired a tutor for our kindergartener and first grader.  what else can we do? there is a huge economic disparity here.  the answer is: teachers are also essential workers.
2020-08-14 14:35,"It's not just ""learning pods"" that people are priced out of. We have a whole other layer of access that's not being addressed at all.  There are nearly 20 million Americans that have no broadband.  Either the service isn't available or they can't afford it.  While these are families that could get their kids an education by putting them on a bus, accessing a full day's worth of learning content is beyond them.  Over 20 years ago there was regular talk about the ""digital divide"", the private sector would expand access and provide for all.  The model used in most areas is the cable provider.  An exclusive franchise in a community providing the ability to charge what the market will bear (I pay over $250/mo for cable and internet) in a rural area.  My local school district also has a large free and reduced lunch program, many simply can't afford it; food, clothing and shelter come first.  COVID brings out two realities that show the depths of our problems in this country.  Employer based health care doesn't work when millions don't have jobs and high priced broadband is just as bad a no broadband for too many Americans.  If we don't fix these two more will literally die and a whole class of Americans will fall further behind educationally and economically and are likely to never catch up.  The only thing that WILL happen is more multi-generational poverty."
2020-08-14 14:50,"Yes! Schools should help pods form so that families can better balance the obligation of monitoring and assisting in virtual learning. With mere weeks until the virtual school year starts, the Chicago Public Schools are refusing to release class lists so that parents can connect with their classmates' families and ensure their children are cared for and learning, both on-screen and off. It's endlessly frustrating."
2020-08-14 14:51,"I like how all of a sudden teachers are given value for being 
essential workers. 
   Parents found out starting last March, that teachers are vital.
  Sadly most substitute Credentialed Teachers were making 
$110.00 a day before taxes here in the district I work in. 
   Imagine what the pay is for a day dealing with 30 plus
elementary school students or 6 periods of Junior high or 
high school students in other states?"
2020-08-14 15:06,I am a high school teacher in an urban school district. I would love to have a learning pod with the students in our school. I think it may be feasible though high school may be more challenging than elementary.
2020-08-14 15:47,"two thoughts - so many people participate in back-to-school ""backpack drives"" and donate school supplies put into new backpacks.  This model should be adjusted to the needs of the digital age during a global pandemic.  Also, most public school systems are served by before and after school care programs on site - what is happening to this pool of trained workers?  Many of the people who work in this field can monitor children and help guide homework."
2020-08-14 15:44,"The problem is that our aspirational goals are in conflict with practical realities. I have participated in most of the live outreach webinars organized by the NYC school system, and it is clear that the teachers, space, technology are simply not available to pull this off. 

It is just a few weeks before schools are to reopen and the Chancellor or principals can't articulate what in-person learning will be like, what remote learning will be like, or what days my student will even be in school- or even if there will be school.

We are experiencing death by project management, or lack thereof. Please, let's just pick an option that we can pull off with the resources we have."
2020-08-14 16:05,"Parents band together to form learning pods.  They hire a few tutors.  The students do well, and neighbors ask if they can join.

The original group of parents crushes some numbers and, coupled with the collapsing rent in office space, figures that they can rent a former office space (or vacant JC Penny or Sears space in the suburbs) and bring in 20 more students and 3 more teachers.

Group continues to do well and the group keeps expanding.

We have just launched 1 million small experiments, some of which will lead to breakthroughs in education and give parents a much wider range of education options.

Time to uncouple education funding (which largely goes paying for the brick & mortar school buildings and legacy teacher pensions) from the school building and give it to the parents to spend as they best see fit."
2020-08-14 16:27,A major factor for limiting infection is ensuring adequate ventilation. School districts should be finding ways to teach outside where any viral particles in the air will naturally be dispersed and neutralized when there is sunlight. Outdoor teaching could occur under large awnings or canopies in empty parking lots or in open spaces. This might not work in all areas where it is too hot or when it becomes too cold in the winter but it at least gives options to students and parents who can't learn remotely.
2020-08-14 16:56,"The concerns of this article and its comments are the same: socioeconomic competition, children's emotional and mental health, and the need for child care. No one seems to care about learning.

We have a nation of people who cannot understand simple statistics and probability, which means they cannot evaluate risk. Many Americans' knowledge of chemistry and biology is that of a Medieval serf, yet they have strong opinions about vaccinations, GMO's, and Covid. Knowledge of history, even American history, is abysmal, as is any understanding of how people in the rest of the world live, or even where they live. The consequences of an uninformed citizenry are all around us.

Maybe if we had spent more time valuing knowledge and the ability to acquire knowledge, we wouldn't have built a society based on vicious competition for virtually everything that makes life worth living. At the very least, we'd know that there was another way."
2020-08-14 16:59,"Why doesn’t the Department of Education set up a TV channel to provide instruction to students? It’s not perfect but most folks can access broadcast TV or YouTube. 

Students shouldn’t be expected to attend school in person until a vaccine is available."
2020-08-14 13:46,Parents of special needs kids - especially autism - have been facing inequality challenges for getting services and quality education for our kids. The public school are dismal - private schools are a must. And if you want quality speech and OT - even if you have good corporate medical insurance - you will pay out of your pocket. My son's costs are around 40k a year. It's a sad reality that you need money in this country just to get education or services that will ultimately make our kids (neurotypical or not) be able to be the best version of themselves
2020-08-14 15:45,"As to the often unwarranted criticisms of teachers, please understand what it was like to teach in the spring:
1) With very little time to do so, teachers had to learn many different software programs and apps to convey instruction. Most learning (of a skill) occurs through trial and error as well as hours of practice. 
2) The teachers had to establish communication with parents and students in order to arrange for classes to be held. This piece was often nightmarish as some parents and students dropped out of sight completely while others responded to attempts to communicate sporadically if at all.
3) The teachers then had to turn around and teach the students (and parents) how to also use these programs and apps. Again, time, requisite materials, and practice are required for anyone to achieve success. Furthermore, not all students had access to computers. 
4) Teachers were THEN able to conduct virtual lessons with their students. Effective teachers monitor their students'  understanding throughout the lesson; this was severely hampered by the remote learning environment.
Online instruction last spring was no picnic for anyone. Now, however, teachers have had time to perfect their online delivery skills and have worked to overcome some of the obstacles mentioned here. Remote learning in the fall may not be perfect, but I assure you that it will be measurably superior to the instruction that we tried to provide in the spring."
2020-08-14 14:28,"You wanted to whip up terror about a virus that 98.8% survive, this is what you get.  

I'm a teacher ready to go back in person.  I can read the CDC data and estimate the extremely low risk of death or even severe disease for everyone under 70.  

Meanwhile, districts in TX (the ones not in Dem-led cities) are reopening in person 5 days a week for whomever wants to to come.  Yes, cases will increase, but cases do not automatically mean deaths.  

You get what you vote for.  You voted for Big Govt in your city, you got it.  Don't complain about the closed schools."
2020-08-14 13:55,"They should. But they won’t. Because they can’t. The way we fund local education is deeply flawed, inequitable, and fragile - facts always in plain view laid bare by C-19. Lots of great ideas about how to collaborate an change school for the better will founder on the rocks of poor funding. Proposition 13 in California for instance keeps property tax revenue intentionally low, Star IG schools and city services of funds. Until we put our money where our mouths are, educators and kids are almost last at the trough, hero talk and Whitney Houston songs to the side."
2020-08-14 15:15,$600 a week is only $15 an hour if Melissa Cohen expects 40 hours of work a week. $15 an hour in LA is painfully low. Teachers are college educated professional. Many have masters degrees. This is yet another example of devaluing teachers. I imagine prospective teachers are watching this play out and deciding to go into different fields.
2020-08-14 15:58,"I hate to be a negative ned but is the issue of schooling in America, pandemic or not, been a series of ignoring the 6Ps and telling the tale that those that can, do, and those that cannot, teach.  Teaching in the Nordic lands is usually considered an important profession, not just a job.  Schools are not considered childcare facilities.  The US spends over 700 billion on defense but will not spend a portion of that amount on facilities and equipment to assist teaching.  Should not every child have access to the internet, to include the State providing the necessary computers.  Like many other inequalities, the Pandemic has laid bare the Shinny City on the Hill fallacy.  I have no answer in the short term for the problems addressed in this article.  I do believe though that unless there is a fundamental change in how the US approaches education then the future is bleak."
2020-08-14 13:42,"“Pod scholarships?” That’s grim. We’re at a point where non-rich kids have to earn a scholarship for the chance to learn in an environment that won’t get them and their parents sick. Anyone else find that disturbing?
Also was disheartened to read about the number of parents in this article who have turned to charter schools, which in many states take funds away from public schools. Sad that our public schools have fallen so far."
2020-08-14 13:36,"On the plus side the best cases  small classes will provide assistance focused on the individual children.  Every student will not get the same education.  Data on the education and knowledge people, parents and tutors along with next year testing will help explain what worked.

A bit off topic:  DJT's knowledge of the Constitution may indicate failures of Civic Eduction in private schools."
2020-08-14 13:40,"I’d like to see some mega-wealthy Americans form a free television network available to all to provide education. (Bloomberg, Gates, Bezos, et al)

This will especially help children who lack computers and/or computer skills. Most homes have televisions. 

Then figure out a way to compensate for the missing interactive component."
2020-08-14 15:26,"With all of this going on now I do not understand why the Secretary of Education did not start to help planning for the start of the school year as soon as it became obvious in March that everything was going to have to change.  For an Education Secretary DeVos has been very absent from the discussions.  

Children do need to learn.  Parents are not always the best ones to teach or supervise their learning.  Yet neither the federal nor the state governments seem to have given much thought to September, to parents, to school staff, or to much beyond opening up school.  

Buildings need to be retrofitted to filter air, to be comfortable, to accommodate students while allowing for social distancing.  Money is needed and money is in short supply due to job loss.  But the childrens' needs don't end just because the money isn't there.  

For a party that claims to care about all Americans the GOP isn't showing any care for anyone but itself and its richest donors.  Shame on them."
2020-08-14 13:48,"I still can’t get over the fact that it’s too unsafe to open schools this fall for children but daycares being open and school districts opening daycares are ok. Government is failing so badly at all levels that you can’t blame wealthy parents for doing all they can to make sure that their children get an education. It’s the government that’s failing low income children, not learning pods."
2020-08-14 14:40,The school and child care issue during the pandemic has served to bring into the forefront what has come to identify America overall. An elitist society. For those that have the financial affluence it means leaving congested cities to second homes or rural retreats. For those with school age children it’s organizing leaning pods with teachers/tutors hired by the hour. The old expression money talks has new pertinence today. In the midst of a health pandemic financial affluence can save lives.
2020-08-14 14:55,"“...the trend could make public education even more segregated and unequal.”

Public education, once a founding and equalizing force in the United States, had already begun to have challenges even before the onslaught of COVID-19.

While I acknowledge the tremendous challenges facing students, parents and teachers, we must do our best to remain focused on the purpose of education: to develop well-rounded young adults with sharp critical thinking skills.

They are the future and will ultimately determine our fate.￼"

2020-08-14 13:47,"What about a program paying out of work parents to host pods for children of parents who must work? That would provide for the computers and printer cartridges and food and so on, support the hosting parent and provide spots free of charge for working parents.

Sure, things should be fairer and more equitable, but let's lay that on our government - state, local, and federal.   Coming up with solutions and funding them is what we pay them for."
2020-08-14 16:54,"North Dakota dept of instruction said such tutoring/pooling would be illegal - as it would be ""private school"" without going through the appropriate requirements.

Doesn't leave many choices for parents, nor their kids."
2020-08-14 14:50,"How come we can't be creative and think of other solutions? This is a national emergency and should be treated with the same sense of urgency and mobilization as anything else. How about a program where highschool graduates can defer college for a year, give back to their community by supervising/tutoring small groups of children during the day in exchange for a free year of college education? Or similarly, college graduates can step up and have their college loans paid off? None of this is rocket science and we've had all summer to brainstorm ideas and develop a program. It's a shame that the summer went to waste."
2020-08-14 15:02,"As a university faculty member I would certainly be willing to offer online one on one tutorials for high school students in my field. Many of my colleagues would too, I am certain. The Times should do a story on how we can do this."
2020-08-14 14:48,"Seriously I don't know what school districts want parents to do. I understand pods will exacerbate the divide, but does that mean I should write off this year for my kid? Our school is going to give us a watered down curriculum so kids don't fall behind in the name of equity. Should I let my kid get bored and become disengaged? She's not being challenged. I do my best to supplement and give her more challenging material but I'm not a teacher. To save my sanity and her love of education we got a teacher to teach our pod. I'm not sorry that I'm doing what's best for our child and our family."
2020-08-14 15:52,"Schools shouldn't give responsibility for educating the kids under their care. And such involvement with teachers can help small groups of parents cope through the pandemic school closures.
Pandemic Pods describe only the amount health precautions a group of people take against the virus. Being in a Pandemic Pod don't specify the educational arrangements those in the group agree on. Once you've identified the families you want to pod with, start an educational family co-op -- it's just a way for sharing responsibilities and resources between all parents. Multiple ages of kids are fine -- kids learn better in such settings. You might hire a teacher or not. You might get help from online tutors. Basically there is no such thing as being ""priced out"" of a Pandemic Pod. It is what you decide it to be. For more information, please read supermarketscience.com -- it has guide on how to think about forming such co-cops and it provides free curriculum and parent guides -- all you need to get started fro nothing. Finally, Kuhn Academy just started offering free only tutors! You can do it!"
2020-08-14 13:51,"Sounds like a concept previously knows as smaller class sizes. However, there was already a shortage of teachers & funding before Covid-19.

2020-08-14 14:38,"hm. I wonder if this were tried how many teachers who resigned amidst the pandemic confusion would be lured back into such a thing? lured back by the districts, given a lucrative package, which doesn't mean a big paycheck, but a reasonable workload, health benefits for themselves and their families and a lot of support from IT and whatever else they needed to do their real job of supporting and encouraging learning in small groups of young people. Although not a teacher, I was a school nurse and was always so impressed by the collaborative and strong bonds between families and their classroom teachers. When the school administrator joined them, anything was possible! They are our most valuable asset in raising thinking, problem solving, creative children!"

My girlfriend is a CFO and her workday is finished long before my teaching counterparts or mine. Thankfully, this freed her up to help me call the homes of Spanish speaking households to serve as a translator for parents, as late as 9:30 PM countless evenings. Most of us teach ""LIVE"" for 30 minutes now, to each cohort, and post a prerecorded lesson that models the student expectations for a particular lesson objective. That shorter teaching time frees me up to provide one-on-one assistance by phone or Zoom to any of my 80 students who request it. The shorter instructional time also frees me up to leave meaningful, written feedback upon my students' writing as their English teacher. A single day's lesson plan must have a three-part learning objective, Common Core Curricular Standards, SIOP objective, ""Do Now"" activity, anticipatory set, direct instruction, modeling, higher order thinking questioning, differentiated instruction, Kagan strategies, and a closure activity. I have two Master's degrees. I am a published author. And my teaching is a work of art to behold. During much of my career my salary made it difficult to even feed myself.

2020-08-14 15:56,"The media’s take on learning pods - as evidenced by weekly pod profiles- suggest that everyone with means who loves their children will be paying for this extravagance. It’s not the case for us. We make over $225k and though housing and our own student loan costs force us to be financially prudent, we can afford a private tutor for our kids. But we are choosing not to. We both have some ability to take weekly leave to focus on our kids (age 3 and 5) educational and physical needs and will hire a part time baby sitter and organize outdoor excursions with friends, otherwise. Trips to grandparents included of course. We are surprised many of our friends will not be taking at least some leave time to focus on their kids. Certainly not everyone has that luxury, but I suspect throwing money at private tutoring is now the status symbol de jour thanks in no small part to the Times. Everyone has to balance their desires for meeting their kids’ needs and their resources, but the false assumption that private pods are the only “real” solution are misleading and contribute to the anxiety and inequity."

I am now going to spend eight hours a day recording podcasts and revising PowerPoints for the fall semester.  My university campus opens in ten days.  Thanks to IT failures, I can’t even email my new students - all 330 of them.  

By the way, I’m still expected to finish a 500-page book manuscript by the end of the year, to publish multiple articles, and to serve on committees that meet by videocall.  I do all of this while caring for my high-risk elderly husband, cleaning our home (can’t afford a maid), cooking dinner every night (can’t afford delivery), and looking after our pets.

I fear this is the future: enclaves of healthy, educated children surrounded by pestilence and the poor. It is good to hear that people see the inequity, but the chances of giving the poor an equal education is slim to none in a country that pays for school with property taxes, leaving the poor with very little. I’m sorry but this is how it ends, especially with Republicans in leadership who won’t help, who give tax breaks to the rich, who refuse to continue unemployment benefits, and who blame the poor, uneducated, and homeless for being poor.

Either we are a country genuinely committed to equality of opportunity no matter what, or the whole system collapses at the first sign of trouble. I think the school situation shows that America as the land of equal opportunity is a lie."

2020-08-14 14:01,"Public schools needed to activate a network of college students to serve as teachers’ helpers. We could have reimbursed them for a semester of college or paid off some of their student loans like a Teach for America / Americorps program. I feel certain that a Biden administration would have gotten the ball rolling on this.

Then, with the nonprofit network in place, schools needed the money for additional classroom space so that classes could be halved, with one half receiving instruction from for teacher and the other receiving reinforcement/doing practice activities with the college student. 

In Alabama, when schools run out of classroom space, they haul in trailers. Yes, it would have cost money to do this, but Trump will be remembered as the cruelest president since Andrew Jackson for leaving public schools to “figure it out” with no money to do so.  

So I just wanted to say that these learning pods were possible in our public schools (just like updating ventilation in classrooms was possible!) Schools could have implemented pods with extra money. Should’ve been Prioroty #1.

It burns me up as a former K-12 teacher, encapsulating all the reasons I left K-12.

Commentors right point out that the focus on ""saving small business"" while completely ignoring the economic calamity of a population of parents forced to stay home with children instead of being at work, was a disastrous prioritization.

This administration had no plan for the fall. None. As a result school districts spent the entire summer pretending that in-person learning was a possibility. Instead of preparing parents for a winter semester of distanced learning, they fed parents  irrational false hope. School administrators have never been able to lead (they are either unqualified, or too scared of offending certain stakeholders by making unpopular decisions), and they certainly failed miserably during this fiasco.

This whole summer, my wife kept updating me on the reopening plans for our district. And every time I said ""It's not happening. Schools aren't opening in the fall and we need to prepare for that reality"".  And guess what? Our school district canceled in-person learning for the entire winter semester.

How could the president and chief executive  of the Boys and Girls
Clubs of Greater Washington have said that ?!

How does Ms.Webster feel about  parents who are leaving three-year-olds home alone ? 

Just a few weeks ago, two young children whose mother had gone on ""for 20 minutes"" found themselves in an apartment  that was on fire. Those children are alive only because people  saw  the five year old in the window of the burning building, and rushed to the building. Those wonderful people gathered underneath the apartment window ,and encourage the five year old to drop his  two year old brother down to him, which he did, following which the five year old  jumped. Miraculously, the two children were unscathed ,while a number of those who had rushed to rescue them sustained broken bones and other injuries.

The parents who ""can't worry about their 8-year-old  being home alone"" may end up with dead  or seriously injured children, and and find  themselves faces serious  charges,  in addition to having been responsible for their own children's deaths.

Another possibility is that the children of the parents who leave their children home alone will end up having their  children taken away by child services.

Ms. Webster should not be endorsing child neglect."

I value serving the young people I have committed my professional career to more.  So much more.  I am able to teach today because some public school teachers committed themselves to education in just the same way.  Unions are complex and worth trying to analyze and critique.

As mentioned they are not set up for daytime child care and have no one to be with their children to make sure they are online and doing their work.  It has been disheartening that members of the GOP and Trump do not acknowledge the very high amount of money that will be needed for schools to support safe learning this fall.  There have been op-eds from Superintendents that feel stuck because they need the funds that will be withheld if they do not open in person but are having severe problems with infection in staff (and deaths), do not have the funds to make their schools safe and do not think it IS safe to open.  So what are the parents to do who also feel this way?
It is a very good idea IMO to have an in person tutoring session for limited numbers of students who request the help funded by the school district.  Not required attendance, they can come in to a space that is large and has been sanitized, wearing masks.  That way these parents would have an option for a tutor that they did not have to pay for."

I just read your excellent article and feel that if I reach out to you, it might be possible to get your support to create something useful for school children who are at a disadvantage. As a retired teacher, I have been following closely the development of the problems that are tied to online schooling for students whose families cannot give any support to their kids nor pay for it. I have been doing some research on the internet to find where I could contribute my time and my expertise for free and am going nowhere. There are so many retired teachers who would love to be helpful and contribute their time without any pay that it would be very helpful to know where we can find  a place that would be able to recruit us.
Do you know of any organization who would do that? Could you write an article precisely on this? I am sure that it would lead to a bigger awareness and perhaps to a whole new way of helping fill the gap between the haves and havenots in these especially challenging times for man, many families.
If you have any questions, please, ask me. I want to do something and do not know how to.
Thank you very much for writing an article that is raising  awareness to a terrible problem.

Someone who lost a loved one, or who was a victim of a hate crime, or who needs a costly medical treatment, people respond generously in those cases, but not in the case of a whole demographic  in need of a service or product.

But this raises serious questions about the supposed generosity of the super rich. I hate to call out specific people but where is Oprah? Where is Beyoncé? Where are the Kardashians? Where is every celebrity followed by millions on Instagram for giving advice on the most vapid topics on the face of the planet (hi, Gwyneth!) and growing rich doing it? Too busy sequestering on their luxury yachts, no doubt.

LeBron James and other athletes have started a fund to pay off the fines of disenfranchised felons in Florida, and that’s great, but more wealthy people ought to pitch in more. And if they don’t, I would like them at the very least to refrain from subjecting us to their trite drivel about inclusion, racism, and democratic values that make them look progressive and non-Republican, all from the safety of an Emmy Awards ceremony.

They are doing fine financially, but do not have the funds for tutoring. At this point the boys, who miss their friends and are active kids, are hard to settle and keep settled for very long. I know that this must be the circumstance in many, many homes - and complicated in many more by job rigidity, low income, home crowding etc., etc. It is just awful right now.

And web cams used automatically and straight out of the box, or with limited control features, are the worst.

So if you are really disturbed by your video chat image, a far less drastic solution than cosmetic surgery would be to have a web cam if you can get one that lets you control the exposure and coloring, lets you zoom in while being further away rather than being close-up to a wide angle lens, using a light that either gives you better lighting angles or that at least makes the lighting even (which I personally hate as being ""plain"", flat, and dull, but which looks better than bad shadows), because most room light from ceiling lights is going to give horrible shadows that exaggerate lines, dark eye sockets, bags under the eyes, etc.

The latest outbreak, has eliminated the airport as the original source of community transmission, because of money invested in scientific genomic tracing. If not the airport, then must came come into NZ from ocean going contact. This is another community outbreak that we'll get under control because of money invested in scientific research.

The federal government created this mess in part by not being strict with containment measures and not setting up a system to keep people employed and businesses whole or mostly whole at the beginning of the pandemic, so now, we are going to have a long drawn out economic fall, then the republican party is going to fight for austerity creating a second economic collapse before we finally get going again.

Even more terrifying is how willing this administration is to let America sink into the abyss.  It's not communism or socialism that's the enemy.  No, it's our own officials in DC and in some of the statehouses across the nation.  

Welcome to the GOP Depression of the 21st century.  It only took about 90 years for them to get another one and to mishandle it. At least in 1929 they had an excuse:  they may not have really known what to do.  Now there's no excuse except their own ideology and hatred for working Americans."

Here in New Jersey there's  been  no attempt to  consolidate services and reduce the cost of government.  People are working in supermarkets and many low wage jobs while many state and municipal workers are receiving paychecks for staying home.  The governor is not being truthful when he says we are all in this together.  Our state and local leaders must make unpopular and drastic decisions to get through this lockdown.  Unfortunately, these decisions are not popular and may ruin their chances of staying in power by getting reelected.  Tax revenues are well short of the cost to maintain the status quo."

""We pay for it so we get to tell you how to do it."" has been clearly why states, especially in the South, didn't want to create per capita funding for their educational systems.  A state's educational system may well be at least a third of their budget.

No government administrator ever gets ahead by reporting the the department needs less money.  

But the private sector has demonstrated that technology permits huge reductions in white collar administrative positions. It is worthwhile to challenge the State and local governments to find savings. If no now, when? When times are good and the coffers are overflowing with money? It would never happen.

Of course, the unions for public employees tend to see the purpose of government as to provide jobs to their members and so improved efficiencies are unacceptable to them."

What part of pandemic do these commenters not understand? Thousands are dying and will continue to die until all Americans discipline themselves enough to pass the basic marshmallow test.

Well, if just one man made off with $26 BILLION, and this country is just a-swarm with thousands of other mega-bucks, then Trump just needs to pass the hat amongst his friends (Warren Buffet is not one, thank you, Warren) but Trump's real friends and do a church-like collection to pay for that ""Vote-By-Mail"", right?

Actually, if he did then he'd probably get a LOT of $$$.
You see, that ""Tax Cut"" was only supposed to be for $1.5 TRILLION, but after attention turned elsewhere, the lobbyists and lawyers got to it and jacked it up to over $5.5 TRILLION.

2020-08-14 20:14,"The president is seeking to choke off the several states' ability to raise revenue through in-place taxes; to provide highway patrol services; to fund state governments. This is all part of a plan that, coupled with his directive that the postal service become an adjunct of the Republican Party's voter fraud wing, will essentially bring states to their knees. I have no doubt that his supporters on The Hill and in the various red state governors' mansions with like-minded Republicans, see these tactics as the only real means they have of re-electing Donald Trump. 

What 63-million Americans voted for four years ago has come to pass. We have chaos that is the vestibule to anarchy and violence throughout our country. All of this, compounded by a pandemic that may reach 300-thousand deaths by the end of the year; with millions infected and unable to work; with hospitals and clinics overloaded; with exhausted first responders unable to keep up with the climbing demand; with unemployment continuing to reach seven figures in every remaining week of this year; all of these catastrophes are gifts to the Republicans. They would rather see the United States of America burn rather than roll up their sleeves and lend a hand in the rebuilding of a nation that dissolved under a president who has no idea of what he is doing.,

He is abetted by Republicans who know better but, what's worse, do not care. This is no democracy. It's not even fascism. It's lunacy; insanity.

 But now they appear quite willing to sabotage the “Trump” economy as well.

What gives?

Well, as we all know the republicans hate the idea of handing any money to Americans to help hem out.  They would rather see the economy  tank than do that.  Their plan is to force all states, but especially “blue” states, to cut their social services and pensions that help so any people and force the country back to the 1800’s in terms of social services.  They don’t care if it also hurts heir own constituents in the process.

The American people are barely hanging on anything that once resembled their normal lives. This horrible time in American history has brought into sharp focus which politicians are preoccupied with getting reelected rather than putting the welfare of their constituents first. We have an occupant in the White House who would rather burn down our democracy and defund our postal service to serve his political agenda of voter suppression.

(Didn't happen.)Republicans like Mitch McConnell are reverting to similar tactics today. They are politicizing the misery of American families & their communities  ravaged by a dual pronged crises. Why, because McConnell smells an historic defeat on the horizon for Trump and Republicans across the country. Blood is in the water, quite literally. Americans are furious with the grotesque mismanagement by Trump and his Republican sycophants of the deadly coronavirus. Blaming China hasn't help juice the polls in Trump's favor. Punishing governors and mayors, especially in Blue states, by refusing to give them the aid they need, McConnell hopes to erode support for Democrats in November.

But when the stimulus money dried up the inevitable budget crunches occurred, and since the Republicans refused to allow a second stimulus, the result was a long, drawn out recovery. 

I was seeking work as a teacher in 2010/11; unfortunately schools were laying off teachers, not hiring them. Multiply my story by hundreds of thousands across the country, and we have a pretty clear picture of why it took so long to get the economy back to normal. 

But here's the kicker: by dragging their feet during the recovery while a Democrat was in the White House, Mitch and the Republicans happily paraded the slow recovery as an example of Obama's poor economic performance. And many in the nation bought it, putting Mitch in the position he's been in since then. 

It's clear the R's plan to use the same strategy now, since there are strong indications that the White House - and probably the Senate - will swing back to Democratic control.  So the Republicans are again making certain that they don't provide the needed funds for economic recovery, because that would make Biden look too good.

2020-08-15 13:11,"The most paranoid closures were made by Democratic governors. Some may have been needed in the beginning like in NY but they were a function of the unique local overcrowding in the overwhelming Democrat controlled large cities. Others like here in NC continue due to a Democratic governor who has failed to address a handful of outbreaks in nursing homes and packing plants, yet blames the (white) middle class for not wearing masks, which is flat out lie. Otherwise we are blessed with a low virus count in spite of a more or less reopened tourist season, much to the chagrin of that governor who has been looking for a way to close down and deliberately expand the ranks of unemployed for his political survival. Sorry but the goal of these governors, and the big city mayors too, is to obtain a bailout to cover their mishandling of both the excessively long closures and their bloated government payrolls in general. It is more likely that reform will be demanded and accomplished at the local level than ever at the federal level. Local voters can force themselves and government to choose between tax increases and expense reductions in a way that is meaningful to local needs and politics. That’s how it should work. It does not work that way in Congress. Let the states deal with the problems they have created in both the short and long term."
2020-08-15 13:15,"Many state and local governments have long lived far above their means  while over  committing on pensions & health care in retirement. And with nothing set aside in a ""rainy day fund"", they are now hopelessly under water and expect the federal government to bail them out of all their past mistakes and mismanagement.  As my mother would say, ""You've made your bed, now lie in it."""
2020-08-15 13:24,"As per the linked article, the April piece regarding pension shortfalls, the argument is that state pension funds are flounding because of the downturn in markets where states and municipalities invest pension funds. But the market has rebounded since then."
2020-08-15 14:32,"Give me a break. State and local governments, not to mention school districts, are not laying off droves of employees. That is simply false. The vast majority of public employees are at home receiving full pay, benefits and continuing accruing their pensions. This is why these governments are going broke. Now they want the great ATM machine in the sky to bail them out. It is the private sector, especially small and medium businesses and their former employees who need the help."
2020-08-15 15:17,"I find some of people's comments on this article to be very, shall we say, uninformed.

I live in a city where we had to lay off almost 1/3 of the police force during the great recession.  We don't have a big pension problem.  We basically never rehired these police. The same thing happened to education although funding was increased somewhat when parents and teachers basically revolted over having the lowest salaries in the country.  Oh, and to deal with that our beloved Republican governor and legislature just cut having an actual teaching certificate as a requirement to be a teacher!

So now we are in round 2 (3? 7?) of Republican malfeasance during an economic emergency.  The Great Recession would have been much easier to get through if we had pumped 2 trillion in rather than <1 trillion we actually did.  Even that brought on the Tea Party.

This failure to support the states will lead to more of the same.  We are a failed state."
2020-08-15 16:11,"The states and local governments have all suffered dramatic reductions in tax revenue because of the pandemic. People don't realize how important the services these offices give are to the people. Often we take them for granted.

But they are teachers, police, firefighters, zoning people, permit people, people who plow your roads, and people who fix roads and bridges. They keep statistics and data we all use, and issue public communications when necessary. 

The failure of Congress, at Trump's behest, to provide emergency funding for them is reprehensible."
2020-08-15 16:23,"States should receive money from a negotiated economic stimuus package.  150 billion for the states, along with 500 billion for SBA PPP repeat, 300 billion for stimulus checks repeat, and 320 billion to cover $400/wk for 30 million unemployed for 6 months.

That is about 1.3 trillion and should do the trick."
2020-08-15 13:19,"Republicans chastising states for not managing their finances prudently is ludicrous when the Republicans gave tax breaks worth billions to rich oligarchs. In reality it is the Republicans who are imprudent. Of course, then there is Trump who is known as the biggest stiff in business who pays little of his debts. Republicans are shameless."

Don't worry, be happy!"
2020-08-15 13:11,"If the Federal Government is pitting itself against State government, and the blue states against the red, then perhaps we should pay our state taxes and forego paying our federal taxes.

Thanks, Republicans for treating American lives like empty soda cans you kick to the curb. Keep golfing, men!"
2020-08-15 15:31,"I'm so sick of our state and federal governments.  All they want to do is spend.  After years of growth, and tax revenue excess, many states chose to increase spending and nonsense legislation rife with unintended consequences.  What about a rainy day fund, what about saving for the actual services government is mandated to provide?!  

No, all of us have been hit financially (except for a few who are making out like bandits) because of this pandemic.  Our careers, our plans, our kids plans - all of us are forced to sacrifice and tighten our belts.  But it seems that government hasn't seen fit to tighten.  And now they want the taxpayers to bail out cities and states that have been negligent at best and fiscally irresponsible at worst - for decades!  Not because of the virus, but because of years of mismanagement and corruption.

NO, NO, NO!!!!!  Only aid to states that assist with the coronavirus impact, and that doesn't mean making them whole as if the virus never happened.  75% compensation for virus ONLY.  I do believe that many states are keeping businesses shuttered for this very reason.  Hope I'm wrong."
2020-08-15 9:45,"It is also not unimaginable that as the GOP begins to see Trump losing the election that any incentive to speed a recovery will diminish. Why not let it languish a while and blame Biden for the whole mess?  Then they and their media mouthpieces can yammer on about how the poor economy is Biden's fault, blame him not only for not fixing it, but also for the huge deficit. After Obama inherited an economy in the tank it took less then six months for some of the Fox ""News"" folks to start complaining the he had not ""fixed"" the economy yet.  The GOP does not care much about the folks who are actually out of work (in GOP doctrine they are lazy people who don't really want to work), so instead they'll try to set up for a 2024 win..."

The local supervisors granted themselves a significant raise in January, they pay for medical insurance for part-time employees and they have already raised real estate and personal property taxes in 2020, added extra taxes for restaurants (how stupid is that) and everything that can be taxed is now taxed except for the air we breathe (maybe they'll find a way to do that too).    We are all cutting. Except government."

2020-08-15 9:27,"Its pretty clear that the cuntry will need an economic stimulus package again. The first one included about 500 billion for small business and about 300 billion in stimulus checks and we need money for unemployment enhanced benefits too. $400/wk for 6 months is about 320 billion. I can see state support being a need as well. For Texas, I know the added unemployment burden at the state level was 400 million through about June 1st, so I know 2 billion will work here, or 100 billion for 50 states as most states are smaller but blue states really do spend more money.

Total next round stimulus package = 1.2 trillion dollars. THis doesn't mean more won't be needed down the road, but the economy did improve with the first stimulus package in a sustainable non-dependent way, and will be stronger in my opinion, in another 6 months, to better allow for the exposure of true needs at that time. The 3.5 trillion or later 2.5 trillion ( after President Trump stepped in) that Pelosi is going for seems to be too much.

Just sign off on 1.2 trillion and lets get money to the unemployed and small businesses.  We can always add more later if needed."
2020-08-15 15:12,"Light on facts or metrics, but lots of political posturing (yay, Pelosi! boo, evil GOP!) The GOP objects to Pelosi’s additional trillions of aid because, they claim, most of the money would be used to bail out blue states that have been fiscally irresponsible for years. This reporting sidesteps addressing the accuracy of those assertions (implying the GOP allegations may be true). Instead it mentions three red states with small populations may face fiscal changes. Whether, even if factually correct, the GOP opposition to Pelosi is good policy is another matter. But is the factual premise for the GOP objection true? False? In between? That’s supposedly why we have a news media. Information, please."
2020-08-15 11:27,"The idea of Donald Trump offering fiscal advice to any government is laughable. Prior to his current job Trump has never been elected to any local, State, or Federal position. 
The self-described bankruptcy expert is now telling governments how run their governments. Only in America.

2020-08-13 16:29,"As a teacher of history I know very well what can happen in the fall, based on what the Spanish Flu of 1918. In the fall it decimated young people-below the age of 40, exactly the group that is getting complacent. I pray it won’t be the same."
2020-08-13 16:30,"A great little read, but I think what is missing in the cultural analysis part is the demographics who are being hit hardest. The 1918 pandemic was killing mainly people in the prime of life - 25-50. Sadly, I think it says a lot about our current society that no one seems to think the deaths of people over 65 and people of color are enough to wear a mask for or enough to consider this the very big deal that it is."

2020-08-13 16:54,"This not a palatable thought that the second wave in USA winter will be deadlier, just like with the 1914 virus. Chilling reading when you think how far we have advanced in medicine and the death rates are comparable to 1914 virus. 

I'd also like to hear from the experts about the consequences of not finding a successful vaccine before another unknown virus pops up in society. I read somewhere that these unknown viruses appear every two years and science is continuously looking for vaccines to be one step ahead of all new viruses on our planet. we seem to be failing miserably as a species because of lack of investment in viral research."
2020-08-13 17:09,"I read somewhere that the outbreak in Melbourne, Australia was traced back to a new mutation of the virus; so this virus is evolving and it makes you wonder where this is all going to end.  We are very lucky in NZ as both our neighbours in Australia and NZ bounce off each other ideas on how to deal with the virus and this is how we'll win this battle."
2020-08-13 17:25,"What makes COVID better (or maybe worse) is the fact that compared to 1918 influenza it has higher mortality in older segments of population, which makes the transmission easier by the most active people.  1918 influenza had highest mortality rate in 10-35 year old age group, which probably made them think a bit harder about partying.  

Then came the roaring 20's.  I expect there will be a lot of irrational exuberance once COVID is behind us."
2020-08-13 17:29,"It is fairly obvious to the average onlooker that a plague like the Spanish Influenza is going to spread much faster and cause more deaths in overcrowded cities with antiquated and overburdened infrastructure including health care, water supply, sewage and garbage disposal, etc. and with people jammed up together on public transportation, in offices, tenements, eateries, schools, etc.

During the 1918-1920 Spanish Influenza the death toll was much higher in overcrowded and often fetid big cities like New York, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia than in small and mid sized cities and especially in small towns and rural areas all across America. 

Any virus fattens and battens on crowd of people especially with poor hygiene and sanitation practiced among many of the poorer classes and mass garbage and sewage dumps."

2020-08-13 17:55,"Somehow, this comparison with 1918-19 rings hollow. Over 196,000 people in the U.S. died in the single month of October 1918. That’s many more than have died in the six months of the current pandemic."
2020-08-13 18:06,Perhaps social scientist can do similar analysis and compare the federal response in 1918 to that of the Trump administration.  At the least that may help explain why pandemics of two vastly different epochs are equally devastating.
2020-08-13 18:22,"If it looks like 1918 we should be optimistic, since there wasn’t much of a second wave."
2020-08-13 18:40,"This article is great illustration of why I have mixed feelings about a lot of the NYT's reporting on the pandemic. The fact is we cannot know how this pandemic stacks up against the Spanish flu at this point in time -- full stop. However, this article sets out to ""prove"" that this pandemic is ""as bad"" as 1918, even though this premise is flawed on so many levels.  

I appreciated the breakdown of the comparison methodology, but then, very deep in the article, we come to find out that it is an apple and oranges comparison (2020's ""peak"" against many months after the 1918 peak). Then the reporter brings out the ""tried and true"" dramatic twist of ""will there be a deadlier second wave like the Spanish flu?"" when the coronavirus is not a flu virus and we have no reason from a scientific perspective to continually weave this doom and gloom scenario. 

We just don't KNOW what will happen -- we CAN'T know. It's as likely as not to follow the same trajectory as 1918 and it calls to mind the story of the broken clock. After finding a medical historian who may not be qualified to evaluate a statistical comparison to dismiss a fundamentally flawed statistical comparison, we wind up with Dr. Faust telling us the pandemic will definitely be the SAME as the Spanish flu, or WORSE, when again, from a statistical perspective, there is an obvious third option that this article dismisses out of hand: that it will be significantly LESS deadly."
2020-08-13 18:47,"It still comes down to figuring out why some people get so sick with COVID-19.  In 1918, influenza spared older people because of prior immunity, which younger people lacked.  In the case of COVID-19, it likely has to do with inherent susceptibility of having a less good immune response with aging and where there is ongoing inflammation.  Also those who have prior chemo history, especially those with prior bone marrow cancers (leukemia/lymphomas)."
2020-08-13 18:54,"So none of our modern control measures are really working.  Were in the same position as 1918, only the passage of time and development of heard immunity will stop the spread."
2020-08-13 19:04,"I would say that THIS pandemic must be worse than the Spanish Flu since in 1918 -- though they might have known about plagues -- the Spanish Flu in particular received very little press, the world was focused on WWI, and there was no coordinated, global plan of attack. 

We're seeing all these deaths today despite all the quarantiningc, carefulness and understanding of *most* people of the importance to public health and the economy of wearing masks and social distancing to avoid spread.

If only we had a POTUS who was more interested in the health of the nation than how to use a pandemic as cover to abuse the law and rig an election."
2020-08-13 19:12,"The world may have changed but containment strategies have not. The ‘Spanish Flu’ of 1918 lasted 2 years in 3 waves with 500 million people infected and 50 million deaths. Most of the fatalities happened in the 2nd wave. People felt put upon by the quarantine and social distancing measures imposed at the outset and when they were lifted, there was rejoicing in the streets. A few weeks later however the 2nd wave hit with a vengeance killing tens of millions."
2020-08-13 19:13,Could we not look to countries with less advanced healthcare systems (eg. Comparable to 1920s) today to better compare apples to apples?
2020-08-13 19:19,"There was a single advantage at the end of the Spanish Flu pandemic, the local economy, which kept people and production of goods and services confined to geographic areas.

In 1917-18, the World War spread the flu to all corners of the globe, a pandemic that started at a Kansas military base. When new recruits traveled in numbers to a specific point, (Fort Leavenworth) they became human vectors as they dispersed to the front. WWI was truly a global conflict, and the Spanish flu was a Godly wrath brought on by human madness. 

Today, we have the interdependent world economy, which late last year, dispersed millions of tourists, business people, students, transportation workers and migrants from rural areas in China to Italy, to Europe, Asia, and eventually to North and South America.

After the Armistice, a few surges sprang up, but eventually the virus was isolated. Perhaps the key to ending the pandemic is a local economy."
2020-08-13 19:36,"How would Covid-19 affect the people of 1918? And how would the 1918 flu affect people of 2020? Setting aside the question of personal immune response and our differing immunological histories, as well as age differences in the two populations, the people of 1918 were generally much thinner, and much more physically active than today's people, especially today's Americans. On the other hand, a greater proportion of people had nutritional deficiencies and a greater proportion of people smoked in 1918. I would not be surprised if the people of 1918 would be more likely to survive Covid-19 than people today, given comparable medical treatment. Similarly, people of today might be even more likely to die than the people of 1918 if infected with the 1918 flu."
2020-08-13 19:56,"Recall that the life expectancy of the disadvantaged generations now under age 62 was already falling, relative to the more privileged (and self serving) generations that preceded them, before COVID-19.  The life expectancy of those older generations continued to rise.

After three consecutive years of falling overall life expectancy, there was a slight increase in 2019, presumably because of the advantages of those older.  COVID-19 has wiped that out.  So it will be more years of falling life expectancy in the U.S.

I still believe the years of lives lost due to our continuing economic and social decline, the loss of family, community and income, which the shutdowns have accelerated, will exceed the years of lives lost due to the pandemic.  The shutdowns and economic collapse -- with poverty, evictions, unemployment, poor health and weight gain due to lack of activity, missed health care and lost health insurance and services -- will have additional consequences for those not killed or injured by the disease.  Some of those may already be in that death rate."
2020-08-13 20:31,"Oh my goodness, this coming fall and winter even worse?!

We’re already exhausted, physically and mentally, and I imagine so are the medical staffs.

Welcome to the future, it is here. Climate change analysts always said climate change would naturally unearth new pathogens that modern humans had not seen before. And, thus did not have much immunity to.

We are dying, and the Koch family is sitting pretty wherever they go to hide. Why are we not going after them as we have with the Sackler (sp?) family of oxycodone infamy?

Someone (Propublica?) should compile a list of the families who have so benefited by petroleum, and have lobbied to bury climate change predictions and timely changes."

2020-08-13 18:39,"No amount of testing, tracing and anything would have avoided coronavirus death in America as there was wide scale asymptomatic spread of the virus in January and February before we could do anything to contain it.  The virus came from Europe. We should have banned travel from EU to prevent it. When Trump banned China travel Biden called it a xenophobic act. That means, if Biden was president, he would have continued Chinese travel and that would have turned CA into a NY type disaster. Now, Biden pretends that he is the savior."

This is why science will never be able to abolish all diseases only Gods Kingdom will wipe them away forever."
2020-08-13 21:48,"You should fact check the people you quote. This pandemic is nothing like the 1918 Influenza pandemic. That virus killed a LOT more people, it killed primarily healthy young and middle aged individuals and far fewer older people. The Median age of patient mortality caused by this virus is older than the life expectancy of the average American. Also note that the World population has tripled since 1918 and the geriatric population even more than that.

Trump and his enablers own COVID-19 and the devastations that it has left in its wake.  In fact, Trump got something right - COVID-19 has “many names”.  Here are three that I think suit it best; Trump Plague, Trump Virus, the Trump Scourge. Trump will be forever linked to this nightmare."
2020-08-13 20:27,"With all due respect, it's dishonest to simply compare the death rates of C19 and the 1918 flu.

The median age of C19 victims is ~78.  

The median age of 1918 victims was MUCH younger.  It especially targeted 20-40 yr-olds.

78 yr-old victims of C19 lost 3 years of expected life during their least productive years.

30 yr-old victims of 1918 flu lost 25 years of  expected life during their most productive years."

2020-08-13 19:43,it is estimated that 500 million people worldwide had H1N1 in the 1918 epidemic. At least 50 million died from it for a 10% mortality rate. Barely over 10% of SarsCoV2 infections even cause symptoms and the mortality rate is 0.4 to 0.5%
2020-08-13 18:12,"In 1918, in a tenement, there would have been no question about the severity of the virus because it was right in front of your eyes.

2020-08-13 22:21,"We’ve been poised to do a re-enactment of the autumn of 1918, one of three deadly waves. With Covid-19, we’ve already had over 165,000 deaths with the virus not even really hitting until spring was near. The numbers of coronavirus infections never completely subsided during the summer and actually flared in regions. Now as we approach the cool, dry months during which the virus likes to transmits, between a President who feels he has a stake in pretending this isn’t a threat and a nation that has grown tired of the pandemic media narrative, many places have decided to open schools and move on as though we’re out of the woods. 1918 provides the cautionary tale that we’ve decided to ignore with our cavalier attitude. Unlike a weather event or some other types of unpredictable disasters, this is a catastrophe that we can see coming miles away. Thoughts and prayers wait on the horizon."

165,000 deaths from the virus, “IT IS WHAT IT IS”.

And now, tRump saying clearly on Fox why he won’t fund USPS. “Now they need that money in order to make the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots...But if they don’t get those two items that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting...”

Dead people don’t vote and absentee ballots won’t be counted therefore I won’t lose.￼"
2020-08-13 23:01,Not a Cv19 denier but I'd say NYCs on the same trajectory as Sweden.  The only explanation for zero new deaths is that we've achieved herd immunity.  Look around most ny'ers don't or can't social distance and masks are for show when shopping.
2020-08-13 23:37,Yes we have better technology and we should not have been in this dires we are in. But technology only goes so far when you have incompetent Trump and GOP who should've taken advantage of technology at the onset of the virus and even before. Instead they made it political and reduced research funding for the CDC but give money to Kodak.
2020-08-14 4:46,"This is a deadlier virus than the flu in at least one sense.  For every person it kills, it virtually cripples at least two more.  The organ damage this virus creates can leave those who recover from it debilitated.  That is, you can recover from the active phase of the virus, but not the damage it does.  In some cases, people can heal over time, but in many cases, the damage is permanent, and life-shortening."
2020-08-14 6:16,"Dr. Faust’s analysis of the 1918 and 2020 pandemics ought to sound the alarm to those elected officials who insist on relaxing restrictions on wearing masks, opening schools, etc.  The politicians need to rely on the medical experts like Dr. Faust who are on the frontlines of this Coronavirus."
2020-08-14 11:03,"Reading the comments here and other places many of them focus on the mistakes made by all elected officials in the beginning, March/April to spin this in a us/them political nature. I wonder if 1918 was the same or then America pulled together for the common good? I wonder if in 1918 many were saying it was all a sham, wearing a mask takes away my freedom, money is more important than people. I think we can learn a lot from our great grand parents."

Yet against all odds the stock market remains at near all-time high levels.  The most probable explanation is that our treasury is quietly pumping huge amounts of cash into the stock market.  Short term that seems good, but long term it threatens economic collapse, a prospect made all the more credible by Trump's serial bankruptcies.   Why is no news service reporting on this worrisome behavior of the stock market?"

And now, because of Covid, the developed world is imploding, and the institutions built for the 20th century will simply not be able to withstand the devastating impact of this pandemic.

The economic carnage to come will be staggering, the human pain and suffering inconceivable and at society-destabilizing levels. 

Given the scale and scope of the damage, violent revolution is inevitable at this point, both in Europe and the US.

It is stunning that more people--particularly those in power-- aren't talking about it, and trying desperately to find a way to avoid a history-altering cataclysm."

Immigrants often do it as tradition but modern Europeans need to adjust to this new normal for a while. I suggest Mr. Hobert consider moving in with his ex until things get better but that is a personal decision.  They have at least tried to follow the advice of masks/social distancing to a level that will allow families to be together again.  The United States have made this impossible as they move towards opening schools that will probably increase the spread of COVID19 (with no vaccine until possibly end of year or start of 2021).  Neighbors need to support each other and watch over the vulnerable.  Life is precious and we should all care enough to help each other. It is Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness not My Life, My Liberty and My Pursuit of Happiness.  To truly survive the Pandemic throughout the world, we need to care."

Dividends are taxed at a little over half of the rate of income in the top tax bracket (about 50k per year in Germany). This means she also did not pay into unemployment.

2020-08-13 13:21,"I dont understand gyms being closed at all. Mine has reopened, limited capacity. All the machines and weights are distanced. The cardio area is closed. I have been going and it is never crowded, not even close. 
Why not just let gyms reopen for weight lifting which is much less huffing and puffing, doable in a mask? Most dedicated gym goers strength train, they dont go for the treadmill (easily replaced with outdoor training). Most lifters love to socially distance anyway. 
I cant imagine that an hour lifting in a gym is any riskier than an hour of being in a Walmart."

If you can present a rapid test showing a negative result, you can work out."
2020-08-13 13:31,"Gyms have been reopened in NM since June. In July the state instituted a requirement that everyone must wear a mask in the gym at all times, which has been followed at our gym. Our case counts are going down even with gyms being open. Our case counts went up when we temporarily reopened indoor dining, and also before we put in a mandatory 14-day quarantine for people coming in from out of state (as we are between Arizona and Texas, you can imagine what happened when cases exploded in those states - they all tried to come here for ""relief"" from their own bad situations. No thanks, go home). We recently restarted group exercise classes at 25% capacity and that doesn't seem to have impacted case counts. So NJ could reopen gyms with proper precautions in place."
2020-08-13 13:31,"how about some stats on opened gyms? how are they faring? 
yes, faster test results, but we need to go to the gyms, especially now. This article is one hand clapping."
2020-08-13 13:37,"Opening gyms and dance studios is nuts. 

Take your classes online. Oodles of dancers, aerobics enthusiasts and yogis gathering on Zoom and other interactive platforms, where the teacher can see you. Both of the main NYC ballet/dance studios are exclusively online. You can even take class from Saint Petersburg (Russia, not Florida). 

I'm a lifelong ballet dancer taking a near-daily class for many long stretches of my life. I have often been your classic gym rat, attending zumba, pilates and other group exercise classes. My body was built to move, and when sedentary, I am depressed and the pounds fly on until I'm pumpkin-shaped and prediabetic. 

Still, I am not going near a gym and I am heartily sick and tired of people who are trying to defy common sense, science and epidemiology because the government has failed to give them proper support. The owner of the gym in this story, for example, should be free to work out behind his locked doors and given a subsidy until it's safe to reopen. 

It's why we needed block marshalls in the WWII blackouts - without enforcement, people are going roll on clouds of denial into bars, gyms and other high-risk environments. Trouble is, just as with the blackouts, their denial gets the rest of us sick or dead. 

I am outraged at how our wealthy country refuses to provide financial support to small business owners like gymkeepers and little restaurants in the service of public safety."
2020-08-13 13:40,"I recently heard a statement from the owners of Atilis and how they are being extra cautious. It seemed to make a lot of sense, but we have a mandate from the Governor's office that says NO to gyms. While I don't agree with the mandate, I also don't agree with violations of the mandate. It needs to be fixed and fixed now."
2020-08-13 13:47,"My YMCA opened at the end of June and I have been going ever since. I go very early in the morning and on average there is maybe 3 or 4 other people in the entire gym with me. Sometimes I have a good 20-30 minutes by myself (the dream!) The machines are socially distanced and they take our temperature before we come in. I have had no health issues in the 2 months I've been going. 

I worked out at home for over 3 months, I hated it at first but it got more bearable as time went on. The reality was is that I didn't have thousands of dollars to spend on a home gym set up, more like $50 to get some dumbbells before everything else sold out. I was regularly using barbells, cable machines, and a higher weight than I could find dumbbells for. 

My mental health suffered greatly during the first month of the pandemic, I was a new lifter who had finally found a schedule and a form of exercise that I loved. It's a hobby for some people, for others like me who battle depression, anxiety, OCD, etc. the gym and exercise helps me feel like a normal person. How about we take some time to understand why people may be longing for the gyms to be open? Or why people might take the risk to go? Not everything has to be so black and white."
2020-08-13 13:52,"As the NYT has reported, we’ve confirmed that the virus is aerosolized and can remain infectious for hours indoors. Gyms, where heavy breathing and sweating would produce large amounts of the virus, would be one of the most impacted businesses by these new revelations.

We all have to make sacrifices during this pandemic. I understand that this gym is the livelihood for the owners. But they are able to get government assistance as well as have the opportunity to adapt to a more online world. At the end of the day, their gym is not worth someone’s life.

This virus is airborne. No amount of socially distanced gym equipment or available wipes will change that. Opening gyms will inevitably lead to infections, and infections will inevitably lead to death."
2020-08-13 13:54,"Diseases related to a lack of exercise (heart disease, obesity, strokes, cancer to name a few) kill far more people every year than Covid-19 ever will. It is simply ludicrous for gym's to be closed when liquor stores are allowed to remain open. Gyms should be allowed to open with rules in place involving masks, distancing, limited occupancy, sanitizing and good ventilation. If we lose half the gyms in this country, it is not going to be good for the long-term health of an already desperately unhealthy nation. Naturally it was a school of management that ranked gyms as unimportant. I'm sure a school of medicine would come to a different conclusion."
2020-08-13 14:03,"It speaks volumes about American culture that liquor stores are more important than gyms. 
Overweight and obesity are comorbidities with severe covid cases. Shouldn't we encourage people to work out?
Try as I might, I couldn't find any super spreader events at gyms. Plenty of events at bars and restaurants, though."
2020-08-13 14:04,"For those who suggest requiring mask use in the gyms: oh, come on! Did you ever try an intense aerobic workout while breathing through a mask?? If people simply standing in line to get into a club find wearing a mask too burdensome, what are the odds that most people working out in a gym are going to comply??"
2020-08-13 14:10,"I belong to the Y in Randolph and I stopped going even before the Governor closed them in March; it just seemed too dangerous to me. I’d like to return but to me it doesn’t make any sense. Moreover, working out with a mask (especially aerobics) would seem very difficult.  

The only thing  that I could see gyms doing is drastically limiting the number of people at any one time.  However, for profit gyms (unlike the Y), this may not make sense. 

In addition, with fall and then winter approaching, out of door classes will have to be terminated."
2020-08-13 14:13,"Many people have diseases that are kept in check by exercise, like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and systemic arthritis. By adamantly refusing to reopen gyms where they can get access to low-impact exercise, the government is effectively withholding medication. Yet liquor stores are “essential?”  I get why they are, but exercise is, too.  People in my mother’s retirement home are dying, not from Covid but because their Parkinson’s is deteriorating after all those months away from the treadmill. My own arthritis is deteriorating to the point where I may end up with a surgery that would have been entirely unnecessary before. If you have a chronic disease, months of deconditioning is serious. Find a way to reopen gyms safely.  And definitely require masks!!"
2020-08-13 14:14,"As long as some people think their individual rights outweigh their social responsibilities, we’re going to have these people who couldn’t care less about my rights and put both me and my community at risk. 

If a gym wants to stay open, that’s fine with me if the owner is willing to indemnify the members and the community for any damages resulting from Covid-19 infections and deaths. However, we all know that no one would insure them. So no, I’m not willing to risk my health and my community’s health for the sake of a gym owner’s financial health. 

I’ve been working out at one gym or another for over 40 years and I love my gym but at my gym, like most gyms, members can’t seem to even follow the simplest rules, like returning weights to their places and owners rarely enforce them. I have no faith that gyms and gym owners will suddenly be able or even be willing to establish and maintain the most basic of rules during the pandemic."
2020-08-13 14:24,"One very important factor in determining how risky a business is for its patrons is how long they spend there.  I imagine most liquor store patrons finish their business and leave in a few minutes.  Gym patrons may stay for hours.  That is certainly true at the gym I used to patronize.  A long, indoor visit where everyone inside is breathing heavily much of the time - try to think of a situation that is better for virus transmission than that one.  That's why I stopped going to my gym, even though gyms in my area were allowed to reopen quite a while ago.  

The argument that patrons' physical health will be impaired because it's harder for them to exercise doesn't really work.  It's been shown that diet, not exercise, is the key to controlling one's weight.  I did some research on the number of calories I burned with the half hour of cardio I used to do at the gym several times a week.  It was a little over 200 calories, about the same as a good sized sandwich.  That is not going to make the difference between obesity and a normal weight.  No one needs big biceps in order to be healthy.  

I wish this pandemic were not happening.  But people who disagree with public health restrictions should oppose them with real arguments, not the sort of nonsense I keep reading about."
2020-08-13 13:39,"Let's not beat around the bush here, anabolic steroid and SARM usage is rampant at gyms like Atillis. If your spending money on expensive steriod cycles, the necessity to lift is that much greater."
2020-08-13 13:49,"The owners are above the law. Gosh, wonder where they get their inspiration from?"
2020-08-13 14:07,Open the Gyms.  Wear a mask and wipe down equipment when done.
2020-08-13 14:08,The tiny tyrants who impose absurd restrictions on small business should all be impeached like we in California are trying to do with our derelict governor.
2020-08-13 13:45,"Gov. Murphy has been a disaster. He stopped AA and NA meetings, religious services- all could have had some limited availability, but he stopped them cold. (He also released criminals- including those in jail for domestic violence and child abuse- back into the streets and homes.)

He shut off all means for folks to find safety, solace, and peace. So folks are stuck alone, gaining weight, depressed, and possibly abused. 

And let's not forget that Gov. Murphy ALSO sent Covid-19 positive patients into nursing homes killing thousands."
2020-08-13 14:09,"Gov. Murphy, stop being a knucklehead! This is definitely ridiculous now. We are at a stage where we need to start looking at these enterprises individually instead of lumping them in with everyone else. 
How can New Jersey entertain having schools reopen with indoor classes in schools which probably have antiquated ventilation systems and yet have a ban on gyms? Restaurants not allowed indoor dining, not because of incidents in New Jersey, but because of incidents elsewhere? How about we start looking at the NJ population population percentage that goes to gyms and ask whether this group poses a risk? I would rather see gyms judged individually instead of through a study that was probably constructed by people who never set foot in a gym outside of high school! 
How about giving New Jersey residents and business owners a chance to show they can act responsibly instead of throwing us all into the assigned risk?"
2020-08-13 14:24,"Feeling safe is not the same thing as being safe. Indoor heavy exercise is insane. All the sanitizer in the world won't impact a virus that is spread by breathing hard in an indoor space.

And the argument that people need to go to a gym in order to walk on a treadmill and use handweights is _even more insane_. Whoever commodified ""going for a walk"" should feel bad.

Parking lot classes, fine. Great."
2020-08-13 14:32,"One of the most misinformed and dangerous elements of gym owners including Mr. Banks  push to reopen not just in New Jersey but around the country, is their claim that people need to work out so they can be in better shape to fight Covid. Covid does not care if you work out in a gym or take vitamins. It is true that those with underlying conditions are at greater risk, a gym workout is not going to cure diabetes , asthma or AIDS. It is disgusting that gym owners would use baseless claims to defend opening a business that is highly likely to spread Covid."
2020-08-13 14:35,"You’re making it seem as if all NJ gyms are like that. Not so! Most of them are responsible, loaned out equipment to their members, went virtual and/or outdoors and are taking gradual, safe steps to reopen - they care for their employees and members. It’s a hardship, but we, the gym-going public are firmly with the responsible gun owners and clubs, and we support them through this new reality of ours."
2020-08-13 14:40,"I agree that gyms (and indoor dining) should remain closed. However, the inconsistencies in some of the Covid restrictions make it more difficult to justify why gyms should remain closed. For example, I have been working remotely since March without any issues, yet my employer is now asking people to come back to the office. Furthermore, we will not be required to wear masks at our desks (because there will be 6 feet between desks now), yet it is becoming more apparent that 6 feet of distance inside without a mask is not necessarily effective. This will also require individuals to take public transportation, which in my view should be reserved for those who absolutely need it (e.g. emergencies, essential workers, etc.) How is sitting in an open-plan office with people moving around, talking, etc. after they have all traveled via bus, train, and subway lower risk than a gym?"
2020-08-13 14:42,People with medical conditions are first in the door? Maybe pre-COVID but certainly not now. Exercise is part of my daily routine but nobody with Parkinson’s or ms is going to a gym now. This gym in Nj is just putting on a show and now they probably lost their business for good.
2020-08-13 14:44,"I live about 5-10 miles from Bellmawr, NJ and was a bit surprised when I read this article because it did not mention the politicization that this gym owner has made of this issue. He has frequently been interviewed on Fox and has intentionally flouted all regulations set forth by the state and local governments. This issue has been ongoing for months with the owner not following any guidelines. Most people in this area have little or no sympathy for this group because they want their way or no way, which was sorely missed it this article. 

I feel bad for any small business that is impacted by this pandemic and the financial havoc it has wreaked but as an almost lifelong Type 1 diabetic as well as Rheumatoid Arthritis patient who requires immune suppressants to treat the disease, I don’t really care if this group can’t go to their gym, mask-less and then mingle with the broader community."
2020-08-13 14:47,"Part of the issue is the inconsistency with the virus mandates across the board. How can anyone know what is right or wrong when the rules keep changing? Now children can get the virus and transmit it, 6 feet isn’t enough, and the aerosols hang in the air."
2020-08-13 14:51,"Who are these people think they are, that think they can break the law without consequences? Stiff penalties and revoking licences to operate those businesses should be swiftly imposed without any recourse or discussion."
2020-08-13 14:52,"Michigan’s Governor Whitmer took the careful, slow, steady approach & it seems to be working. 
“We’re seeing states that closed late and opened soon are now having much bigger surges of coronavirus,” said Charles Ballard, a Michigan State University economist. “That strongly suggests the policy of trying to be really careful has paid dividends, both in terms of arresting coronavirus and in allowing us to reopen the economy.”"
2020-08-13 14:58,"These establishments and others deemed unsafe need ongoing government support so that they can remain viable and reopen when deemed viable.

They must stay closed and those in violation of such mandate should be put out of business permanently and face charges of endangerment to others."
2020-08-13 15:01,"In reading some of these comments here, I am amazed at how little consideration is being given to the reality of the situation.  Yes, the rules seem to be constantly evolving -- that's because this is a new virus and we are still learning about it. No, taking someone's temperature to test for infection doesn't mean a thing for the 40% of infectious people who are asymptomatic or anyone one infected during the period they are presymptomatic.  No, you can't just decide to accept the risk of getting infected since you might that risk onto many others and those others, some of whom could be die or be crippled for life, don't have any say in your decision. No, building bulging muscles does nothing to protect you from infection and nothing to stop you from passing that infection onto others.

Wake up, people."
2020-08-13 15:04,"There has got to be a way to do this safely especially in states that have low covid rates.

1-Stagger hrs. into a 24/7 arraignment. 

2-Keep people at least 6ft apart, clean, clean, clean all equipment.

3-Limit the number of people to a very few at each time.

4-No showers or changing of clothes, Do it at home. 

5-Some form of a mask must be used."
2020-08-13 15:06,"Really I don't get why we can't adopt air safety standards that would be commensurate with lower virus risk.  Why can't we accept that gyms can open if they install adequate air put fires, and/ or if they have adequate ventilation?  Measure and monitor carbon dioxide levels to ensure there is adequate mix from outside air.  There should be some path to reopening with what we now know."

2020-08-13 14:58,"I loved how in a House committee hearing on the Black Lives Matter demonstrations and law enforcement response, Jim Jordan and his fellow Republicans attacked law breakers.  However, then Jordan got into a huff about how the owners of the Jersey gym were mistreated by being punished for breaking the law.

And at least those gym owners should be grateful they weren't pepper sprayed or beaten as many peaceful demonstrators were."
2020-08-13 15:15,There is no reason people have to go to a gym. People can exercise at home with a few weights.
2020-08-13 15:18,"The lack of scientific support to explain why a closed studio offering high-intensity exercises of gymnastics or martial arts, but NOT a gym with weights, can reopen “safely” is part of what fuels anger at the closures.   And although liquor stores were deemed just as inessential as gyms, they were permitted to open.  Why? Because the excise  taxes and revenue they bring to states like NJ and the fear of what a bunch of people going into withdrawal because they can’t drink, and likely some pressure from the liquor industry, all came into play.  

These are inequities without science behind them, and it’s what makes gym owners and other closed businesses that are no different than ones permitted to open, angry. Get enough testing kits and capacity for fast results, increase contact tracing, and protect the elderly, the morbidly obese, and others at high risk.  Stop letting legislators pick businesses to reopen based solely on tax revenue.  And realize that widespread economic collapse contains its own risks.  We already have too few people paying taxes and working."
2020-08-13 15:26,"MN Gov Walz has been the recipient of endless criticism despite working under the direction of some of the very best medical professionals such as MN based Michael Osterholm. He relented, recently  opening indoor dining and gyms. I still have a membership at a  national chain, however I won’t set foot in a mega petri dish until this is over. Probably going to cancel as my newly purchased ‘Bullworker’ isometric exercise device pretty much mimics weightlifting at a gym."
2020-08-13 15:29,"There is a bizarre tendency to glorify ""small business owners"", but this is how many of them behave. We definitely need small businesses, but we do not need anything close to all small businesses. The pizza shop, gym or bar owner is not fulfilling some patriotic destiny, and it is extremely likely that the IRS would agree. 

Gyms and restaurants provide services that are easily copied at home for low or no cost. There is great angst that the public will figure this out if forced to step away for a few months. Well, they have been and they are."

2020-08-13 15:33,Texas opened gyms prematurely and we were foolish (and desperate) enough to return. Public health precautions were violated as the norm. Mandated masks and distancing were not enforced - “real Texans don’t wear face masks“ seemed to be operative standard. Elders dropped their memberships in protest after an infected active member was forced to quarantine by the state - and the gym failed to notify the exposed members. So I now have a commercial-grade treadmill to accompany the old elliptical and track bike in my living room - with a hot tub on back patio for the male’s high-intensity water aerobics (at 82). The gym could have been safe for all age groups in our community with (surprise!) high infection rates. Gym norms don’t adapt well to empathetic behaviors like masks and distancing.
2020-08-13 15:53,"I empathize with business owners trying to keep things afloat and please their customers. But we're in the midst of a global pandemic, and failing to comply with reasonable orders designed to keep the general public safe is careless at best."
2020-08-13 15:55,"These gym owners should be fined or jailed and their businesses shut down.  But they won’t be, because this is America, where you think you are permitted to infect, annoy or even assault your fellow citizen(s) in the name of “freedom.”  

The owners don’t realize or appreciate how free they already are.  In China, they’d be hauled away and perhaps never seen again.  But here in the US, we can’t even get police to do their jobs . . . unless, of course, you’re an innocent Black person.  Then, it’s pedal to the metal."
2020-08-13 15:38,"Any business owner who defies the govenment orders should be fined, with the fines doubling daily as long as they remain open. These business owners do not care about public safely at all. That's why the chamber of commerce and other business lobbiests are trying to get liability protection for businesses, so they can't be held accountable when people are infected with the virus in their business. Why would anyone support a business owner who cares more about his profits than he does the health and safely of  his customers? I will never support these businesses that defy the stay-safe orders. This virus would have been controlled by now if Americans weren't the selfish jerks they are and refused to do what was necessary to make that happen. That these business owners care so little about what happens to their customers is pathetic. They don't care about me-- I don't care about their business going under. Seems fair."
2020-08-13 15:56,All the opinions on opening or not opening are moot with the current administration’s incompetence in fighting the pandemic.  The entire country has been stuck on hold for six months with no end in sight. What a total waste of human life due to this administration’s lack of a response to the virus.
2020-08-13 15:09,"By the way, I can’t help wondering why none of these flag-waving muscleheads don’t have a couple of choice words for Trump, Mnuchin and McConnell, who first dragged their feet about SBA financial support and loans, and are now refusing to get off the dime.

And no, Trump’s executive orders don’t touch this. A couple of them aren’t even executive orders."
2020-08-13 15:44,"Create a law and fine them.  Make arrests if need be.  The fact-denying toddler mentality in America needs to be addressed and dealt with.  We are civilized, but we are also beings of nature.  And, within nature, creatures who don’t line up and jeopardize the well being of the pack, are pushed out, ostracized and left to face the elements and predators alone.  Unfortunately, the power of ideas or ideologies to manifest a more perfect and healthy union (or pack) is hindered by those who won’t line up and are putting us all in danger due to their selfishness and lack of accountability.  In nature, they would be removed from the pack-and the alpha wouldn’t be nice about it.  Again, we need leadership.  We need alphas, male/female/trans, to protect and lead the pack.  Listen to what nature has to say and you’ll hear the truth.  And if you look, you’ll see the path forward.  Be courageous, be a leader!"
2020-08-13 14:26,"I asked my doctor about going to the gym.  He said absolutely not.  The mere nature of the breathing during a heavy workout is going to put Covid into the air surrounding you.  I was disappointed but not surprised.  So I turned to the internet and found lots of workout videos (for free!) and am now using them until Covid gets under control and a vaccine (a real one) is established.  

Yes, I miss going to the gym but I would miss it a lot more if I were dead."
2020-08-13 14:21,"The takeaway from this article is that it is prudent to have dumbbells, barbells, stationary bikes, etc. at home in case of situations like these. I am content working out safely at home. Plus, a run or walk outdoors is free. I feel sorry for these gym owners, but exercise indoors is a gamble right now."
2020-08-13 13:46,"Either we take the pandemic seriously or we don’t. I really miss my gym and pool, but once we had to shelter in place I just made do. Bought some weighted jump ropes, a BOSU, and installed a pull-up bar. It’s not the same as a gym, it’s not ideal, but it’s about creativity and commitment in a crisis. Stop focusing so much on yourself, think about your family, your neighborhood, your town, your country and humanity."
2020-08-13 14:25,"There simply can't be a discussion about enforced closures without an acknowledgment of the financial ramifications for business owners and remedy for those business owners. 
I believe that the government has the right to prioritize public health, but I also believe government has a responsibility to preserve the economic health of those who face financial ruin through no fault of their own. The misfortune of owning a business that could contribute to the spread of COVID, and which business can't be insured for revenue lost due to COVID restrictions is nothing that any owner could properly predict or contingency plan."
2020-08-13 16:24,"We in San José have perfect weather most of the year (near-perfect the rest of the time) and yet there's no evidence that my gym, fronted by an enormous parking lot, has had the initiative to negotiate with the mall owner and move the weight stations outdoors into the lot.

It doesn't have a sign on the door describing future plans, nor does the corporate parent's website give any information about reopening.

Seems like lousy management to me.

Of course one can do pullups, pushups, etc., at home, but they're not much of a substitute for what a gym offers."
2020-08-13 16:28,"If someone died in the community as a result of infection by one of the gym members, and contact tracing could trace it back to the gym, why couldn’t the gym owner be accused of third degree murder? I’m no lawyer but they sure sounds like killing due to negligence and indifference to me."
2020-08-13 16:59,"Why can’t the people who say they simply must work out get equipment and work out at home? For the cost of the gym membership, they could get the basic gear instead. I preferred working out at home long before Covid showed up. It’s more easier and comfortable and the shower is cleaner."
2020-08-13 17:05,"I'm a pretty liberal guy, but I side with the gym owners here. While it's good to be cautious, the majority of states have opened indoor gyms, albeit on a limited capacity, for months. For some, gyms are essential. In my home state of Vermont, which has the lowest rates of COVID in USA, gyms have been open since mid May. Every week, I've been going to indoor yoga and indoor swimming pool since May. If every day hundreds of thousands of people are engaged safely in group indoor exercise around the US, can't NJ let people decide for themselves if the small incremental risk makes sense for them?"
2020-08-13 17:09,"I worked in a gym until losing my job due to Covid. I understand how important gyms are to people, including myself. 

The business owners in the article argued about the steps they were taking to keep things safe, but the fact they said “masks not required” says they are not taking enough steps.

Even in a gym like the one I worked in where most people would most likely wear a mask, there are always those people who have to defy protocol. These are the people who pre-Covid would try to enter a class in progress very late, not clean up after themselves, monopolize equipment, and terrorize the front desk demanding to be let in because carrying their membership card was too inconvenient. Some people will take off their masks as soon as they think they can get away with it (even if they come in with one) and will throw a fit if politely asked to put on a mask.

If I had a medical condition, I would stay away from the gym for awhile even if everyone including myself wore a mask—there are ways to work out without equipment if need be. It’s harder on us, especially if the gym was a social or therapeutic refuge for us, but so is getting more out of shape from the possible long term effects of even “mild” Covid.

I’d be way more sympathetic to these gym owners if they were taking the risks seriously and presenting their cases demonstrating that they were."
2020-08-13 17:45,"Keeping gyms closed assumes people cannot behave appropriately. That, sadly, may be true. Can a gym owner open safely and make any money? Hard to say, but if it is feasible to enforce the following protocols, it could work:
1) Limit how many people are allowed in by requiring customers to sign up online for a limited number of slots for 75-90 minute periods;
2) Require wearing masks at all times (over your nose!) except on aerobic equipment which is widely spaced (10+ feet); no exceptions;
3) Close the locker room;
4) Have an employee walk the floor to enforce the rules--you can't expect customers to ask others to behave;
5) Close the gym mid-day for an hour or two to clean everything, as well as after closing;
6) Have hand sanitizer handy, post signs, etc.
7) Your HVAC system needs to be able to move enough air and it needs to be filtered. I don't know exactly what the standard should be, but we should be doing this with schools, public buildings and private spaces--everything from gyms to barber shops--maybe leading to a ventilation clearance certificate of some kind."
2020-08-13 17:47,"in CT we have had Gym's open for almost 2 months
while cases continue to decrease

2020-08-13 18:12,"It’s arbitrary and capricious for some states to continue lock downs without an absolute rationale for doing so. It unfairly disadvantages business owners and clients. In this cases and several others eg. indoor dining, movie theaters, there should be federal guidance provided by the CDC that all states should follow. Cuomo and Murphy must be listening to a certain public health expert that is overly cautious."
2020-08-13 16:53,"I am a gym owner in Upstate New York. I question the fairness of the equal application of laws at the present time in our fight against the pandemic. I could bemoan my own situation but I would rather ask, why are bowling alleys in NY still under mandated closure? Is there an overly physical aspect of the activity that I am overlooking? Their owner/operators could easily close off every other lane. They've been disinfecting bowling shoes decades before this pandemic, and I imagine would readily agree to clean bowling balls after use. Moreover, many of the operator's say their patrons bring in their own balls and shoes.

It is my feeling that the application of the law overlooks industries with less of a collective voice or less of a financial impact/backing. Bars have been open since phase 3. Malls were reopened. In person classes will continue in about a month in my school district. Bowling alleys, movie theaters, and gyms remain closed indefinitely."
2020-08-13 16:59,"Such utter hypocritical nonsense.
I have to go to another state to go the gym?
But I can go to an auto parts store, right here in town.
Oh, and florists shops...which were, very interestingly, right before Mothers' Day..
Makes zero sense.

Gyms should do what other businesses are doing...

Calling customers and letting them come in on a top-secret, individual basis. 

My nails look great and my hair looks amazing.  Shhhh..."
2020-08-13 16:56,Has governor Murphy inspected every gym in the state? Has he reviewed every plan for mitigating the threat of spreading Covid? What plan would he approve?  I belong to a state of the art facility associated with a hospital. It's the polar opposite of how Murphy depicts them. No matter to Murphy though. It's becoming clearer by the day that his decree to close down ALL gyms has more to do with his authoritarian bent than a real fear of Covid spread.
2020-08-13 17:11,"So tired of the nonsensical freedom and liberty arguments from the GNC crowd. We’re dealing with a deadly virus with high transmissibility. 6’ of distance isn’t enough..some studies point to up to 16’ of viral droplet suspension.View some of the horrific COVID-19 autopsy footage. Lungs that have utterly melted, en-masse organ failure. Let’s stop deferring to the uneducated, uninformed and those unwilling to learn.

2020-08-13 16:15,"I’ve read the comments from the Gym Owner, who is looking to bank on the politicization. His yelling about “Freedom” for the alleged patriots is all about getting his name in the papers and getting duped to contribute to a crowdfunding.

“Freedom” is not at stake in this “debate.” It’s about the lives that can be impacted because of the obstinacy of small business owners like this and anyone who somehow thinks that complying with health directives (And City Ordinances, and Laws) is somehow about “Freedom.”

Yeah, one is “Free” to assume the risk of catching this disease. But it’s not just about just one person. This is highly infectious, with community infection not being realized for days. Meaning Mr. “Freedom” is okay with his choice, but if infected (And doesn’t discover this fact for 1-2 weeks,) then every other person is at risk of infection.

There are laws and ordinances against reckless behavior. Speeding, for example is illegal because of the risk you pose to others. You might want to be “Free” to act like every highway is Talladega and are “Okay” with the chance that you’ll end up a street pizza. (You’d be lying, but I digress.) But you don’t have the right to put others at risk of the potential accident you will cause.

For those that are still feeling froggy, just wear the mask, drive safe, and stop trying to equate a Public Health Emergency with your warped interpretation of the U.S. Constitution that you read on Facebook or the r/Conservative sub-Reddit."
2020-08-13 18:41,"Each week, I get an email from my gym encouraging me to write to Governor Cuomo and tell him that gyms are essential and outlining the steps they are taking to ensure cleanliness within the gym.  Each week, I ignore the email.

First, by outlining all the additional steps, it makes me wonder just how clean my gym ever really was!  Before the pandemic, I rarely saw people wiping down equipment after use.  Given that this is an airborne virus, spraying disinfectant on the equipment may help during cold and flu season, but it won't cut it for COVID when the weightlifting grunters are grunting away and people are puffing as they run on a treadmill.

I've discovered many options for getting a decent workout in right at home.  I do yoga with online classes, invested in a set of basic weights, an exercise ball and find my long, vigorous walks in nature physically and mentally satisfying.  Humans have found ways to stay in shape before there was a gym or yoga studio on every corner and we will again.

In a time when this country is woefully unprepared for children to return to school, I think that the education of our future should be the top priority."
2020-08-13 18:46,"I live in NJ. These guys are all over the place, on the news, particularly Fox News,  looking for their 15 minutes of fame.  They seem to be enjoying themselves.  Governor Murphy is correct in that gyms are dangerous places during pandemics.  These guys don’t care and have absolutely no respect for the law.  They were given multiple times to comply without a penalty. It was their antics that got their license revoked."
2020-08-13 19:46,"What this article - and the commenters - fail to consider is context, namely the facility's infrastructure. 

New Jersey is one of the densest US states per capita, and, likewise, so are the gyms. Even before COVID, I felt uncomfortable frequenting my local commercial gym in Northern New Jersey because it always felt claustrophobia-inducing with machines/stations spaced only 1-2 feet apart in a window-less, stale basement. 

Once I became more serious about power lifting though, I switched to a barbell-only, warehouse gym with high-ceilings and garage doors. This type of facility is very similar in nature to a UPS, Amazon, and other warehouse where laborers are breathing heavily in masks throughout the day. How are warehouse workers and weight lifters behaviors and environments any different in terms of Covid spread? 

To that end, I believe it is unfair to paint all gyms with a broad brush. The State ought to create a set of stringent facilities guidelines for all gyms and allow those who meet those standards to open. Warehouse and barbell gyms are very different from boutique spin studios, and those gradations ought to be considered in regulations."
2020-08-13 19:55,"To everyone who says we can just work out at home while our local gyms remain closed: Which individual can afford to buy all the equipment (weights, benches) and to rent all the space needed for his or her workout? As other commenters have noted, weights became either astronomically expensive or simply unavailable (especially for anything heavier than 25 lbs) by the beginning of April. So no, it's well-nigh impossible for anyone who isn't both wealthy and well-connected to reproduce a gym workout at home. 

And while journaling, manifesting gratitude, and taking long. meditative walks are certainly nice, they don't yield the physical or spiritual benefits of a strenuous workout with weights. So I implore all the scolds and tut-tutters in this comment section to just accept that there are people who really do benefit from lifting weights, and that we do have a legitimate gripe. 

Since mid-March I've been doing yoga and kitchen ballet, lifting dumbbells, doing lots of push-ups and planks, and taking long walks. But I really, really want to get back to the gym! Maybe next year . . ."
2020-08-13 20:12,"As retired seniors my husband and I are pretty much sticking to home.  After five months of being careful we are getting a little stir crazy.  We live an active adult community with many amenities which we are not using.  Our bedroom is cluttered with weights, a yoga mat, and our new fan exercise bike.  I realize a lot of people don’t have space to equip their homes like a gym, but you can make do to avoid exposing yourself to risk.   I feel bad for the many businesses experiencing  financial hardships and hope for a vaccine soon."
2020-08-13 20:43,"Before Covid, I went to the gym every morning, 7 days a week. I want to stay healthy and work out every day, it’s my right as an individual.  

HOWEVER, let’s not confuse “individual rights” with “selfish rightfulness,” as many in this country does.  With a small investment in equipment (less than $300) I now workout at home or outside 7 days a week, just as I did prior to covid.  It IS possible to both exercise your individual rights AND be a responsible member of your community, the two are not mutually exclusive."
2020-08-13 22:23,"I find it most concerning that neither Cuomo nor Murphy says what benchmarks must be reached in order to move towards some level of reopening. 

I'd go back in a gym right this second. I don't expect it to be like it was before, and I don't think anyone does. I'd accommodate any precaution to return to weight training. I doubt I'm alone. 

Short of that, I want our Governors to tell us what figures they're looking for, so they'll be encouraged to turn some knobs. NYS has been around 1% for ages. It's not going to get better than that, so why can't they tell us what they want to see?"
2020-08-13 22:37,"First of all, this is pure economics. According to my quick check on the internets, $60-billion in support has been given to a handful of airlines so far. If 50,000, as the story suggests, is the number of gyms in the country, that would be [mental math] $1.25-million per gym. Which, I submit, solves the problem. But, of course, that's not going to happen. The alternative, in light of the accurate tenor of the comments I have read, is simple if Draconian. Each gym that wants to open posts $1-million bond from which it pays for care and death benefits of anyone who contracts the virus related to its place of business. What you would see then is the gyms requiring a testing certificate, masks, space suits, etc., at which point, the gyms could, I suspect, operate safely. Better use of their money, I think, than filing lawsuits.

I can attest personally, that gyms, health clubs, most indoor facilities are health hazards, not ""Health  clubs"". Just about every person i knew back then and would come in when sick either at the start or ending of their cold or flu, to ""Work it off"", to ""sweat it out"", in the process spreading their disease to others.  In addition, many health clubs have steam rooms and saunas; steam rooms that just spread the mist, filled with virus particles and of course shower facilities, with hot water/steam also doing the same.

I cancelled my gym membership, but feel like I am being guilt tripped for not going to the dentist for a cleaning.  I am more fearful of being exposed to covid there.   I just wonder why dental preventative care is being encouraged in such a highly infectious environment?   And, what I assume to be a less infectious environment is causing people to be shamed.   Any answers?     People being guilt tripped to go to dentist (suggestion that it is totally safe) vs gym (suggestion that it is not at all safe) where people are shamed.  Something doesnt make sense here.  I will wait out Covid before going to either."
2020-08-14 3:28,"Im in NY right now. In the last 14 days I've been to Colorado, Oregon, California, Illinois and NY and in my mind sitting on a plane recirculating air with 200 people crammed together is way more dangerous than going to a gym. However, I have flown on 6 flight in 2 weeks and have not come down with Covid. Also, I filled out a health questionnaire at the Syracuse airport that said I would be relieving texts from the NY health department every single day. I havent been contacted once. I think keeping gyms closed while allowing dance studios and gymnastics places (which has the word gym even in it) to be open is pretty unfair. Covid restrictions are destroying small businesses. After Covid the only gyms will be corporate, the only restaurants will be corporate, and we will just buy every single thing we need from Amazon bc there will be no local business to go shop at. Ive worked every day through all of Covid. I never stopped. By wearing a mask and washing my hands Ive been able to stay Covid free while traveling all over the US and working with literally hundreds of people. Teachers need to get back to work, gyms need to open, and we need to stop letting Covid allow corporate America to take over even more. Also, I noficed that since no states really have rising cases that the NYT has changed their tracker to per capita cases. Very manipulative, but par for the course."
2020-08-13 14:43,"46 states have successfully reopened gyms and without any Covid-19 outbreaks as a result. What better evidence could there be for re-opening gyms in all states. Anyone who feels unsafe can stay away from gyms. No problem.

So what is so different about New York and New Jersey that gyms are not opened with no word when they will ever open and the gym industry on both states is being destroyed as a result.

New York Health & Racquet Club a well known, high quality long established operator with multiple facilities in New York City  has permanently CLOSED as a result of the never ending shutdown as one example and destroying hundreds of jobs in the process.

So what makes New York and New Jersey so different ?  Andrew Cuomo and Philip Murphy two incompetent Governors who are exercising dictatorial power and we are their victims."

This is America and adults should be free to make their own decisions after weighing any potential risks. For some people, being able to utilize the gym, especially those who are disabled, is medically more important than avoiding the use of the gym after taking the recommended precautions. Tax'em Till They Drop Murphy, as one example, allowed many outdoor venues to open but not outdoor shooting ranges as he hates the 2nd Amendment and the private ownership of firearms. Of course, he retreated on this position with his tail between his legs when gun owner groups instituted suit. The 2nd Amendment is not the issue here, though. The issue is Tax'em running the State of NJ as his own personal fiefdom. I never thought NJ could end up with a governor worse than Jon Corzine but I was wrong, not that Chris Christi was any great shakes either. If Tax'em decides to stand for reelection, I will contribute to, and vote for, his opponent whomever that might be."

As soon as I got to her home, I could see her breathing was labored, but she was totally unaware of that, nausea being the main symptom she noticed.  In fact, when the EMTs arrived, they used an oximeter and found that her oxygen saturation was only about 60%.  She had pneumonia and spent a week in the hospital.

I see a need for a reputable, anonymous, online Covid-19  recommendation engine.

It would utilize vital signs, symptoms, comorbidities, age, sex, body mass, medical history, physical location, etc. to form a detailed analysis and recommendation.

People could enter their data and update it, to help them decide if they were in need of additional diagnostic tests or medical intervention."

They didn't realize then that once you have trouble breathing your lower lungs were already trashed; you were in deep trouble.  

It was suggested that we all monitor our oxygen levels and when they go low, go to the ER and demand to be admitted.  Or, at least go to your doctor, a number of which would prescribe hyroxychorliquine.  The media didn't like that narrative, so you really had to read the medical journals and talk with doctor friends on the front lines. 

Sadly, the media is more about politics than health.  Glad this reservation used science vs. politics.  And to those that didn't read the article, it was NOT contact tracing that really made the difference, per doctors.  If you're willing to be open minded."

Fortunately, this community has their own hospital where members can be treated.  Unfortunately for so many of the hard-hit communities in our nation, members do not have access to this kind of testing and care.

No protests, no AK47s and military gear, no Pro-Trump rallies to celebrate not wearing masks. All they do is implement a plan and the people are educated enough to understand why. 

The USA has sparsely populated counties out west with less than 35,000 people pulling in 20 cases a day. Our supposed safe cities in the Northeast of similar size are still racking up 100 to 200 cases a day. A DAY. 

Trump and the GOP is the worst government and party in the developed world.  Our people are really among the least knowledgeable in the world.

Prime Minister Jacinta Ardern has conditioned the people of her country to be cautious and flexible. And smart. They're locking down again. This proves how serious this ongoing virus is in its reappearances and in its uncaring resolve to find hosts on which to consume and replicate. NZ's not on a golf course with ""it is what it is"" etched on a golfing cart. And I have read no stories about angry New Zealanders storming the steps and entering the lobbies of lawmakers' offices demanding their ""freedoms.""

America saw an explosion of infections and deaths when the weather warmed up. June was bad and ushered in a hellish July. But August promises to be much worse. 

And the president and the governors of several states want schools re-opened. It makes me wonder sometimes if parents who live in the Bible Belt and the Southwest actually love their children. I mean, are they so into the Trump kool-aid that they're willing to risk their children's health and safety? It would seem so, but I guess it's all of a piece: ""Make America Great Again.""

Speaking of caring people, I was deeply saddened about the story recently in which a father and son who were physicians and took care of patients with COVID-19, both died within days of each other from COVID-19.

We all know that if Trump had handled this the way a real leader should have done starting in February 2019 and followed expert advice, the death toll would have been much much lower and the whole country could be on a road to real recovery albeit at a slow pace until a vaccine or cure is available. Everyone wants in-class learning and opening of social venues like restaurants, sports etc. But we can't do it by wishful thinking. We must ALL follow the ""science."" 

After millennia of mystical/religious thinking humans now have real scientific methods that help us solve real problems.

If he articulated a reason that could’ve been tested through rational, informed debate, then ok, we’d be on the right path.  But instead be just struts and bellows like a cartoon dictator.  So, most people (reasonably) assume a hidden agenda, likely nefarious, and do the opposite of what he demands.  This is the state of American leadership.  It’s also why the scientific pursuit of a vaccine is not our biggest challenge.  No, the biggest challenge will be in persuading people that it’s safe and effective, and if Trump appoints himself as the chief promoter of a vaccine, most Americans won’t believe him and they’ll avoid it.  So as much as we’d all love a vaccine to be developed before inauguration 2021, in fact we’ll be better off if it’s after that date and Trump, who won’t leave voluntarily, has been evicted from the White House by federal marshals, and the new occupants of the White House, whether it be Biden and Harris or [fill in the blank], assume the role of building public confidence that a safe vaccine is produced and will be fairly and competently distributed where needed.

Why are they the only class of employees that don't have to make tough economic decisions?  At least return some of the per pupil spending to working parents so that they can find care for their kids and still support their households.

2020-08-13 14:00,"As a retired teacher I can bring to the discussion of opening schools in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic a bit of background.  There’s hardly a teacher or corresponding staff member that make up the school setting who hasn’t  used the description  that at times a regular school is a veritable Petri Dish.  

And not in a disparaging way, just the reality that during flu and cold season many of the students  and staff members get sick from other students and staff members.  More so at the elementary level.  

This coronavirus though can be deadly particularly for older people with comorbidities like high blood pressure and diabetes , among others.  That’s where the older staff becomes a concern in the opening of schools.  

For forty years I willingly received the then current Flu Vaccine and luckily avoided the flu most years or got a mild 1-2 day flu.  The one year a strain was too late to be included in a 3 strain vaccine, students and staff got hit hard, myself included.  Kids and adults got sick after arriving healthy going home often very ill during the day.  It spread, as they say, like wildfire.  An elementary school closed for several days to combat it.  

Instead of the constant advice to follow CDC generalized and, IMO, watered down guidelines, I propose we follow the WHITE HOUSE COVID-19 GUIDELINES, what they do.  Let the schools do as the President does, not just what the President says!

New Zealand is rolling out a huge testing, contact tracing and quarantine blitz that aims to quash Covid-19 for the second time.

“Going hard and early is still the best course of action,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. “We have a plan.”

New Zealand has responded with a level of urgency and action that it hopes will be a model for how to eliminate a burst of infection and rapidly reopen.

Michael Baker, an epidemiologist who was a leading proponent of New Zealand’s efforts to eliminate the virus, said:

What makes these errors of judgement all the more regrettable is that they contradict the advice of the scientific community, particularly the men and women whose entire epidemiology careers have prepared them for this moment. 

During an historic pandemic, placing the responsibility for critical nationwide public health policies in the hands of politically and economically motivated local school superintendents, principals, and university administration executives is beyond unwise. It is an ideologically motivated crime against innocent children and young adults.

If I were to tell you that this week I only gained 20 pounds, whereas last week I gained 30 and the week before that 40, and that I now felt like I was on the right road to achieving a healthy weight, I'm sure you'd suggest we celebrate by going out for banana splits.

I have an MBA. I spent 40+ years in business, mostly in finance. I do not understand this calculus, so obviously I went to the wrong school and did my job wrong for many years. I think now I should have been trying to convince management that year-over-year losses were fine, as long as we lost less each year.

I fully understand that at any given time there are people being hired while there are also people being fired or laid off, so it's not as if I expect employment to rise indefinitely until unemployment reaches zero. But this nonsense is beyond comprehension. It is not a sign of economic health, nor recovery of any sort when 963,000 people file for unemployment, therefore there is no basis whatsoever for withholding additional relief aid to people who are out of work.

You can't expect children in colder climates to ride with open windows. You can't enforce social-distancing on school buses. You want bus drivers to watch the roads and not monitor mask-wearing.

The U.S. has failed in its goal of providing affordable health insurance to everyone, that the other developed countries have all done for between 25 and 75 years now.  It needs much fixing, and that needs strong Democratic majorities in Congress.

(And even with that, I'm not positive the Dems will do a strong enough fix.)

We only have 91% ""insured"" now, in the stats, to drop 1-2% from covid.  This is largely due to unaffordability for some people: Though the ACA treats many people quite well, some people have premiums plus out of pocket max of 40% of income. 

(Only 1%-2% of the uninsured number is due to failure of the 12 red states to expand Medicaid.)

Further, even though the official stats count all people with a Medicaid, including ACA expanded Medicaid, in the 91% ""insured"", actually, in 10-14 states, including blue ones like MA, MD, and NJ, medical bills paid out for people 55 and over under any Medicaid, including ACA expanded Medicaid, are subject to estate recovery.  That's not insurance--it's a loan, and it blocks lower income people from accumulating wealth intergenerationally.  This must be fixed.

He couldn’t put together an effective program even if he were being paid to do it. Hold on—we are paying him! It’s been obvious for a while that Trump is an ineffective, bumbling employee who does not know how to learn. He should be fired as soon as possible.

You cannot sustain locking them down, it goes against their psyches at this age. It’s not sustainable and if my grandson is any example, he and his friends would do just about anything to get out. I see kids playing basketball at the park, swimming, jogging, hanging out at houses. Why oh why not send them back to school with safety measures. 
If these educators were on unemployment, they wouldn’t be so definite about keeping schools closed. Really, cut their pay or lay many off and you’d hear a different tube. 
And finally, the argument about everything these days is if Trump wants it, then let’s say the opposite. There’s no science or logic, just hate. I don’t get it.

There is nothing that shows someone can’t get COVID19 and flu at the same time.

Once the cold weather rolls in, I think these numbers are going to skyrocket (again) and without a stimulus package in place, it will be garbage bags in lieu of proper PPE (again), unemployment claims in the millions (again) and a lot of unnecessary suffering (again).

Speak with the operators of local food banks and ask them if they feel overwhelmed with the demands still made upon them.

Young people are most familiar with names like Apple and Amazon and that's what they're buying.  I've been an investor for over 20 years and I'm very concerned about these apps that offer commission-free trades and I'm concerned about the free money the government is giving to people to gamble with.  I was there during the dot-com boom and bust.  There is no free lunch in the markets.  These kids don't understand what they're doing.

As we all know and wonder about the COVID vaccines, there's also aspects to consider like ingredients, and price. The concern I'm going to address is price. I believe yes, a vaccine is needed but if it's too expensive to the point many people cannot afford it what's the point of fairness in that? I would've thought that we want people to have access to the vaccine and to not live with fear of getting the virus yet the possible high prices are not representing that point.  I thought we wanted to bring back flourishing economies, schools and normal life but if this price is what's going to stop us that needs to be changed and thought through logically. I personally want to bring life back to normal and be able to go out and have fun in public where I don't have to worry if I forgot my mask or not."

2020-08-13 20:32,"My paternal grandfather immigrated from Russia with his bride in 1914. They settled in NYC and my grandfather although an educated man, was young and quickly had three children.  He opened a blacksmith shop in a small brick building. It was a converted fire station. They were doing well. Then in 1918 the flu epidemic was upon them.  Several members of the extended family got sick, but survived.  My grandmother died.  As was the custom of the day my grandfather wrote back to his small town in Russia, and asked them to send him another bride.  He needed someone to take care of the small children.  That epidemic saw orphanages open all over the city, and foundling homes where small children were housed in dormitory settings until survivors could make arrangements to take them back. On no special occasion, but several times during my youth my father would outline the tale of the 1918 pandemic.  And then he would get quiet and sit alone in his chair.  People did whatever they had to do to survive.  There were soup kitchens. Pies would be sold for a nickel or a dime on the street.  My grandfather died in NYC when he was 90 years old.  My father lived until 2001. That pandemic was part of the lore I grew up with.  That Covid-19 is part of our lives for the time being, I am surprised, but I think  I expected it.  I respect that we have masks and hospitals, and refrigerated trucks for the dead.  Coronavirus will end.  And tales of this time will be told for a century."

Frankly, the worst thing for them to do politically would be to float an anemic stimulus which will yield a quick, painful contraction over the next few months, tanking the recovery and giving voters the ultimate reason to vote against the GOP. The GOP stonewalling parsimony is senseless and against their own political interests.

Likewise, leaving states to flounder only undermines their election potency and can't possibly yield the political results they desire... spotting or proping up the microeconomy through unemployment and state aid will, and they would be the recipient of the credit for that. If the GOP wants to harness this goodwill at the polls, they better find a way to meet the House in the middle. Republicans can co-opt that goodwill in mind of the electorate only through an effective aid package and yet they seem unable to corral their own wayward party members. Poor rebuplicans. Poor Trump. They can't even save themselves, for the myopia and rigidity of their party core. 

The GOP could walk away with the vote if they can silence their own short-sighted ideologues and ""buy"" the election with stimulus aid that their own adversaries are pushing, a novel way to win."

It's about the executive order for the unemployment topoff of $400. a week, where each state is required to come up with $100. a week of that to get the Federal $300 towards the topoff.

The reason is that the topoff is being done via the Stafford Disaster Relief Act, which requires a 25% contribution from the states for any assistance under it (detail: which is not housing assistance, i.e. the topoff comes under ""other assistance"").

We still have entire industries shut down or just barely stumbling along. Not to mention severe undercounting of COVID-19 related deaths and people up north dreading a resurgence when the weather turns cold and more people are forced to stay inside. All of these factors should be in play in negotiations, not just what happened last month! I am continually astonished at the lack of planning and foresight from the Senate and the White House.

Since the House passed its version of COVID relief McConnell and the Senate maintained its steady pace of judicial appointments and never once brought COVID relief to the floor.  In the past 4 months, DJT and VP Pence have pronounced multiple ends of the COVID crisis only to have cases and deaths erupt from one region to the next. Yet Schumer and yes Pelosi, offer the sound bite a relief bill is hung up by a dollar figure difference which makes COVID no different than every Congressional stalemate of the last 20 years. Simply incredible and very stupid. The hangup is Republicans have utterly and completely failed to step up to the challenge of a pandemic. Call them to task for their failure.

- Germany is a nation of 83 million people
- The U.S. is about 330 million, so the factor is about 4
- At the height (!) of the pandemic (April/May) we had 6000 new infections a day
- Multiplied by 4 that would be 24.000 for the U.S.
- But you never, ever got below that number, even after the first wave has passed!
- Instead you racked up a number of 75.000 infections a day, in full knowlede of the virus and it's properties, and after the first wave went through.

The U.S. never reached any kind of baseline from with to build up. Track and Trace is not feasible with numbers like that. And don't give me this ""we test more"" stuff. The very first test was developed and deployed in Germany while your CDC was stupidly trying to create your own - maybe because of ""national (in)security""? Per capita we test at least as much as the U.S., probably more, and our tests don't take two weeks to get the results...

Even today, with a resurgence of the virus in Germany, we still had ""only"" 1445 new infections. That would be about 6000 in U.S. terms. But you actually have 56.000 new infections! And you you are opening schools, let people go to bars, and think about restarting mayor sport leagues.

Maybe we should ""slow the testing down"" around the White House. We should all be disgusted with this trump regime.

The fact is that our lives can only return back to some semblance of normalcy once this virus is somewhat contained. Right now, it's nowhere close to contained. And there's still much we don't know about the virus, especially its effects on children.

The most effective way to contain it is through a robust, nationwide, systematic testing and contact tracing plan. Yet trump has consistently rejected a federal role in testing and contact tracing. 

The sooner we can replace the trump administration with effective leadership, who will put medical and public health experts in charge as opposed to unqualified family members and sycophants, the sooner our lives can return to some semblance of normalcy.

Things are getting worse. Nearly six months later, things are STILL GETTING WORSE... that, in itself, is staggering. That this could be politicized, that a Sheriff could make it so that mask wearing is forbidden, that ""culture wars"" could arise over a flimsy, weightless mask...

It's a self-inflicted wound that won't heal. People are entitled and unlikely to sacrifice for the greater good. And yet, they whine and whine more than the people of the Depression did and they've done less than people who lived through World War II lived. During the war effort people had to go without butter, have regular blackouts, not buy new clothes- they accepted it as part of the bigger picture for the greater good. Now we've got rich white men whining that their mask is uncomfortable. It's incredible."

Wearing our masks we headed south from NJ, but found arriving just outside the D.C Metro area in Va. that it’s like no one even knows there’s a pandemic. No masks (literally, you could look down a city block and not see one masked face) anywhere but maybe Starbucks, where I assume it’s required nationally. Outdoor seating at restaurants in a few spots, but tables close together and no masks on servers. We got takeout we grabbed at a bar right inside a restaurant door - literally ours were the only masked faces. It was disturbing, to say the least. And disheartening."

I think he should go for it. Wouldn't it be great to hear his fumbling explanation for why people shouldn't protect others by wearing face masks _during a pandemic_? 

But then, Kemp's just another of Mr. Trump's wrong-headed zealots who think it's cool trying to convince citizens doing the opposite of what makes sense is somehow brazen and cool. 

What can you say? What _does_ one say? Perhaps we should simply point out that Mr. Kemp is yet another Republican public health menace? Because that's exactly what he is. And why does anyone give him the time of day?"

2020-08-14 1:43,"Hey NYT,
California has 40M people. Simple math would tell you that numbers per million are lower than many states.  I guess I’m surprised you still haven’t figured this out."
2020-08-14 1:02,"California, with 40 million people, has 12% of the US population, so of course it is the first state to report 600 thousand cases.  The next biggest states are Texas (20 million; 9%) and Florida (22 million; 6.5%), so they will be right behind California.

In comparison, 24 US States have less than 10% of the California population.

A far more valuable way of describing the pandemic effect are by ranking the states by cases/ 100,000 inhabitants and fatalities/ 100,000 inhabitants.  

For cases, using those metrics, Louisiana is ranked first, with 2,882 cases/ 100,000.  California is ranked 23rd, with 1,482 cases/100,000.   That means the California case rate is just 51% that of Louisiana.

For fatalities, using those metrics, New Jersey is ranked first, with 178 deaths/ 100,000.  California is ranked 29th, with 27 deaths/100,000.   The California death rate is 15% that of New Jersey.

2020-08-14 2:11,"Let's keep the coronavirus infection and death statistics straight. The only valid statistical method is to quote PER CAPITA numbers. The ratio of populations of California over other states with huge infection rates are: NY, 2.0; NJ, 4.4; FL 1.8.  If California is still behind these states with significantly smaller populations, then we are better by the factors given above.

That being said, I am embarrassed to see that we are not 10 - 20 times better than everyone else. California has much of the same defiant population that refuse to follow expert advice as  everyone else."

An hour a day should suffice to compile a list of all the companies who boycotted Facebook and Twitter, but who take out ad space in Newsweek, and put it somewhere prominent so people can boycott them.  After all, we ask FB and tweety-bird to take down hate speech and stop conspiracy theories.  So why should they do that if Newsweek is going to publish racist trash from wingnut law school professors festering in places like Chapman University?

Do not buy Newsweek, do not subscribe to Newsweek, do not spend one red cent with anyone who advertises there.  They are currently running a Chevrolet ad, so there's a car not to buy.

Aren't we at a place where we can start questioning removing Trump from office for being a danger to Americans by not enforcing people to where masks? SERIOUSLY!! This is insane. Trump could mandate mask wearing from an emergency executive order for 6 months. There are traffic laws, laws for wearing no shirt and shoes in restaurants, no smoking in restaurants.

If Trump would have led and taken covid-19 seriously, had increased testing as to know who had the virus and the location of hot spots through tracing, then it would be safe for children to return to school this fall as well as sport. We would be much closer to getting back to normal.

If Trump had cared more about the country instead of only his re-election and had followed the health guidelines recommended, then the economy would have recovered by now with the unemployment rate rising. 

If Trump had an ounce of empathy, he would have made a fireside speech expressing condolences to the almost two hundred thousand Americans who have died from covid-19; and to their families and friends.

2020-08-14 8:23,"Gavin Newsom did the right thing initially, but he caved to political pressure and jumped on the “re-opening” bandwagon. Unsurprisingly, California had a big case surge since June. However, since NYT’s headline puts sensationalism ahead of context, it’s worth nothing that 600,000 still means California ranks 28th per capita among these states. That’s nothing to celebrate, but people who think this represents some triumph of red state policies like refusing to wear masks should look at Louisiana, Arizona, Mississippi, and Florida, #1 through #4 in case rate per capita. And Texas has now managed to surge ahead of California. Ignoring scientists is just not good policy, no matter your partisan affiliation.

In the end, this shouldn’t be some ridiculous partisan taunting contest. These are real sick people and real deaths. The only agenda should be to stop the pandemic and the only guide should be medical science. But the fact there are already comments engaged in partisan gloating shows how sick America has become, not just physically but morally."

2020-08-13 15:30,"On the one hand, I support an remote start to the school year (my kids attend public school).  It is the right thing to do during the pandemic.  The Georgia stories are horrifying.

On the other hand, I think the pandemic has emboldened the teachers unions to an unfortunate degree.  It has certainly provided an excellent rallying call for them, but I have heard from several civic leaders, most of whom are staunch union allies, that the teachers unions are overreaching.

In Massachusetts, the unions are now asking the legislature to ""take this opportunity"" to permanently ban MCAS, our state exam.  That might be the right course of action eventually, but to push the issue now is totally tone deaf."
2020-08-13 15:22,"Trump is personally responsible for the fact that it's unsafe to send kids back to school--or for people to go to a bar or a movie, or for grandparents to hug their grandchildren, and any number of other things that are now possible in countries with good governance such as Germany or Taiwan or France or South Korea.  That he is now bullying and hectoring teachers and students to go back to unsafe schools is psychotic and sociopathic.  It's as if the fire chief denied the schoolhouses were on fire because he thought it would make him look bad, and then turned around and insisted that kids go back into the burning buildings.

Our national media has simply not been up to the task of reporting well on the sheer monstrous destructive lunacy of this man."

2020-08-13 15:35,"I cannot imagine the extent of school clusters and the cataclysmic impact on teachers and families notwithstanding children that will die.

However, the two party system cannot survive him banging a hammer regarding ineffective pandemic policy and cutting off unemployment benefits."
2020-08-13 15:38,"A command from a president who displays his utter ignorance and lack of compassion daily, who extolls the virtue of the ""under educated"" and appears to be one himself, and who has intentionally and in full view of the public sidelined the CDC and attacked the experts and science - a command from this guy to ""reopen schools"" carries almost no weight to anyone at the school districts level except those local politicians who are in the bag for Trump and his far right anti-science pro-evangelical agenda.  

School districts got a taste of what is truly involved with putting this all together, during the March to June timeframe when they had to adjust in real time to an entirely new manner of teaching and reaching students - while maintaining some semblance of safety.  Remember, Trump won't be the one sued (nor his GOP governors and administration hacks) when a student contracts the disease.  Local officials will, though.  And this is important, as accountability for decision making counts.  Science is real, and ignoring it simply leads to someone getting hurt unnecessarily.

There are ways to do this right.  And fast and with zero regard to safety is not one of those ways."
2020-08-13 15:40,"Well of course we educators are running the other direction when Trump tells us to run the way he's pointing. Educators are often the voice for children when very few people speak for their needs.  We aren't (entirely) a cog in the capitalist machinery that Trump and his ilk wants to cast as the reason d'etre of America. We aren't here for the money. The focus is on the kids--mentally, physically, even spiritually. These aren't just future consumers and worker bees. These are future citizens, parents, and gosh darn it...they *are* Americans. We aren't so willing to put children (and yes ourselves to) in harm's way. We're educators. We are educated, intelligent, and put children's needs before money, and committed to safety and the long game.  So, in short, the not-Trump plan."
2020-08-13 15:38,"We are used to seeing arguments based on a few facts and presumptions, that lead to a conclusions based on logic.

In trump-world the conclusion is chosen for personal political reasons, then the facts and logic are molded to force home
the conclusion. We've seen this approach in climate change and will lead to disastrous consequences in the long run.

Its hard for teachers to accept this logic  when it increases their chances of getting sick, and dying. Clearly this is another case where Trumps  chaotic process, and bullying fail to allow each district or school to work out the best process.
The choices are not binary, and the most logical things to do
probably aren't legal.    It makes sense to keep schools
open only for 'volunteer'  teachers, and to give parents choices, based on their work needs, and their children's educational needs. But when you politicize the discussion the
subtle compromises get that much harder to do."
2020-08-13 15:47,"As trump labels safety sought as a major concern regarding opening schools by Governors, mayors, teachers, health experts and parents as political because he only sees himself first and who terms everything in ""WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME"" !

2020-08-13 15:44,"There is no subject more emotional than the subject of children. Had there been a president willing to listen to the concerns of parents, or who even expressed sympathy for their concerns, this subject of school openings might have been decided upon with some consensus. Instead, there was Trump who is completely unable to see past his desire for re-election and who has little thought of anything else. How many parents are going to set aside the distrust inspired by that, and offer their child for sacrifice on the altar of D. Trump's re-election ?"
2020-08-13 15:25,"Once again Trump fumbles, acts rashly, and shoots himself in the foot.  Seems to me there would have been valid arguments for re-opening schools, like how online learning is not as effective, low-income students will suffer more from not having in-person teaching, and many parents need to return to their jobs physically.

It could have been accomplished with Trump's assurance that safety protocols would be used, funding would be provided by the Federal government, new spaces would be opened to allow for social distancing, new teachers would be hired to help out, and so on.  Had all those things been offered, people would probably have been a lot more accepting of returning to school.

But Trump messed up yet again, leaped into the debate without understanding the circumstances, and made himself look just as awful as he is.  Hopefully it helps get him out of office, which is what America and the world desperately needs."
2020-08-13 15:50,"Trump's reasoning for opening schools is transparent and is no different from his approach to retail or hospitality. He's been coddled his entire life, and were it not for the hubris that drove Trump to be king, he still be a small-time operator, too lowly to attract the attention of world-class tyrants or SDNY."
2020-08-13 15:53,"Trump's biggest problem is Trump himself.  How different might the response have been had he said something more along the lines of ""I understand opening the schools will be difficult and will require following CDC guidlines.  My administration will do everything we can to assist school districts in their efforts to resume classes, whether they are held remotely or in person as each district deems prudent.""  Instead we get the dictum with a one-size-fits-all command and a threat of withholding funds.  This was his educational ""fire and fury"" moment, and it didn't play well at all.  This could have been the opportunity to push for broadband access across the nation to bring everyone into our modern age of communications, but the bigger picture has eluded him.  Granted, that wouldn't happen overnight and we need immediate solutions, but we also need to be working on long-term ones as well.  It's that walking while chewing gum thing."
2020-08-13 15:25,"We've reopened in the south and have quickly closed back down.   The ones that haven't opened yet I figure may make it for a week or two.  There is absolutely no safe way to reopen schools in areas where case counts are rising, just like there's no safe way to do contact sports, go to bars, dine inside, etc.  Trump and his enablers  want to pretend that it's business as usual, irresponsible Governors (Bill Lee, I'm talking about you) also want to pretend, but at the end of the day they're putting people at risk of sickness and possibly death."
2020-08-13 16:09,"Every school in the country has been closed for almost 6 months. I would have thought during that time period, safe, effective and protective measures could and would have been developed and initiated in the event kids and teachers would be returning for the fall semester.

What exactly have school administrations done to protect kids, teachers and staff should they return to the classroom?

Until solid and safe measures have been taken, sending anyone back to the classroom is as reckless and irresponsible as the president not supporting nor endorsing the wearing of a face mask.

Kids are not petri dishes and teachers are not ""soldiers"" fighting the good fight.  They are human beings with families, spouses, siblings, parents and grandparents who love and worry about them.  They deserve to be safe and protected at all costs."
2020-08-13 16:15,"The shambolic efforts at remote learning last spring in Portland, Ore. were maddening. There was no coordination at the district or even school level. Every teacher had a different plan, different daily schedule, different software. And seemingly no accountability. Our 9th-grader's Spanish teacher was basically MIA for the entire spring -- getting paid for doing almost nothing. It was excusable for a couple weeks, but after that ... shameful.

This fall, we're in in Louisville, KY. The school board voted a month ago to postpone in-person instruction for at least six weeks. There wasn't a single dissenting vote on the school board. I spoke to my board rep and he said he could not in good conscience subject teachers to the risk of Covid-19.

Private industry finds a way. It's true in education, as well. We've enrolled our youngest in a private school that will open for in-person instruction. They've worked all summer on their system. They've repurposed less-used rooms so that kids can spread out. They're using video-conferencing tools and big-screen projectors. They're bringing in teaching assistants to ensure in-person help for everyone. 

We don't know how well this will work. But I'm impressed at the creativity and can-do attitude. And thanking my lucky stars we can afford the tuition."
2020-08-13 16:27,"As a retired teacher with almost 40 years of teaching, I do weary of the “powerful union” thing. In NY and some other states, it’s true, but in a lot of the country teacher unions have very little power. It took years for the two major organizations to quit fighting each other, much less exert power."
2020-08-13 16:30,"As a teacher my political leanings play ZERO role in my feelings about re-opening schools. I love my job and I'm not talking about grading papers but dealing with students. To a person everyone I know wants back into the classroom so they can teach again. The only factor holding that back is the science! If it's safe for my students ,their families and hopefully myself as well I'm here ready to go.
The big orange-haired guy is just a side show that doesn't even come into the equation."
2020-08-13 16:11,"While it’s possible that the president’s tone and relentlessness has contributed to the growing conviction that in-person teaching is unsafe, I would argue that the lack of any consistent national plan and the consequent surges in case numbers and fatalities is a major driving factor. When his July 6 tweet commanded that all schools should open, many people likely hoped that there would be a reduction in the spread of the disease, making school attendance a possibility. With millions more infected since then, rational thinkers would aptly choose to keep schools closed. Our president’s irrational disinterest in public health is just icing on the “BEAUTIFUL chocolate cake” that he blubbers about."
2020-08-13 16:30,"""I thought it was really good and useful to have someone with a big megaphone make those arguments,” Mr. Hess said. “But he made them in such a five-thumbed, unserious, reckless way.”. This quote can be used on just about anything trump attempts. Nobody believes him. They now see that going the opposite of what he proposes is usually the better way to go."
2020-08-13 16:10,"Historians will study the politicization of masks for decades.  

If Donald Trump isn’t a foreign asset, he sure behaves like one, The only other question worth investigating is why have all elected republicans enabled him with their complicit support of non masking.  

It didn’t have to be like this."
2020-08-13 16:32,"Open the schools. If teachers elect grocery workers to work then they need to go to work. If they don’t want to I’m sure someone will be glad to take their job.

I used to support the teachers union but now I see them as instruments of systemic racism that oppress minority students and families who want school choice and schools that work.

The unions have failed our students, just as the police unions have failed our citizens.

It’s time for major reform of our education system. After seeing the demands of the California teachers union, I might vote Trump, but let’s see how the debates go.."
2020-08-13 16:27,"Have we not learned anything from countries, such as Sweden, that never closed their schools and never mandated masks on children? Children there are not dying and are probably happier. Here, where the population has been terrorized, parents and teachers are afraid of sending their kids to school; and if they do, masks will be mandated, as well as mass application of sanitizers, which themselves pose a health threat."
2020-08-13 16:07,"Union resistance even in NY shows, they are not interested to teach kids, but only interested to play politics. I don't think their job is riskier than  nurses."

Sweden: schools have remained open for 15 and under. no masks
1.8 million children
468 cases
8 required ICU
Zero deaths
Teachers had identical cases as the general populaton
Data, data..."
2020-08-13 16:18,"Trump announced yesterday that he's sending 150 million masks to schools around the country to make it safe to reopen.  Whether this is true or a lie remains to be seen.  But il illustrates how he and Republicans fail to understand people's feelings about this and other matters.  Parents and teachers are quite apprehensive about reopening schools not because there aren't enough masks.  They are apprehensive because in the communities where they live, there is a recent spike in infections.  His solution, stated already by him, to that problem is to do less tests so the infections (detected) will decrease.  That is deceitful sleight of hand.  A caring parent will not trust him after he offers such a deceitful solution no matter how many masks he sends."
2020-08-13 16:19,"While the lazy coward hides behind a wall of testing, he expects teachers and parents to take the risks.  If he had just done his job properly like leaders of all other advanced countries, the problem would be solved and lives would be safe.  Trump cannot sacrifice innocent parents and teaches for the sake of his reelection efforts.  Failure has its consequences and they should not be foisted upon the innocent."
2020-08-13 16:27,Did anyone mention the President’s son attends a private school that will NOT have in person attendance.
2020-08-13 16:01,We don't know enough about the coronavirus in children. So let's open the schools and find out. Great plan!
2020-08-13 15:55,"“By some estimates, at least half of the nation’s children will now spend a significant portion of the fall, or longer, learning in front of their laptops.”

Did Trump’s plan really backfire? Because in the middle of a pandemic that’s out of control in the damp, steamy month of August we have half of the children in the nation going to back into the schools for the cold, dry, virus transmitting months. Additionally, despite that there are over 165,000 deaths already, we have a significant portion of the population that believes Covid-19 is the sniffles and that teachers are whiners. This doesn’t feel like some type of great win for science believers."
2020-08-13 16:16,"Trump keeps claiming what a great job he is doing.  Here are some basic facts.

According to all the independent tracking services the US accounts for about 25% of total COVID cases reported to-date and just under 25% of total deaths.  Yet the US population accounts for only about 4% of the world total (331 million out of 7.8 billion).  The US continues to account for ~20% of the new cases on a daily basis according to the Johns Hopkins tracker.

OK, so maybe you could argue that some under developed countries are under counting their COVID cases and deaths and this is making the US look bad.

The EU5, i.e. the other leading industrial nations that the US is closest to in terms of population, culture, and population health sophistication accounts for 6.5% of the total COVID cases with a population similar to the US (324 million).

By what form of rational analysis can you look at these #'s and conclude that the US is doing a great job?

Trump and his followers are either really bad at basic math, or delusional, or both - I suspect both.

Trying to open schools in this environment is doomed to fail and will just prolong the time it takes to get back to some semblance of normalcy."
2020-08-13 16:27,"A few months ago, I started thinking of Trump’s tweets like George Constanza’s declaring Opposite Day on the show Seinfeld. 

If Trump tweets “REOPEN THE SCHOOLS!” : Then logic demands that they stay closed."
2020-08-13 15:54,"This is precisely what happens when you have a president that you cannot trust. His constant lying on even the slightest issue has lost my trust in him and his administration. A dual earner working family need schools to reopen, but not at the expense of their child's health and possible future. I no longer have children in school or college, but if I did I would be reluctant to send them to school because I don't trust the data coming out from Trump and there is no national plan. When my children attended grades K-12 there were over 15,000 students in the NJ town they grew up in spread across 13 elementary schools, 3 intermediate schools and 3 high schools. There's no way to social distance all these kids and a split session is not possible to bus all the children that need busing. I have since retired and no longer live in that town and I have no idea how they will have the children return to school in late August.
This  is 100% Trumps fault and is indicative of his seat of the pants governing. We need a restart in November and the Biden/Harris ticket is the one to do it."
2020-08-13 15:58,"How sad that an issue as important as proper schooling for our children has become one more battle defined by whether you are with Trump or against him.

Trump's obvious failure to provide leadership during the pandemic has been tragic.  But the desire of the media and progressive organizations like teachers unions to use the damage from the pandemic as a hammer to pound Trump has greatly contributed to the U.S.'s dysfunctional Covid planning.  

The teachers unions claim to to be focused on the care of our children.  The Covid risks for children and teachers younger than 50 are well below the risks they face from other health problems and accidents.  How can the teachers unions square their claims that a good public education is one of the bedrock goals of our society with their refusal to take even very limited risks or to develop creative solutions for our children?

Finally, Trump may be wholly self-interested and incompetent, but just because Trump says it, doesn't mean it's not true."
2020-08-13 16:20,"Trump doesn't believe in medical science, which has been quite clear about what will happen each time a region reopens when infection rates are high, i.e., the infections rates will soar.  These outcomes are no longer hypothetical because we have seen them happen repeatedly.  We can do what is necessary to get the pandemic under control in this country, and then open public schools, or we can continue staggering like a heavyweight fighter in the late rounds who no longer has a chance at winning but keeps hoping for a knockout.  In other words, we can listen to qualified scientists or we can listen to Trump."
2020-08-13 16:34,"As a retired university professor, I have felt fortunate to have not had to deal with the pandemic in a teaching situation.  However, having been a teacher, I think I do understand how most teachers feel about this.

Mr. Trump’s desire that children be back in school has nothing to do with concern for their educational welfare.  Instead he knows that many parents cannot easily go back to work unless their children go back to school.  If parents cannot easily go back to work the economy will suffer more.  If the economy worsens then Trump’s re-election chances become even more less certain. 

Teachers understand the above argument and most of the implications of going back to school, for example being infected by the virus.  Given this realization, most educators will likely conclude that they do not want to give their lives for this monster that has no empathy for what they would go through when they get sick and who brazenly uses kids, as well as teachers and parents, as pawns in his grotesque re-election scheme.  

Add to that the potential of infecting the parents, it matters little that the kids don’t seem to be affected too much by Covid-19 infection, although the verdict is still out on even that.  Thus, many parents will simply refuse to send their kids to school.  Altogether, this is why Trump’s push to reopen schools has backfired.

That is also why we must vote in record numbers in November to get rid of this dictator wanna be and his enablers."
2020-08-13 16:02,"Trump is only interested in his re-election. He dosn't care about science, the rule of law or the Constitution. He doesn't care about students and he doesn't care about teachers.

Trump is destroying America like Putin wants. Republicans are all in. 

Are U?"
2020-08-13 16:09,"All you need is two facts to analyze this and almost any other course of action urged by Trump:

1.  He lies constantly.

2.  He’s a bully.

There it is!  Your guide to decision-making with regard to Trump’s efforts to bully you or convince you of almost anything.

Try to ignore the mendacious bully.  Let facts and your own common sense be your guide.  Along with your conscience."

Donald Trump

It's true he wouldn't lose any voters.  He didn't have enough voters to win the popular vote in 2016. Does anyone really believe he's been gaining voters since then?

The ""somebody"" Donald Trump shot was his political career and professional image.  He's been committing political suicide since he began running for office and murdering the careers of anyone foolish enough to get close to him.

His original statement clearly showed he has no concept of how the real world works, everyday life, the lives of everyday people or reality in general.

The only thing more sad and sickening than Donald trump believing your children and mine will be perfectly safe in a demonstrably unsafe environment is the support he derives by his ignorant and misguided supporters.

Even so, their ignorance isn't the greatest enemy of knowledge.  It's their illusion of of knowledge."

It is no wonder the teachers unions have risen to oppose all that he and they say.  Thank you for this true news report, Eliza."
2020-08-13 16:32,"Reopening schools puts whole communities at risk. I don’t have children of school age but as a taxpayer, I don’t want to pay the price for this absolute folly driven by a megalomaniac. Whatever it is Trump thinks he’s accomplishing, he can’t bend the virus to his will.
“ If wishes were horses...”"
2020-08-13 16:43,"One of the many reasons Trump is unfit to manage the country is that everything he touches turns to chaos and divisiveness. The issue of schools is an example of his ineptitude. The reality is some schools can open, others cannot. In most of NY/New England, the prevalence of the virus is very low which makes opening schools appropriate. A quality education is the most important social determinant of health. School children are not at risk of serious illness or dying from COVID. In Massachusetts, of the 8500 COVID deaths, zero were under 20 years old. 63% were over 80 years old and 65% were nursing home residents. Of course, teachers and staff may also be exposed to the virus, but otherwise healthy people under 55 are at practically no risk of dying from it either. I mean “not at risk” the same way I would mean I am not at risk of dying as I drive to work, or my child is not at risk of getting kidnapped on his way to school i.e., it is so unlikely that it doesn’t paralyze me into fearful inaction, but I do take reasonable safety precautions for both. Public school education is an essential part of community life, and another semester or year or longer without school will have terrible socio-economic and mental health consequences for children and adults. Teachers over 60 and those with chronic illnesses should be accommodated to minimize their risk. There is no perfect, risk free solution, but school districts can't wait for some unknowable date when the virus is eradicated."
2020-08-13 16:49,"I'm in upstate NY and the percent positive COVID tests has been less than 1% for awhile now. We are good to reopen, even by WHO standards. The push for virtual around here is entirely political, not rational or based on science."
2020-08-13 16:51,"I am a retired teacher, who worked with students with learning disabilities.  I am also a computer user, but not a computer expert.   There is a lack of information in many of the pronouncements from both the federal government and state and local school systems.  The federal government does not control all  the money going to local systems.  It does provide some money to special ed programs and other efforts.  Every educational system has to design and manage its programs.  There are many creative ways that this can be done.  The Trump administration and DeVos are not interested in real eduation.  Their goals are political and interested in power.  Most young people and their families can deal with what is needed.  For example, some families have formed small neighborhood groups to enhance schooling.  Teachers are making home visits if it is safe to do so.  Etc.  The threat of Covid is real and must be respected.  Problems can be solved without hysteria."
2020-08-13 17:13,"One thing that seems to be missing from the discussion on reopening schools is the certainty that attaches to any decision. With in-school or hybrid classes there remains the distinct - perhaps almost certain - possibility that    Coronavirus cases will result in schools having to intermittently close for varying periods of time, leaving parents and teachers who organized their personal and professional lives around in-school or hybrid classes madly scrambling to improvise at a moment’s notice. While it is abundantly clear that online classes are lacking in many respects (I currently teach online at a graduate school level), at least it provides a level of certainty that none of the other two can. There is much to be said for such certainty."
2020-08-13 16:55,"NO way I would send my kids back to school, even here in the UK. The USA is 100x worse. So many parents and grandparents are compromised as well.

Like Senator Kamala Harris said,  “ Everything he touches FAILS”."
2020-08-13 16:58,"Trump and his toadies have broken our collective ability to tell truth from fiction. That is what people (me included) are reacting to.  His incessant politicization of a public health crisis makes it nearly impossible to make rational decisions people can have confidence in.

2020-08-13 17:08,"Donald Trump, the only person I can think of that embodies all 7 deadly sins, Pride, Greed, Wrath, Envy, Lust, Gluttony, and Sloth is effectively over. Kamala Harris will be his worst nightmare come true. Every word he utters and every action he takes sinks him further down in the polls. Instead of running the country and doing his job - he sits in the Oval Office thinking of names to call Ms. Harris.  Yes - everyone in this country can become President - but not everyone should be."
2020-08-13 17:03,"All of Trump's decision during this pandemic period gone haywire. From the beginning of this new year 2020, his mind only oscillates around the upcoming November elections and to stay in power for the second term. When a leader is in such a mentality, how can one expect result producing decisions. It is our mistake that all these days we expected him to take good decisions in controlling the spread of the virus. Now also his decision to reopen schools ended up in more than 1,000 students tested positive after attending classes on the first few days. Just ignore him time being. If the school managements wants to reopen, they have to take all possible and available precautions, and then with a limited number of students they have to reopen schools. But never ever think about filling the classes with more number of students and risk their lives, please."
2020-08-13 17:15,Trump's complete effort to politicize every aspect of this pandemic was once again exposed when he stated that schools would reopen on Nov 4 because the decision to close schools was politically motivated.  And his decision to open them before election day isn't?  Give me a break!
2020-08-13 16:50,"Trump has been successful in one way- this whole issue of pushing to REOPEN THE SCHOOLS has put maximum pressure on local school districts to attempt it.  Of course, no one seriously believes that school will last more than a month before being shut down again due to outbreaks.  But it's as if governors and school districts have to PROVE that it will be a failure to get Trumpists off their backs."
2020-08-13 16:59,"Teachers are used to the scenario where new demands are placed upon them, and they are told to come up with the solutions themselves, without the required resources. You cannot do this in a pandemic. Teachers know that the PPE would not be there. They know that they would be buying their own hand sanitizer, and also be on the front lines of a ""culture war"" over masks. Trump made a serious error in his attacks on ""liberal"" teachers. He created - as usual - more division, and eventually this led to organized resistance from the teacher unions. Unfortunately Trump also emboldened frustrated parents to take out their frustrations on the teachers in their communities."
2020-08-13 17:20,"Chaotic, unclear, no national plan, and the ever present ""how can I get reelected"".   It is not about students that Trump has on his mind.   Everything only has one goal.   His reelection.  Teachers, staff members, administration, families of students are secondary to his searing desperation for reelection. The ""right to life"" party turns the other way as Trump pushes children to the front during this pandemic.   No monster needed in fiction.   He is pretty much real."
2020-08-13 15:35,"Because his push to open schools was not backed up by science, data, caring or resources to the teachers in the classroom; the students and parents with underlying conditions; the administrators, state and local governments responsible for overseeing all this — it was nothing more than his usual bullying and bluster — no leadership, no plan, no sense that we are all in this together.

Only this time many, many lives and people’s well being and health are at stake — the virus is the reality and Trump doesn’t deal in reality — while the rest of us live it."
2020-08-13 17:22,"This article is an object lesson on why, even if you agree with this administrations of policies, Trump is a terrible president and leader. Even when he might actually have a point, he behaves so recklessly that it actually forces people to demand the opposite. The re-opening of schools is simply a failure of leadership. And one of hundreds, if not thousands of example why new leadership is necessary."

2020-08-13 17:17,"Too often, a simple minded fellow wants one solution to fit everyone and everything. It's so much easier and he doesn't have to think very hard about it.

The facts indicate that some areas of the US might get away with opening schools because of their current low infection rates. How long they can get away with it is the real question.

People travel, families interact over great distances for various events and the likelihood of pathogen transfer at some point is very high.

Thus, while a particular moment in time may look safe, the following week might introduce a virus brought in by student transfer, or, cousin Billy visiting from California.

You have all noticed that Trumps mind works in a very fundamental way. It fails to see nuance and possibility. It fails to grasp possibility and probability. It can only understand very, very fundamental, binary concepts and is fueled by a huge compensatory ego shielding the little fellow within. 

The Niece was right, he is the most dangerous man in America today and perhaps the World as he watches his presidency crumble. 

He will do anything to prevent the inevitable including civil war, foreign war, atomic war, he'll do anything at any cost to anyone. He's a very sick fellow. The US Military may have to enforce the election results and physically remove Trump.

Or, with Barr as AG we may see a repeat of the Christmas Eve Pardons arranged by Barr and GHW Bush for the highly illegal Iran-Contra secret war perpetrators."
2020-08-13 17:21,"This is especially unfortunate because there's a growing body of scientific evidence, that suggests that reopening schools (elementary schools at least) would be relatively safe, as well summarized by Dr. Naomi Bardach in yesterday's NY Times:

Serious people--public health officials, school administrators, union leaders, economists--need to tune out the stupid-chatter and have a serious conversation about this, without the taint of politicization.  Children, parents, and teachers all deserve it."

NOT LIKELY, even if he did correct the economy, despite his well documented life as a business fraudster, etc.!

2020-08-13 17:43,"The rational, scientific, and practical solution is right in front of us, staring us in the face:

Shut down again, this time correctly and completely everywhere in the US, for 8 weeks; fix the testing debacle; train unemployed to do contact tracing, and reopen properly when the infection rate drops to nil, with masks and distancing required for everyone

Then, with safeguards in place, we can reopen schools since teachers, parents, staff, and kids will no longer be in jeopardy.

This is, after all, what Germany, Italy, Taiwan, and other  countries have successfully done.

But, no, we will not do this, because it would require acknowledgement of the truth about the pandemic, short-term compromising some of our imagined individual rights, willingness and demand by Congress to do and fund what is necessary, and last but always impossible, real leadership from our president.

There is a point at which obstinance is no longer just stupidity but rather becomes manslaughter. We are there."
2020-08-13 17:18,"If it is too dangerous for schools to reopen due to the anticipated wide spread infections from child to child and child to adult, then, as per what is currently happening, these same children should be banned from stores, restaurants, malls, day camps, parks and anywhere else they are gathering.
If teachers are so precious that they cannot be in close contact with these children, then neither can the general public.
You can't go to school, so lets take a wander around Walmart  or Target; eat on the patio at Cheesecake factory?   Really?"
2020-08-13 17:27,"So sick of hearing whether or not public school teachers (I am one) should become front line workers.  This is a false argument.  It's really very simple:

1. Schools cannot re-open until the virus is under control.  Transmissability rates must have enough margin under 1 such that the projected increase due to opening schools keeps the rate below 1.  In most or all states, this has not been accomplished - the virus is not under control, as it was in other countries that have re-opened schools.

2. Related, schools cannot re-open until testing & tracing are robust.   This has not been accomplished, presidential* gas-lighting aside.

3. Accomplishing #1 & #2 requires a strong federal response, as this is a national crisis.  Otherwise all that will happen is another lockdown after a very short return to the classroom.

4.  trump has chosen to abdicate his responsibility to lead a strong national response.

5.  This country will be held hostage by trump & his enablers until a national plan is successfully implemented.  This includes economic recovery.  It's not possible to prioritize the economy over the virus, it will not work.

I want to get back as much as anyone.  Teachers are fully aware that students are suffering - educationally, emotionally, & socially.

Dozens of countries have done this with a far greater level of success than us.  Why is the federal government not collating and implementing all of the global best practices and lessons learned?  Pride before the fall..."
2020-08-13 17:38,"What is wrong with the administrators running our schools---really---You mean Trump was instrumental in the decision making process to reopen schools. I assume that Superintendents and Principals have advanced degrees, have passed certification tests, and have experience in managing schools and school districts. What is all this training and experience would give any credence to what Trump thinks about education in general, and running of schools in particular. Add to this, Trump's absolute ignorance of how a virus works. I cannot believe that Trump was even brought up in these district or buildings offices."

This is just more of the same, Trump looking after his own interests. He neither hears, learns from, nor cares a whit about any of these, however valuable, discussions. 
Trump knows only one strategy, and that's bullying. He cannot understand why, as for most of his life, everyone is not intimidate-able with the exception, of course, of his GOP sycophants.
Bottom line...we are ultimately in this alone, to use our best judgement and protect our families, with no expectation of any help from our current government.
With God's help, hopefully we can stay alive long enough to see Biden/Harris win."
2020-08-13 17:27,"Trump's approach to reopening the schools is not unlike his approach when he wanted businesses to reopen a few months ago - get in there, get it done, and let the chips fall where they may because in the end, ""it is what it is.""

Because there has NEVER been any kind of coordinated effort by the Coronavirus Task Force or the Trump administration in keeping schools or businesses safe, the end result has been an even higher number of COVID-19 cases in the past few months.

Between bullying businesses and schools to reopen, they continued to toot that they ""slowed the spread, flattened the curve, saved lives"" but the growing number of new cases and higher deaths tell the true story which is much different than the Trump ""truth"".

Granted, teaching and learning via the Internet is not the best plan but for now, it's the safest plan for teachers and students to follow.  They also had a solid 3 months to ""acclimate"" to this ""new temporary normal.""

I worry about the kids who are homeless and have special needs.  In Chicago, during the week of May 11, ""nearly 40% of homeless students failed to get onto a platform once. This comes despite the fact that the school district gave them each new laptops and hotspot devices."" 

I worry these kids will fall through the educational cracks."
2020-08-13 17:36,"It's sad that the Resist Trumpers have successfully sandbagged the future of our children.  The science is clear that younger children are not particularly contagious but adults and older teenagers are.  Teachers unions are shamefully playing into the fears of young children's parents.  There are many ways that the teachers can be protected -- with a particular focus on the other teachers.  Clearly high school is a different situation and requires more demanding protocols . Some schools many not be able to successfully come up with a good protective program for older kids. 
 But most importantly, there is no good excuse to keep young children out of the classroom. The science is clear and the unions are being hypocritical in their opposition. Truly, it's clear they do not have the children's interest at heart."

When it comes to children, there is nothing more important to parents. If parents are concerned, about sending children back to school, there is a reason. The decision to send children back to school, should be left for parents, educators, local medical professionals to decide. The picture is clearer at that level.

We cannot hold a country together when we lack basic shared facts. Science is true whether or not you believe it!

Tell me, why is it that the same people who believe wild tales about sex slave colonies on the moon and pedophiles operating in the basement of pizza parlors, refuse to believe that masks work?  

This is why I stopped teaching K-12 a few years ago. I would be totally losing my mind if I had to deal with the ignorant parents and ignorant school boards who have turned basic science into a political issue. I’m so sorry for all the kids who want to go to school but can’t do so safely, those who wore masks and social distanced all summer in the hopes of returning to school. It is not fair to you that your futures have been jeopardized by nutty anti-science people. And I’m sorry for teachers/staff who work in these school systems that cannot keep you safe.

Now that parents have become increasingly alarmed at the skyrocketing rates of infection among children returning to classrooms when at the same time Trump continues to push for more schools to open, caretakers have begun turning their backs on him and his  dangerous policies, yet another strategy that has backfired on this ego-driven president."

Their failure will likely culminate in their future irrelevance as others (non credentialed educators)  innovate and create solutions for educating safely, and as importantly, effectively.The pandemic is an opportunity to break old rules and find new solutions.

I also understand the need for students to be in school, but it would seem there is an unnecessary rush to put them there. Trump wants the US to ACT as if there is nothing wrong. Advocates of reopening school would tell you children are at low risk of developing Covid-19. They would give you a statistical breakdown of cases and recoveries. Ohio State's past and great football coach Woody Hayes said ""Statistics are for the man who drowned in 2 feet of water."" In Covid-19 terms that means: ""How would you feel if it was your child or grandchild was in a sickbed with a disease that could permanently disable them or even kill them?"" What would numbers mean to you then? Trump won't establish a national policy as simple as mask wearing to help save American lives, but he will push our children into harm's way just so things APPEAR normal. Lives mean nothing to Trump. He's pushing for college athletes to play football. His rational is they are young and strong. If they get sick they'll recover. Real leaders care about others. Real leaders respect and protect the life of others. Trump, by his actions, has proven that he isn't a leader, and so it is up to us to make sure that the lives of our youth,our most valuable resource, are protected as best as humanly possible."

In my district just outside DC parents voted overwhelmingly to either send children back full time or create a hybrid. It didn't matter because parents were shouted down by the teachers union.
I can tell you that both Democrats and Republicans were furious and we are no fans of the teacher's union."
2020-08-13 20:02,"No, it was not dislike of Trump that increased opposition.
It was fact-based analysis by sentient beings that stopped the disaster of premature opening.

The assumptions for safe reopening included HEPA filters and controlled heating and cooling systems. Schools do not clean their filters or change them, and normally do not have HEPA capability. Net: the virus can spread from class to class in most schools, and will certainly be spread widely inside any class.

Safe reopening required physical distancing and masks--but the classroom changes needed for physical distancing were not done -- and most school districts are already working with less funding than last year so they could not afford to do them. 

Early opening schools often closed within days--providing a sobering reality check.  

Opening schools without controlling the pandemic was as certain to fail as opening bars while an uncontrolled pandemic rages. 

The president's official statements have included a minimum of 20,000 falsehoods of easily checked facts. Believing anything from this administration and acting on it is effectively malpractice without independent proof. 

Finding a way to open schools safely based on factual evidence and information allows only distance learning until the pandemic is controlled. 

Trump could have enabled opening schools if he had done what, say, Canada did to control their outbreaks--or many other countries.  He chose not to."
2020-08-13 20:19,"The American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines strongly recommend that students be physically present in school as much as possible, because there are major health, social and educational risks to keeping children at home.

2020-08-13 20:22,"In the schools are children. Also, adults--teachers, administrators, paraprofessionals, cleaning crews, volunteers, and parents. And many of the people in the schools are at risk because of their own health conditions. Schools in low-income areas have higher numbers of people with asthma, a known risk factor. Keeping physical buildings closed and addressing the problems with online teaching, particularly for the most vulnerable students, only makes sense. And when schools are able to reopen, masks MUST be required!"
2020-08-13 20:34,"The theme running through many of these comments is that we cannot resume foundational aspects of society (schools, in person work) until everyone can be safe. The extension of that logic is that it is ""too soon"" to resume these core societal activities, and any lives lost due to covid infections is unacceptable and a violation of the social contract. This view is commendable, but it's not how we live. For decades, we have made choices that cost lives in many areas of public policy, from highway speed limits, to the frequency of/ age thresholds for medical screening tests. Polio and meningitis killed or paralyzed countless thousands of mostly young people. We never closed schools to limit these deaths. For other communicable diseases, we have to admit that societal lockdowns every year from October to April would save many thousands of people from dying of the flu (61,000 died from the flu in the US in 2018). But we don’t do that. We have as a society tacitly acknowledged that there will be some loss of life from infectious disease while society functions. No, covid is clearly not the same as the flu. But claiming we can’t risk any lives isn’t the honest starting point either. The truth is covid is not “an equal opportunity killer” as cable news pundits  have claimed. This type of claim by influential media outlets shapes opinion prevents a risk stratified response which protects the vulnerable but allows schools to open in areas where the prevalence of the virus is low."
2020-08-13 20:51,"I am an educator, I have been for over 20 years, working with students from highly marginalized backgrounds and who have dropped out of school. We build up their skill sets, transition to college tuition free using the same funding sources as K-12, and follow them to their graduation with support or they say, ""get lost"". Very successful. 

We have seen a disproportionate rise in those effected by Covid that mirrors the country's, but also economically, we see poorer white families/students also suffering in higher rates. We have seen real deal hunger, no food at all hunger, and we deliver food to families regardless of who they are but centrally focused on our students and their families that are now having multiple families together in apartments to stave off homelessness. 

I think we could have opened, and we were prepared to do so(no more than 5 in a room, 6 feet apart, including hallways, all rooms have a door so air is not going between rooms, mandatory masks, and ventilation, access to free masks, hand cleaners, wipes, etc. with regular wipe downs etc, usually multiple times per hour, fever check-ins and outs) with very intense, what I call ""ICU"" protocols that are usually in ICU units like masks, etc.  My staff, and teachers, requested this and wanted to do it when our students asked, vociferously, for it. We had sneeze guards for the front desk, rotating telecommuting most of the week for non-direct service, and a max capacity per site. Trump flubbed it again."

He should have left Obama’s pandemic plan in place and he should have left Obama’s scientists in place in China. We could have conquered this right away like the Ebola, the bird flu, and the first SARS virus.

He should have left safe school and business guidelines to the CDC AND led the federal government in a national federally funded and organized strategy of testing, tracing, isolation, and PPE.

He could have forced the Republican Senate to pass the House bills to fund the lockdown and FUND THE SCHOOLS.

If he wants schools to open why couldn’t he have worked to get virus numbers down, asked people to stay away from bars and wear face masks, and given the schools the tools and money they needed to open?

Everything he does is like he wants America to suffer."

2020-08-13 20:44,"Many Alabama schools opened on Monday. We haven't heard Georgia-level stories about them for one simple reason: the governor of Alabama did not politicize masks. All schools have to wear masks. Alabama even ordered 2.5 million masks to distribute to students and teachers who are unable to buy/make their own.

On social media, you see a common theme in these schools: everyone is wearing masks. Teachers, students, bus drivers. Everyone. I have seen several cute bulletin boards that promote mask wearing, with slogans such as “Wearing is Caring.”

I’ve also seen parents posting photos of their kids in masks that match their first day of school outfits. They are making masks “cool.” 

The schools that are doing it right have spent many hours planning for socially distanced instruction. Of course it’s not going to be perfect, but Alabama is not having Georgia-level issues because Alabama has a governor who decided not to play politics with masks.

Why did things go so terribly wrong over there in Georgia? Because Brian Kemp needed to create a wedge issue in his now- purple state to fire up the Trumpians.

Alabama won’t turn blue in 2020, so the governor didn’t have to turn masks into a wedge issue. Brian Kemp didn’t have to either, but he chose to because that’s who he is. All for the sake of keeping Georgia red. It’s despicable. I just wanted everyone to know that while Georgia is burning, over here in Alabama, school reopening is going much more smoothly. Leadership matters."

Demanding that schools reopen and threatening to withhold funds as cases surged is not going to get parents or teachers on his side.

Trump has finally met his match. Covid-19 can’t be bullied into submission. The pandemic has exposed just how profoundly incompetent Trump is, as well as how completely uncaring and totally lacking in empathy he is. He attempted to deal with the virus the way he deals with people, by lying constantly and trying to create a reality to his liking. That’s all he knows how to do, and as we’ve seen, his approach is unsuited to dealing with a crisis like this. 

The less people listen to him, the better. He just cannot contribute anything meaningful to this issue."

This will just plain, flat out not even remotely allow for 'social distancing' inside of enclosed school rooms with limited air circulation / ventilation.  In other words, the worst possible environment for the spread of an air-born disease.  Kids sitting very close to each other, the same kids, for many hours every day, day after day for months.

Don't take the initiative to launch an effective federal-level COVID-19 strategy.  Underestimate the impact of the disease.  Suggest we're in a good position.  Dispute the medical experts.  Deepen divisions and mistrust of government on COVID-19 policy.

The teachers would have to do some walking around, to make sure everyone understood the online assignments.  And they hadn’t left or were getting high.  But they’d be out of the house.  There’d be social distancing.  And the kids might learn something.  Nobody needs to be at home or in the official school building."
2020-08-13 21:27,"""Distrust of the president and his motives hardened the conviction of some educators that teaching in person was unsafe, helping drive union opposition.""

Of course it drove opposition.  Not just from educators and their unions, but from anyone who dislikes Trump.

You see, the majority of anti-Trumpers hate the very air that Trump breathes.  If Trump says White, they say Black.  If Trump says Up, they reply 'Down'.

And this is the problem with many on the Far Left.  Instead of thinking through things, weighing all possibilities and angles, most of them come to kneejerk responses and 'decisions' based in political affiliation.  I'd say we all know many anti-Trumpers who would never admit that Trump may have done or is currently doing anything half-way right.  The only time you hear from these folks is about what Trump has done wrong.   They live to hate on him.

Look, I'm not saying I have the perfect answer to what we should or should not do regarding back-to-school.  But I'm tired of the omnipresent black/white thinking that pervades the US populace, and the fact that no middle ground is ever attempted to be reached.  It's either Yes or No, you are With Us or Against Us.

I also tire of the mention of 'health' being framed so one dimensionally, as equaling 'avoidance of COVID'.  There is far more to a human being's overall level of health than just 'does or does not this person have COVID?'  Being alive is about more than merely having a pulse."

2020-08-13 21:13,"Good article. I agree that Trump's belligerence likely hardened the union's resolve.  The union may have calculated that most people at this point view the opposite of whatever Trump says (almost without regard to what he says) as the more desirable path.  That said, as this article quietly suggests, the union's position is likely to harm the poor, minorities, and the disabled the most.    

Although I agree that Trump's handling of schools reopening, and his leadership in general throughout the crisis, has been disgraceful, I also think that the union leadership's approach to school reopening, at least in NYC, has been disgraceful.  At the well-funded, highly sought after magnet school my kid attends, the union said that it would not be safe to return to school unless, among other things, NYC had 0 confirmed coronavirus cases for 14 days in a row. They apparently backed off that facially preposterous demand but still managed to get the school to agree to allow them to teach just 4 days a week, including online. Why COVID should mean teachers can't teach ONLINE 5 days a week is anyone's guess.  It's not the end of the world for  me or my kid if school is 4 days a week. Nevertheless, going forward, I am permanently disposed to view teacher unions as an educational blight. When the going gets tough the unions cravenly bow to the narrow self interests of the most vocal, selfish teachers. No thank you"
2020-08-13 21:34,"Trump has nothing to do with it.   The stance hardened when the schools that opened early got additional cases and quarantines.   Remote learning is the smart thing to do if you understand science and statistics.

Unfortunately the GOP no longer does."
2020-08-13 21:36,"If comments made here or on TV news reflect public mood on this issue, teachers’ unions will face a hard slog getting a bye on account of personal hazard which transit workers and cops do not. Adequate arguments from safety instead center on children, who lack choice in a matter they’ve more stake in than anyone else given their remaining life expectancy, should infections lead to unanticipated long-term health effects, and the fact that schools are a likely focal point for community spread even if kids acquire and transmit the virus at half the rates of adults.

Danes themselves are worrying about keeping their schools open while Denmark’s case count surges, and this with 10 to 15 cases a day in a population of 5.7 million in early July gone up to 150 now. American numbers are so insane I can’t believe we’re even talking about school outside Connecticut and Vermont. The prospect of mass education in an epidemic is inherently unsafe no matter the feelings. Our kids need teachers and play time with peers, but families cannot enjoy those benefits if they are in and out of quarantine all year as Georgians look to be."
2020-08-13 21:39,"This analysis is exactly correct:  Every Thing Trump Touches Dies.

A reasoned approach to school reopenings would have been to appoint a national commission to work out the numerous logistical details involved:  social distancing, multiple even/odd days attendance, requirements for reopening at all, how to manage flare-ups, how to protect teachers.

Alas, because Trumps insists on being the single dominant player in all decision-making (remember his saying: ""you have to dominate"") he is psychologically impaired from empowering groups of experts to solve real national issues because he views such groups as threats to his own power. 

Because of this fundamental limitation on his ability to empower those around him, Trump will never be able to solve any both the simplest problems."
2020-08-13 21:59,"This is disingenuous at best.  Isn't it as likely if not more that teachers have been less and less willing to return to in-person instruction as more and more evidence has piled up that it's not safe?

There was a very real sense in early June that we might actually address this problem.  There weren't so many people who had tired of COVID and decided that because they were bored, it was over.  Congress had recently passed a flawed bill that at least partially addressed the crisis, and the House had passed one that would have given schools additional resources to return safely.  In June, teachers couldn't have known that Senate Republicans would sit on that bill for another two months and still refuse to pass it.

I don't think Trump had terribly much to do with this.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day, and if the situation supported a return to school, unions and teachers would be for it even if that put them on the same side of the issue as Trump.  They're concerned about safety not because of Trump's blatherings, but because returning under these conditions is not safe.

And I've got significant reservations about any article that quotes Hess and Petrilli, two ""education experts"" who've made a career out of saying things about education that are dead wrong but politically useful."
2020-08-13 22:14,"As a parent, I can attest to this. I absolutely reconsidered in person learning (in NYC) when hs started really pushing it. I've never trusted anyone's motives less than his; I've never assumed ill intent to the degree that I do now. The harder he pushes for something, the more we can be assured that it's a bad idea. We know he doesn't trust scientists and we know he doesn't care about our children. It's not complicated."
2020-08-13 22:39,"This article and many of the comments treat the school reopening issue as a nationwide, one size fits all proposition. The reality is school decisions are local, and the conditions in Georgia or Florida or Texas are radically different from the conditions in NY and  New England. In the NE region, most areas now have declining or flat cases, low levels of hospitalization and low levels of fatality. We were very hard hit by the virus in April/May, but the prevalence of the virus is now very low. Covid positive rates are currently below 4% in almost all areas of NY/NE and below 2% throughout NY State. Despite this, and despite three months of school district  planning for in person or hybrid learning, teachers unions are now pushing for online education, and making demands that cannot possibly be met (e.g. closure of an entire school building for 14 days if even one student tests positive). A quality education is the most important social determinant of health. Teachers over 60 and those with chronic illnesses should be accommodated, but in much of NY and New England, the societal cost of not reopening schools outweighs the risk."
2020-08-13 21:15,"First, and year to date, American deaths from COVID19 and the lack of any meaningful policy and a continuous stream of non-sequiturs, misinformation, abject lies, and refusal to possess any sense of urgency to protect the American public, Donald Trump now wants to subject American children and school teachers to an equally deadly and risk-laden scenario to open up the schools. On the one hand, this is another example of Trump and his advisors - Betsy DeVos in particular - behaving in a reckless and dangerous way, totally ignoring the facts and reality of a situation they created.

As COVID19 was roiling through the nation from March to May, and then kicking up in full secondary fury because of the rush to reopen the country, all 165,000 deaths were created by Trump's negligence. Death arising from negligence is a form of homicide and guilty parties are punished in criminal proceedings. Moreover, the death of 165,000 Americans in a space of 6 months should be considered as it truly was: a mass murder from gross negligence and incompetence.

And now, America, Donald Trump wants to come after your children and school teachers. Our nation has an empathy lacking and dangerous killer on the loose."
2020-08-13 21:20,"Why did it fail?   Because TRUMP is too stupid to comprehend the difference between asymptomatic (or mildly symptomatic) and immune.   Children frequently are display few or no symptoms but that doesn't mean they are immune.   Trump insisted schools reopen because he believed, and continues to believe, that asymptomatic means immunity.   

Trump has failed every decision point in the federal government's response to COVID-19.   His decisions are based on magical thinking.   He magically thought the virus was going to disappear, me magically believes that infected but asymptomatic people are immune."

With zero medical education he insisted he was the expert in dealing with Coronavirus and went psycho claiming that infectious disease experts and most doctors were lying. “Everyone is lying. The CDC, Media, Democrats, our Doctors"" he said in July when he really should have been locked up. 
Well, the proof is in the pudding.
US deaths per 100,000 stands at 50 in Dr. Trump's hands. 
Japan following the science has 1 death per 100,000, a factor of 50x better than the USA. 
Japan is not a more scientifically advanced nation nor did they discover magic.

2020-08-13 22:24,President Trump should lead by example. He should enroll his son at a public school in Washington and sit in the classroom with him for the first week of classes. Then the rest of us would feel more secure about the prospect of having our children attending school.
2020-08-13 22:27,"As someone who works in public education, let me put it to you this way:

If you live anywhere near a heavily-populated area, you can check your feelings and politics at the door.  They don't matter.  Practically and logistically speaking, schools will not be able to open and stay open through this.  Our institution is poorly-funded, and even more poorly-administrated, on our best day.  Now you're throwing in the logistical hassles of class-and-hallway social distancing, the staffing hassles of what happens when teachers and other staff get even a standard fever and have to wait for a COVID test, contact tracing, sanitation concerns, HVAC concerns, mask policing, temperature checks, technological and logistical problems with distance learning, and another gigantic dose of financial problems.  

It ain't gonna happen.  

We're like a Jenga tower this country has been poking holes in for the last 50 years, and now you want to throw a cake on top and celebrate a return to normalcy.  Don't be surprised when it doesn't work."
2020-08-13 22:54,"To alleviate teachers, adminstrators et al's concern and fear about if and when they will catch the virus from the kids and/or the kids will pass it on to one another, is there any good reason why a testing program could not have been organised in the 6 months that schools have been closed?
While ad hoc testing centres have sprung up all over our State, no-one thought about prioritising a testing program for the school community, to be undertaken just prior to schools opening?
Doing so would have found those who have the disease (albeit presumably asymptomatic otherwise would they not have already been identified), and mandated they be quarantined;  thus enabling the healthy ones to return to school.
It is not surprising that there are outbreaks in some schools.  Evidence has shown that some kids will have the virus, have no symptoms but could potentially infect others.
Testing and quarantining those who have the virus is the only way to contain the disease.
Without testing we are just bumbling along blindly - and schools will stay closed indefinitely, since there is no guaranteed safe time to open."

No humane system would ever operate like this."
2020-08-13 22:56,"Another demonstration that Trump is his own worst nasty enemy.  As terrible a president as he is, I find some meager comfort in the constant demonstrations of the sheer incompetence of Trump and his crew.  Someone in that circus decided that the way to get the economy booming again in time for the election was to open schools so that parents would be free to go back to work, and that the way to get educators and parents to send kids to school was for Trump to bellow in caps and exclamation points ""SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!""  The virus, however, is indifferent to Trump's bloviating and all he has accomplished is to make it easier for educators and parents to accept the previously difficult decision to keep kids home.

Why act with certainty about opening schools when the answer was still out?

Our children are the victims of these partisan, union ""heroes"".    No justice, no peace?  How about no work, no check.    Maybe that will get them doing more than lip service for the children."
2020-08-14 4:16,"""For your country right now and for the war that we're in against Covid, I'm asking you to do four simple things: wear a mask, social distance, wash your hands and be smart about crowds,"" Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC

A 10-ton elephant is sitting on the body politic. We can't breathe.

NO schools can meet any much less all four of these basic necessities. Every school that has opened has immediately had students test +, often within days.

The myth of safely reopening is just that: a myth. And yet Redfield, Birx, and Fauci always stop short of calling for online learning. Fauci's favorite metric is ""No one should gather in a group larger than 10."" He has said it every day this summer. ALL schools are groups larger than 10! This glaring inconsistency has muddied the waters in deadly ways. 

This country is being driven stark staring mad by glaring inconsistencies, lies, misinformation, failure to take bold stances, and an inability to think logically. In a pandemic, those failures kill. The CDC is nearly as guilty on these grounds as DJT.

The single most potent step we can take is to close schools in red zones to in-person learning until we get our numbers under control. It's criminal that the CDC has not used its podium to broadcast this message. Their ignorance about schools and how they work and what they really look like has led to a deadly delay, one that is going to cost hundreds of thousands of lives. It's equal parts baffling and inexcusable."
2020-08-14 10:28,"The most illustrative aspect of the entire Covid pandemic to me  has been observing media and Democrats actually root for drugs not to work, for closures of businesses, for furthering economic pandemonium, for anything but encouraging all to make the best of a bad situation.  In a way, anything but a American can-do spirit.

Moreover, what the political battles have illustrated is that these same media people and Democrats want to express their many opinions without the inconvenience of research and thought."
2020-08-14 3:37,"DJT's position is far worse than ""bullying."" It's called extortion. He openly declared the intent to ""punish"" schools that don't open (even if they're in hot spots) by withholding funding. He has also refused to address the reality that any attempt to keep students safe (a myth no matter how well done) requires an investment of billions of dollars (trillions, if done right) and years of mindful planning. 

I am tired of saying this. There is NO safe way to reopen to in-person learning. This is a *virus.* It does not respect borders, parties, race, religion, age, nationality, zip code, or gender. It seeks hosts. Period. Schools provide many.

We've seen a 41-year-old professional dancer die after multiple heart attacks, strokes, and losing his limbs. A sixteen-year-old boy near me made it through a day of school and was on a ventilator six hours later. He's fighting for his life and is not expected to win that battle. Professional football players in better shape than 99.9% of the American populace are developing potentially fatal heart complications. 800 students tested positive within days of going back. A local football team at a private school managed three days before they had ten players out. So much for the myth of private schools opening safely.

Millions of students, teachers, and *their communities* are being put at risk so a pathetic bully can pretend to be powerful. Depraved.

Historians will treat this with the same contempt reserved for the Children's Crusade."
2020-08-14 11:23,"The NYTimes, by making school reopening a story about 
""Unions vs. Trump"" is missing the point. Reopening is about one thing and one thing only: the health and well-being of communities across the country. 

I worked for 29 years as a School Superintendent in New England, Maryland, and New York. In that capacity I had to decide whether or not to open schools when it was snowing or snow was forecast. Whenever it was a close call I would ask this question: ""Why put thousands of children and hundreds of employees at risk in order to avoid an additional day in June?""  

With so much uncertainty about the long-term effects of this disease or about it's contagion among school-aged children this doesn't seem like a close call... nor does it have anything to do with politics any more than deciding on a snow day has to do with politics. 

And here's the bottom line: If the POTUS had insisted in late March that we all stay home for 6 weeks and wear masks and maintain social distancing for an extended period thereafter we might not be having ANY debate about reopening..."
2020-08-14 11:05,"If Trump really cared about the children, he would have focused on the virus being controlled & Scienctic Experts would have led the Federal & state actions.
Trump's failure (& that of many Gov.) is to blame & that is plain as day.
Do not risk our kids lives for political reasons!!
""We do not Know, what we do not Know!"""
2020-08-14 12:35,Trump has been so insistent that schools reopen in the form that they had been in before Covid19.  He hinted that he might withhold federal moneys if they didn't.  But the school in which Barron will begin high school this September decided to continue having their students work online.  Why hasn't Trump moved his son to a school which will return to the form he approves of?  Why is in his opinion best for other kids not good enough for his own?  Why does he want to jeopardize other children but not his own?  He is tested for Covid19 every day and all those who have access to him must also test negative.  Why is he so much against testing for others?
2020-08-14 12:56,"From what I can determine Trump's only saving grace is that he is almost universally wrong about everything. 

If he says schools should open then they obviously should not. If he says COVID-19 will fade away, then it will be with us forever. If he cries that climate change is a hoax, that is the surest proof that it is an existential threat. And so it goes, on and on and on, ad nauseum.

Very few people are always right but I have never seen anyone who is as unfailingly wrong as Trump."

But there is one thing that is certain: he can not play his game of Risk when it comes to our kids.  I would wager that not only our teachers, every day heroes even before the Era of Covid 19, but also even the most loyal of Trump-supporting parents will rise up against this man when it relates to the health and welfare of our children, our future.  It is shameful that we did not defend those innocent immigrant children who were separated from their parents and placed in over-sized cages.  Perhaps, Trump's and our day of reckoning has arrived by giving the chance once again to protect our gifts, our treasures, our children."
2020-08-14 13:36,"Educators have been expected to take a bullet for their students for quite some time now. At least in America, that is. Now they are expected to sacrifice not only themselves, but their loved ones. At least in America. There are many willing enablers of this diabolical political party - Republican - that values neither students nor teachers, nor any of their families."
2020-08-14 13:29,"The print version of this story is accompanied by a confusing photo. A person is shown disinfecting the doors of lockers. Why would students be allowed to use lockers? And why would anyone think that it's the door, not the clustering of other students, that's the problem?"
2020-08-14 13:50,"The current crisis in education is merely an extension of the crisis in school shootings. A large section of our society has demanded the freedom to endanger the lives of others for any reason whatsoever - to not wear a mask or to carry a gun under any circumstance. Until we stand up to these abusers, nothing will change. November is coming."
2020-08-14 14:14,"“President’s Trump’s goal of seeing schools open was never about politics, it was about the health, growth and learning of our nation’s children, and it has not backfired,”  - But not, apparently, about the health of the teachers? 
Parents should be left out of the discussion about re-opening schools. What they want is immaterial. What is relevant is whether the schools can be re-opened without exposing those involved to danger.  What the parents want has no bearing on that. And who are we talking about ? Both the students and the teachers. As usual the needs of the teachers are being ignored. Many teachers are older men and women who are both more likely to contract the disease and more likely to die of it. Does anyone care ? Or is the risk of teachers dying from Covid 19 the price parents are only too happy to pay just to get their kids out of the house ?
What we need is a qualified independent authority to inspect schools and pronounce whether they are physically in a fit state to be opened and whether the necessary protocols to guarantee, yes, guarantee teacher safety are in place. Schools should be re-inspected from time to time and if they are not satisfactory, they should be closed until they are. Covid 19 should not be used as another excuse to continue the shameless demonizing of the teaching profession that we have become so used to in recent years."
2020-08-14 14:54,"I'm nobody. I'm not an epidemiologist, or a doctor. I read the news carefully and listen to NPR every morning and PBS every evening. That is all. But even I could see this coming from a mile away. I dropped my grand daughter off at her middle school on March 13th and realized that whatever the government experts decided, this was going to be her last day of school for at least a year, maybe two years. Our family was going into lock down. It turned out that was everyone's last day of school. I don't understand why this is so hard. It's a pandemic. It's global. It's deadly. Everything Dr Fauci has so patiently explained is common sense and as plain as the noses on our faces. Stay home. Wear a mask. Wash hands. And elect a government that will fund science, health care and compassionate family leave to keep the economy going. Now we have 200,000 dead Americans, the homeless population is exploding, and we're debating whether to wear a mask or provide adequate economic support for impacted families. This is crazy."
2020-08-13 15:47,"This exactly happened in my school.   The school has a lot of outdoor space, and is deconstructed into many buildings.  It's actually a ""perfect"" place to teach in a pandemic, if such a thing exists.  The principal was determined to open in a cautious, hybrid manner, and large numbers of parents and teachers were supportive with only a relatively few hold outs... and then Trump tweeted.  Opposition immediately snowballed, and now... we are going back online."

That afternoon, I fell head over heels for newspapering. The great excitement of the environment, the awe of the profound craft needed to turn bits of information into succinct, readable news, and the promise of being “in” the world of the public discourse have remained with me since that day.
I long ago moved on from, “New York’s Picture Newspaper,” but what I learned there made the meager pay more than worth it.

I believe many industries, not just journalism will experience a ""reevaluation of its real estate needs."" Many companies have successfully marched on with its employees working remotely.

Other newspaper chains like Gannett and Gatehouse Media have been doing this for several years now. They bought old, established, mostly family owned newspapers for huge amounts of money and then tried to squeeze every penny out selling off the real estate and slashing employees, cutting salaries, reducing circulation, hiking up ad and subscription costs, etc. 

It is not a successful business model and simply hastens the downward spiral of print media in the U.S. 

In New York City in the 1950s Gotham boasted a dozen daily major newspapers and several small neighborhood ones. Now the city is down to three: the leader being the New York Times, next the Post, and bringing up the rear the Daily News. There are still a few neighborhood and specialty daily papers scattered across New York City but no large, mainstream journals. 

I hear the death rattle of the Daily News which has supposedly lost money and been subsidized by wealthy owners since the 1990s. 

The Post is owned by multi-billionaire Rupert Murdoch and is housed in the same building as Fox News and the Wall St. Journal which undoubtedly heavily subsidize the New York Post----which claims to be the oldest daily newspaper still published in the United States.

As a college senior I remember the ""Ford to New York: Drop Dead"" headline when NYC almost went bankrupt in 1976.
 
Then there was 1977: ""Son of Sam"" shooting and taunting columnist Jimmy Breslin and the cops. And there was the power blackout. ""God Gets a Bum Rap"" roared the NYDN when Con Edison blamed the outage on ""Acts of God."" 

A week into my studies as a Columbia J-school student, the NYDN presented the grisly front page of mob boss Carmine Galante, gunned down in the back of a restaurant, sprawled on the ground, pasta sauce and blood blending on his portly stomach. The rival NY Post stole the show that day with its ""GREED"" headline. 

Timesman Earl Caldwell was my childhood hero, but I really remember him as a NYDN columnist. He brought compelling small-town storytelling to the metropolis. It was an honor to be Caldwell's colleague this century at Hampton University. 

The Daily News was New York's essential local paper. When I visited my hometown this century there were moments when I laughed convulsively while reading the paper on the subway.

And there is reporting that is not reporting at all. It sickens me to see headlines like ""(Celebrity Name) stuns in a bikini"" in a newspaper. It's pathetic. These celebs' personal assistants send those photos and the editors play along - and kill their credibility with every syllable in that headline and the ""story"" that follows. The rise of celebrity reporting truly signaled the end of newspapers. The Times seems to be succumbing to it, too. Every day carries a new pathetic story about a useless Texas-sized ego. Enough. I mean, seriously, who cares if a newspaper running headlines like that dies? I say good riddance. I don't care if you do have occasional flashes of brilliance. These papers are committing suicide. I told an editor as much in the 90s when I told him the newspaper had better develop a digital edition. The real culprits are the publishers and editors who are ridiculous megalomaniacs and narcissists. Anyone with two ounces of sense could see what was brewing as the internet wave came in the 90s.

But on the other hand, can there really be a cohesive voice and vision for a disparate group of people, writing for one entity, in the absence of the collegiality that an office promotes? (Personally, I have doubts.)

A couple years later, it was old news. Remote work became more of an ocasional thing than the norm. Ultimately employers decided that there was more value in having people at the office, especially those who worked in largely collaborative projects.

Only Tribune is really sure of what will happen to the Daily News, which covers for the most part I've enjoyed seeing.

As a kid I once delivered the Cleveland Press. Papers were dropped on the street corner at 3:30 in the afternoon and I finished my route around 4:30, depending on weather.

Periodically I went door knocking to drum up new subscriptions and the newsboy who got the most new subs could win prizes.

This was a common practice in midwest cities and towns where people didn't pass by news stands on every other corner as they do in New York. They counted on their paper being on their porch everyday.

I know that revenues from subscriptions didn't cover all costs. Eventually papers like the Village Voice discovered that they got more eyeballs on a page by simply giving the paper away and focusing exclusively on ads.

But in this digital age producing an on line ""paper"" has to be much less expensive than a print version. But then I don't really know the economics of the news business.

 Now is not the time to downsize and abandon NYC. Shrink your offices but don't leave them. The Chicago owners should rethink this.

The city I knew was essentially blue collar with many thousands of family supporting industrial jobs.  My musician father had steady employment playing in pit orchestras on Broadway.  Now ""progressive"" politicians drive jobs out (Amazon, Industry City) with no alternative to find the ""good jobs"" they say they want for their constituents.

And alcohol even in small amounts lowers judgement.

For air flow review The NYT subway train air flow demonstration.  May I suggest the designers add simulated passengers describing how they add or change the setting.  Extrapolations can be imagined for restaurants/bars.

Then atop this majestic USA planetary and space dominance a microscopic illegal immigrant virus cross-borders manifold layers of national security, outwitting most advanced science, medicine, armaments, intelligence, economics, the plethora of assurances and confidence that no threat is unconquerable.

Surprise, great-hearts and best minds, the USA is now feared globally for its threat to cause mass death by spreading Covid virii, even its military and spies are spreaders abroad and at home in magnitude and lethality far greater than terrorism, political ideology, election tampering, opioids, ignorance, fake news.

Covid sneers at the nuclear-triad as it gnaws the crews' and commanders' guts and brains, physically and psychologically, futile masks worn as faith-based amulets, reopenings enforced as sacrificial offerings to the slavemasters of ""I don't care, do you?""

Yes there are some Heroes Act line items that should be tabled for after the pandemic of Trump is over. But aid to states and cities is not one of them. Naked aggression, attempting to destroy Democratic managed states and cities for political ad material is disgusting, but expected from Republicans. I wonder how they will scheme to backdoor fiscal support to Republican managed states and cities. You know they are.
Infrastructure program creation to provide new sources of employment for the millions suffering is not pork. Since there are fewer available jobs than people searching for employment new sources of employment are critical. So let’s fix American infrastructure while we are at it.

The longer this pandemic continues to handcuff our necessary human commerce the more urgent innovative adaptations to the new normals become. We are at a tipping point. The virus, given the US response from the top down, is not going away. It has not even finished slapping us with the First Wave.

Which isn't even news. A study published several months ago proved that viable SARS-Cov-2 virions remain in aerosol suspension for 3 hours or more (the experiment was terminated at 180 minutes).

This should settle the issue of masks.

Nothing less than an N-95 - respirator - fitted tightly, and leak-free, can stop inhalation of airborne aerosols.

All the regular masks allow the virus to enter around the sides.

And all the regular masks allow exhalation of a certain amount of virus around the sides as well.

And now Fauci proposes that goggles and face shields are a pretty good idea because the virus can colonize through  the surface of the eye and the lacrimal system.

In the end, all the lockdowns will probably not have prevented a single death (in terms of absolute numbers), they will simply have delayed them and shifted them to a different location. Btw the Swedish statistics bear that out. And all the arguing over masks - may - have saved some transmission. It certainly makes sense that they would.

But a statistically significant number ?

Doubtful, in my mind."

It is just another reason to vote him and the Republicans out of office. It is unfortunate that after the November election Trump would still remain in office for 2 and 1/2 months. In a crisis like this pandemic, the transfer of power and political responsibility should occur the next day!"

The longer this goes on I wonder more and more, what if this was just called a bad flu?  And we took care of vulnerable citizens either in nursing homes or with certain medical conditions, could we have gotten through this without such economic destruction and hysteria?

And it seems as though each state has its own methods of recording COVID deaths.  If one dies of cancer AND had COVID, it gets listed as a COVID death while the neighboring state chooses a different method.  

I only listen to my local doctors/hospitals where I go for all of my health needs.  And they are all wearing masks and keeping distances.  They were all quite happy back in March when they saw that I had spent the entire winter radically changing my diet and weightlifting.

That’s getting close to 1/2 of all American killed (407,000) during WWII. When people break in and enter a property illegally, assault someone or rob a liquor store, if they are caught, they are arrested and prosecuted.  Criminal behavior is not to be tolerated in a free and law abiding country.  A country without appropriate laws risks robbing its citizens of their very lives.  When I see people openly defying Dr Fauci’s guidelines to keep the virus under control it makes me upset and angry.   What right do they have to behave in this anti social and dangerous manner?  These same people would be the first to expect extensive healthcare treatment were they or a loved one to become infected by the virus.   Laws should have been passed by Congress months ago mandating the required preventive steps by all American citizens as the virus doesn’t care about state boundaries and the like.  Failure to adhere to these laws should result in severe fines and other appropriate penalties as deemed by Congress."

2020-08-12 20:39,"Is there any legitimate reason the data cannot go to both agencies? 

If HHS wants the data to coordinate response, why should that precude CDC from having it as well, for its obvious research value to epidemiology? The fact that the data is being hoarded and not shared with transparency among the nation's top scientific institutions makes the case that the data is being shielded from view for political reasons. 

HHS can use the data as it needs to without ever removing it from the purview of the other scientists, researchers and healthcare officials. It only takes the press of button to share this data with these valuable scientific players who do what scientists do. 

Not sharing it, when it is so EASY to do so and has no impact on how HHS would use the data anyway, belies the compromised intention this administration has  in keeping the data from not only top scientists at CDC but the public. 

Like the detrimental politicization of a basic public health tool like protective masks, making this critical data less transparent, less available to highly relevant parties like the CDC is a purposeful, strategic effort on the part of this administration to control and bend the facts of this crisis for political gain.

The school is closed for Monday, Tuesday for cleansing and return to regular class on Wednesday. Really, the school facility include tables, door knobs, hallway etc are not self-contaminated. The virus are being introduced in the school by students who may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. By returning to class on Wednesday, the virus will not be going away magically.

to the mismanagement of the pandemic.

1) How is it that six months out you can have so many nursing care  facilities so vastly under supplied with basic ppe?

This is surely due either to the complete  unwillingness  to command production  and/or the disorganized inventory
control that makes it hard to figure out how to get new supplies from Place A to Place B. 

But why is that?

2) The decision to impose a completely new  hospital recording method in the very middle of the pandemic with no  adequate prior consultation of all invested parties, i.e., hospitals and CDC, is surely as absurd and  inept decision as was the original decision in early spring not to use the Emergency Declaration to command production  of needed ppe. 

It remains unclear why this decision was made so quickly
and without any consultation. Anyone with an ounce of
functioning brain matter should have realized  
before the decision, that this was going to be highly 
disruptive, waste valuable hospital time and money, and not   lead in the short run to the supposed aim of a qualitatively superior and more streamlined data reporting system.

Inevitably, if schools are opened people will get sick and die. It's not worth it. So this is what we do:

When I was in grad school I attended a double summer session and thereby made up a half-year of study and I graduated a half-year early. 

I say keep the schools shut until we have a cure and a vaccination. Do video classes as much as possible. Put everything live on hold. When this is all over we can make up the lost time by having summer sessions or longer school days. It may take a  couple of years to completely catch up but I'd rather see schools open in the summertime and after-hours than sick and dead kids and teachers.

Im working in NY right now. In the last two weeks I've been in Colorado, Oregon, California, Illinois, and New York. I've socially distanced and washed my hands and worn a mask and I've managed to stay corona-free. If I can fly to 5 states in 14 days and not get sick then they can go to work."

I've traveled to 5 different states in the last 2 weeks, including Calfornia and NY, and Ive had no issues. If you wear a mask and wash your hands you are pretty much good to go. I sat next to 200 people on a plane with no empty seats and everything was fine. Liberals at this point seem to love the virus. Im sure the second Biden gets elected (and I am going to vote for Biden in case you think I'm some Trumpista) everything will suddenly be fine and good to go."

2020-08-13 2:18,"I support the Mayor on this one, but there is a major logistical issue to resolve. 

According to the school Chancellor, 75% of parents elected to send their children back to school and 85% of teachers are returning as well. The problem is that the Chancellor is offering two modes of schooling that can't coexist; remote learning and blended in-person sessions. Not with live instruction anyway.

Since the schools will allow only 1/3 of students to attend school on any given day, 2/3 of students will learn remotely. Since 85% of teachers will be in-person, the other 2/3 of students will be taught by 15% of teachers. How does that work?

I am definitely a big supporter of sending my kids back to school, however, we are not spending enough energy on the remote learning option, which is where the majority of students will be taught. I fear for the education my children will get this year."
2020-08-13 3:02,"We're talking about schools, right? Places of learning and intellect, right? 

So the decision that must be made is easy, (a) open and see people, like children, teachers plus relatives and friends get sick, spread disease and die; or (b) stay at home, survive and, after some delay, while we come up with a cure and a vaccination, we pick up where we left off and survive."

In the first half of 2019, the California Teacher's Association's special interest lobbyists were the biggest spenders of all state lobbyists. This includes a list of fossil fuel corporations and other profit-making businesses. Teachers and their unions by far gave the most money to CA state legislators. This is taxpayer money that they are corruptly using to damage communities.
It's small wonder that California's state gov't practically tripped over itself to rush to indefinitely close public schools a few weeks ago. If they didn't, the teacher's unions would threaten to cut the money spigot off."

They have had since March to offer teachers training but have they done that?  No, I taught close to 600 students remotely during the pandemic.  My only training was on YouTube.   Have they fixed our broken school buildings?  Certainly not.  Nothing in my school gets fixed unless a permit is filed five years in advance. Meanwhile, the air vents in my classroom are in the closets, and my windows  don't open. Have they hired custodial staff?  No, my principal told me yesterday that the city had cut custodial staff since March.  My school has three janitors.  They barely empty the garbage but now, suddenly, our lives are dependent on them.  Since March, there is nothing, not one thing that the City/ DOE has done to help teachers teach.

De Blasio is eager to open schools in an effort to counter his abysmal handling of the virus in mid-March.  Mulgrew purports to care about the health and safety of his members, but the remote education provided in the spring was abysmal, and even now teachers are resisting daily, live, synchronous classes following a regular school schedule.  Carranza's entire focus is on ""equity,"" and thus is happiest if the system fails all equally.  Who advocates for the students here? Clear answer: no one."

Teachers are an essential part of our children's learning and well-being, and they must do everything possible and within reason to impart the knowledge and educate our youth as they were trained and are paid to do. Therefore, it is unacceptable that unions try to prevent teachers from delivering the valuable education that children need and deserve. Some teachers may not feel comfortable in the classroom given current circumstances, but those that do should be allowed to do their jobs in the classroom. Don't let unions dictate how and when our children can be educated -- let the teachers teach!!"

2020-08-13 9:52,Based on everything I’ve seen it appears that one of the problems with school reopening decisions is that the districts consider it binary. Either every grade is open in some form vs all remote. But there is evidence that the youngest students are less likely to spread the virus ( see the article on kids not being vectors in the NYT). Why not just have kindergarten through second grade only  open for in person teaching. After all this when the most vital skills of reading and basic math are taught and attention spans are at their worst. This would allow for more spreading out in the buildings too. The rest of the students could be remote for now.
2020-08-13 8:05,"The Trump administration said they were transferring pandemic data handling from CDC to DHS because CDC was slow to process it. Now we learn that data handling by DHS is slower. So why did they do this? The data is crucial to the pandemic response -- delayed or inaccurate data could even lead to increased mortality.

This pandemic is a global challenge of historic dimensions, and one day may be remembered as something maybe similar to a World War. We thus should keep our focus on the real enemy (the virus!) and reduce finger pointing on people with different views to a minimum. 

When trying to understand the logics and spread of this disease, we may thus stick as closely to the Facts (the ones we can agree on) and the Figures (we get from plus minus reliable sources). When doing so, we may be saddened to realize, that Figures of Deaths follow the ones of Infections with some weeks of delay. With this, we may need to prepare for figures turning back beyond 2000 additional deaths and mourning families a day. 

Whatever the views on Dems or Reps, people need to focus on protecting themselves, Friends and Families, Colleagues and Employees, Vendors and Customers, Teachers and Students. No finger pointing will help us doing this. The help comes with Masks worn properly, 6ft of distance and kind words for everyone to take care in These worst days of a global pandemic. 

To end this virus (or at least control it), we need to work as one. Maybe Joe Biden can get this message to the American People before and after the elections."

In many states, retail and office spaces lead to much more infection than bars and restaurants. And across the board, nursing homes and industrial settings are way worse. I understand, hypothetically, the conclusion that bars are dangerous, but I'm just not sure the data bear that out in a meaningful way. This piece feels, to me, like more of a political statement supporting keeping bars closed more than a nuanced take on the data."

Vermont has had restaurants open for dining (both indoors and outdoors) for 3 months and has the best Covid record in the country. Also in that time: less than 5 deaths from Covid in the entire state.

2020-08-12 20:17,"A bar is not the same thing as a restaurant, even though most of the regulations fail to make that distinction.  A restaurant may include a bar, but many do not.

At bars, people are usually sitting side by side next to each other and often talking loudly -- conditions very conducive to virus transmission.  In restaurants, people are usually sitting at tables, though the distance between tables can vary a lot.  I used to live in Manhattan, and I remember how common it was for restaurants to use banquette seating where diners in single party are seated opposite each other and adjacent to other diners.  On the other hand, restaurants in areas where real estate is not so expensive usually, but not always, place diners at separate non-adjacent tables.

Restaurants can usually accommodate rules about separation of tables, though sometimes at the cost of capacity and therefore of revenue.  But a bar that required its patrons to observe social distancing would have a very hard time operating at all.

My impression is when a restaurant also has a bar, the bar provides a disproportionate portion of its revenue."
2020-08-12 20:17,"I very much enjoy restaurants but have patronized only take-out from my favorites since February.

Think back to your time in college.  How often did you go to restaurants and bars?  My food and drink palate has changed considerably, but the local bars and affordable greasy spoon restaurants got my dollars back in those days.  The associated independence and freedom of choice was a rite of passage.  After reflecting on that time in your life, tell me, how much will any open college town bars/restaurants be patronized with non-social distancing students these days and what will be the price?"
2020-08-12 20:18,"I fail to understand why we can't do *outdoor* dining and takeout only. We know that COVID is transmitted by aerosols, which build up in the air when people are maskless. Outside, the air mostly solves this problem. But indoors, when people eat maskless, they build up.

There really shouldn't be INDOOR dining or drinking (or gyms/fitness centers) until there's a vaccine and the people who work at these establishments have been given the option of getting a vaccine. 

We need to avoid maskless people coming together indoors. It's just that simple."
2020-08-12 20:19,"I would posit that the number of COVID cases from bars and indoor restaurants are underreported.  Patrons would likely self-select by their perceived invulnerability, i.e. slanting to younger age groups.  The younger age groups have a higher proportion of asymptomatic or lightly symptomatic cases. These cases would not be detected in statewide statistics, however later they can be passed to older folks at events such as family gatherings.  For this reason, a data-driven approach might fail to indict bars and restaurants as a major source of spread."

2020-08-12 20:22,"Sanitizing windows seems like a purely symbolic gesture when you consider that the greater way in which the virus is spread indoors is by customers who are unmasked while eating and drinking and talking loudly. All the other cleaning measures are made superfluous by unmasked patrons. Sadly, the only way ahead for restaurants and bars is to remain closed for indoor dining until a vaccine arrives. In the interim, the government urgently needs to find a way to subsidize their wages and rent."

It’s sad, but their business model just does not work in a time of pandemic.  I am sure when NJ eventually allows restaurants to open indoors, (I don’t know if we will allow indoor bars to open before a vaccine), the owners will be happy for a couple of weeks, then they will be pushing for more capacity, which they will not be rightfully given.  

Sadly, we are going to lose a big percentage of our restaurants.  I don’t think it can be helped. I just hope people get out before they throw more good money after bad.   Who knows when we will have an effective vaccine?"

2020-08-12 21:01,"As part of Covid relief and economic stimulus, I wish government could tap restauranteurs to make and deliver food to all who need it but cannot pay (as part of the public safety net.) Restaurants are able to purchase, prepare, and store food at scale; I bet Tom Colicchio (as an example) could employ and train a lot of prep cooks, sous chefs, and kitchen help to turn out delicious and healthy food for the entire tri-State area! Special dietary restrictions? Restaurants have already solved that complexity. There’s no need for restaurants to go under while people are hungry and food goes to waste. One solution could end a triple shame."

I will stop work in a couple weeks (as will additional family income) to supervise my five year old’s first experience of elementary school: complete online kindergarten.

However, salaries have been cut and jobs lost, I can't see a full recovery for at least a year-it all depends on viral recurrence this winter and vaccine progress. Scientific pundits are correct in that Covid is now endemic and will periodically pop up in local bursts even after a vaccine depending on local levels of acquired immunity."
2020-08-12 21:04,"Restaurants have devolved into ambush sites for class warfare where the ""oppressed"" are handling your food. Eating at restaurants was rarely healthier, cheaper or much faster than other options in the best of times.

That people are literally dying because of this habit, compulsion or delusion is fairly strong evidence that we are too often living unexamined lives. Yet many of us simultaneously defend nearly every aspect of these lives as if it were our own child. Our restaurant habit and reflexive defense of it may be killing us, but it is a symptom of a much deeper and more daunting societal problem."
2020-08-12 21:07,"It's sad but tragically not surprising whatsoever how this serves as a staggering example of just how much Americans- of all generations- cannot go without for the greater good. And just how many of those same people lack the capacity for bigger picture thinking.

For me, it's equatable to a huge building that rents stores being engulfed in flames, ala ""The Towering Inferno"" or something- and someone says to the firefighters attempting to put it out, ""Well, you've got to let me in since I rent a store in there. I need to make money!""

Then they go in and are consumed by smoke or burnt to death. And people are surprised this happened. 

Some people never eat out for the majority of their lives because it is, above all else, a luxury more than a necessity. Go without. The facts are not adaptable."
2020-08-12 21:18,"My best friend, a cancer survivor, after months indoors, met family for dinner.  The restaurant followed all the guidelines.  She was exposed, an employee tested positive.  Thankfully, she nor any family members contracted it.

Almost once weekly an exposure potential is on my local news.  Always an employee at a restaurant testing positive.   

My favorite local restaurant, sadly just permanently closed. 

No I will not eat at a restaurant for a very long time.  

I am still working, I would love to see my best friend, but I consider it too great a risk to take with her impaired immune system.  

We are all missing our normal lives, but a little sacrifice can save so many lives.  Wear a mask, keep your distance."
2020-08-12 21:21,"Some observations from an elderly South Floridian:

First, the recent surge down here --now apparently easing-- is predominantly due to teens and millennials partying.  Closing the bars --obviously a sensible notion -- moved the drinkathons to private residences.

Second, all restaurants are not the same.  Many don't serve alcoholic beverages, ergo they don't attract crowds.  Our occasional recent forays into local favorites have found them virtually empty, otherwise we wouldn't go in.  Easy to maintain social distancing under those circumstances; hard to see how long they can remain in business.

Third, mask usage in stores now seems ubiquitous, a good thing.  I do wish the media would let their readers know a dirty little secret from the contact tracers:  They focus on prolonged exposure --five to fifteen minutes -- at close quarters.  It would help many feel a little more secure about their grocery shopping."
2020-08-12 21:34,"Though I like the restaurant where I have eaten, because it is quiet, even when full, it is not the place, but the food.  We order take-out weekly and the restaurant is doing well.  It serves Vietnamese food.  American food I can prepare."

2020-08-12 21:39,"I do not understand how it is pleasurable to eat in a restaurant right now.  I love eating out, but just can’t see that is worth the risk and don’t think I could enjoy my meal.  When our favorite restaurant opened for takeout, my husband went to pick it up and found workers not masked nor keeping six feet apart, and this is at a high end Italian restaurant where a meal with a glass of wine hovers at $100 per couple.  I love to cook and have been using this as an opportunity to experiment with new dishes.  I will wait to go out until we have a vaccine or the virus dies out."
2020-08-12 21:40,"Stimulus payments should go to the businesses and employees of them most affected by this pandemic - yes restaurants, bars and households where a parent must stay home from work to facilitate remote learning. This instead of blanket payments to everyone who is still gainfully employed and doesn’t need it. This could be achieved by a securely encrypted IRS opt-out app. But hey, everything’s going to be back to normal soon so why waste $$ on such a thing?
Next, restaurants and bars could be assisted to implement a delivery model using their own employees since fewer are needed for outdoor and curbside/carry out. Allow forgiveable loans so that electric vehicles outfitted with hot boxes and chill boxes can be obtained by the business for home delivery servers to use rather than their own vehicles. Include delivery of alcoholic beverages with ID - because not allowing that is plain silly. Revamp menu items to include delivery options that can be easily warm and serve in the home.
I’d gladly pay 20% gratuity for tasty meals and drinks brought to my door by the restaurant and not a 3rd party delivery aggregation service. 
Everyone thinks things are going to return to normal soon so too many think it is a waste of time to reinvent in this way. Right."
2020-08-12 21:53,"We never ate out more than a couple of times a year, when we had our two young children.  However, it never bothered me, as I liked to cook, and grew a lot of our own vegetables, and put them up for winter.  My husband had come from a family who ate a high fat, salt, sugar diet, and his father died of heart disease at the age of 40, so I wanted my two children to have a better outcome, and they have.  Everyone that eats out consumes more calories than they otherwise would if they ate at home.  However, the experts in this disease have said that we are 5 times more likely to get the virus from a family member, as each member has their own work, or school social circle, and their own friends social circle.  That is where all the cases are coming from.  A son who was an actively working doctor in South Florida, passed on the virus to his father, a retired physician, and both of them died.  In other words, the virus is so contagious, and often deadly to many healthcare personnel, who are subjected to a high virus count, day in, and day out.  Every contact with more than 2, presents more its own dangers.  Most nursing home residents who died were given the virus by those who worked in those institutions.  These people probably had spent considerable time with friends, either in bars, or at private homes.  The country is very selfish in how it is approaching this virus.  Not a lot of those, except in the older generation who realize the severity of the virus, and act accordingly."

2020-08-12 22:05,"This article is about where outbreaks have come from, but I don't think the headline that bars and restaurant owners wanted to get back to work is accurate. Bars and restaurant owners have felt compelled to reopen in some capacity due to the lack of support required at the state or federal level (PPP has been problematic and not the financial or legislative fix needed to save bars and restaurants). The effort required to pivot a million times, keep employees safe, and try to meet pre-pandemic expectations from guests has created constant stress, and it's not profitable. And because the take out only scenario is really, really not profitable, we end up with businesses making irresponsible decisions about dine-in. But when the alternative is shutting down, defaulting on one's lease, and risking a lawsuit from the property owner (a real threat), what does one do but keep going? Five months in and few have received the concessions needed from their landlords to feel confident about their businesses making it thru the coming fall and winter."

""Psychology today"" reported in an article by Bill Eddy, lawyer, therapist, mediator and author, the following:  ""After 30 years as a conflict resolution professional in many settings, I believe that narcissists and sociopaths are an increasing public health problem. The feedback I get from professionals worldwide is that these two personalities seem to be on the rise and the cause of many marital, workplace and criminal problems.""

It stands to reason that if you can effectively trace cases to restaurants, you can trace them to *specific* restaurants. Alert (and fine, if necessary) the places that are identified; closing the entire sector because of 1 or 2 locations is absurd.

The statistics you present in the article are also not being put into their proper context. Louisiana, for example: ""roughly a quarter of the state’s 2,360 cases since March that were outside of places like nursing homes and prisons have stemmed from bars and restaurants.""  Translation: 79 cases in a state of over 4.5 million people. The article also fails to note that they categorize an outbreak as *2 or more cases*. Even so, the attempts to paint the picture that ignorant restaurant/bar goers are slamming hospitals has so far been successful, if not factual.

Obviously this is a virus that should be taken seriously and efforts should be made to mitigate its spread. But we need to move past long-term and seemingly arbitrary closures of entire sectors of the economy. We are well past the point of ""just close x businesses for x amount of time"" as a public strategy."
2020-08-12 19:54,"As Mr Waites Laseter, the head bartender at the Backspace Bar & Kitchen, in New Orleans said,
“A friend of mine was threatened with a gun over putting on a mask,” he said. “I’ve always approached a bar as a safe space. Anybody can make a vodka and soda at home.”

Reopening indoor dining and bars, where alcohol almost always can lead to a lack of social distancing (and social graces, safety and more) is a toxic mix during a pandemic. Here in Italy, despite a robust test and trace system, cases are up after indoor dining and other facilities opened up. NYC is wise to stop indoor dining and, I would suggest for my fellow New Yorkers and Americans in the states, closing bars, avoiding nonessential business and wearing a mask. 

Stay safe"
2020-08-12 21:07,"The problem is air.
More exactly: not enough fresh air.
It’s not so much socializing per se.
Its congregating in places that have AC.
The increase in cases in warm states happened when everybody started hunkering indoors under AC.
Thats the red thread that explains much of the southern outbreaks this summer.
AC = lack of fresh air = recirculating peoples breath
It is crucial for us to understand this now before winter causes the same problems in the North.

As you say, ""many restaurant and bar employees across the country are in their 20s and can carry the virus home and possibly seed household transmissions, which have soared....""  And yes. ""Epidemiologists roundly agree that indoor dining, especially in bars, is far more likely to spawn outbreaks than outdoor settings.""    So what do you think is about to happen as millions of teens and young adults crowd into classrooms and dorms across the nation?  It is not possible to avoid the reality of what we are doing, or what the consequences will surely be.  We've already seen it.  Yes, workers have been kept from pay and the poor suffer.  Yes, businesses are breaking down.  No, the republican leadership will never agree to subsidize the nation until a real decline in cases comes.  So yes, we are being forced to open schools for children, and colleges are forced to open as they lack funding otherwise.

The initial lockdown (flattening of the curve) was intended to prevent the breakdown of the health care system. It was intended to be followed by a slow, cautious deliberate reopening where spikes could occur. Italy, Spain, Germany are all experiencing this. The virus cannot be eliminated, it can only be controlled. The health system, except for a handful of places, has not been overburdened and the death rates have continued to drop.

2020-08-12 22:19,"Whether or not it's employees forced to work while they're sick versus patrons with the virus is the critical piece missing here- wildly different policy responses to each. But I'd hesitate before we start pinning this on instant gratification for the young or some uniquely American brand of hedonism. Is there data on this from other countries that reopened? What portion of the cases are tied to outdoor versus indoor dining (common sense says it's a little pointless wearing a mask indoors if you're going to be taking it off for a prolonged period to eat- it's not like we magically stop breathing during the course of a meal) 

And there's also a question of the case load- if it's young people who don't need to be hospitalized and aren't dying catching it in droves from restaurants, to an extent we need to say it's their lives and they're entitled to make their own risk calculations, provided they're not going to the elderly and then spreading it to them. Like people here in Boston are freaking out about the college students coming back but my thoughts are the restaurants and other businesses that cater to them need the business and it's probably better they catch it and stay cloistered in a dorm than getting bored in the suburbs they're from and give it to elderly family members. Better they don't catch it period but there's probably more control over different risk groups in a communal setting like a dorm."
2020-08-12 22:57,"We are in a culture of denial. And it's not just about masks. The whole approach of ""reopening"" to ""save"" the economy was misguided at best, deceptive at worst.

The whole idea of reopening while the biological problem is not under control is a recipe for disaster. The govt should have taken steps to ensure that all small businesses and workers would have what they needed to get through the pandemic. 

Forcing businesses to reopen (and many were gung ho about it) is systematically euthanizing them. Many were barely surviving on 100% of their customer base, pre-Covid. Now they have to make it work on 70%? Or 50%? Good luck. Wall Street wants you to go Chapter 11, so hedge funds can snatch up the commercial real estate on the cheap. Just like they did with the housing market in 2010.

So it's no surprise the govt is letting everyone suffer. (Remember, this is a policy choice. Other countries didn't do this.) They're doing it to benefit the corporate elite. People have to unite: renters, landlords, small biz owners, commercial property owners. Unite and hold govt accountable. Call your reps."

The increases in Covid cases was really due to very crowded indoor *bars* that masqueraded as restaurants, mainly in states that never reduced their COVID cases enough. In states where they reduced COVID cases and have introduced indoor dining, like Maine, it hasn’t been an issue.

At the end of the day, we all need to figure out ways to restart normal activity - schools, work, and yes, restaurants - while implementing precautions (masks, cleaning, testing) and being safe."

2020-08-13 0:35,"A part of the scientific community is focused on minimizing spread. This article follows their lead. But there are many scientists focused not only on minimizing spread but also on carefully reopening the economy.  Their teachings are more relevant here. 

Those who factor in the value of reopening give less attention to general virus spread and total infection counts because the vast majority who are infected have mild cases. And so they focus on secondary spread.

 A young person who goes to a restaurant isn’t much of an issue if he scrupulously avoids those at risk, including the elderly of course. Avoiding a dangerous secondary transmission is all-important. Bringing back business is worth the price of many mild infections. 

As we reopen, we should not make the mistake of the first wave, when we focused on total infections. Total dangerous infections are what matter. A simple infection is a mild case of the flu. A dangerous infection can be a death sentence. We have been missing the forest for the trees. The 20% of cases that are serious require  the vast majority of our attention. 

We pretty much know who the most vulnerable are, not totally of course, but with enough precision that not protecting the vulnerable, first and foremost, is indefensible. Tracing needs to be taken to the second level. Otherwise, the infection of a teenager looks the same as that of his grandparents."

Some nights dinner is grilled cheese or a glass of wine and tortilla chips. Who cares. Have found I don't miss restaurants all that much. Hard for me to understand a country that prioritizes opening restaurants over getting kids safely back to school. Can't stand looking at people eating at restaurants when millions of the country's children can't go to class and are stuck in front of computers all day. That said, restaurant owners and their staff need and deserve substantial government support. If we put them temporarily out of business and force them to stay home from their jobs for the common good, they are owed fair compensation for that. When we are done with this pandemic, I pledge to do my best to gain that 5 pounds back again, happily overeating, ordering craft cocktails and tipping well at our local eateries."

Societies can't organize themselves for the greater good, especially not a society that emphasizes individualism. That's why we try to build strong institutions and elect competent leaders.

We can complain about ""those people"" all we want, but without leadership, consistency, guidance, and reliance on the experts at the highest levels, we're going to have chaos and a long, long road ahead.

I'm a guy and my mother taught me when I was 10, so this ain't rocket science (I was preparing my lunch when the first reports of JFK's assassination started being broadcast).   Let's ignore for the moment it's a very creative process, cooking provides structure and planning to one's existence.   It's ultimately cheaper to cook for oneself (pasta meals with home made egg pasta start for about a buck a serving).   Also, with a little  effort you are in control of your calorie intake.  

Today you don't even have to buy cook books--it seems as if anyone who's so much as baked a loaf of bread has captured it on YouTube.   Name a dish prepared anywhere in the world, I don't care if it's prepared with pig's ears in only in one district in Datong Shanxi, you'll find its prep on YouTube.  

If you can't cook for yourself your basic necessity, and everyone you live with, is dependent upon others.  Think of it as freedom."

A meal eaten at a restaurant is not worth risking my life over, nor is it worth risking the lives of my nearest & dearest.

I have the patience to wait this out, and it's too bad so much of this country is afflicted with a ridiculously short attention span AND the entitlement virus.

Let me put it this way: If World War II happened now, we wouldn't stand a chance, b/c everyone would be so lazy, so out-of-shape, and so selfish - totally unwilling to ""do without."" It would end up being easier to learn how to order from Mickey D's in Russian or German."
2020-08-13 2:26,"In California, indoor dining is prohibited in most counties, while socially distanced, masked outdoor dining is permitted. Restaurants have taken over a great many parking spaces in this ostensibly “car crazy” state.  I

I would not be so moralistic about people going to restaurants. Many restaurants are small businesses, often owned by immigrants, which are the backbone of urban neighborhood commercial districts. Supporting these businesses is a positive thing. Restaurants are among the few destinations outside the home in a time when cinemas, concert halls, libraries, museums, and other public spaces are all closed. With the pandemic likely to continue for many months, is it reasonable to expect that people will stay cooped up in their homes indefinitely? That is the kind of lockdown that is likely to produce explosive, unhealthy reactions.

To me, the discourse about unsafe activities is less than logical. Most states (though not California)give churches largely get a free, unregulated pass, even though they have repeatedly been the site of mass spreading events. Restaurants are scrutinized. Many parents demand on site school openings, though these have regularly been followed by outbreaks. Transit is demonized, though it has not been the site of  contagion anywhere in the world(perhaps because transit in the US is associated with the poor)."
2020-08-13 2:27,"I’ve been wearing a mask at all indoor spaces since mid-March, well before it was recommended or required at least in MA. In general, my wife and I have been living like hermits with the rare social interaction limited and at least 6 feet apart. We went out to dinner a few times beginning in June (outside with good spacing between tables), which seemed like a very low risk.

We don’t want to become ill and we certainly don’t want to contribute to the spread of this pandemic. 

I can’t fathom why anyone would go to a crowded bar, restaurant, or indoor event during these times. How is it that so many people in the US lack any sense of consideration or responsibility for others?

Depressing."

The author would have your believe that in spite of a mountain of evidence collected around the world from countries with far better contact tracking programs, America's problem with COVID-19 is due to bar and restaurants re-openings.  Simplistic, childish and inaccurate as her own opening paragraphs show:

""In Louisiana, roughly a quarter of the state’s....""
""In Maryland, 12 percent of new cases last month...""
""....and in Colorado, 9 percent...""

Where are the real 'focal points' and 'clusters'?  Swimming pools?  Money?  Toilet plumes?  Schools?  The answers are known, but they aren't exciting or fear-inducing so they go unmentioned.  In the meantime just stay away from bars, restaurants, water (of all kinds...the virus monsters are very afraid of water in any form), cash, toilets and schools.  That should just about take care of the virus.

They could have stopped incoming flights, closed down certain industries and schools, asked us to all stay home while ""they"" got busy preparing us for the possibility of a pandemic. Instead, they did nothing. They wrung their hands over the stock market. They worried about what would happen to their political careers. And they golfed, all while this pandemic took hold in our country.  Everyone has paid the price all right, and now it's time for them to pay theirs - at the ballot box and through the courts."
2020-08-13 5:13,We won’t gamble our health at a restaurant anytime soon. My hunch is that it’s those family and friends get-togethers at numerous homes where most of the spread is really happening. Responsibility is really personal. If having that little party is more important to you than the lives of all the people you don’t know who may be infected by you or someone who visits you then this epidemic will end up being every bit as deadly as the worst predictions.

2020-08-13 7:28,"Many posts legitimately bemoaning the fact that Americans, unlike most other cultures, tend to put their individual needs - however superficial - before those of their friends, neighbors and community. 
Keep in mind that Americans are relentlessly sold images of individuality and its value, along with absurdly out of proportion doses of “everyone’s a star,” from the second they’re born until the day they die. The act of living has become the acting out commercial programming, cynically generated not only through mainstream media but now social media as well.

Social contacts are severely restricted and freedom to assemble doesn't exist any more. Policeofficer ready to fine group of people that assemble peacefully or don't wear face masks (even outside in some places). I see Europe turning into a dictatorship. Doctors and epidemiologists say that this is the new normal and that we will have to be used to that until a hypothetical vaccine that may or may not be effective. Is that the world we want?

2020-08-13 10:08,"The problem of spread is not due to going outdoors. The problem of spread is due to crowding indoors and outdoors. Fresh air and plenty of it can prevent spread. Most of the hot spots have been in densely populated urban areas of the USA not in the vast rural areas of the country so far. Why is that 98% of USA does not have confirmed positive cases? The Coronavirus 2 is an airborne virus that gets transmitted from close people to people contact and from inter continental travel of infected people. Well every country has placed travel restrictions for a long time now. How long is enough is the question. Human race is born to be free. Each one has to try getting out of the line of fire. The extended lock downs by governors have destroyed businesses and helped certain businesses thrive to an unanticipated level of profits. If the hunter gatherers of the stone age were to wait for Amazon to deliver prepared ready to eat meals they would have waited until eternity and the human race could have been extinct long long time ago. 

Politicians of both parties, predominantly lawyers have mucked up the lives of their residents and poorly handled this pandemic by politicizing this public health crisis. If we had taken a proper multi-pronged approach by this time we should have seen the tapering of the pandemic and hoping for an eradication, NOT a surge and definitely not a segmented economic disaster in certain sectors and unprecedented job losses, loss of livelihoods and a grave future."

We walk, hike, bike, paddle board, swim in lakes, rivers, the sound, the ocean (the ocean with wetsuits here)-we're hardly stuck inside. We do Airbnb online experiences-cooking, virtual travel tours, etc. I'm disgusted that people don't understand that until the virus is under control we can't have our lives back, we can't have our economy back. The selfishness is astounding...and it will keep going on and on until the stupidity stops...or until we have the majority vaccinated, which will be months after there's a vaccine.  I simply don't understand how people don't get the big picture of how this works, or that our schools ever thought in the spring, given how people are behaving, that there was any hope school could start safely in person. The people hollering about their ""freedom"" (mask-less, of course) are keeping everyone, including themselves, from getting full lives and the economy back."
2020-08-13 6:15,"While I'm sure some customers wanted to eat out again, ""the nation"" hasn't been clamoring for this. Most potential customers are voted with their feet to save their lives,and are staying home. Some restaurant owners, particularly corporate ones,  wanted to reopen, even if it killed a few people, and government officials were only too happy to value commerce over human lives when given the chance. Keep those campaign contributions coming in from people, and corporations, with money! Forcing workers back into unsafe workplaces, and then lying to say it was their ""choice"", is shameful. So is claiming a business, or workplace, is safe if people kinda sorta wear masks sometimes and sometimes keep six feet away from each other, but not really and not all of the time."

With time though, I noticed when I passed restaurants and cafes a laisser-aller. Waiters wearing masks under their nose or not at all when they were setting tables before clients arrived. 
Now the numbers are up and I don’t trust restaurateurs any more and since many waiters are young I have no way to know if they weren’t partying in large crowds on their day off.

The ""new cases"" and ""deaths"" counts are completely unreliable.  A positive Covid test is not even needed for a doctor to count the death as Covid!  Now no one trusts the numbers (except old people, who are also easily fooled by phone scams, internet scams, etc).

Texas had a huge ""spike"" back when reporting rules changed re what could now count as a confirmed case.  Again, most people rolled their eyes and went about their business.

2020-08-13 15:24,"My primary and often-only source of information through this pandemic has been the New York Times. 

By the very data you presented, all but 2360 of the 133,243 cases in Louisiana since March have been in nursing homes or prisons. 

With this data, you presented a story suggesting that bars and restaurants are dangerous places for outbreaks (“outbreaks” being defined as “2 or more cases among unrelated individuals that have visited a site within a 14-day period”.)

This means:
•1.8% of all cases in Louisiana are not in a nursing home or prison.
•Less than 0.45% of all cases in Louisiana occur in places like restaurants and bars. 

None of this addresses the misleading definition/presentation of “outbreak”. Correct me if I’m wrong, but the definition of an outbreak in this case is literally “as few as 2 people who don’t know each other who contracted the coronavirus who went to the same restaurant or bar within 14 days of each other.”

I’m sure I’m missing something here, but at the very least something isn’t right...and I find it incredibly disappointing and irresponsible that that something is coming from The New York Times."

2020-08-12 19:21,I remain concerned that studies which are admittedly not peer-reviewed are being extolled as scientific gospel. The severe implications of this COVID-19 Coronavirus are already dire enough to exclaim that its infectiousness is even farther than 6-feet distance all the while researchers quoted in this report acknowledge the limitations of this study.
2020-08-12 19:25,"Scientific evidence slowly accumulating. 

At this moment, it is clear that Coronavirus with these discovered features will be very formidable threat to our daily life.

Distance from a coronavirus source such as  6 feet is any more out of date and should be abolished. in a close environment, you are not safe UNLESS you are wearing a mask can safely protect you.

Distance may work in the open air, but in closed spaces, distance is not a safety factor.

That brings us a final conclusion. The only way to protect ourselves lies on effective masks and cleaning. 

Simply without a mask, you do not stand a chance."
2020-08-12 19:31,"""The room had six air changes per hour and was fitted with efficient filters, ultraviolet irradiation and other safety measures to inactivate the virus before the air was reintroduced into the room.

That may explain why the researchers found only 74 virus particles per liter of air, said John Lednicky, the team’s lead virologist at the University of Florida. Indoor spaces without good ventilation — such as schools — might accumulate much more airborne virus, he said.""

Most houses average air leakage of about 1 air exchange per hour. Any more leakage than that will make the house feel drafty in cold weather and cost more to heat and cool. Air leakage less than that can be achieved in new construction, but old houses require extensive (though low cost) retrofits. So, when heating or cooling is required, there will be a desire to reduce ventilation to increase comfort and save money/environment. 

Reduced ventilation from a drafty hospital at 6 air exchanges/hour to a comfy home of 1 air/hr will lead to a huge increase in density of virus particles. Very few homes have hospital style decontamination of ventilation return air. So, all return air is fresh and expensive, or laden with virus particles.

I try to wear an N95 (that I reuse) indoors at stores. This article will increase my motivation. Also, I prefer to be outdoors if around others. Good luck and vote."

The air we breathe is increasingly unhealthy."
2020-08-12 20:06,"My employer here in Australia had enacted a work from home instruction to all employees for a period of 3 months until community transmission of COVID -19 subsided. We have now been gradually reintroduced to the workplace office, most of us unwillingly, with the reassurance of daily deep cleaning of workspace areas, restricted movement of staff, and a 1.5 metre distance rule. 

This research confirms my thoughts that COVID-19 is perfectly capable of airborne transmission over comparatively long distances (making the 1.5m rule a joke) and can survive in a rich environment such as an office block for a significant period. 

I'll be sure to share this article with my employer."
2020-08-12 20:07,"Very interesting article.  I am wondering if these findings suggest that cloth type masks won't provide sufficient protection when indoors?  Also, wondering how these results compare with other viral particles such as flu?"
2020-08-12 20:19,"There has been a missing link since the virus appeared and I was convinced it was more airborne than the authorities had been revealing.  It was simply spreading too fast, too randomly.  I certainly can’t be the only one who came to that conclusion (which would suggest a cover-up in hopes of quelling panic),"
2020-08-12 20:23,"""Now a team of virologists and aerosol scientists has produced exactly that: confirmation of infectious virus in the air.""

This seems obvious since flu and other viruses would spread in the same manner.  

We will not be able to keep school children and teachers safe as long as they are indoors where aerosols spread throughout the air or people in restaurants or other enclosed spaces."
2020-08-12 20:33,"On the one hand, it is good to conduct studies to understand precisely what is happening and how best to approach the situation. That's the scientist in me speaking.

On the other hand, some of this need for proof is like arguing how many angels can dance on the head of a pin (ala Alexander Pope). Efforts to prevent transmission should have proceeded without needing to prove every single little thing up front. We should have taken as strict measures as we could and then eased off on them as evidence rolled in (e.g. that items are not the main path of transmission). That's the physician and public health researcher in me speaking. 

The need for immediate, definitive proof (partly driven by the politics in this country) has no doubt led to many deaths, infections, and chronic illnesses."
2020-08-12 20:49,"An ounce of prevention in this case doesn't yield a pound of cure.
So far, most attempts at a solution have failed. A new tact will be developed by minds superior to thse with prevailing beliefs and approaches. Dismal results at containment are obvious and a cure or prevention still but a hope.  The tact that works for me is the assumption everyone has, had or will have this or that  bug and live Life accordingly. It works for me and has for a very long time ."
2020-08-12 20:53,So .... a RESPIRATORY virus can be transmitted through the air?  Oh what a surprise.
2020-08-12 20:54,"I have never comprehended why or how the six-feet social distancing guideline has survived this long.  I adjusted my social distancing (especially indoors) to 4 meters (approx. 13 feet) after the Chinese study recommending same was published in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal back in April.  Perhaps now this US study will propel us all to adopt and observe a more scientifically arrived at and efficacious social distancing, especially indoors."
2020-08-12 20:58,"I am not surprised by the new findings, as the evidence had been pointing in this direction for several months now. It was just a matter of time before scientists were able to prove that the coronavirus can travel far beyond the much touted 6 feet and infect cells (though we still don't for sure whether there is enough live virus at that distance to infect humans).

As others have pointed out, we shouldn't have waited for scientific proof that the coronavirus can travel - and survive - over distances of more than six feet. This may have been the worst mistake made by the WHO, the CDC, and the White House. 

Had the U.S. assumed a conservative, ""better safe than sorry"" position on this issue and required - not just recommended - face masks in public spaces from day one, the pandemic would never have reached the proportions it has. This is what many Asian countries did, and while they weren't able to suppress the virus completely, they fared better than the U.S. by several orders of magnitude.

And that's just if regular cloth masks had been required. If the U.S. had invested billions of dollars into producing its own U.S.-made N95 masks (or equivalent) to provide not just health care workers, but also (at least) essential workers and other vulnerable populations with life-saving masks, the toll of the pandemic would be nowhere near what it is now. The associated expense certainly would have been less than the damage suffered by our economy due to our mask failures."
2020-08-12 20:59,"This is not rocket science.  There is so much anecdotal evidence that the virus easily spreads in the air around us.  Look at the choirs, church,funerals, gatherings etc.  That transmission was more than six feet.  If you are indoors where other peoiple have congregated, picture invisible virus particles like a cloud. You are walking right through it and breathing in those particles.  Wear a mask and if you wish, add a face shield.  Six feet does not help.  Wearing gloves doesn't help.  I am not referring to a walk outside with no walls or ceilings.  Add a mask for crowded sidewalks or farmers markets.  But six feet distance will not protect you!"
2020-08-12 21:09,"I think it’s about time to recognize how simple the coronavirus spread is: it is 95% spread through the air by people who don’t have any significant symptoms … and aren’t wearing masks. (The remaining 5% is from everything else.)

That’s where all the data are pointing. 

And at this point, that means the spread in America is currently due almost entirely to Trump supporters. Both directly through maskless socializing, and indirectly through disastrous policy making."

The second was telling people to wear a mask to protect other people, which gave selfish idiots license to ignore the advice because it wouldn't affect them.

Now it's clear that masks work to protect the wearer and others.  We should have been told this 5 months ago; imagine how different things could have been."

As my district puts together a cobbled, half-baked plan for a ""hybrid"" return -- hybrid for students, not for teachers by the way -- news continues to stream in over how abjectly, infuriatingly stupid it will prove to open schools in person. 

This virus spreads easily through the air. Classrooms are poorly ventilated incubation boxes. 

This virus can kill, yes. But that's not the real issue here. 

This virus is showing a propensity to have a strong likelihood of altering your physiology for the worse in myriad ways. 

Contract the virus, and look forward to:

-heart damage;
-lung damage;
-kidney damage;
-brain damage;
-blood clotting;
-and more!

The human and economic toll on this bug is possibly exponential. The hubris of NY, with a currently low transmission rate, is complete as the virus rages across most of the rest of the country. Andrew Cuomo thinks somehow we are in the clear. We are not. People are in the restaurant and at the bar in NY. 

If I am debilitated by this virus, because we could not, as a society, figure out how to hunker down and take care of one another for short (less than two year) period of time, then I -- along with countless others who were foisted into a petri-dish masquerading as a workplace -- will be forced to litigate against those whose Pollyanna fueled magical thinking devastated our lives.

Right?"
2020-08-12 20:47,"Back in late winter, a NYT poster wrote that the older Italians were saying that the virus “was in the air.” 

Simply put, it would have been easier for the public to understand that phrase rather than to bicker about droplets or the smaller aerosols. 

Since mid-February, I’ve always worn a surgical mask (and sometimes a KN95) to cover my nose and mouth, eyewear to protect my eyes, and a cap with a brim when in public and anywhere outdoors beyond my property. 

I recently was a visitor in a hospital on Long Island. Did I protect myself enough? Time will tell, but still dodging the virus so far and acting as if it’s in the air."
2020-08-12 21:22,"It is always necessary to gather evidence when establishing fact, so kudos to the researchers. 

But for the rest of us, well, Occam's razor is a really good way to  start thinking about how we act in the face of an absence of concrete evidence. If the simplest explanation for the incredible contagiousness of the disease is that it can spread by aerosols; and if we can take simple, non-harmful ways to reduce exposure to aerosols; and if reducing exposure to aerosols, if aerosols exists, would reduce overall infections, then the best bet is to act as if there are aerosols. Wear a mask. Distance yourself. And sure, wash your hands.

I am grateful for proof. I am certain that the naysayers will find that aerosols can produce infections - most people are not hacking up a lung at the bars that have had clusters. But do we really need proof to do what makes sense?"
2020-08-12 21:30,"How many are being made to return to schools that promise safety with the 6-foot rule even though recent research suggests that rule is antiquated and wildly inadequate?:

So is hand washing/sanitizing, cleaning surfaces, door handles, etc. in the home. So is minimizing the number shopping trips, utilizing pre-order/curbside pick-up services, etc.

Eventually the research and the science will catch up.  My guess is that aerosol spread will be proved the most prevalent and efficient way the virus spreads.

Until then, common sense and a healthy dose of self-preservation will keep me masked and safety glassed when out in public.  Fortunately most folks in our area feel the same way (though maybe not the safety glasses).  We are lucky."

Think that without wearing an N95 mask, a teacher forced to spend hours with children.

And how about how far aerosols could travel in supermarkets.  

Now we need to convince those in the WH, but that has zero chance of getting them to change protective measures."

2020-08-12 22:04,"In truth, this is another speculation. We heard about picking the virus up from surfaces, and they were wiping down surfaces and taping off benches in Boston, and the consensus is now that picking a virus up from surfaces in Real Life is exceedingly rare. The same goes for wearing masks where there is ""no direct or quality evidence"" they protect transmission of the virus, says WHO. There is a huge logic leap from outlier events that are detected in labs from scientists and real life. We can't make generalizations from finite scientific experiments to society at large, that not good science, and it's not reality."
2020-08-12 22:06,"Many are commenting that this was conducted in a hospital room with negative pressure and UV. However these are also patients hospitalized with COVID. People are not hospitalized unless they are pretty ill and presumably have high viral loads. Working in a hospital is a risk factor for COVID but many of us are still unaffected despite contact with sick patients. Those with continued contact with the sickest patients especially on vents seem to be most at risk. So rather than positing that staying 6ft away doesn’t protect you, I would say that keeping sick people home (paid sick leave), wearing masks and increased cleaning are still the answer.

We’ve suspected (and acted on) this since early in the epidemic. People with influenza also create virus laden aerosols. 

What people have been hung up on is whether the aerosols and the attack rate are similar to something like measles, which hasn’t been shown to be the case. If it were like measles, you would expect much higher case counts in places like hospitals where the most commonly used PPE is surgical mask except during aerosolizing procedures, such as intubation, when N95s are used."

Good grief.  It's only Wednesday. I shudder to think what tomorrow may bring. Every day the news continues to get more gloomier and disheartening.

As a comparison, the CDC qPCR assay can only consistently detect at ~1000 copies/mL which is more than 10,000 fold higher. There does seem to be viral spread beyond the putative 6 ft distance, but this is not to say that it's enough to be infectious.

2020-08-11 10:49,"While the efficacy of this vaccine should be critiqued openly,  I think this development is  at least promising.

I hope this does not become a political issue from the onset the way HCQ became. I recall Trump pitched that drug as a cure-all misleadingly to the public.

But this caused a widespread backlash.While HCQ was far from a cure-all, it was still used in treating COVID-19 in many countries - including European ones and China - despite its politicisation in the US. 

The sad thing is how quickly people from any side take stances based on ideology rather than trying to discern the facts for themselves. If a study in France shows HCQ as promising, Trump touts it as a cure-all. If other studies do not arrive at a similar conclusion, Trump's opponents will immediately label the drug as a scam.

Medical science continues evolving. And studies can contradict each other on the efficacy of a drug or vaccine. I believe people need to refrain from ""confirmation bias"" - only considering the evidence which supports their preconceived view while dismissing  evidence which might contradict that view.

It is my sincere hope the Russian vaccine is not politicised in that people adopt view based on ideology. Let's see what this vaccine is and determine its efficacy before pouring cold water on its prospects from behind a computer keyboard."

2020-08-11 11:37,"The news that Russia has a vaccine for the coronavirus and is going ahead with it without the full range of testing is alarming for multiple reasons.

One is that testing has three purposes: to demonstrate the vaccine is effective, determine the best way to use it, and to make sure it is safe. Putin’s decision means none of that has been established. 

Two, Russia’s population is about to become participants in a giant medical experiment - and no one can trust the results that will be reported. There are already plenty of conspiracy theories about vaccines out there. This is going to make them explode.

Three, Trump has been dropping hints about a vaccine being ready by October. (Surprise!) Now we know where he’s been getting that from. Trump’s trust in Putin over our own authorities has been repeatedly demonstrated. 

We know Trump calls Putin all the time - and we know he keeps tight control over the content of those “perfect” calls, especially after being impeached because of them. What are the odds no one else in the administration really knows what they have been talking about?

We also know Trump lies about everything and only hears what he wants to hear. We’ve seen that he, his administration, and right wing media will seize on anything they think will help them, like HCQ, no matter whether it’s actually a good idea or not. Will his base buy this one? Expect more division, more controversy.

Just when we think things can’t get worse..."

Best would be a compromise between Democrats and Republicans in Congress to get some money for states, a lot of money for the unemployed and other important groups in the traditional way. That is why I was so dismayed when Speaker Pelosi walked out of the negotiating room and said let them call me when they've got a higher number. That negotiating should be done in private. If they can't agree on everything let them at least, as Minuchin says, pass what they have agreed on which is a lot.

I don't think anyone wants to go to a politician for their medical problems. Seems like a horror movie come true where a mafia don amputates his victims because he is a surgeon by training. Putin is just a mafia don, come to think of it, and yet he wants to play doctor to the entire planet.

Putin rules Russia with an iron hand, so I doubt if he runs any great risk of alienating the Politburo by getting a vaccination that will be widely distributed to Russian citizens. Those in the basement will be inoculated first to make sure that a vaccine is viable. The obvious unthinkable parallel in America is that the American president might (will?) take a toddler's ""monkey see, monkey do"" approach.

The president hates testing (except for himself, his family and his courtiers). Trotting doglike behind Putin, Donald Trump will want something that's political, not medicinal. We will be able to add Putin's cynical ""effectively enough"" to the president's great arsenal of leadership quotations: 

""I don't take responsibility at all.""

""It'll be gone by spring.""

""The Obama administration didn't leave us with anything.""

""It's mostly harmless.""

""It's China's fault.""

""We''l have to live with it.""

""It is what it is.""

Donald Trump has ""cut corers"" on his presidency in the same way that have raised ""international concerns that [Russia] is rushing approval for political or propaganda purposes."" He never cared about America's health.

I have collaborated with Russian scientists in the last century and published jointly. I can say that the Russian scientists are just as bright as American scientists though not as successful. Is it possible that the Russian equivalent of its FDA may have pushed the approval process prematurely? It is possible but that is where each country does what it is supposed to do. Do a risk benefit analysis for their own country and to whatever it takes to keep its citizens safe. Russia has a long border with China. I am sure it is quite porous too.

Wikipedia explains it well: Safety (toxicity) is the main focus of Phase I of clinical trials. Side effects are evaluated in Phase II. Phase III is focused on the ability of vaccine to prevent the disease. Serious side effects are monitored in Phases II & III but can be discovered even after the Phase III is completed and long after the drug was marketed. Faulty Phase III trials might result in producing the medicine that is inefficient, but mostly safe.

Putin is willing to sacrifice several thousand/million people to help #45's efforts to get Russia back into the G-7.  At the current rates of infection in the USA, we have no real idea about Russia's CV-19 infection rate, however; we know two (2) things: a) that Putin does NOT want Trump to lose this election, and; b) Putin's data on Russia's pandemic isn't true.

Russia lifted shutdowns in May, people are dining inside restaurants, going to concerts. Meanwhile government numbers don't add up to hospital reports. Hospitals using Soviet era ventilators, even those are in shortage, medical staff are dying from infections. Dictators who rely on lies and strong arm tactics quickly realize they can't muscle a virus. Putin's Russia already suffering economically can't afford to keep the population out of work and without social distractions.

Much like the US, we see that the rays of sunshine Republicans pump into their constituents are a facade. Suing to repeal affordable healthcare, small incompetent government, tax cuts, cuts to broadband, cuts to education, a pandemic doesn't care about ideology. 

Putin is the man Trump has been receiving orders from on a weekly basis? Where do you think Trump got ""Operation Warp Speed"" from. Republicans have left the US weak and vulnerable. Their decades of guns and Pentagon spending while forsaking healthcare, education and shared sacrifice has left us desperate, vulnerable and weak, just like Russia."

Their treatment of epidemic diseases such as typhus, smallpox and others was exemplary. In many ways, they were ahead of the West. So if this vaccine works well enough, I would take it. But there is no need to ask Putin for handouts: there are several vaccines in the West that should be rushed through stage 3 trials and administered ASAP. The anti-vaxxers on the left and the right who refuse to take it “because Trump” or “because freedom” should be left to their own devices. I honestly don’t care what happens to them."

Any state that doesn't do so, now, is a dastardly liar.

If the vaccine has completed Phase 2, it's completed safety trials.  There is little downside and much upside to essentially expanding the Phase 3 efficacy testing from 30,000 to 30 million.  If its efficacy is good, then thousands of lives will be saved by earlier delivery, far, far more than would be risked by the delivery of the vaccine (as was determined in Phase 2).  If its efficacy is poor, then the cost is some inconvenience.  Like all the COVID-related choices, we are weighing lives against inconvenience."
2020-08-11 14:24,"The Russians will rush their ""vaccine"" to under-developed countries as well as their own and claim victories in science and technology while pointing out that American health care and technology has failed. They'll also point out that the United States will take care of it's own citizens and not care about other countries. So, though greatly untrue, the untried and unproven vaccine will provide ""The new Soviets"" with substantial propaganda victories at the expense of the United States and the West.  Putin will also strengthen his stranglehold on Russia with this false victory.  Putin and Russia will exploit anything they can even if people die in the process.  This will also feed American conspiracy theorists who assert that the American scientific community is not doing all it can and they will also assert Trump is making heroic efforts to help Americans in the face of failed American science that abandoned it's citizens under the direction of the Obama administration.  Tragically the lies will have a foothold and will impact the elections this fall."

But I'll still trust the word of Dr. Fauci over whatever Russia claims, especially when various clinical trials had not been completed before an ""approval"" was even given for this vaccine.

There is empirical scientific data and then there's voodoo vaccines from a country that would not even admit there were COVID-19 cases in Russia until MONTHS and months after the fact.

The Russians are well known to take risks and push ethical boundaries to achieve results. Sometimes it succeeds  spectacularly, like with the early days of the Russian space program when they were first to put a man in space. Other times, like with recent disaster with their nuclear powered rocket program, it ends in disaster. 

Based on what’ve I read, I have no reason to doubt that they’re probably right. Hindsight will likely prove them correct. But for the utmost confidence, our ways of doing things — ethically and carefully — will be the thing that gives us the faith to go to the moon."

My hypothesis is that this is a Russian attempt to spread misinformation regarding the vaccine with the intent of building false hopes, and controlling the narrative. They might even try to use it to leverage support for Trump in the elections. My basis for this argument is that historically, this is what Russia does.  Russia is the epitome of The Boy Who Cried Wolf."

2020-08-11 15:09,The assumption that the vaccine will do more good than bad even if it is not super effective is resting on shaky ground.  First when people have gotten a vaccine they think and ACT LIKE they are protected.  If only 30% are protected then you have major damage and rampant spread.  Second there is a small chance that the vaccine will make people directly sick or make them more vulnerable to severe illness if they get infected.  The last thing we need is a vaccine failure that make people even more paranoid about government vaccines.

I want to see the data and watch closely as this vaccine either isn't viable at all, or falls shout of working properly in their patients.

At this time, I find it doubtful that Putin is acting in anyone's best interests, but his own.  He wants to see America in chaos and bowing to the superiority of Russians.  That will never happen."

2020-08-11 16:29,"Russia is not a successful participant in world trade nor in good governance because this kind of behavior is habitual. They never learn and it's been centuries of this kind of behavior that has brought Russian to this set of circumstances. Russians simply do not do all the work needed to produce excellent results, they always cut off efforts with first successes and then act like they've done a great job, when they have only completed the initial stage of development.

Competent and lasting results requires extra efforts beyond initial successes. In technology, in science, in law, in government, in business, and generally the first 90 percent of time and effort and the last 10 percent time and effort are about the same. Stopping at 90 percent results in high rates of failure despite initial successes.

This vaccine may work, the vaccines which eventually do work, do work initially. But the empirical evidence predicts that the likely rate of failure at this point is significant enough that the risks of poor outcomes are not unlikely. Taking big risks by not doing all the work necessary to minimize those risks is characteristic of Russian technologies and management."

By getting EVERYONE to take it, you are guaranteeing problems for folks who had none before, causing disease in healthy people. A sound RCT trial through a Phase 3 & 4 process is crucial.

There is enough anti-vaxxer, anti-masker nuttiness already; Putin is stirring the pot of American chaos...and Trump is sure to follow the reckless bullying of his favorite despot.They have a mutual benefit alliance ! America is disarray, Russia gloating at how cheap it was to unravel us."

But in any ""sibling rivalry,"" there is inevitably competition. My fear is that this ""president,"" like all things within his reign of terror, will be to pressure the FDA in such a way that a vaccine will be prematurely approved.  No doubt with Donald Trump's total immersion into self-glorification and dependent adulation from his people, that is his ultimate goal....a rushed vaccine that may help him get reelected while further harming rather than saving lives."
2020-08-11 16:41,"WOW.  The vaccine path the Russian health care regulator is taking is completely unconventional, if not reckless and dangerous.

Protocols such as the final phase, Phase lll are put in place for specific reasons. ""This final phase is the only way to know with statistical certainty whether a vaccine prevents an infection"" and yet, the Russians are completely bypassing that final phase.  

The Russian government is satisfied with a vaccine that merely ""works effectively enough"" and will start administering it to ""teachers and medical workers this month.""

This is entire scenario is so wrong on so many levels.

It's difficult to not think that a primary reason Russia is fast tracking their vaccine without the crucial final Phase lll is because they want to beat the US in being the first.

I remember very well when back in the 1960s when the U.S. and Russia were competing in who could get a man on the moon first.  Mistakes were made, astronauts died.

I fully understand a healthy competition for wanting to be the first in the world to develop a vaccine against this virus.

The moment safety and effectiveness is tossed aside and replaced by a lower expectation of a vaccine working merely ""effectively enough"" because the goal is NOT to save lives but rather it be a ""symbol of national pride and provide a lift"" for the country's president then the world only sinks into a lower, darker and deeper pit of selfishness and inhumanity.

Talk about priorities being skewed and upside down."

In any case we are no better, operation warp speed sounds as scary as what the Russians are trying. Sinking billions, especially into a company that has never made a viable vaccine and presuming on the vaccine while people are still learning about this virus.

The previous policy included immediately notification of any positive case. Why were the guidelines changed to cover who tests positive? How are we going to protect ourselves, or our students and staff, if we do not get information about who tests positive? Is it me, or this guideline seems a blatant attempt to hide the severity of the situation? What kind of attitude!

This speeds up clinical trials considerably and may reduce the need for a traditional phase 3 trial; however, it does raise ethical questions. If this were the case, they would be able to bring the vaccine to market much more rapidly. In short, it is possible that Russia has developed a safe, effective vaccine, but we may not want to know how they achieved it."

When he finally went because he couldn’t get a deep breath, it was too late to even do treatment. He died four weeks later. 

Refusing to admit that he was sick killed my great uncle. 

Refusing to admit that COVID is real, that it can cause serious illness, that it can kill, and that it spreads easily is to act just like my uncle. 

The one big difference? He’s the only one who died because of his choice to ignore the evidence in his every breath. 

With COVID, one person’s choice to ignore the evidence can kill them as well as others. 

Mask up. Give space. Stay outdoors when you need to gather.

I say keep the schools shut until we have a cure and a vaccination. Do video classes as necessary. Put everything live on hold.

Four more years of Trump would probably destroy our country as a useful actor on the world stage, not to mention a counterweight to Russia’s malign influence and desire regional hegemony.

One might think, the system of society, or its many systems, are in disarray, and signals are not being sent and the parts that used to work together aren't even working singly. But our society is so organized in general, and so ""hot,"" as it were, there are patterns, certain operations, certain things, that at inertia keep moving.

So, how much of what is happening is emergent? How much of it is inertia?

Consider the school issue, K-12, athletics, college, as normally practiced. Common sense, or informed common sense, dictates you simply cannot school in the traditional way during a still flaring pandemic.

Yet here we are. The inertia of the quest for revenue demanded all concerns be subordinated, despite reality. The problem is this however: nobody puts reality in the corner. So, well, you'll see soon enough.

The problem with us being a slave to perhaps outdated customs, expectations, methods, or means, is that we might just be running out a dead hand. A good gambler knows when to fold a hand like this, and wait for a better deal.

But sadly good gamblers are not making the play here. These decisions about our education sector are coming from an institutional and political class whose primary concern is the preservation of systems of revenue, not education.

So there is a lot of talk about ""change"" but paradoxically, a lot of what is happening in various sectors is the opposite of change. That which we are leaving unquestioned."

Nothing but a political ploy on Russia’s part. Putin _needs_ to show his countrymen that he’s on top of it.

Sadly, I believe Russia does not have a viable vaccine. If they do, I highly suspect they stole it from us or China.

Now Russia has some brilliant scientists, but their infrastructure and resources are dismal; especially since gas prices are so low.

China has more of a chance of getting a viable vaccine than Russia. I firmly believe that Putin would lie about anything and everything...all day, every day.

If Americans die or fall ill as a result, Putin couldn’t care less, and neither, it seems, does Trump."
2020-08-12 0:38,"The big issue, not mentioned in the piece is that Attorney General, Paxton, has provided guidance which states that if local health officials close schools without Texas Education Association approval on a case by case basis, they will lose state funding. So Abbott wouldn't make decisions at a state level and punted to local officials. Then Paxton threatened to hold their funding hostage if they close for more than 3 weeks and which limits online learning for 3 weeks. So school districts are in a position where they will open at the last possible date, Sept 8th and all schools that can afford the technology will start with 3 weeks online then go back to in school classrooms on September 29th. so basically they've been forced to push back in school presence until children in school districts that started earlier begin to DIE, in the hopes the state will change it's guidance. This was the same guy that said Senior citizens would rather be exposed and die versus damaging the economy for their children/grandchildren, so expecting any kind of humanity from him us futile."

If the vaccine is good, I guess they are national heroes who gave Russia and Putin a propaganda coup.  If the vaccine doesn't work, perhaps they should upgrade their winter clothing with Siberian winter weather in mind."

Sickness and death are part of life, but this virus is not even close to deadly for 99.99% of kids.  Since very few campus staff are near or over the age of 70, that's not really a concern either.  It's time to move forward.  We are not going to eradicate this virus and wear masks forever.

Because of lockdowns, social distancing, and enhanced hygiene behaviors adopted over this period, all these causes of death and those related to infectious diseases are massively decreased.
Meaning the cumulative total provided by CDC is far lower than normal for non-COVID-19 causes.
So the real COVID-19 related death count over these 5 months is almost certainly well over 250,000.

She is prepared to follow the necessary guidelines, but has a lot of anxiety about feeling lonely.

College administrators have no business blaming young people for acting like youths in a situation that has been mismanaged by our federal government and taken advantage of by colleges looking only at their bottom lines. Students are making risk assessments and see that while they are at low risk themselves for the worst impacts of Covid, they are at high risk of anxiety and depression due to social isolation. Rather than draconian restrictions against socializing (no student is allowed into another student‘s dorm room), colleges should understand that students need small, sanctioned social bubbles. Otherwise we will see parties and large gatherings, more school closures, and blaming of those who least deserve it, the students themselves."

But even the most responsible, isolated student can’t live in a vacuum on campus, attending classes, sharing meals and dorms.

These two factors, combined with young people’s tendency to be efficient spreaders of the virus, make for a volatile mix. Unfortunately, as with sports and businesses, “opening up” or “reopening” schools before they are ready to do so is yet another case of Trump and his ilk trying to put the proverbial cart before the horse, acting as if things are normal before they actually are, thereby making them even more abnormal than they need to be. This is also a clear example of the differences between, and advantages of, progressive, proactive, preemptive approaches to such issues versus reactionary ones that, after the fact, attempt to put the horse back in the barn after it is long gone."

2020-08-19 16:17,"This is the realized logical conclusion of what a disturbing amount of the ""lockdown until vaccine"" crowd have been advocating. 

I have often seen and heard things like:

Caught not wearing a mask? Fines and/or jail time.

End up in the hospital after going to a bar? Deny them medical care.

Hopefully people will use the sad situation in Venezuela as a mirror to inform their opinions on just how much oversight on individuals a government should have."
2020-08-19 16:20,"The US economic sanctions, really an economic war against the Venezuelan people, has significantly reduced the ability of the government to deal with the internal pandemic and provide necessary medical care to those infected. Venezuelan health statistics related to covid-19 infections and deaths likely underestimate the breadth of the pandemic given the decline of the health care system denied adequate resources. 

Now thousands are returning from countries with exceptionally high infection and mortality rates, like Perú, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador. All countries have systems for repatriating citizens who traveled abroad, but few are dealing with the massive influx of high risk returnees who have traveled under circumstances not conducive to social distancing, etc. Venezuela obviously lacks the resources to do this in a manner that would both provide the greatest protection to Venezuelans who never left and the greatest comfort and support to those returning. 

The NYT has strongly supported the draconian sanctions against Venezuela and has not advocated a relaxation during the pandemic. This article only feigns concern for those returnees since it denies the interest the government has in managing the return, much less acknowledging the impact of the sanctions on limiting the government's actions.  

It's time the NYT begin to report objectively on conditions in Venezuela and advocate editorially for a relaxation, if not a removal of economic sanctions during the pandemic."

And when companies disappear (or become nationalized), when entrepreneurs are forced to flee, the economy collapses, and citizens are plunged into mass poverty, Socialists turn to brute force to impose their policies—in this case, the military. 

All we need do to see how Democrats will perform if they achieve unfettered Federal power, is to look at how they already perform in the areas they control.   Blue cities and states—mired in debt, infested with COVID, plagued with drugs, riots, homelessness, crime and violence—with the worst record for income inequality anywhere.  

Yeah...no thanks."

2020-08-19 17:09,"So, the US has been strangling the Venezuelan economy with sanctions, stealing oil (just the other day, the US seized oil from an Iranian ship headed to Venezuela), practically stole CITGO, had Great Britain hold back $1 billion of Venezuela's own money, has attempted several coups under the guise of ""humanitarian aid"", is training para-militaries in Colombia, tried to install Juan Guaido as ""president"" (imagine donald trump installing a president in any  other nation - scary enough to curl your hair), and, yet, Venezuela and Maduro are evil. Approx 40,000 have died in Venezuela as a result of US sanctions.

Many governments are using similar border controls, curfews, quarantines, etc., some with good effect, some not. Venezuela is a desperately poor country, with an ineffective government.

So much for economic and political sanctions while this regime is systematically  annihilating  its own people, consolidating their power, and threatening the whole region simultaneously.  For how long do you expect to negotiate -pacifically- the outset of the Maduro regime while their people are suffering and dying in the meantime? Yes, COVID is a critical problem, but it is even worse to impose a  lockdown on people who are surrounded by sickness, famine, and complete hopelessness.  Firstly get rid of the Maduro regime and his cronies -immediately-  and then bring the necessary help to stabilize the country so it can effectively cope with not only COVID but with the lack of: electricity, water, food, medicines, health system, and hope."
2020-08-19 17:11,"It’s incredibly sad to see other commenters defend this brutal, authoritarian regime because they’re worried this reflects badly on socialism. It does, of course, but Juan Guaido, the legitimate leader of Venezuela, was *also* a socialist. Nobody should have had any illusions about Maduro, or, for that matter, Chavez.

Don’t bother with the whattaboutism. People deserve human rights, period. It should never be about our personal preferences for economic systems. 

And no, I am not saying we should have invaded Venezuela. I’m saying something that should be very easy for people to agree with: Maduro’s regime is illegitimate, the country would be suffering less under Guaido."

It's not just in Venezuela that the military is deployed.

Here in Bogota also - the same is true.  And newspapers say its true in other parts as well.  Here, military often does policing during tense times.  No one thinks much about it.

Ex FARC areas are reporting more violence including killing of innocents.

We are almost 6 month's into a lockdown -  aislamiento. 

Patience - not to mention money is running dry.  Increased domestic violence against children and more worrisome against women including murders are on the rise.

The economy here is practically destroyed.  Folks even in private sectors are living in 50% of regular salary for past 6 months.  Unemployment is almost 25%.  The economy has taken the worst hit in the last 100 years.

How long can folks put up with this?

There is a tussle between a timid federal president and local mayors.

In many instances, he is now just a bystander.

2020-08-19 17:01,"I spent three years in Venezuela at a time when it still had time to craft itself into a conventionally successful country. With its untold oil and mineral wealth, it had many times the resources necessary to create a fair and just society for all of its citizens. In terms of demographics and wealth, think Norway.

Instead, the oligarchs continued to grip Venezuela, and because the country allowed free and fair elections, it eventually chose as the solution to its predicament the criminal gang headed by Hugo Chávez.

Chávez was a grossly incompetent populist; remarkably, Maduro is even more incompetent. Other than the regime, Cuba is the only real winner in this disaster, having traded doctors and nurses for oil that it could not afford to purchase on world markets.

This not inconsequential failed state is little more than a thousand miles southeast of Miami. At some point, another country will choose to use a supine Venezuela to further its influence. The question for us is this: which country will that be?"

At a time when our own US Government has the worst record on the planet with the COVID-19 pandemic -- so bad that US citizens are legally forbidden by the EU to visit Europe -- it is ludicrous for the Times to criticize Venezuela for attempting to prevent persons from intensely infected neighboring countries to enter Venezuela without meeting quarantine requirements. How does the Times feel about folks from Florida entering NYC without meeting NY quarantine requirements (as Florida earlier restricted NYC folks from entering Florida without meeting Florida's quarantine requirements)? And the worst part of this Times propaganda piece is that it totally ignores the crippling economic measures that our US Government has not only maintained but tightened against Venezuela during the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, knowingly depriving Venezuela of desperately needed food and medical supplies. The Venezuelan government is far from perfect, but it is doing a far better job of protecting its people from the COVID-19 pandemic than is our own US Government."

All but $10 of his medications are paid for by his employer's medical plan because some liberal union workers fought their employers for paid medical insurance - now Joe gets it too.

He prepares his morning breakfast, bacon and eggs. Joe's bacon is safe to eat because some girly-man liberal fought for laws to regulate the meat packing industry.

In the morning shower, Joe reaches for his shampoo. His bottle is properly labeled with each ingredient and its amount in the total contents because some crybaby liberal fought for his right to know what he was putting on his body and how much it contained.

Joe dresses, walks outside and takes a deep breath. The air he breathes is clean because some environmentalist wacko liberal fought for the laws to stop industries from polluting our air.

He walks on the government-provided sidewalk to subway station for his government-subsidized ride to work. It saves him considerable money in parking and transportation fees because some fancy-pants liberal fought for affordable public transportation, which gives everyone the opportunity to be a contributor."

He has a good job with excellent pay, medical benefits, retirement, paid holidays and vacation because some lazy liberal union members fought and died for these working standards.

If Joe is hurt on the job or becomes unemployed, he'll get a worker compensation or unemployment check because some stupid liberal didn't think he should lose his home because of his temporary misfortune.

It is noontime and Joe needs to make a bank deposit so he can pay some bills. Joe's deposit is federally insured by the FSLIC because some godless liberal wanted to protect Joe's money from unscrupulous bankers who ruined the banking system before the Great Depression.

Joe has to pay his Fannie Mae-underwritten mortgage and his below-market federal student loan because some elitist liberal decided that Joe and the government would be better off if he was educated and earned more money over his lifetime.

A mixup in diagnosis/patient papers, the other guy was covid-19  , the police came to cart my brother in law away in the paddy wagon.  The mix up was cleared up but it gave you a real feel for what could happen here.  My sister in law in the USA happened to hear the police action on a cell phone call.

Up until recently, and on/off since then, two nearby places party hearty.  One, a Chavista occupied house, would party continuously Friday PM thru Monday AM.  The other, a hotel for parties, had the same schedule.  Unknown if the hoteliers were Chavista or other.  The Chavista house had 30 families (not people) living in it, so no social distancing there.  Don’t know about the hotel.

There’s tons of rolling roadblocks everywhere.  Traffic stop mask checks.  Infrared thermometer checks and hand sanitizer stops in all stores.  Social distancing floor markers.  Even the occasional walkthrough sanitizer spray cabinet.

His car is among the safest in the world because some America-hating liberal fought for car safety standards to go along with the tax-payer funded roads.

He arrives at his boyhood home. His was the third generation to live in the house financed by Farmers' Home Administration because bankers didn't want to make rural loans.

The house didn't have electricity until some big-government liberal stuck his nose where it didn't belong and demanded rural electrification.

He is happy to see his father, who is now retired. His father lives on Social Security and a union pension because some wine-drinking, cheese-eating liberal made sure he could take care of himself so Joe wouldn't have to.

Joe gets back in his car for the ride home, and turns on a radio talk show. The radio host keeps saying that liberals are bad and conservatives are good. 

He doesn't mention that the beloved Republicans have fought against every protection and benefit Joe enjoys throughout his day.

Guaido was chased out of the country by Maduro's henchmen while Maduro took over the government and the judiciary. See any similarity to Trump?

As someone with a Rheumatologic autoimmune disease,  I’ve been very alert to the research and experiences about folks in my cohort, who have potentially more severe experience with COVID 19 - more frequency of hospitalization, for example.  And yet, I am also reading research that seems to indicate that those of us in the class of treatment I am taking - biologics - are less likely to experience cytokine storms if infected. Keep the articles coming!"
2020-08-11 15:02,"None of this is surprising to patients suffering from autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases. We've been the guinea pigs for many of  these immunomodulatory drugs for decades now. Many of the drugs are simply miraculous, but it's often a long trial-and-error process to find the one drug or combination of drugs that works just right for you. Two patients with exactly the same disease and clinical presentation will respond differently to the same drug. Why? There's likely a genetic explanation, I think, just as there's likely a genetic explanation for why COVID-19 causes no symptoms in some patients and death in others. We already know -- have known for a long time -- that some haplotypes correlated with autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases are also protective against viral infections. HLA-B27, for example, is linked to a plethora of autoinflammatory diseases (ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis) but protects against influenza, Epstein-Barr, and HIV."

But I sensed my gift in ""science"" was actually the hands on ""art"" of tinkering to find a solution as is described in this article, so instead I went into special education. It was by working in oversized, urban,  special ed classrooms, that I developed several innovative teaching techniques in both early childhood reading and math. 

Eventually, I did earn a doctorate in Curriculum and Instruction, and demonstrated the effectiveness of the methods in small scale studies, but never got to the large scale study stage of phase three. So i was relegated back to tinkering in a smaller, private school, urban classroom. 

Hopefully, the field of medicine can keep both types of researchers working together and not allow their intrafield ""discussions"" over successes and failures to be overly politicized for fame, glory, and money--as seems to be the case of  Putin stealing the today's banner headline in the New York Times, and Trump angling to do the same with an early October surprise vaccine based on incomplete and unpeer reviewed results."

Not an instantaneous process. If several cells die near a living cell the osmotic dynamic may so draw water out of the good cell that it dies. This can become a chain reaction self-sustaining process once started by any initiating cause: you hit your finger with a hammer, your cancer cells are killed by treatment, or mass covid in a particular spot starts it. Circulatory removal systems can clog and slow particularly those driven by muscle and joint movement. Once in the heart driven blood stream, too much debris can overwhelm the capacity of organs to metabolize and eliminate. So in this theory it is a time and numbers game.

The notion of boosting our immune systems to help fight off infections made perfect sense and appeared to be safe.  So my wife and I recently got vaccinated for DPT and pneumococcal pneumonia.
But after reading this piece I wonder if we've put our lives in even greater jeopardy.
Does science have anything at all that can be done to improve the probabilities of reducing COVID-19 symptoms?

After about 10 days I felt better again.

 It demonstrates how the scientific process really works, in a world where we almost all are used to the results of science without living through the messy details of getting there. We often take for granted (excepting vaccine deniers & the like), that doctors know what to do or at least what not to do. But seldom do we see on such a scale, the confused & confusing process of seeking the answer, making mistakes, reaching false conclusions, & self-correcting.

2020-08-11 16:40,"Fascinating study.  
The fact that adults mount such a strong immune response to the Covid-19 infections and causes them to have a cytokine storm is why they say that children aren't bothered by the disease as much. It's not that they don't contract the disease: their immune systems are not as strong so they don't develop the strong and detrimental immune response to the disease.
So, from what I read, it's not so much the disease itself but the body's response to the disease that is the problem."

2020-08-11 21:10,"One promising avenue of research in the quest to find some way to stop the human body from harming itself through autoimmunity has come in from the neurologists. Coincidentally, in lab rats, disabling both vagus nerves at the  cervical level quickly causes the lungs of the rats to fill up with inflammatory fluid leading very rapidly to death. The autonomic nervous system has checks and balance. The sympathetic system is the ""fight or flight"" one. The parasympathetic is the ""rest and digest your food"" one. The parasympathetic also serves to check the sympathetic which, unopposed can over-react to perceived threats. Since COVID is well known to affect the olfactory nerve, another cranial nerve, it is possible that it could affect other cranial nerves--such as the vagus. If doctors could determine in advance which seemingly mildly affected COVID cases are showing signs of vagus nerve impairment they might be able to start immune modulators before symptoms get out of hand."

Add the cytokine storm issue and one sees that the plethora of competing funded vaccine initiatives aimed singularly at the spike protein is a media circus, but not really a useful direction, different immunizing vehicles (mRNA/carrier viruses) notwithstanding. Except in a money-intoxicated society that ignores root causes like overpopulation/ecocide/climate change until a crisis,  when it reacts with panicked knee-jerks.

Recommend the ""Useful Idiots"" interview w/Dr. Robert Gallo, who points out the need for a diversity of vaccine & therapeutic approaches against a pathogen against whose close relatives (e.g., SARS) vaccine development has generally been a failure; Gallo also emphasizes that most of us recover from viral infections long before the 10-day to 2-week latency necessary for the appearance of specific antibodies; in other words the role of our innate (nonspecific) immune systems and cytokines like the interferons."

2020-08-11 21:59,"""Many Covid-19 patients may be dying from their immune response to the virus, not from the virus itself."" 

This has to be one of the silliest statements I've ever seen in the NYT.

Of course the virus is killing people.  Virtually every study on COVID-19 patients shows that as disease severity increases, the number of Lymphocytes falls below minimum levels.  They've even mapped this out by Lymphocyte subset (CD3, CD4, CD8.)

In other words, COVID-19 is killing the adaptive immune system (Lymphocytes) and you have virtually no killer T-cells to kill the virus. It's not clear whether the virus is directly infecting Lymphocytes (there's peer-reviewed research that show this can happen.) Or whether, as discussed in other NYT articles, it's a misfiring of the immune system (i.e. the innate immune system is adversely impacting the adaptive immune system and shutting it down.)

So you have a dysregulated/dysfunctional immune system trying to stop a virus with no killer T-cells. In its futile efforts to do so, you have a cytokine storm. 

It's certainly true that measures have to be taken to modulate a misfiring immune system. 

But seen in a holistic sense, the original problem is not an ""overactive immune system.""  It's an immune system that is unable to protect itself from the virus.  It's being destroyed by Covid-19, and the virus is infecting every organ in the body.  There's nothing (i.e. killer T-cells) to stop it."

But I digress. Given that time is of the essence, we must stimulate 'our' researchers (including forgotten chemistry-able countries in your report, i.e. Germany!) not only to advance methods for an effective and save vaccine but, meanwhile, medications to possibly reverse the lethal course for far too many (antibody protection with plasma, Steroids to modulate an excessive reaction from our own immune system, and selective medications proven to help in selective cases...provided they are used early enough).

A close friend of mine, Dr. Vallo Benjamin, the father of modern cervical surgery, besides discussing neurology, spinal cords, stenosis, glioses, brain transmitters (the latter is a big one because studies overlook some major factors so they get a CL 40), discussed what a waste med.'l sch. was vs. research.

Back in May/June, my (fantastic) rheumatologist discussed the emerging evidence and scientific hypotheses regarding COVID-19 with me. I’m on an anti-inflammatory drug to control my over-reactive immune system so who knows, I might be better protected (instead of more vulnerable) against a COVID-19 infection. But as my rheumatologist told me, let’s not run the experiment. Following his guidance, I have isolated myself, just in case."

I'm sending it to family in case I get Covid.  One major problem with the article, though: the study linking hormones to poor outcomes in women was so deeply flawed, it's questionable whether it has any merit.  It's been written about and is widely known that this is the case - I was surprised to see it referenced here. I hope the author will turn his attention to that next, because more people need to know about it.  Too many women are suffering needlessly because of this very faulty study."

As flu-ridden soldiers returned home from WW I, crowds and parades welcomed their return--and caused a spike in flu cases during the summer of 1919.

Manipulating cellular metabolism may provide a promising therapeutic intervention in autoimmune diseases

Date:

Source:
    University of Alabama at Birmingham
Summary:
    Preclinical research shows a pivotal role for cellular metabolism to regulate the fate decision of naïve CD4 T cells as they differentiate into either destructive Th17 cells that mediate chronic inflammation or regulatory Treg T cells, a decision that occurs very early in the activation of CD4 T cells. This opens a possibility that manipulating the cellular metabolism of T cells may provide a therapeutic intervention in chronic autoimmune disorders."

2020-08-14 20:49,"A large part of treating patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections seems to be timing.  Which is a real problem with our lack of testing.  Being to early with immune calming treatments can cause harm.  Not being early enough makes antiviral treatment much less effective, even to the point of not being effective at all.

Doing studies where timing is so important is really hard to do.  So here is my proposal on how to get a handle on the timing.  Test high risk groups daily with the high speed testing that have been FDA approved on an emergency bases.  The ID Now test and a couple of antigen tests.  This will give us a much better idea of when the person was infected and therefore what treatments to try."

Almost all patients respond  after 3 days and some almost immediately. The monoclonal antibody is call Leronlimab. There are no Severe Adverse Effects. It has cured patients on ECMO machines."

2020-08-15 22:49,Glad the article AT LEAST mentioned Leronlimab. You should probably research the success of the monoclonal drug. So far excellent results that  are statistically significant in mild to moderate patients- a population that big pharma failed. CytoDyn will probably get FDA approval for this group.

2020-08-16 3:34,"Sorry, )young people in cases of flue and in yjr 1918-1920 flue epidemic was that it is exactly the cytokine storms (over reaction of the immune system) that is the actual cause of death.  This has been known more or less since even before June.  and the big question seems to be when to administer steroids.  What I realize about Covid is not only that it is often fatal but that people are sick for quite awhile-- requiring lots of care-- turning every two hours - has been reported if they are prone on the ventilator.  

Can we get a grip on treatment of severe cases soonish?   Of course, the big question is how will life be permanently changed or will it be permanently changed.. UNiversal Single Payer Medical Care would be a nice change; also reconfiguration of police practices-- I am a litttle tired of death by cop and also closed records for individual police misconduct.

Thank you for taking the time to write about this. In your article, you mentioned one, Leronlimab, that stuck out for me. re you able to provide more information on their work? Also, government officials should pay attention to these smaller candidates as big pharma would not hesitate to keep a potential lifesaving treatment from being utilized to save lives resulting from covid 19."

This novel virus confuses the immune system in vulnerable subpopulations whom can be identified early and treated expectantly by physicians who have gained experience and are smart enough to think mechanistically and who are intellectually curious. 

While the cost is nearly galactic, the advances in clinical and translational medicine will be nearly as remarkable in the coming years."
2020-08-16 15:02,"What we are forced to learn in the treatment of Covid will lead to advances in the treatment of many other diseases that involve the immune system. Note that I am taking a drug which is off-label for my specific cancer, and it is reducing my tumors substantially. It is likely that this treatment is saving my life. I believe that in times like this, real time gathering of information that is short of controlled clinical trials provides hypothesis to test in controlled clinical trials. The reason that the rate of dying from covid is declining is tied to non-controlled clinical trials. Some level of experimentation is helpful, and should not simply be condemned by other, more conservative members of the medical community."
2020-08-16 16:57,"Leronlimab has had superb safety and statistically significant outcomes for efficacy in Phase II COVID-19 trials. A great advantage offered by this this drug is that it is administered through an injection as opposed to IV, which greatly reduces the infrastructure to support its administration. Given its prior safety record with HIV testing, which has been superb as well, it would be very reasonable to expect this drug to be given Emergency Use Authorization very shortly."

Researchers are looking at every treatment and vaccine, and new drug developments are, of course, very promising. 

In this article, I didn't see the study from Harvard University for repurposing FDA approved drugs for ARDS treatment. ARDS, or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, is among the deadliest side effects of the Cytokine Storm. 

Harvard researchers found that ""Fostamatinib (R788), an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia as a repurposing candidate."" Fostamatinib or ""Tavalisse"" comes from Rigel Pharmaceuticals and has been FDA approved since 2018, and EMA approved as of 2020. 

There is an unused SYK inhibitor sitting around right now. Tavalisse is in hospital pharmacies TODAY.

Dr Bruce Patterson has very elegantly described the cascade of this cytokine storm and has proposed that this is a rantes disease. He also proposed that Leronlimab can very effectively calm the cytokine storm in as early as 3 days. There has been a submission to the FDA for EUA this past week.

Trials with Leronlimab have been ongoing since March, first at Montefiore Hospital and later throughout the country. Dr Bruce Patterson has eloquently discovered the cytokine pathway as a Rantes disease and proposed Leronlimab as an effective blockade to the devastating effects resulting in morbidly and mortality.

2020-08-17 19:32,"I read your article with great interest as I was involved in the discovery of anakinra (human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IL-1ra) back in the late 80's and have been following the application of cytokine inhibitors in treating COVID-19. It is exciting to see the potential of anakinra in this indication. Anakinra is different than some of the other cytokine inhibitors evaluated, which are generally monoclonal antibodies that bind to the specific cytokine and block their activity. Anakinra is a recombinant form of the naturally occurring human IL-1 receptor antagonist. It blocks to activity of IL-1 by binding to the IL-1 receptor, preventing IL-1 binding and activation of the subsequent inflammatory cascade. The expression of both IL-1 and IL-1ra are often observed in inflammatory processes and it is perhaps an imbalance in expression, where excess IL-1 is induced to a level that can no longer be modulated by IL-1ra, that kicks off this systemic inflammatory syndrome. So early intervention with anakinra makes sense and hopefully further studies will confirm the benefit. We all look forward to discovery of treatments that will tame this beast."

The Cherokee people started their Trail of Tears from places including this area when forced to leave by Andrew Jackson's refusal to enforce the Supreme Court's decision to protect them from eviction of their land. 

The times have changed, but the insistence by a few that they have the individual right to threaten the life and livelihood of others persists. In Cherokee County. In non-masking America. Do we have enough better angels to get through this time?"

This fractious fracturing is exactly what has been happening to society, as we all know all too well. The pandemic introduces another pair of elements: serious disease or death. So in this case, if you insist on your ideas about education despite the facts, you might kill yourself or somebody you love or perhaps merely the grandparent of a child who is in class with your own child. Easy as pie. So you have to leave your passion at the door and face the facts. Of course school opening is desirable,so children can have their education and lives and their parents can get on with their own lives, especially work. Of course there is an election that partly hinges on reopening. But the pandemic is requiring a sterner discipline than we are accustomed to. And that is a very good thing. The entire thrust of contemporary civilization is toward satisfaction, a big ego operation all 'round. And now something comes along and tells us: careful, satisfaction can also be fatal.

Add students who, for whatever reason, cannot learn online. This gives districts a chance to get protocols and procedures right and make sure they have enough PPE.

If that goes well add more students and transition to full in-class learning when health conditions permit. It is a shame that education has become a class system where some workers, such as custodians, principals, and others are placed at a higher risk to ensure teachers have a lower risk. Districts need to ensure that all staff have the safest possible working conditions. 

There are no guarantees that the workplace is safe. This is not just COVID-related. Nobody knows when schools will be as safe as they will be prior to COVID. For now, they need to ensure students and staff follow all safety guidelines with no room for flexibility based on personal opinions."

Also, many people in the population are immunized or have some protection from previous exposure to the influenza virus. 

The data shows that shows the high school age and above also can spread the virus. 

Under these circumstances it is not wise to reopen schools normally. This will make it extremely hard for working parents and the children, whose education will suffer, but we will have to endure until a vaccine is available."

However, I'm less sympathetic with parents driven by political motivations, by religious zeal, and by a lack of concern for those adults and children whose health is compromised.

With individual freedom far outweighing any social responsibility, even the simple act of requiring masks to be worn is causing thousands to die -- with the 'president' of our country setting the ethical tone for everyone else. 

There is no easy solution for schools reopening, but there are better, more creative ones than many districts and states are imposing. Parents and teachers all need multiple options, with employers needing to give employees far more latitude, and the government much more aid -- but that's idealistic in these close-minded, mostly Republican-leaning times.

I only hope that the election proves an occasion for a drift toward common sense, reason, and greater fairness -- and even a chance to establish the possibility that wearing a mask to protect a child and teacher at school is as reasonable as learning 2+2."

These buildings were designed to operate at a certain density, with recirculating, energy saving air systems. Even though we have technologies, systems, and risk assessments that can mitigate the spread, there has been almost zero investment in modifying buildings to operate safely during the pandemic. Instead, we’ve spent trillions of dollars to fund a stock market bubble in the name of Trump’s re-election, rather than keeping our children safe.


The State of Georgia has bought into the politicization of the pandemic, led by a monumentally incompetent governor whose hubris in the face of the obvious borders on criminal.

Would that mother who talked about God’s plan quietly accept it if her child was killed in a school shooting?  Because that would, by her logic, be part of God’s plan to call her child home. If the school did not have an adequate plan and policy on school shootings, would she still feel that it was all in God’s plan for her child to die and so the school was blameless?

There is a viral pandemic raging across the Nation and world.  It is not controllable at this time.  It is simply a force of nature that is presently unstoppable.

Yet the people in this school district, and throughout society, act as if dealing with a force of nature is a matter of politics.  As such, those who wield the greater political power in any particular jurisdiction --  be it state, city or school district --  will force their will on everyone else, No matter how vulnerable any one individual may be to succumbing to a force of nature.

Clearly, the information and statistics we have on this pandemic is not believable for them. Won't be long before a child endures a serious illness or after affects of this virus or even death that there will be outrage and lawsuits. And good luck with the costs of the medical care for them. Or if there is room in the hospital for them. In my county, beds are maxed out. And a local college returns to classes today in spite of it.

Children are asymptomatic carriers and they must be tested prior to school, and often while in school. This is basic. There must social distancing and rigorous protective measures in place all the time, without ""breaks in technique"". Masks are basic. This is not a time for asking whether ""Johnny will like them"" because disease transmission can be deadly. Teachers must be tested, and often. They must have PPE available, and plenty of protected spaces in which to work. Parents must think ""We, rather than ME"". Bathrooms must be cleaned after each use. There needs to be a nurse in every school, with a sick room. Custodians must be plentiful. The same goes for bus transportation. It seems like almost none of this is being done, even by expensive private schools. Therefore, school opening will increase the spread, and make some children, teachers and ancillary staff very sick. How about using the money spent on one Military Jet, and funnel those funds to schools."

Yes. It is compelling to read with horror about the proponents of pandemic misinformation, but it gives them a voice that they don’t deserve!

Teachers in northern states are often under just as much pressure to “reopen,” regardless of the risks to the safety of their students, their families and themselves.

The difference is that unionized teachers can effectively resist. Chicago Public Schools was forced to go fully remote when faced with a teacher strike. Unlike in the “god fearing” South, the uneducated and selfish don’t get to make all the decisions without any meaningful pushback or resistance. 

Unionized teachers also make more money, have better working conditions and more political clout. No wonder they are a constant target of hated, vitriol and political attacks from the right. They are an impediment to its agenda of furthering the wealth and power of the elite at the expense of everyone else.

2020-08-12 12:51,"Wow. Human beings are governed by a number of facilities, from the chatter in our minds to our emotions, physical sensations, and states of consciousness. We are a bundle of impulses. Science has shown that the chatter in our minds has two functions: one, to keep up a running narrative about ""who we are"" and two, to stop us from acting upon our very worst impulses. The Buddhist teacher Josh Korda calls this ""free won't."" To those so-called Christian ladies: if you believe that God has a plan, you also believe that God gave you the ability to stop yourself from doing stupid things that will harm you and other people. You could drive 150 mph down the freeway, but you don't. You could try jumping off a tall building to see if you fly, but you don't do that, either. Why are you not using that facility to prevent yourself from engaging in harmful, peer-pressure induced, politically motivated behavior? Politicians and rich people who don't want to lose money in this economy have convinced you that it is a good idea to resist taking care of yourself and your children, and that you should just surrender all of your ability to regulate your own safety to someone else's right-wing political agenda. That is the opposite of exercising ""free will."" You are being coerced by a brand of religious-based politics to behave in ways that endanger yourself, your children, and the community around you. Sad and horrifying at the same time."

It's one thing to let citizens over the age of 60 suffer and die; it's a whole other thing to think children must suffer and die.

Superintendents are political animals---they must be--they serve at the whim of seven board members. What is the political upside to reopening schools? You cannot work in schools for long and not realize that the organizational design and instructional delivery systems are fertile places for the spread of an airborne virus. It is inevitable that opening in-person schooling--especially in states with high number of tested cases---will end badly. Which, in turn, will drive boards to look for a scapegoat---and, in schools, that buck will stop in the Superintendent's office."

The second thing is that, given this pandemic, many of this same group seem more concerned with schools to function as daycare centers than about education, or the health of their children.  The young look to adults for guidance, and it's clear that they're not getting it from home. How can a parent claim to love their children, while at the same time fight to put them at risk?  The level of selfishness and self-deception is  impossible to justify, not matter how you rationalize it.."
2020-08-12 13:17,"Public schools, unlike any other institution in society, are embedded in the community.  Teachers, students and staff probably live on every residential street within a school's district.

If Covid-19 runs rampant in a school, when teachers, students and staff go home, they will spread it throughout the community.  No one would be safe. 

What schools need to do is forget the 2020/21 school year.  Take a Gap Year and let the students pick up where they left off in the 2021/22 school year, hopefully after a vaccine is developed.

Ten years from now, it will not matter that some graduated when 19 instead of 18.  It will not matter that seven-year-old students began 1st grade, instead of doing it when six.
There would even be some educational benefits.  For example, students born early in the year tend to do better than students born later in the year.  There is nothing different in these two groups except age and maturity.  Having students take a gap year would provide the time to mature and they should be better prepared to handle the material expected of them.
One word of caution, school employees are a vital part of the state’s economy, during this gap year, they would need to be paid or it would probably guarantee a recession.  Then too, if they were laid off, by the time school reopened for the 2021/22 school year, they may have moved on and be hard to replace."

It seems that areas with low infection rates are the ones who ""open up"" just about everything as if asymptomatic infection does not exist. They have now made their schools into super spreaders.
When ""leaders"" like Trump, Kemp and Ms. Martin encourage wreckless behavior and traffic in misinformation some people behave accordingly because they trust them. How many people have to get sick and possibly die before people choose to trust public health experts? Just because they made some missteps early on because they did not yet know enough about the virus doesn't mean they can't be trusted now. NIH, CDC, the Surgeon General and Dr. Birx have had consistent messaging for more than three months as have most local public health leaders. Trump disparaging them does not mean they can't be trusted.

How many schools are open and how many have had outbreaks?  What is the percentage?  We read about 56 tested positive - how many with symptoms, how many hospitalized.  If only 56 tested positive, why the panic headline that 900 are quarantined?  

As we open schools, there will be some that have outbreaks. It's good to read that they are being taken seriously.  But the story is lacking in details and impact, and we need to revisit it in a few weeks to see how many totally got sick, how many got hospitalized, etc.  No one should expect each and every school to be 100% healthy for the entire school year across the entire country.  It's not going to happen.

2020-08-12 14:02,"I agree that schools shouldn't be reopening in communities that are having a large outbreak. However, the NYT is missing several key things here.

1. We need a threshold at which schools need to open/close. There can be multiple metrics -- mainly, number of positive cases over a one or two week period and test positivity rate (because if you're not able to test enough, you shouldn't be open).

2. No matter how low the case numbers get in your community, at some point *someone* in a school is going to test positive. I mean, in a community with a really low positive rate of, say 0.5% of your community has it, then in a school with 1,000 students and faculty, 5 people are likely to be positive. It doesn't even mean they got it at school. 

We need to remain calm when this happens and make science-based decisions about how best to proceed. Like, can you close the classroom where someone tested positive, quarantine teacher and students for 2 weeks, and then reopen to everyone who has a negative COVID test? There is no reason to panic and close the entire school.

3. We need to have a serious conversation about whether or not schools are essential. We seem to think that any positive cases in schools is a catastrophe. And yet, we are seeing positive cases -- and even deaths -- in other essential workers, like grocery store workers, people working in the food supply chain, transit workers, etc. These people generally make far less money than teachers, and with far fewer benefits."

2020-08-12 13:51,"When I was doing the research for my masters and doctoral research on traditional women folk healers ('curanderas') in Latin America, I read reams of documents from the pre-national period in several countries--which were then still part of New Spain.  

Two particularly rich sources of information about women's social efficacy, the ultimate object of my analysis, were trials conducted by the Spanish Inquisition in the so-called New World, and the journals of Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries, as well as those kept by the Spanish King's personal physician.

The mindset of these religious-political authorities was that they needed to understand the linkages between the etiology of various diseases and the cures that Spanish curanderas and their Native American counterparts prescribed, and the idolatrous pantheon lurking behind them. 

What jumps out at me in reading the remarks of parents in 21st Century Georgia is the degree to which they intransigently reject empirical evidence of the deadly results of their actions.  One famous New Spanish investigator nearly killed himself on more than one occasion, because he attempted to use an herbal remedy in a manner inconsistent with the experience of his charges--but he learned the lesson, recorded it as a warning for others, and committed to further study.  

Pointing to God's plan to vindicate oneself for willfully sickening children and their grandparents is not religious devotion; it's irresponsible and just plain wrong."

2020-08-12 14:01,"As a 60 year old teacher, I am thanking God right now that I am not in Georgia. The mother who has five children going maskless astonished me. It reminded me of a cartoon I saw recently where three beekeepers are gathered around the hives. Two are protected with the usual garb of beekeepers and the third has bees clustered all around his head. The first is saying to the second, “I told him he should wear the protective gear but he told me that he had a right to go without“. Whatever. The worst part is that it puts other people at risk, unlike the beekeepers in the cartoon."

Freedom of religion is protected by the written US Constitution and parents have long enjoyed and usually fulfilled the unwritten responsibility for their children's health, safety, welfare, thoughts and emotions.

By law and collective wisdom responsibility is handed to school systems for the children's care away from home and parental supervision. Home schooling is an established alternative, and remote learning has been introduced as a hybrid.

Yet to be formulated is how to protect children when they are forced to attend a dangerous environment on the trust of prayer and political persuasion. But even this is not unprecedented in societies where danger is commonplace from jobs, commerce, travel, recreation, sports, rallies, parties, and yes, especially education where exposure to ideas can shatter comforting faith and undermine strict obedience.

Though tragedy of Covid and related hasty reopening is rife with extremist responses, this should not mean the children are to be weaponized in a political and social war. Those who place the kids at risk, whether parents or politicians, should get off their high horses and think first about school health and safety, suspend forced attendance, join in the search for ways to school with least risk to the innocent."

I'm not a particularly rich individual, worked for a living my entire life, but I always insured I had a year's income buffer before establishing a family and people depended upon my income.  

The public interest outweighs Ms Martin's failure to plan (her economic failure does not provide her new liberties).  Involving god in this decision merely cheapens all religions and ultimately the need for religious freedoms.   Moreover, even without checking my copy on the constitution I'm pretty confident there is no freedom to defy public health measures within."

But it is not like the virus has signed a treaty, you know.  Given the chance, it will spread, according to the best information we have available now.   Deprive it of that chance.

As a result, here we are, in a position where in-person school is a terrible idea (unlike in other nations with competent leadership that suppressed the virus).

How is it supposedly 'liberal' New York, leaves locally elected governments charged with decisions on how best to protect their residents, where as Georgia seem more than willing to seize control over local elected officials decisions? This is not taking power from appointed officials, it is taking power from elected officials, as if states like this have taken local residents vote from them. Isn't this what 'liberal' means? Liberal with the governments power.

Is this not the same thing California is doing? The reality of both: California is using its obligations under the 10th amendment, to protect it's citizen's, just as it does with mandatory school vaccines. How did we arrive at a proud southern state like Georgia, now being 100% all in with government intrusions and in love with the Federal Government? 

What is left to come? Are we looking at Georgia ordering local municipalities to make mandatory school vaccines optional? Are these states planning to ban dress codes under freedom and choice?  Of course not, so how are masks in school about freedom and choice, but vaccines are about public safety and the liability of our cities and counties?

Keep all schools closed nation-wide until we have a better grip on this. Remote learning for another few months isn’t going to ruin any child’s social or educational standing in the long run. In fact, it will be more beneficial since teachers have had a chance to improve what they had to crash learn. Plus, the children won’t be mentally stressed about getting a potentially deadly virus, bringing home a potentially deadly virus, or being the one kid that causes a whole school to shut down because a deadly virus has infiltrated it.

I think that it's wrong to insist on high risk activities that have little society benefits, like large indoor parties. But it's equally wrong to say that any risk to yourself is unacceptable, since our basic needs demand that some people are put at risk, and in the course of normal economic life we always accept a level of risk to keep things going.

As a society we need to choose which activities to pursue and which to put on hold based on what's in greatest common good. Risks, costs and benefits are unequally distributed, so we must help out the people who are hit hardest and protect those who are most vulnerable. If at all possible, let's extend this protection to the social-emotional development needs of children as well as to the physical needs of the elderly."

Once they become infected,  scholastic learning, either in-person or online, stops.

- The virus can spread across air ventilation systems and stay active in the air for hours on end

- Masks only offer a limited amount of protection because the virus itself is airborne, not just the aerosols it clings to during breathing, sneezing, coughing

I believe it was Dr. Peter Holtz (sp?) who said (paraphrasing): ""It's just like the flu, only it kills"".

That's really great!

Now, gals and guys, what are we going to do? I already quit my job in order to be as far away from other humans as possible.

We can find others ways of helping our kids learn. And we can find childcare that doesn't risk the lives of children or families (and teachers). 
One way is to form educational family co-ops -- a small group of neighborhood families get together and share the responsibilities of teaching their kids. Those families can agree on the standard of pandemic precautions that they are all willing to take, forming what is now has become known as pandemic pods.
Such co-cops can decide on educational goals, wether they should hire a teacher part time, where the ""school"" will be held and for how long. This is doable! And safe. Here is more info on how to get started AND free curriculum: supermarketscience.com"

We try and protect our children from child abuse, neglect, malnutrition and drug abuse. We have dress codes for schools, cell phone rules for schools, attendance rules and sanctions for tardiness.  

We don't equivocate about the level of child abuse and designate some behavior as ""not severe"" or ""mildly abusive""...or ""not harmful"".  As adults we intervene. We investigate and protect the children based on the belief that any abuse is unacceptable.  When we see high rates of malnutrition in schools we invoke programs to feed the kids so they can not be starving while they try and focus on school work. 

So, why wouldn't we protect them as aggressively as possible from the virus? Especially where it isn't contained, and not likely to be contained?

If Donald Trump had taken this whole issue seriously in January and February when we all saw that is was coming this way and told everyone to wear masks and stay home - we would not be having our children used as experiments along with teachers who care for them.

Moreover, how do they know that it is not ""God's will"" that they wear the mask?  One might think that the empirical evidence of booming infections and quarantines might challenge her logic, but it won't.  In the end, I ultimately agree with Ms. Morrison that her kids need school.

Look at Europe and South Korea.

However, Georgia just showed us how NOT to do it. That is insane."
2020-08-12 16:58,"Evidence is emerging that masks are prophylactic, but not perfect protection against aerosol transmission. They are great for short term exposure, such as a visit to the grocery store. But, evidence suggests that being in a classroom for 5 hours with a COVID transmitting individual, even if everyone is wearing face masks, could result in multiple cases. Similarly, due to long exposure, grocery store clerks might get sick even if wearing a mask and serving only mask-wearing customers. Masks reduce transmission, but do not completely stop small amounts of virus from escaping and entering. Over time, this can lead to an infectious dose. This is why US schools cannot safely open in their current configuration. 

The only guaranteed protection is social distancing.  Also, rapid and accurate testing is crucial, and paid sick leave and guaranteed health care are life-savers. With none of these, the US is failing to control this disease. We have sacrificed the education of our children for easy answers and fun trips to restaurants."

Otherwise, where schools in other countries have succeeded in being reopened relied more on the general population keeping the virus at bay, thus reducing the likelihood of infection in classrooms (plus all the protective measures), which is clearly not the case for most states in the US."

""Ms. Morrison said she and her husband do not wear masks either. 'I feel like before we’re even born, God has a plan for when he’s going to take us to heaven,' she said. 'There’s nothing we can do to stop it.'”

This reflects a very specific religious belief among some Protestant Christians, especially evangelicals and conservatives,  which seems to be related to predestination. (I heard similar sentiments voiced by my late mother-in-law, a devout Catholic, but overall the Roman Catholic Church doesn't seem to embrace predestination). It seems as if public policy decisions on this matter, that public officials make about opening public facilities like schools to meet public obligations like education, are being driven by this particular religious belief.

Covid-19 is not something to trifle with. It is far more serious than a head cold, also a corona virus, for which no vaccine is possible due to its high rate of mutation. This virus damages the heart. In a recent study of 100 recovered patients in Germany, whose average age is 49, 78 had heart damage similar to a heart attach as shown in an MRI.  <a href=""https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/27/covid19-concerns-about-lasting-heart-damage"" target=""_blank"">https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/27/covid19-concerns-about-lasting-heart-damage</a>/

Even those who recover may have long lasting or permanent impairment. Those in thrall to the Trump cult are seemingly incapable of acting rationally to protect their own well being or that of their children. As is often the case with a cult, the members reinforce each others fantastical beliefs and deny reality. One is reminded of the members of the ""Heaven's Gate"" cult, a group of 39 members, who committed mass suicide in 1997 as the comet Hale-Bopp approached.

You don't need to understand everything about a car to know how to drive one. Most of us know that if you are behind the wheel of a speeding car that is approaching a crowd, you can step on the brake and prevent the car from injuring and killing the people in the crowd.
Try not to hurt other people. Wear a mask. This is a simple concept, people. We have many more complex challenges to cope with than this. If basic disease transmission prevention is too hard a task for you, please get out of the way of the rest of us - those who care about people and see the long list of *actual* challenges ahead."
2020-08-12 17:32,"Before I ask my questions, I’m all in for wearing masks and not opening schools until this whole thing is under control. 

I’m confused. How does this all get started? Why are the kids getting tested? For example, the 2nd grader that tested positive. Did he have symptoms? Or is it a situation where all the students and teachers are getting tested routinely? 

So, if a child tests positive, all his classmates and teachers get tested? How about any children he may have passed in the hall? Are the kids getting to school by school bus? Then everyone on the bus including the driver gets tested? Who is doing the testing? How are they getting the results back so quickly? 

So, when a child tests positive, he, his classmates, teacher and his family as well as the families of his classmates and teacher and any co-workers all quarantine for 14 days? That’s a lot of people. 

What a mess."

Would she drive drunk with her children in the car?  She allows one child to wear a mask out of respect for the teacher with a health condition; what about the the other teachers, no respect for them?

Now they can together rent a school space or church space or take turns hosting their pod of kids in their homes, and of course pay for a child minder/s....NOT a teacher. As for financing it, perhaps DeVos can take a bit from money being siphoned to private schools and share it with parents private pods.

Meanwhile this article presents reopening as a black-and-white binary: a free for all with no regard for safety that is doomed to fail, OR safely virtual. But even here down south there's a wealth of diversity of reopening plans as well as parent response. Not everyone who is sending their child to school is doing so with reckless abandon, and not every superintendent is blind to the benefits of masks, barriers, social distancing, etc. For parents in our area this is a fraught choice. We are choosing between our children's safety and their education-- easily the two most important things in our worlds.  As much as I appreciate the pro-mask and pro-safety sentiment I find the demonization of parents and administrators to be unhelpful.

We also need to lower the age limit for a sibling to be granted guardianship of another sibling. If siblings are adults at 18 then there is no reason that they cannot become the guardian of their sibling(s) if they have the maturity and desire to do so. A strong safety net would provide public housing and cash and food assistance in a situation like this. Why give this money to a foster parent when, if the sibling is willing and over 18, it can be given to them to support their brother/sister?

Hopefully more can be done to let young people fend for themselves, with mentoring by loving, caring adults from the side line."
2020-08-13 16:13,"Please let us know, how can we help these children and their adult guardians? I will volunteer, I will send money, please would the author or editors advise on how to directly help these children and their guardians?

Their circumstances, their situation is what we need political leadership to deal with. This is where our current leadership is failing us. Our success as a society should be judged on how well these brave young adults succeed in supporting themselves and their siblings. They all need the love and support of their community."
2020-08-13 16:17,"I lay these and the majority of US covid deaths at the feet of the Republican administration and party. Aside from the recent horrors of the Trump administration, 40 years of Republican lead gutting of social services and lower taxes for the wealthy has brought about unneeded suffering in the richest nation on earth.  Sincerely hoping that all this greed and abdication of basic human rights and values brings about radical systemic and social change."
2020-08-13 16:21,"Children do not process death of a parent in the same way as adults process the death of a parent, spouse or significant other. They need special care to help them deal with what happened and be able to move on. To be tossed into the foster care system is the worse thing that can happen."
2020-08-13 16:22,I am heartbroken. These children deserve so much more support from our government! Taxing the rich would help pay for it Cuomo
2020-08-13 16:30,"Under normal circumstances the foster care system is not just a failure, it's the result of a selfish society that has no cohesive plan to care for its most vulnerable citizens.
In NYC 18 year olds age out of foster care with no place to go, no skills and no help.
The lack of affordable housing for families, safety nets to prevent evictions and the homelessness thst destroys families, compels parents to give up their children  statistically end end back in the system. 
We should stop giving press or be in any way concerned  about whether rich people can afford the $25,000 per child ""learning pods"" for their 5 year olds. 
There are many choices available to the upper classes, who escaped the epidemic to their country or beach homes or were able to buy or already live in their multi million dollar houses on eastern LI and the lower Hudson Valley. 
NYers should  worry about children and teenagers left orphaned by covid, addiction, illness and how we can avoid these kids losing the roof over their heads, give them  the tools to learn and not spend their lives with strangers and at 18 age tossed out with no where to go.
Why can't the city, state  federal government pay their 18 and over siblings or any other relatives  who want and love them, to be their carers?"

May the siblings find love and strength among them."
2020-08-13 16:35,"I was all in until I got the part about planning the trip to Ecuador.
Where is that money coming from?  Might it not be put to better use getting that larger apartment they need?

Besides, are we even allowed into Ecuador these days?

Finally, ashes don't expire. The  brothers might consider growing up, going to/finishing college, and getting enough money to make this important trip.  It's possible that is what their mother would have wanted."
2020-08-13 16:57,"So does anyone here have hard numbers on money?  If the 16 year old goes into foster care, how much does the foster parent get?  And would a 21 year old sibling get the same, or less, or more?  There was some discussion about this, and I'm curious.

And of course, yes, as many here have already said, this is heartbreaking, and a crying shame in a wealthy country to have so little help for these kids.  It's appalling, and I'm ashamed for our country.

Vote Democrat, and then pressure them to do better.  Primary the DINOs, but don't waste money and effort on a primary challenge with no really clear improvement (e.g. Markey vs Kennedy).  If you are well off be willing to have your own taxes go up if the money can go to something actually useful.  And in the meantime donate.  Let's try to be a decent society.  We would all be happier even if those of us who are fairly well off would be slightly poorer."
2020-08-13 17:18,"Tough times! I can’t imagine the grieving part. I hope it would bring them closer and that they would use that energy to fight for a better tomorrow. I once worked 3 jobs while being in school full time. I was alone in the city and had to figure out everything. Of course it helps to have friends around, but I strongly believe that they can make it if they stay informed on what resources they can use to go through this storm. Sending them lots of love from across the Atlantic!"
2020-08-13 15:44,"Pain. Suffering. Families destroyed. Lives destroyed. And almost all of it is as needless as it is senseless.

And I say this without equivocation - Donald Trump and his fellow sadistic, narcissistic sociopaths in the GOP couldn't care less - unless of course you are one of the 1 in 100,000 Americans that constitute their only real clients.

And even then, your suffering is only relevant in so far as it negatively affects their self-serving financial and political fortunes.

And this is not hyperbole - it's a fact."
2020-08-13 15:36,I would love to donate to these young amazing kids who deserve the government’s help to stay together .

2020-08-13 16:45,"Trump, his golf pals, and the rich with their second homes need to pause for a second to consider what’s happening to actual families. The Tryson brothers really need a break. Isn’t there someone in NYC who has multiple homes —a Manhattan apartment and a home in the Hamptons—who could finance a simple apartment for them? Please. There are people out there with more money than God. Do something noble, for crying out loud!"
2020-08-13 15:38,"Dickens would be having a field day in the U.S. today.  Orphans...families torn apart...kids ending up on the street.  What next, work houses for the poor and child labor?  Don't let the GOP know, they'll be building them so fast your head will spin."
2020-08-13 17:12,"So much heartbreak. Much of it avoidable.

We should all be infuriated that so much of the fabric of our society, our communities, and our families, has been destroyed due to the Worst. President. Ever.

First he was lazy and unprepared and inept, but then he was criminally negligent to serve his cunning pursuit to remain in power and above the law. 

He is sacrificing and ruining American lives in order to sow enough chaos to overwhelm the proper functioning of our federal government and rig an election.

Vote Biden/Harris on November 3 to 
Make Donald Indictable Again."
2020-08-13 15:03,It will devastate a child if he or she catches Covid at school and infects a parent who then dies from Covid. No child should be forced to assume such a burden.  Schools should not reopen if there is widespread Covid in the community.
2020-08-13 15:22,"As many posters mentioned earlier.  Schools opening can destroy families economically.  The burden to children who infect and potentially cause significant harm to their elders can be catastrophic.

The republicans during a pandemic send kids back to school while people are being evicted and potentially sick.  The level of out right abuse to the American people especially targeted at blue states is outrageous.

The costs to society and families will likely last a lifetime."

It’s neighbor Jewish Seminary, another place of ‘god,’ is already cashing in on its’ own uber luxury skyscraper.  Few of us who have lived in the neighborhood want(ed) either of these monstrosities or the rich beyond comprehension buyers who can afford them. Most of us would welcome these young people in a minute with open arms. One would expect that religious institutions would prioritize the housing needs of such people or even middle class people over the needs of billionaires who likely have multiple  lodgings scattered around the globe. But this is godliness in America today. What a shame."
2020-08-13 14:14,"This is so heartbreaking. Another way COVID 19 is disproportionately affecting poor communities. These families already had few safety nets, no life insurance, property or money to leave behind to help take care of their children. What will become of these children? As we bail out businesses and wring her hands over gyms being closed I would hope our state and federal government would set up a system to help these kids. Make it easier for their siblings to get guardianship. Provide scholarships for at least community college for their siblings who are sacrificing so much to step up while still young adults. We should do more, we can do more."
2020-08-13 13:50,"My heart breaks for these kids.  My mother's mother died in the 1918 flu pandemic, leaving my mother (6 years old) and her two younger sisters.  Fathers were not considered suitable parents for girls, so they were separated and farmed out to relatives who agreed to raise them. Some of the homes were Dickensian.  Throughout my mother's life she consistently said the loss of her mother was the most significant event in her life (despite a marriage of 50+ years, four children and 8 grandchildren)."
2020-08-13 19:08,"This is beyond heartbreaking.  On the potential upside, this feels like a good opportunity for all the Brooklyn parents who profess to care so much about family and community to step up and *truly* make a difference."
2020-08-13 19:26,"This is the Human conditions left by Covid 19.  But these are the stories where Trumpsters say ""So what?""  Because children can be orphans from a car accident, cancer, etc.  The thing is, this may have been prevented if leadership acted responsibly.  Even today you see Republican governors still opening schools even though many of them within the state had to close within days of opening.  They refuse mask mandates.  They play down the rising numbers.  They lie about other countries.  Covid is making a return in countries that have gotten down to 1% or less because people put their guard down.  

And of course the lack of testing and truthful information plays a big part in this.   We are just learning the horrible after effects of this disease even if it was a mild case.  Organs are beginning to fail!!

You need a heart in order to tame this disease."
2020-08-13 20:24,"My heart is both sad and inspired as these young men and women, barely out of childhood themselves, take on the support of their younger sibblings.   Many families, it seems, already do not have the resources of extended families, or even another partner.  There needs to be a special program and funding, as well as future college funding, for young people found orphaned in these situations.  Perhaps young people 18 to 20, with younger sibblings, could live together in the same setting, with a ""foster"" parent checking in on them and assuring the needs are being met."

He was 7.  Our family was broken and in some ways it still is.  It was way easier for my son to get over the death of his dad but the loss of my mother was so profound for all of us. She was the glue that held me, my dad and sister together. My son, her only grandchild, was the light of her life. We speak of her so often and how things would be so different if she was here.  When folks look at numbers now maybe they will think of all 169,000 people who died and know that they are broken in some way too. These aren't just numbers but lives. So many lives. It's almost overwhelming. It didn't have to be this way and that is what just makes me weep. I weep for these families who will have to spend birthdays and holidays crying instead of laughing and celebrating. This is an American tragedy and the fact that POTUS says ""it is what it is"" is just disgusting.  I am so sorry to these families."

This important story that for those of us who are concerned about these broken systems have knowledge so that we can be of help to families.
These unfortunate stories can help mobilize people who want change to understand the brokenness of the system
The pandemic forces us to hit the what it means to be an American reset button. Forced our political representatives, organized groups to help families succeed vs putting obstacles in front of them. The pandemic has changed how we all should proactively view life.  We do not need feel good slogans, fake commercials, we need  organization  with the virus and the strain he and his family are enduring.
Thank you NYT for printing these stories.  Please keep writing about these issues.  If possible  put a link where we can help if we choose to do so."

No matter who we are - we are each suffering through this.  But, wow, this story really puts things into perspective.  Losing both parents and then trying to sort out how to keep going and keep your family together?  That requires a resilience that many of us do not possess."

What I really wanted to point out was more general. With all this sadness, depression and loss why do we also have to put up with conservatives? Every lie Trump and his supporters tell about covid is a slap in the face to the victims. It all just seems so unbearable."

Courts have long allowed older siblings to raise younger siblings, but it doesn't happen everywhere or in every circumstance.  Overall, the demise of large families means their are fewer aunts and uncles to help.  The increase in one parent families has made the problem worse. 

There are experimental programs to help kids emerge from foster care by supplying them with funds to as old as age 24.  Here is an example:

I remember hearing that my grandmother at age 9 and seven of her siblings lost their mother to the influenza pandemic of 1918.  Their father survived, so their situation was not nearly as dire -- but even so the grief and trauma of that loss shaped even my family life two generations later.  Supporting these siblings is so important."
2020-08-13 23:07,"I, too, want to know how to support these young people. They need more than money-are there social services/therapists who can listen to them and provide advice? My parents also died when I was a teenager, with a younger brother, and older siblings helped out. It was very hard on all of us as we processed our grief and tried to find our way forward as adults while honoring and remembering our parents. Money is absolutely necessary of course, but they need community and older sources of wisdom and experience."

Yet there is still a non-zero chance that Americans will re-elect trump and the GOP in Congress.

About 2/3rds of the 44, 000 Americans who died from gunshots before the COVID-19 pandemic were suicides. Overwhelming white men and veterans who tended to use handguns.

While 95% of homicides involved people of the same race aka color as perpetrators and victims.  With the remaining 5% involving people of different colors aka race about evenly distributed between Black and white.

Suicide clearly has a mental health aspect.  And some homicides may involve emotional and mental health stress issues as well. Murder and manslaughter are legal determinations regarding charges and trials regarding some homicides."

A life in the USA without guns would be a wonderful life for all."

We have developed a media culture where being angry is a core competency ( just watch CNN and MSNBC and ask yourself if they go to looking indignant training ). I am not an evangelical by any means but I see the core message of love for one another has been lost in this Country"
2020-08-11 11:23,"People being isolated or cooped up in small spaces in hot weather is a volatile mix.  Perhaps the protests are more of a letting off of steam and a welcome to a camaraderie as well as giving one a sense of purpose.  When I refer to protest  I mean all protests on the right and left.  I do take issue with one statement in this article which mentions the 'wave of police killings' which is an unsupported exaggeration of the truth.  Before you disagree take a look at the real numbers!  There are 800,000 police officers in this nation with millions of interactions that don't lead to 'police murder'.  In fact there are many positive interactions which are never reported except in very rare instances.  Humans are indeed a strange species in their propensity to concentrate on the negative and completely ignore the positive.

2020-08-11 12:13,"We are experiencing a widespread mental health breakdown due to the societal upsets caused by the virus.  The social mechanisms that bind people into groups and provide for decent mental health have been taken from us.

I myself am experiencing bouts of anxiety that can at times be brutal.  So far, I have been able to cope, but it hasn't been easy.

Then, you add on top of this, a president who is shredding the institutions we depend upon to provide stability in our lives.  Even the Post Office is under attack.  Can you imagine?  The most stable, dependable thing in our lives is the sight of our neighborhood letter carriers visiting us every day reliably delivering the mail.  And now that simple stability is under threat.

Social services that have always been under funded are evaporating.  The money for them is gone.  Cultural outlets where people can express themselves and experience music and dance are gone.  Sports are gone and with them the social binding they provide.  Religious services are zoom rooms.

If ever there was a time where we needed national unity and cohesiveness, this is it.  We have just the opposite.  As a result, we are breaking down.  The most down trodden and neglected areas are breaking down first.

In high school, we had riots and students that I thought would never hurt anyone did.  This breakdown is like a continuous, low grade riot where people are hurting each other.   It takes a village."
2020-08-11 12:23,"Idk- I'm still one to think the majority of this is caused by police pulling back in the wake of protests/riots, with a bit of admixture from the lockdowns taking a toll on people mentally and economically. I mean, if we need a case study, just look at how much crime increased in Baltimore in the wake of the Freddie Gray riots, or even at Ferguson. We have case studies here, and the cities subsequently became raging dumpster fires. Granted, I don't think any of this would be as bad if we weren't in the thralls of a pandemic, but without a doubt there'd be the uptick in the wake of the protests and riots. And I'm sure on top of all that the BLM activities are related to the lockdowns since they're one of the few social activities that hasn't been explicitly condemned amidst the lockdowns."
2020-08-11 11:59,"Why can't we get it through our thick heads? Increase in homicides is tied to guns. Not color, weather, fool moon, COVID-19 lockdown, or whatever else people want it assigned to. Some of these shootings might involve ""illegal guns"". There is no such thing as illegal guns. All guns are produced ""legally"", in a gun factory. They are sold ""legally"" to dealers. Then, they find their way to people that shouldn't have access to them. And that means almost everyone. The only way for this mayhem to be curbed is make ammunition selling illegal to civilians. Let them keep their guns. No need to create trouble by confiscating them. And the fact that many shootings happen in democrat run cities, is the most hypocritical nonsense I ever heard. Chicago and New York have strict anti gun laws. What good does that do, when you can drive a few hours to another state and bring back guns to sell at a good profit? Unless you install metal detectors at every city entrance, this will not get better.  The European union, with 500 million people, had 3300 murders in 2018. America, with 330 million had 18,000 murders. The EU has strict gun laws. Americans are the only ones who can't see the real reason behind the discrepancy. And we are pittied the world over."
2020-08-11 11:56,"It's unbelievable how Americans won't face the evidence in front of their faces. It's the guns stupid!! Take away the guns and miracle fewer homicides. If our Supreme Court justices are too dumb or bought out by lobbies to understand the  plain English of the  Second Amendment which only guaranteed the right to possess an arm in the context of an organized militia, then abolish the Second Amendment. Otherwise Americans will continue to slaughter each other at a rate far greater than any other so-called civilized country on earth."

2020-08-11 12:28,I think the NYT needs to seriously reconsider taking the conclusions of academics as the gospel truth. If academics aren’t themselves extreme liberals they are in fear of them. So their conclusions often come off as unbelievable to normal people. This is the case here.
2020-08-11 11:58,Trump's American carnage.  Republican governance is building toward a dystopian nightmare and a gutting of our national institutions.  It is hard to not feel despair at the discontents and disruption to our way of life unleashed by this president.  He is responsible.  The buck does stop with him.
2020-08-11 12:10,"All these killings! Sad, tragic, deplorable... And not unexpected. The vile injustice of the American system would drive a saint to rebellion. I grew up learning of, not Paul Revere, but of Irish ""heroes"" in every generation who stood against tyranny. Why might I come here and take the side of the tyrants? (Many Irish did, and their offspring control police departments in some cities.) Trump unleashed America's worst angels before the pandemic. Then he praised Xi and his handling of the infection---until it became obvious that Trump would benefit more from attacking the CCP,  He continues to say the pandemic is getting better and will go away. He continues to appeal to those invested in stocks and praises the Dow, Nasdaq etc. He assures white suburbs that he'll save them from whatever ""barbarian invasion"" they fear. How many shouts from the roof-tops do the dispossessed need before they realize they are expendable and actually unwanted? Analysis and statistics have their place, but who makes all those guns available? Who buys all the drugs, sending billions across America and farther south, corrupting societies from here to Colombia?"
2020-08-11 12:30,"People blaming this on protests against police violence are seriously barking up the wrong tree. I know we like to scapegoat, but come on, use your heads.

People are under huge economic strain. Tens of millions of service sector workers are unemployed. People have been scared for months - scared of coronavirus, scared of being destitute. People are surrounded by other stressed out, frustrated, angry people. Our government is comically corrupt and incompetent - no hope or help will come from that quarter. 

When people feel scared and trapped for long enough, they explode. Give someone in this condition a gun and they'll use it. The article explains: there's a rise in reactionary, not premeditated killings.

This isn't a deep insight into human nature. This is basic, obvious knowledge about how people work. 

I'm sure it's reassuring to blame the liberals or whoever for this problem, reinstituting police chokeholds isn't going to solve this. We're experiencing systemic social failure to support our most vulnerable. These are the consequences."
2020-08-11 12:26,"I think that therre is one and only one positive effect of the lockdowns: to manage the case load on the healthcare system.

And that is a worthy goal; fatalities would probably have been somewhat higher in places like NYC although that system was overwhelmed anyway.

Aside from that I see no positive impact from the lockdowns at all.

As a knee-jerk initial plan lockdowns are expected.

But when one considers the breadth of activities that have been declared as ""essential"" in all states with lockdowns, there are so many activities ongoiing that the lockdowns are really nothing more than ""the state"" deciding who it wil bankrupt.

And that's not what the Founders had in mind.

A surge in homicides ?  Is it due to lockdowns and depression ? Or is it due to the overal negative environment that has been forced onto our policing function over the same past few months by progresive leftists ?

A question wortg pondering."
2020-08-11 12:38,"Can you stop having a political/social agenda on every story? 

Of course the rise in homicides -- almost entirely in cities like Chicago, Baltimore, Los Angeles and New York - is connected to the civil unrest since George Floyd's death, the calls to ""defund"" police, and the sense on the part of police officers that any intervention or even routine patrolling in some areas is to risk an encounter that will destroy their careers and lives. 

This weekend in Washington D.C. there was an episode where 20 people were shot, and a kid was killed, after a block party turned in to a gun battle. Police response was leisurely at best. Who could blame them? 

This weekend in Chicago, the fact that police returned fire on someone shooting at them let to an ugly riot and looting with scores of injuries.

And you want to pretend there is no connection between events like these, the rising crime and murder rate in America and the massive protests this spring? Ludicrous."
2020-08-11 12:36,"From The Los Angels Times, January 12, 2014: ""As concern about economic inequality rises to the top of the issue agenda, it is instructive to note that the upturn in poverty of recent years has not been accompanied by a rise in violent crime. To the contrary, since 2008, unemployment and homicides have been inversely related.""

And re the 1930s Depression: ""Lest anyone think that reductions in economic inequality triggered the crime downturn, the following staggering figure should be kept in mind: Even as crime plunged in the late 1930s, the percentage of Americans at or below the income poverty line hit an astonishing 68%."""

I would love to know what research says about the effect of policing (defunding), gun control, heat waves, protests,isolation/quarantines, prisoner releases etc on homicides specifically."
2020-08-11 13:15,"A person doesn't just wake up one morning and decide to become a killer, it's a learned response.  Granted there are psychopaths amongst us, but the overwhelming number of murders are done by sane people.  Certainly the lockdowns, quarantine restrictions and job loss due to the Covid-19 virus puts pressure on a person's mental condition that can result in criminal acts such as larceny, shoplifting and theft, but to the extent that the Covid-19 virus in and of itself has caused a rapid rise in homicides would be difficult to prove.  There are too many people who view our laws as merely suggestions which have no deterrent effect upon them.  Breaking laws and getting away with it only serves to embolden them."
2020-08-11 13:16,"""“If people could settle an argument without having to resort to shooting, violence would reduce” ""

When you are packing a gun, it's quicker and easier to just start shooting.  America today prefers quick and easy."
2020-08-11 13:15,"Kansas City (MO) has had problems with crime long before Covid-19.  The main shopping district - the Plaza - has had a curfew in place for several years due to crime, Swope Park is unusable at night, the city public school system is avoided by any residents who can afford to do so, and there are large areas that are riddled with crime.  The police department has been underpaid as well, and the actual size of the city makes regular  enforcement difficult.  KC’s problems are more an example of the pitfalls of poor governance than anything else."

Fund schools to perform well in the environments they are in. That means staffing the support services needed to deal with poverty, broken families, violence etc. Incentives for the best teachers to stay in troubled districts. Higher social resources to help these parents who many times have limited life experiences and education. Infrastructure to pull children out of bad homes and put them up in highly functioning boarding schools. 

Decriminalize drugs and get the government to sell them at or below cost. Eliminate the black market. Get ruthless sentencing on people caught with or selling illegal guns. 

Our economy has no tangible use for uneducated people. The automation is too high, the immigration of uneducated refugees is very high and the competition is very high."

People are angry.  People are watching our elected officials, particularly those on the GOP side, play games while their lives fall apart.  They can't go up to the statehouses or to DC and force these same officials to work on behalf of all Americans because they'd be arrested.  The police can't calm things down because they don't have the right training or temperaments to do it.  

Any American with half a brain could have predicted that it was going to be a long hot summer as soon as Trump and his surrounding sycophants refused to step up to the challenge of COVID19.  What have they done to ease things?  Nothing.  In truth it ought to be all of them suffering in the heat, the humidity, and with the stress they have foisted upon all of us."
2020-08-11 13:33,"This story speaks to one individual case that is very sad. But this rise in  gun violence (largely black-on-black)  is not simply a story of one tragic decision, and not limited to large cities. Cities like Albany are seeing the same trend and in this case it appears to be mounting retribution between two gangs or neighborhoods, with innocent bystanders including children injured or killed. And look at Chicago: horrible gun violence and this week's looting which the mayor described as purely criminal. So; somebody smarter than me please tell me how to stem this tide, hold the  perpetrators responsible and what the remedies are? It better be good because Trump has a simple answer that will resonate with his base.... and perhaps beyond."
2020-08-11 13:18,"The real problem the US has is in dealing with its chronic pockets of poverty, whether they are rural areas with white people making meth and selling oxycontin or in urban areas with African Americans engaging in gang conflict.

On one hand, the link between crime and inter-generational poverty seems axiomatic.  When entire communities have been  stuck in a cycle of poverty, it's not really a surprise when anti-social behavior becomes a chronic social pathology.  America has mostly given up on solving these problems -- too expensive, the populations too unresponsive, a hard problem that easier and more profitable to ignore.  We're also unwilling to face the idea that some elements of aiding these communities may be necessarily coercive to gain compliance and progress, in an ""eat your vegetables/do your homework"" kind of way.

On the other hand, the social malaise and violence these communities originate are real.  In many cases, some kind of law enforcement presence and response is necessary to keep them from devolving into chaos and harming innocent people inside and outside of these communities.  However, our law enforcement efforts wind up plagued by both ham-fisted law enforcement and people who claim that *any* law enforcement response is unjust and unwarranted.

We're winding up with the perfect storm of incompetence and inaction.  We've given up on addressing poverty.  Our whipsawing support/criticism of law enforcement has resulted in the worst possible outcomes."
2020-08-11 13:38,"Not to diminish the tragedy of gun violence, but there are a lot of other things that aren't being / haven't been addressed for years, and are now getting worse.

I recently had a car stolen.  It was clearly marked, targeted, and watched.  The police response has been effectively zero.  It took over 12 attempts to contact any city commissioner before anything but an auto-reply.  

When I did get responses, they were prefaced with ""homicides"", ""unrest""...

That to me is merely an excuse.  Portland has had car break-in problems and car theft problems with lack of enforcement so many other issues they can't be listed.  All these problems are years in incubation."

In some ways it's like I've forgotten the skills it takes to navigate the ""real"" world with it's hustle and bustle, minor and major inconveniences without taking it personally or getting irritated.  I'm very cognizant of this and find it psychologically fascinating - yet frightening.  I wonder how many are feeling the same?  You can blame it on a slew of issues and conditions but I do believe being isolated for so long plays a big role in peoples lack of patience and tendencies toward aggression.  Such  strange and scary times right now.  Time to take it slow and easy."
2020-08-11 13:43,"So now we're going to defund the police?

One suspects that, as the article says, the increase in killings was because the police were occupied with the protests, although low morale in the police departments may have played a role as well.

How a long-overdue protest against police brutality and legalized murder turned into a circus, I will never know."
2020-08-11 13:56,"So you are linking the rise in murders in major cities across America with a ""steep decline in gun arrests beginning in May"" which was a NYC thing only.

So fewer gun arrests in NYC in May and June has led to record murder rates in cities all over America which actually pre-dates even Covid.

Got it."
2020-08-11 13:56,"There have been 83 homicides in Columbus, Ohio this year, according to the Dispatch.  We are likely one of the 20 major cities mentioned in the article that have experienced a sharp increase in murders.  

Our nation's current civil unrest is caused by the convergence of many societal problems - because we have elected ""the government we deserve"" for the past 40 years.  We have been lagging in healthcare, education, infrastructure, and poverty alleviation for two generations.

Once admired, America is now pitied by other countries!"
2020-08-11 14:00,This is clearly tied to calls for defunding the police.  I'm all in for reforming the police but  the street protests have chosen this unfortunate meme and the opposition is running with it.  To say that the murder rate is caused by Covid or unemployment or  anything else is misleading.  Police need more funding not less.  They need less militarization.  Maybe the new slogan should Reformed Community Policing which Protects People.  Why would police risk their lives when they are continuously being eviscerated?  It's a tough job.

2020-08-11 13:42,"If you want to defund the police, do it in your own neighborhoods.  But we want and need police in downtown commercial districts. Removing police from public areas is just a bad policy idea.  

We don’t need a radical minority of activists dictating policing strategies for everyone, especially for communities where policing isn’t considered a problem by the people who live and work there. 

Now do we need reform of police tactics more generally?  Yes.  Cops are obviously too trigger happy and are too often immune from reprimand.  

For one thing, you can often arrest someone later instead of brawling one on one on the roadside. They also need better non-lethal alternatives.  Perhaps we should even disarm them on certain patrols (they could keep a long gun in their car for extreme emergencies). 

Finally, I know people don’t want to hear this but resisting arrest is futile and stupid. When you are arrested, you need to calm down, shut up and call a lawyer.  Do your fighting lawfully, in court."

2020-08-11 14:15,"I am confused as to why a report as well-researched and reported as this one failed to highlight the prevalence of firearms in this country. Easy access to guns is one of the most-prevalent factors contributing to this country's spiking murder rate, which your article alludes to, but does not state outright. 

More guns equals more gun violence, full stop. The case in point being the confrontation between Isaac Knighten and Jayvon McCray described in your article. In a country where the guns now out number the people, we need to acknowledge that any interaction with another human being can and should be treated as a potentially life threatening interaction based on the likelihood that at least one party is armed. 

The prevalence of guns in this country is a cancer that kills our citizens without any real accountability. As long as gun makers and their lobbyist supporters continue to further the narrative that ""guns save lives,"" and publications like this one don't acknowledge that lie at every turn, we continue to normalize the sheer inanity of owning and maintaining a firearm.

To me, the country is starting to look a little 1970’s again with the gentrified and livable cities backsliding into trash and graffiti depots. The N.Y.C. real estate market is already sliding, and the guns (1000 shootings this year already) will accelerate the exodus law-abiding tax payors."

2020-08-11 14:32,"The issue is spiritual degeneracy, not “economic hardship.” On “Greg Kelly Reports” (Newsmax TV), former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani reminded the audience that the 1929 St. Valentine’s Day Massacre, which left seven people dead, outraged America, but when eight people were killed in New York City in one day in the ‘80s, “it didn’t even make a headline.” Then-New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that “we were defining deviancy down. We’re doing it again,” Giuliani said. “We’re started to get used to 20 people getting killed in Chicago.” The district attorneys in these riot-torn cities are not prosecuting the rioters, but letting them out without bail. Violent offenders get their bailed raised and are released. What’s offensive to these liberals is incarceration, not crime. So you’re going to have more crime. “This is our future if we elect Biden,” Giuliani predicted. “Our future is Portland. Our future is Chicago.”"

Police morale is at zero when in many localities the politicians go with the herd in attacking police. NYC was one of the safest cities in The US until the mayor and city representatives decided it was politically expedient to attack the cops.

Then article continues with ideas that the lockdown has increased pessimism about the economy, and perhaps altered drug selling strategies, kept teenagers out of school and generally contributed to the combustion that can lead to increased murders. 

It seems like there’s a struggle between the New York Times editorial policy and the facts on the ground.  By admitting the fact that police have had to monitor protest marches and are thus unavailable to fight crime, The cat is out of the bag. And the connection between Corvid, and the protests, and an increase in certain types of crime becomes clear. 

To say that crime and/or just murder and assault has increased because of protest and the pandemic does not in anyway mitigate the need for a drastic social change. But the New York Times seems to have trouble accepting this."

He begins to hit the skull harder and harder - until he finally ends up smashing the skull to bits with his newly-discovered ""weapon"" - as he displays defiance, power and victory -

Next - we see two groups of apes - each living on opposite sides of a small river or pond -

There seems to be some level of animosity and distrust between the two groups - for no other reason than they live on ""the other side"" of the pond -

The first ape has shared the discovery of his ""weapon"" with his group - and now they all have large sticks and clubs -

The dispute between the two groupsof apes comes to a head - as they cross the pond to fight - however - the group with no ""weapons"" is no match for the first group - which mercilessly beats the weaponless group - killing some - while sending the rst fleeing - as the weaponized group cheers and displays in triumph - now in ownership of both sides of the puddle of water -

The point being -

While we have moved forward since the days of clubs and sticks - and have made tremendous advancements in technology -- especially with regard to weapons and methods of killing - 

As a species - we have apparently progressed very little - if at all - from those apes at the pond millions of years ago..."

A video game come to life.  Plus, with looting you get free stuff.  Watch the videos of young people in Chicago filming themselves taunting the police, then scattering after the police police have had enough thrown objects and charge.  They’re not scared of the cops; they’re acting exactly like kids with a substitute teacher.

Same thing on the west coast, only with more tactical maneuvers and McGyver tricks, like leaf blowers and umbrellas.

As for homicides, all of that seems to be the kind of score-settling and subsequent revenge attacks that go on in inner city classrooms where the teacher has lost control (minus the gang and gun factor at the elementary level - I speak from sad personal experience here). 
Being soft on school discipline to reduce “disparities” increases classroom disorder;  being soft on criminal penalties to avoid those same disparities increases urban disorder."

Acts of revenge, plunder, murder, and attacks of competitors preserve the balanced order when a system of anarchy prevails. You can do whatever you want if you have the ""power"" to get away with it. A similar event occurred in Montreal, Quebec at 08:00 am on 10/07/1999 when the Mounties went on strike for sixteen hours. During that time the normal law abiding culture robbed banks, committed acts of revenge, burned down competitors businesses, looted, set fires, rioted, and these anti-social acts did not abate until the army and Mounties enforced the law again. I think much of our uptick in violence is due to law enforcement taking a knee (not in support of BLM) to make the case: ""Who ya gonna call when the wolf is at the door?"""

The victims and the perpetrators are most commonly people of color. They are fighting each other because of the desperation poverty, lack of education and opportunities cause. I don't know the solution but the problem needs to be addressed realistically."
2020-08-11 15:38,"How many of you who believe serious gun control would stem the carnage would be willing to take the first step of actually enforcing existing gun laws as written?  Most cities have fairly strong laws around unlicensed firearm possession, particularly by those who already have felony records, and those laws sometimes include mandatory sentences that are never actually applied (since such application would result in racially disparate incarceration numbers).

Maybe if, when cops found felons carrying guns, they were kept locked up until trial (Covid is not a serious danger to young men).  Currently they are simply released, and many go on to shoot whoever they were planning to shoot in the first place.  Staying locked up for a while would be a much stronger deterrent, as would actual prison time for committing what is currently classified (I think) as a “non-violent offense”.

Locking up firearm carrying felons would cut the murder rate pretty fast, no new legislation needed."

Given heat, confusion over a virus and virus measures, national upheaval over policing, and a sorely divided country, the lines between reality and fantasy may blur for some.

It’s the fact-free reporting by outlets like the New York Times that portrays cop-fueled murder of unarmed black civilians as commonplace — even though such incidents, unjust and unacceptable as they are, happen to be a rarity. Meanwhile the activists can’t even be bothered to register concern about the street violence terrorizing America’s urban poor, because that wouldn’t be very woke, would it?

I can’t imagine what it must be like to be a cop on a dangerous beat, responding to a potentially violent complaint, only to be followed, Black Mirror-style, by hordes of camera-wielding bystanders — as if they are the dangerous ones!

The Times has barely mentioned Chicago but - it needs to. Find a list of the stores that were looted and it represents the core downtowns of many cities.

Stay-at-home orders, as if we expect drug dealers unfazed by threat of long prison terms to obey the local health department, and recession, as if we believe those pulling the guns this year would refrain from doing so in better economic times, appeal to liberal sensibilities but that won’t make them hold water. I can recall when the “superpredator” concept, advanced by criminologists such as James Fox, was in vogue and I doubted that one, too.

While anger and boredom may well figure among the causative factors, I think our habit of preferring simple theories for stranger-on-stranger violence, a phenomenon which remains poorly understood despite a century of study going back to Émile Durkheim, forecloses on our ability to ask basic questions such as whether the macro-social environment is really more important than the particular circumstances at hand. America’s highest modern homicide rate, achieved in 1980, fell during the years of high unemployment immediately following only to rise again as the economy improved."

It's the kind of crimes that always seem to accompany great economic downturns which cause people to lose livelihoods and great frustration and helplessness. 

The prevalence of violence and looting and burning in close proximity to the demonstrations in our region seemed to be more opportunistic criminality precipitated by police being distracted than the outrage from unjust incidents. I suspect that it was this way due to the pandemic more than the issues which motivated the demonstrations."

If we had a federal government that constantly, daily reiterated we all are in this together - help neighbors, donate to food banks, and remember your fellow citizens whether local or far away - there would be a big mind shift in this country.

Most homicides take place in an unplanned moment of hyper emotion or  during commission of another crime and are almost impossible to prevent, which is distinct from solving. The availability of guns, involvement of drugs, alcohol, gang activity, domestic violence and to a lesser degree personal disputes are much more prevalent factors in increased killings. One COVID related factor could be fewer arrests for minor offenses leaving more potential killers on the street at any given moment, but police being diverted to control protest crowds is probably not a large contributory factor."

Police and the criminal justice system have room for improvement as with any system, but they have also successfully been central to a dramatic reduction in violent and smaller crimes in urban markets over the last generation.  When police raise the red flag over support, budgets, engagement, and or ""tried to lay blame on a new law that let's many defendants go free without posting bond"" (put aside the obvious bias in the article), we should given their expert opinions due consideration and respect.  

It's amazing how community organizers and anti-police groups and others are given agency and police are summarily dismissed"

2020-08-11 19:17,"Violence is endemic to America.  The have been over 330 mass shootings this year.   Everybody is under pressure all the time.  Lose your job and you lose your healthcare or maybe you never had any.  Wages are low. People are under a lot of stress and its not going to get better.

Americans needs to find away to start treating everyone better starting with healthcare and then moving on to education for all and a general fairness in society.   

There has to be a better way that 600 or 700 mass shooting a year and an incarceration rate that has 1% of your adult population in jail

There has to be.   America needs some leadership"

2020-08-11 19:16,"My opinion, there are just way too many guns.    It is too easy to get mad, grab your gun from your car and become a murderer.  Solution, I sadly don't have one.   I could wish the guns all away but that is magical thinking.    I could wish people could control their anger and frustrations and resolve things peacefully and calmly.    Once again, magical thinking.

We could improve people's lives with jobs that pay a living wage.   We could help people with healthcare for all.   Is this magical thinking?    Hopefully we vote Donald and the GOP out and begin to put our money in solving our many problems, not giving the money to the billionaires to spend on themselves."
2020-08-11 19:05,"Typical US scenario---- ""That led to an argument...it escalated.... one pulled a gun...""
and
""....the all-too-familiar crackle of gunfire pierced the humid air,""

Sure, we'll have ""academic studies to trace the effects of stressed economics, folks out of work, teens out of school...a volatile situation.""

But what makes these situations lead to shootings and death?
Easily available guns---the American tradition in many states, where where high profit gun makers and NRA have propagandized the citizenry to say guns equal FREEDOM. 

And where the lobby pays off lawmakers to block laws that may reduce gun profits.  
It all works together as a system.

Compare this situation to other world democracies with sensible, strict gun possession laws --- supported by voters--- and much less gun deaths. What are gun maker profits like there?

They also have universal health care as a right, which here is still locked by our politics. What are their insurance profits like there?

Question: 
In the US, when a shooting victim ripped by bullets does survive, but is one of millions uninsured here, who pays the high hospital bills for treatment?  Does financial disaster, and unpaid job disability compound the gun tragedy--- for the victims and their families' future?

At least in other countries a shooting victim gets medical care paid by their universal systems. And paid sick leaver from job.

Let's have some media coverage of this huge aspect of our American Gun Tragedy."
2020-08-11 19:06,"I know that what I'm suggesting here will be interpreted as asking for the second coming of Christ, but I cannot see, nor can imagine anything less, than the total renunciation and complete removal of the First Amendment and the associated gun rights, banning private ownership of firearms of any kind, hunting for sport, closing down of the entire gun industry from the manufacturers through the distributors and all retailers, all gun shops.
In other words: full and total gun control, enforced."

2020-08-19 10:24,"I know an actuary who wrote a seminar paper in graduate school working out what one's chances of being run over by a vehicle were at different Tel Aviv intersections. How practical was this? For the few people who read it it meant being a little more careful as a pedestrian in certain areas.

Care and caution and even some fear is good. Being frozen in place is bad.

It is necessary at various levels, including the individual one, to work out what makes sense and to find a modus vivendi. It is that or cease to exist.

So major shopping is delivered; I can afford it. Fruits and vegetables- I shop at off hours. I prefer the high quality of the local fruit and vegetable store. I went to the dental hygienist today, taking the standard precautions as she did, but in the end, she sticks her gloved hands and masked face into my mouth. Dumb on my part? Hope not, but gum disease can lead to heart problems, especially at certain ages.

Grandchildren, we meet outdoors and try and be careful. I have a 3 month old grandson whom I have not yet held.

The media does not always help. Data is thrown around and ""experts"" crawl out of the media woodwork. A financial reporter stating that schools are safe would do better to leave such matters to real experts. 

So Dr. Rosenthal is correct. Life must go on. Take precautions, use common sense and hope for some luck. 

It is necessary to have a plan. It is also necessary to realize that plans oft go astray."
2020-08-19 10:33,"This conveys exactly how I and many of my physician colleagues approach the virus. However, the media and culture of safteyism in the upper middle classes makes it hard to convince those who are paralyzed by fear."
2020-08-19 10:35,"I’ve been practicing medicine for 35 years. Dr. Rosenthal has got things wrong. Why? Because we are too early in the natural history of this disease to make rational decisions about risk tolerance. 

Just last week we had studies showing that antibodies last only a few months, which painted a confusing picture of possible immunity. Then, all of a sudden  we had another study showing that memory B and T cells may provide immunity regardless of measurable antibodies. This illustrates how we are still at the baby stages of learning about this disease. 

Same is true regarding transmissibility of the virus. Remember how long it took to confirm asymptomatic carriers and spreaders? How about the scary fact of aerosol vs. droplet spread? How about the lack of an effective antiviral medication or vaccine? 

I won’t even mention the politicization of scientific data and policy that we are all too aware of. 

So Dr. Rosenthal, please don’t ask citizens and medical personnel to evaluate individual risk tolerance at this stage in the pandemic. We need more data and more lockdowns of multiple States to preserve life until we learn more. 

Your comments regarding risk tolerance are better suited to those who are interested in mountain climbing or whether to buy stocks or bonds."
2020-08-19 10:39,"There are two unfortunate facts, which undermine your otherwise sensible advice ( which has been implemented by other democracies ) :
We have The Joker as our role model. Batman hopefully takes over in January. But even then, the second problem will remain. An Orange Stain that has been with us from the outset. We do not have herd immunity against willful ignorance, otherwise known as individual freedom."
2020-08-19 10:40,I have always been a defensive driver and it has served me well over the years however navigating through Covid-19 has proven to be much more difficult. There are too many selfish people in America right now not following the rules exposing the rest of us who are trying to be responsible. Am I supposed to go back to the office at 66 years of age where the majority of my co-workers are between 25-40? Am I supposed to believe that my money hungry company (now worse than ever) is really going to try and protect me from this virus? I don't think so. I have been around too long to know better. Those of us in my age group are on our own to make these important decisions. I agree with Dr Rosenthal about the fact that this is far from over.
2020-08-19 10:40,"I have been living with a ""risk tolerance"" since the last week of April, when I returned to my medical office, with my own rationale that could be best stated as ""what would I do if there is never a vaccine?"" It is easier here in NY, where the state drove the numbers down to a tolerable risk.

My patients veer between paranoid and complacent, a relatively normal cross section of the community.

And the data we get is colored by distrust, and suspicion. Are they saying the disease is deadly to get Trump unelected? Are they saying a treatment works or a vaccine will work to keep him in office? Truth is not even truthy. Truth is more elusive than unicorns and mermaids.

How much is the virus spread by surfaces? 20% of cases, 80%? How much can masks help, both eliminate expelling virons and breathing them in? How deadly is the disease? How many have actually died of COVID, given that we now know that it causes myocarditis and kidney failure? How likely is a 55 year old diabetic to die, how likely is a 22 year old diabetic?

COVID kills about 1%, hospitalizes up to 20%, leaving many with lifelong heart and kidney disease, and leaves 80% unaffected or unaware of illness. I have a close acquaintance who sees those numbers as proof it is overhyped. But another disease that's more benign numerically - 95% mild or asymptomatic, 5% seriously ill, with life long complications, and 1% dead or disabled  - is polio. Would we shrug if polio were rampant?

Which framework is accurate?"
2020-08-19 10:48,"I agree with Dr. Rosenthal to a point, but then come some very glaring shortcomings to her argument. On the one hand, I can liken my risk of contracting Covid-19 or unknowingly infecting others to driving a car -- I can take all of the necessary precautions to protect myself and others, but my life and safety can be quickly compromised by those not taking such precautions (e.g. drunk drivers, those texting while driving, etc.).

That said, a major flaw of Dr. Rosenthal's argument is the fact that we just don't yet have enough data on Covid-19 to make an informed risk assessment. For example, I am a 30 something year old, in otherwise good health with no co-morbidities who exercises regularly. I'm sure Dr. Rosenthal would tell me that my chances of a bad outcome if I were to contract Covid-19 are low and therefore I can have a higher risk tolerance. Well, we still don't understand why some young healthy people have bad outcomes, why some people having lingering symptoms and other issues long after ""recovering"" (e.g. strokes, heart immflamuation, lung damage). Furthermore, this is a public health crisis, not just a potential personal one; in this respect, I am also doing what I can not only to protect myself, but to ensure I don't unknowingly spread Covid-19 to others (i.e. if I were to become infected as an asymptomatic carrier). 

At the end of the day, we might have to live with Covid-19 out there for quite some time and luckily humans are made to adapt."

It will be my first venture out except to quick trips to the grocery store.    If masking requirements and timed visits had been available from the start, it may have made a big difference to our dealing with the virus. It also may have saved many of the small  ""unessential"" businesses."
2020-08-19 10:50,"I have a reasonable handle on the risk I take doing all sorts of seemingly mundane but potentially harmful or even lethal things; it's the aggregate wisdom of many expert opinions. One can make a relatively informed risk assessment even if one is not an expert, in this way.

The aggregate wisdom of expert opinion on this subject seems to suggest that we don't even know what we don't know, yet.

An informed assessment of risk is not yet possible."
2020-08-19 10:59,"Dr. Rosenthal is exactly right.  I think the reaction of most Americans to the virus has been hampered by relative inexperience in handling this level of risk.  So, without the benefit of experience, many of us have relied on instincts, emotions, rumors, or the many inaccurate comments of our leaders - community and national.  

We are growing, though, and over time each of us is learning more facts about the virus and our own tolerance for risk, which will be different for each person.  Over time, and with better leadership, that will enable each of us to make the right decisions for ourselves and our families."
2020-08-19 11:07,"Unfortunately some of the data is flawed or deliberately distorted, Florida for sure, so any risk assessment has a lot of uncertainty attached.  Dr. Rosenthal should be loudly advocating a public health standard for test data, mortality, etc. so that prudent people can then make reasonable decisions.

I know I can't trust what comes out of the White House or from Mr. Pillow.

I can see a number that tells me something about my local rate of positive tests, but not really know which kind of test, how reliable the test is, and so on.  So it is either too early to think about the risk or we must acknowledge how little we really know at this point."
2020-08-19 11:09,"I think that from a commercial perspective, this pandemic has highlighted my risk tolerance about what I require vs. what I used to do simply to amuse myself.

2020-08-19 11:27,"While the NIH/CDC Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories manual states coronavirus is a level 2 risk, it refers to pre-COVID 19. Under that definition, it can be handled safely using Biosafety Level 2 protocols and controls, but is advised to use Biosafety Level 3 for some instances. Here is the definition of Risk Group 2 (corresponding to BSL2):

Agents associated with human disease that is rarely serious and for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are often  available.

Risk Group 4:

Agents likely to cause serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are not usually available (high individual risk and high community risk)

Here is the is the definition of BSL4:

Biosafety Level 4 is required for work with dangerous and exotic agents that pose a  high  individual  risk  of  aerosol-transmitted  laboratory  infections  and  life-threatening disease that is frequently fatal, for which there are no  vaccines  or  treatments,  or  a  related agent with unknown risk of transmission.  Agents with a close or identical antigenic relationship to agents requiring  BSL-4 containment must be handled at this level until sufficient data are obtained either to confirm continued work at this level, or re-designate the level.

SARS COVID-19 currently meets more of the criteria for a Risk Group 4 pathogen than Risk Group 2. That is my Risk Assessment."

In Germany I challenged my mental health by going to Dachau, and been robbed in Valencia Spain. There is always risk. In Nepal I sat on a 13 passenger prop plane and watched as an engine caught fire at 8 thousand feet as we crept through the Himalayas. Somewhere in Spain I contracted trench mouth and spent a week with a fever, a swollen mouth delirious and scared. In Mexico City I got amoebic dysentery and spent days in bed or the bathroom. The corona virus is different but not unmanageable. I stay home 95% of the time, mask in public, and wash hands. I stick to my routines and am always cognizant of how others are managing their risk, careful to avoid the less vigilant or complacent."

2020-08-19 11:41,"I don’t think teachers can be reasonably expected to change their work environments into surgeries, nor can we expect young people to suddenly be medical students they can rage at for touching a non-sterile surface.  

I expext many people don’t realize that there is a quiet chaos that runs through most schools. Parents - I think you would agree that there is a degree of chaos in raising children. Now imagine drastically reducing the number of adults - no level of professionalism is going to change the fact that they are massively outnumbered. Add to that the fact that teachers are human and have various political and scientific outlooks too - there are plenty of nonconformist teachers and administrators in every population. It’s going to be very hard to put our students back into an environment where they are very used to behaving in one way and then expect them to maintain these new protocols for months as they relax into the school year."
2020-08-19 11:41,"I agree that for the next several years, we will have to learn to live with the virus.

However, so much of our personal risk tolerance depends on the behavior of others. I can wear a mask, sanitize my hands until they’re raw, but if I go into a store where no one else is doing those things, I am at their mercy. 

And right now we have a significant portion of our citizenry who refuses, through willful ignorance, to take even the smallest steps toward helping to curb this thing. 

Where I live virtually everyone wears a mask indoors. My family and I drove 40 minutes outside the city and no one was wearing a mask anywhere — except the employees of a restaurant where we got ice cream.

Our consumer habits (take out  food, disposable, single use glass and plastic containers, napkins, towels and eating utensils) have all added to the clutter and ugliness on the street. The coronavirus is forcing behavior changes that might just transfigure into manners, grace and social etiquette, elevate dress, improve our grooming habits, focus more attention on the public side of our living residences, tone down and refine music, performance art and outdoor festivals, even make us more circumspect in expressing our romantic intentions.

The pandemic might indeed have a silver lining."
2020-08-19 11:56,"This opinion starts with a key point: we have no idea how long this is going to last.
Ideally, a vaccine currently in development works, and is released to the public in early 2021.  Enough high risk people get the vaccine, relatively quickly, so that they are no longer at risk; and the disease peters out.  And then there are no new diseases like this one.
In reality, we might not get a sufficiently effective vaccine this fast; the vaccine distribution might be poor or inefficient; and there might be a relapse in the fall that forces another lockdown, further devastating our economy.
Worse, our leadership might not respond to these challenges, exacerbating all of these problems (as they have so far).
And then there is the worry no one wishes to speak of: that covid-19 is not a one-shot occurrence, but the start of a trend, perhaps related to climate change or some other human impact on the natural world.  Let's hope not."
2020-08-19 11:58,"I think I see an error here.  The author states that if one is not wearing a mask on the sidewalk the virus ""could be roaming free.""

So i don't wear a mask when walking (it's around my neck) nor am i afraid of others passing by briefly without a mask outside, but I do the other things the author discusses.  Wearing masks indoors, limiting time around other people indoors, keeping a distance (more than 6 feet) and hand sanitizing (a bottle is always in my pocket)."

In our globalized world, we are likely to get major pandemics once per decade, unless we develop major international public health programs to suppress them the moment that they appear.

This public health defense is more critical than military defense, and we need to treat it with long-term planning and budgeting previously accorded only to the military.

The Trump administration has utterly failed at this, given its denial of scientific facts.  A newly strengthened public health agency should be the top priority of the new Biden administration next year.

2020-08-19 12:12,"Re ""many physicians I know in Covid-19 hot spots say they actually feel safest in the hospital, where procedures like masking and sanitizing are assiduously followed.""

I was in UPMC-Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh two days ago (Aug 17), the flagship hospital of the huge UPMC health system and affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh.  There were countless employees with no masks or masks covering their mouths but not their noses.

I have been in other UPMC facilities in the last two months -- Hillman Cancer Center and Eye & Ear Hospital -- and observed similar behavior among staff and patients.

If we can't count on health system employees to observe sensible and simple precautions, the road ahead looks pretty rocky and estimating the level of risk is no simple task."
2020-08-19 12:13,"I'm not sure what this article is saying, other than one should wear a mask at all times. At one point it seems to say the vaccine will not be a panacea, but my experience tells me the opposite. I have no fear of smallpox, polio, and DPT (whatever that is), the vaccines protect me (and you). The health authorities tell me the flu vaccine is only 60% effective, but I take it every September, and I haven't got the flu in many years now. My observations on the streets of my town clearly indicate maintaining sterile objects is unrealistic, just as inconvenience is not something tolerated by young (not yet) adults. I'm counting on the vaccine."
2020-08-19 12:14,"""Which is why masking should be mandated and enforced. It’s not just about your individual risk tolerance, but about keeping everyone safe.""

With all due respect, Dr. Rosenthal, you might as well have written ""Which is why buying a unicorn should be mandated and enforced.""

In my state, the majority (if not the vast majority of people) refuses to take even this basic step. 

It's not about my risk tolerance. It's about me trying to avoid getting or spreading this disease while my fellow citizens have decided it is a hoax."
2020-08-19 12:16,"But if you decide due to the situation to postpone a routine medical screen for a couple of months because you have decided you can accept the risk that you're one of the small minority of people who will find a problem and whose outcome would be significantly different if that finding were briefly delayed, you get called fearful and irrational."
2020-08-19 12:17,"My risk tolerance has evolved. Fortunately I live in a state with a low positivity rate and a city where no one enters any business without a mask, even small children. I’ve always gone to the grocery store, but I no longer rush through or feel the need to sanitize every item I purchase as I once did. Should I be doing that? I don’t know. On a practical level disinfectant wipes are hard to come by and I need to conserve on them. On an emotional level it became too draining. I can’t imagine flying. I don’t think leaving my own state is a good idea. Eating in a restaurant not an option in my state and I wouldn’t do it anyway. The same goes for bars that never opened in my state after the lock down was lifted. Overall my risk tolerance appears to be low. It limits my life greatly but I’ve accepted this is life for now. Not being 35 with decades of life ahead I do sometimes wonder if so many precautions are robbing me of living more fully. It’s a philosophical question I don’t have a definitive answer to. I’m prepared to go the distance with being cautious as are most all my friends. I wish more Americans felt that way. I resent them for being so selfish. It prolongs all our misery. Personally what I find most difficult is the lack of national resolve and the feeling we are all collectively in this together. It makes the sacrifice much more sad and lonely."
2020-08-19 12:20,"My wife and I are eating at outdoor restaurants at quiet times and beginning to venture out to a few museums. Parks are usually no problem as long as not badly crowded.

I have several relatives on university faculties. One of them has a faculty betting pool as to how quickly the university will have to close down as soon as students return. There is little optimism concerning rule-following in those environs. 

Another relative is being told to teach a large lecture class face to face, although to be fair the lecture halls are carefully spaced, ventilation is improved, everyone will be masked, etc. Still, one wonders how long that circumstance can last. It places many faculty on edge, as has been discussed within these pages.

My wife and I dropped our longstanding local gym membership. They were too lax on requiring clientele to wear masks while indoors, and for us the risk was not worth the cost of gym membership. Fortunately, there are other ways to exercise safely. I understand all the controversy surrounding masks and am sure a good bit of that controversy is contrived on political battle lines, not careful medical science.

 We live in a semi-rural environs, so our day to day risk is a bit easier to manage than some. Uncertainty will continue to rule, for now. Our tolerance will shift as things unfold."

2020-08-19 12:27,"Dr. Rosenthal is not a conventional risk-taker. She places herself in risky situations and accepts a level of risk that seems horrifying to the average person because she is psychologically engineered that way. She chose a career that delivers an intense experience. She chooses to be heroic annd we need people like her and rely on them.

Nevertheless, I think she might not viscerally understand how the average person perceives risk. Because she is a doctor, she is empowered with both knowledge and technology to protect herself. She is not helpless. 

Many people, however, are nothing like her --- mentally, educationally, technologically and. psychologically.  

They may be at higher risk than she is even in her career. And we do not seek out risk for the idealistic reasons that she does. 

Getting back to ""normal,"" depending on one's age and physical condition, could bring with it a death sentence. And even for young, healthy people, a miserable and perhaps prolonged or even permanent damage to health. 

This country is seething and crawling with aggressive science deniers and mask-haters. They raise the level of risk exponentially. There is no reasonable way that I can see to change their behavior. 

You can't ""uncatch"" the virus. If you have chosen to dine out, attend a wedding, go to a party or a public event, you have taken a risk for what seems to be a transitory pleasure.  That is not ""getting back to normal"" life IMO."

Everyone born in the past has died.  This is the order of things.  But the manner of death and our adaptations to it have been honed over time to better our odds.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, tuberculosis was a fact of life (and death).  People were stricken with ""consumption"" as they watched the disease run rampant.  But we learned what to do to protect ourselves before we had any effective treatment.  It was only in the middle of the 20th century effective treatments were found beginning with streptomycin, PAS and INH but rates of TB had been falling well beforehand and the rate of improvement did not increase with active therapies.

Why?

Improved living conditions with less crowding and the emergence of active public health services with case controls were the primary reasons.  Including, yes, masks.

TB showed its resilience in the shadow of HIV/AIDS and human behavior, especially non-adherence to treatment, has led to XDR-TB, now increasingly difficult to treat.

This history will be repeated with our current pathogens of SARS-CoV-2 and those yet undiscovered yet we should remember our most significant improvements in control and treatment come with improvements in living standards, sanitation and public health long before active treatments or vaccines.

Bring on masks, social distancing and contact tracers and lets get on with life again."
2020-08-19 12:39,"Three months ago I swore that, at age 60, I would never eat out at a restaurant again, or at least for a couple of years until after a vaccine was developed.

Yesterday my girlfriend and I (both retired) passed by an IHOP and decided to take a peek inside.

There were two cars in the parking lot.  There were four patrons seated at two separate booths far away from each other.  We walked inside, wearing masks.  We were seated at a similarly remote booth, took of our masks... the tables were bare, no condiments, menus, nothing.  Everything was clean and the wait staff all wore masks.

I felt safe and must confess that it was great eating food prepared by someone else at a place we had frequented hundreds of times prior to the lockdown in March. 

I don't plan on making dining out a habit again, as I no longer feel the desire to do so.  

But it was nice to push the envelope a little bit."
2020-08-19 12:39,"Acceptance is one approach to risk, but there's also no shame in avoiding unnecessary risks (e.g. choosing not to ride a motorcycle or take up rock climbing), mitigation (wearing a helmet or seatbelt, or transferring (paying someone else to bear a risk for you -- there's a reason doctors are well compensated)"
2020-08-19 12:40,"Inconsistent implementation  of what we know works is the issue.  If community spread is under control, schools and businesses could reopen with limited risk. We also need to be clear about face coverings - no gators or masks with valves and COVER YOUR NOSE.  Public health measure only work if we all take personal responsibility so that the risk for all is reduced."
2020-08-19 12:52,I don't really understand the point of this article. You're saying to take reasonable precautions. That is already what the vast majority of people are doing.
2020-08-19 12:53,"All very sensible and true, but unfortunately as I suspect the author knows fully, there are very few places where the appropriate authorities have “set the stage properly.”

So until that changes, now unlikely even with a change of government administration, we’ll all be stuck with our own irrational approaches.

So long science, it was good while it lasted."
2020-08-19 12:58,"Here again we have someone with high risk tolerance - laudable for a physician on the front lines - who does not understand the sociological and psychological effects of this pandemic. 

We are not in a position to resume life as usual. And while this is not the Black Death, it is communicable by otherwise asymptomatic people to those who can and will die or experience long-term negative effects.

On top of that, our communities are not compliant with safety standards and there's no reason to expect that this will change. We have no real testing going on and because contagion is not necessarily associated with illness everyone is a potential threat. 

The communal loss from this disease is also great and this won't change because of a lecture by a physician telling us to resume life. Schools are unsafe. We can't go to theaters, concerts, religious gatherings, most restaurants or bars. On and on I could go.

Dr. Rosenthal does not seem to understand that none of this changes without a widespread vaccine and the fear reduction that would come with effective treatments.

In point of fact, pre-scientific societies did shut down for smallpox, TB, and many other outbreaks. Lacking technology to maintain any economic activity, whole communities collapsed. We're doing the best we can under these circumstances and lectures by out of touch physicians change nothing. We should thank her for her medical efforts but she should leave the psychology and sociological analyses to others."
2020-08-19 13:05,"Republican authorities, starting of course with Trump, have bungled the response to the virus.  Especially, we lack the testing and tracing capabilities that would allow safe opening up.  So there is a huge political dimension to the response of individuals.  Voting for Republicans simply means that little will be done collectively aside from support for a vaccine and other medications, and there is a good chance that premature introduction of these things for political purposes will be harmful.  It is unlikely that the coronavirus will be gone by January 2020 and it is important to have people in charge who will actually take meaningful measures."
2020-08-19 13:08,"I watched Taiwanese news yesterday and one thing was abundantly clear, the government wants to inform people how to prevent the spread of disease.  During each commercial break, at least one public announcement was made teaching proper hygiene and techniques for social distancing in multiple settings such as shopping and exercise.   We can't just stop dead in our tracks waiting for the all clear, we must take proper precautions and continue living the best we can."
2020-08-19 13:11,"The author seems to propose that we individually assess our risk tolerance. I think—from the maskless to those living in a a bubble—we are already living that way and it’s deadly chaos, with the mildly symptomatic inadvertently passing the virus on to those who will die or suffer greatly. This is a public health emergency and I’m tired of the selfish entitlement of individual choice around masks and social distance. We aren’t given such options with seat belts and similar requirements.  What we are missing are national standards for management and containment. And we are also missing what other successful countries have, which is much greater individual willingness to cooperate with common sense practices. Speaking as an older person with a chronic condition, when rational, data driven practices are put in place I’ll be much more comfortable exiting my bubble."
2020-08-19 13:12,"While I believe that science is real and that the virus requires special ""handling"", I'm not going to lock myself inside.  My view is that this virus will not go away-ever.  Even if a vaccine is developed, it will only be partially effective.  Most anti-vaxxers will not, under any circumstances, get the vaccine.  I'll likely get the vaccine but wait a few months until the efficacy/safety numbers get tallied before getting in line.  My wife and I are in our late 60s. Our kids are out of the house.  We have plenty of room so there's no real punishment in staying home.  My basic strategy is to always wear a mask when out, maintain physical distance from others and do frequent hand washing.  I've gone to coffee shops and restaurants where I can order and sit outside.  I've just added Covid to the long list of ways that I might die.  I think the schools problem will be difficult to resolve and that if the virus is rampant this fall/winter, the incidence of mental illness and social malaise will be very high. Outcomes would be better if we had a more educated and disciplined population.  Oh well...."
2020-08-19 13:18,"My wife and I are both in the high-risk age group. We have neighbors who recently hosted a party with 20  guests.  Knowing that none would be masked or socially distant, we declined their invitation.  When we did, the husband opined that we have a low risk tolerance.

He oversimplified the matter, as does the author of this article.  Our decision not to mingle with his guests was based on a cost-benefit analysis.  How much benefit did we foresee being derived from attending this party vs. the cost of potentially contracting COVID?  Applying similar thinking, for the foreseeable future, we plan to continue cooking our own food rather than eating in a restaurant.  And conversely, if we weren’t retired, we’d return to work in order to avoid the risk of upending our careers. 

We will eventually expand our bubble when, for instance, a more efficacious treatment and/or vaccine become available. These are factors that will change our risk-benefit calculation.  Unfortunately, the absence of a coherent national policy on managing this virus coupled with the fact that so many of our fellow citizens refuse to take reasonable precautions because it “violates (their) freedom,” only complicates matters."
2020-08-19 13:18,"I am a scientist, and I realize that risk exists on a spectrum from zero to maximum and that there may be many acceptable places on that spectrum where I am OK with the risks.

But here is my problem with this line of thinking: I am not comfortable (or capable) of making this risk assessment on behalf of other people, who may disagree with me with what represents an acceptable point of risk on that spectrum, and may face compounding circumstances (think preexisting conditions, or advanced age) that I do not share.

Any risk assessment has to take into account not just the risk to oneself but the risk that one poses to others. Recent history has shown us that a lot of Americans are either incapable or unwilling to assess risk to others and think only of risks to themselves. Just think of the mask protesters who constantly bellow ""You're wearing a mask, why do you care if I do not?!""

If we are going to make a rational assessment of the risks AS A SOCIETY we have to be able to have discussion about those risks in the context of their impacts in aggregate, not just in ones own life. This is a huge challenge under normal conditions, and when we can't even get American to agree that masks aren't a conspiracy to track us using 5G technology, this seems like somewhat of a lost cause.

So I try to assess the risks not as I would to myself, but as one of my cancer patients with a compromised immune system would. This is not easy, but we have to do it."
2020-08-19 13:18,"I live in a place where the virus is not under control.  Until last week, when I visited a few non-essential retail stores, I had only been in a grocery store and a home improvement store since March.  I am a long way from sitting in a restaurant or taking a vacation, and I am comfortable with that.

What concerns me is lumping school openings into a discussion about personal choice and risk.   Opening schools is more of a societal mandate than a personal choice for most students and teachers.  And while schools will be safe for most students and staff with proper guidelines enforced, it cannot possibly be ignored that most states have not come close to reaching the government recommended threshold for reopening the economy, much less schools.  So while I may be comfortable enough to go into a store to buy new clothes, that does not mean I think schools should open.

When it comes to opening schools, I believe very strongly that the guidelines by the CDC and epidemiologists should be strictly adhered to.  In other words, no ‘let’s give it a shot’ allowed.  And let’s be honest, those people with a higher threshold for risk are the biggest factor in why schools aren’t opening safely in this country.  In this case, personal choice impacts the society at large and, sometimes, people need to make choices for the greater good.  If we want schools open, people may need to adjust their personal risk assessment to get community case levels down.  That is just reality."
2020-08-19 13:23,"In our business we manage risk every day. We are woodworkers and we use potentially dangerous tools and machinery every day, all day. We are exposed to varying levels of environmental hazards as well. The first lesson of our safety program is the hazard or risk never goes away, whether mitigated by PPE or engineering controls or guards and fixtures or safe operating procedures, dangers are always present. I started woodworking more than half a century ago and can count the minor injuries I have incurred on my fully functional and intact hands, all of which occurred when I forgot the ever present risk. We follow procedures and protocols that yield a predictable result, no injury. Assessing risk has to include understanding the hazard and following clear protocols and widespread compliance to mitigate risk for everyone to a tolerable and predictable level. The fundamental concept of risk mitigation is the same whether you are being launched into space, visiting the super market or working in the ER."
2020-08-19 13:24,"Risk assessments are difficult to make when too many people, of the Republican variety especially, follow Trump and Fox more than the science, or deem the pandemic a Democratic “hoax” that will magically end the day after the election (somehow ignoring the fact that the whole world has been hit hard by Covid-19 and dealt with it rationally).  As a result, in addition to the steps suggested by Dr. Rosenthal in the article, I also take steps to minimize my contact with people unlikely to “believe” in Covid-19.  For example, although I am sure my dentist adheres strictly to all protocols in the office, I also know that it is a very Republican staff (FOX news always on its TVs until I suggested something neutral like HGTV and very evangelical). Thus, I have less confidence that the staff members practice safe Covid measures away from work. So, I am switching to my spouse’s dentist that I have more “Covid confidence” in, because the staff there more likely takes Covid seriously even away from work. How sad when risk assessment logically must take service providers’ politics into account."
2020-08-19 13:25,"As a physician, I agree entirely with the sentiments expressed in this opinion article.  The Hong Kong flu epidemic in 1968 killed about 150,000 Americans when our population was significantly smaller.  When the AIDS epidemic began, the mortality rate was not less than 1% which is the current mortality rate of COVID-19, but 100%.  In neither of these epidemics did we shut down like we have with the current pandemic.  I think the time is right for opening America up while being prudent about social distancing and wearing masks.  Connecticut, where I live, has done an excellent job in this regard.  So has New Hampshire where my family and I have a second home and spend much time there.  I feel safe going to restaurants and other public places where safeguards are by and large adhered to.  
I have had influenza three times, including the 1968 Hong Kong flu epidemic.  The last time occurred four years ago, and my fever reached 104.5, accompanied by 7 hours of uncontrollable rigors. That was despite having received the flu vaccine and started Tamiflu as soon as I had symptoms. My wife thought that I was dying and indeed our hospital had 4 deaths from influenza that year, including 2 young healthy women in their 30's.  If the press wrote about influenza the way they have covered COVID-19, no one would want to venture out of their house at any time."
2020-08-19 13:27,"‘In those places where governments, businesses and administrators have set the stage properly, we can — with sensible precautions — begin to live again.” This is what is required in every city, county and state in our country. Why have we not done this ?"
2020-08-19 13:28,"I think the author is trying to make an important point about risk assessment. However, as a professional involved in risk assessment for many years, one thing that is typically overlooked is what’s called an “uncertainty analysis” as part of the process. The reality is, with the dearth of scientifically sound information on COVID-19, we simply will have a high degree of uncertainty until this is all over."
2020-08-19 13:30,"Read the first part of this piece carefully.

We are unfamiliar with having to think about how to avoid or manage contracting an illness that can kill or maim us.  Western life has not prepared us for this.

Less than 100 years ago, that was a common thought.  Our ancestors knew that some of their children could and probably would die early, that they might die in childbirth, and that their spouse could die young and leave them and their children alone.

If you are in a high-risk category, you need to have end-of-life plans outlined.  Learn from your medical providers what precautions you need to take.  They will tell you if you are performing a high-risk task by shopping or flying.  If you are immune-compromised, you probably need an N95.  You might get one from your physician, or get help finding a source for them.  

If you aren't high-risk but you have relatives that are, you need to understand what your loved ones want done, and you need to decide how your actions put them at risk.  Again, medical professionals can help you with information.  They won't be able to lower your risk to zero.  

Nothing will, except and isolation room."
2020-08-19 13:30,"Risk tolerance includes assessing the fact that  can't trust many of our community members to be responsible.  Or for institutions to get it right.  My wife was hospitalized for 5 days last week, not for Covid.  The hospital has signs by the elevators -- to help prevent the spread of Covid, no more than 5 people on an elevator.  5.  IMO, that's insane.  They're only allowing one visitor per patient, so you don't have a situation where there's one parent with multiple kids.  If a staff team is needed to go with a patient, they have staff elevators, and if they need to ""commandeer"" a public elevator, obviously that's an exception.  

It's great to say let's go back to normal, but in a couple of months, the options for doing things outside start to decrease.  I do walk a lot and have gotten together with a friend at a time to eat lunch in a park, or play music together, at a distance.  Even though it can stay warm in the DC area through November in some years, obviously it gets iffier."
2020-08-19 13:30,"Dr. Rosenthal writes: ""In addition to wearing masks and social distancing when not at home, we should avoid prolonged periods in indoor spaces with crowds or strangers.""

Unfortunately, being crowds or strangers for prolonged periods defined the lives of most Americans, at least in urban settings, pre-COVID. 

Recent outbreaks at Notre Dame University and UNC-Chapel Hill teach us that we don't always have the final say when it comes to risk tolerance.

As a trial lawyer, I was often asked by clients questions along this line: ""What is our percentage chance of losing this case?""

I would respond: I will answer your question but begin by warning you that it is a guess, an educated guess to be sure. However, you should keep in mind that if I tell you that you have a 50-50 chance of winning or a 90% chance of winning, it won't matter if you are in the wrong 50% or wrong 10% because then it will be a 100% loss. Instead, what you should evaluate from a business point of view is what would the effect of losing the case be on your ongoing business. Can you handle that or find a way to mitigate it, just in case? 
Most of the time, my clients decided to try the case. We won at trial and a couple of times when I lost (note that ""we won"" and ""I lost"") we got the bad result reversed on appeal.

Risk tolerance is easy to write about in the abstract. In real life handling risk intelligently is far more complex and not always in our control."
2020-08-19 13:32,I expected to hear more from the AMA and professional nursing groups demanding that society invest in their protection.  Asking nurses and physicians to treat sick people without adequate Personal Protective Equipment is like asking a firefighter to run into an occupied burning building without an air pack or a hose.  People who are trained to work in risky environments for the benefit of all of us must be supported by those in society who choose not to do so.
2020-08-19 13:33,"Countries where healthcare advice is not secretly thought to be another way for  insurance/pharma/medico entities to make a buck, have done much better."
2020-08-19 13:34,"Dr Rosenthal implies that school can easily make their buildings, classrooms and offices safe for teachers and students. This is not the case. 
And not just in states that have been lax in enforcing masks and social distancing but throughout the country. 
My wife works in a school. The ventilation system was not built to deal with blocking the circulation of coronavirus cells through air vents. Like many work buildings, none of the windows can be opened to bring in fresh air. There is no money or plans for the exorbitant project of retrofitting the ventilation system to make it safe.
Dr. Rosenthal's parenthetical reference to ""those teachers not in high risk groups"" underplays the severity of the threat. According to a July 10 Kaiser report, 1 in 4 of US teachers is in such a high risk group. If we consider family members of teachers (older parents and all the high risk groups) then it's more like a majority of teachers who cannot afford to go back to work in an environment that is unsafe. There is no funding or serious work being done to make schools safe for teachers. 
Yes, let's take calculated risks to get out of our homes and back to a more normal work life - but not on the backs of vulnerable teachers."
2020-08-19 13:40,"I have followed all of the guidance since the beginning of the spread. I have lost my job and I am about to lose my home. I wish we had never shut down.
I would rather take my chance with the virus."
2020-08-19 13:42,"""There are many knowable parameters in the equation: your health; the prevalence of cases where you live; the safety precautions being taken any place you want to visit. But the final answer may depend on your individual risk tolerance for exposure to infectious disease.""

There are a few knowable parameters, and yes, of course the answer depends on risk tolerance. But there are lots of key unknowns too. You may be healthy, but still very susceptible. Although you may know the safety precautions of public places, you don't know how well these will be enforced. We know the bug is very contagious, but we don't know how far it can practically spread, or how long an exposure is necessary, and answers to some of these questions will be different for different people. 

Maybe we will need to learn to live with this virus as a common danger for a long period of time or forever, but we don't know this yet. Within 6 months or so, we expect to have not only vaccines coming on line, but treatments too, such as an antibody cocktail that has proven to be potent in the lab. It may be that a year from now, even if you get the virus, it will be treatable as a routine matter - you go in, get a couple of antibody shots, and you're good. 

We've lost perhaps 200,000 people so far - 2/3 of the US combat deaths in WWII - and many of these people died unnecessarily. Lots of people continue to die daily because they're trying to tough it out. Lets not jump the gun."
2020-08-19 13:47,"Dr Rosenthal states: ""So as states and cities engineer sensible reopening policies...""

Sensible reopening policies? What are those? Here in Ohio one must wear a mask in a bar, except when drinking. One must wear a mask in a restaurant, except when eating. Those playing contact sports, and thus breathing heavily, are not required to wear a mask. 

Does any of this sound sensible?

I'm eager to go back out into the world, and recognize that there will be some risk once I do so. Unlike our leaders, I understand that the virus will not magically disappear. Let me know when we get those sensible policies instead of political theater providing fantasy, pretend measures of safety while prioritizing the economy over human life."
2020-08-19 13:55,"Here is a point missed by this and all other articles I have read about this topic: We need masks that protect the WEARER.  I trust very few people to look out for my health, and I certainly can't assess the risk of strangers not doing the right things to protect ME.  If we had masks that protect the person wearing them, then much of this problem would be solved: Anyone who has low risk tolerance and wants to protect themselves can wear a mask, and people with greater tolerance for risk who don't care about protecting themselves don't have to."
2020-08-19 13:59,"The smart people understand that this is not going away any time soon, if ever.  The problem is the smart people aren't the ones making the decisions.

The interconnected nature of the global economy is what's allowed so many to experience large improvements in their lives.  Especially in countries with relatively corruption free, stable governments.

With the responses we've seen by governments around the world we're going back into time a century or more.  One can certainly stop a very large train very quickly.  But picking up the pieces and getting it going again is another matter.  The economic damage will be at least as great as the 1929 crash.  But probably much, much worse.  Today every government and pretty much all people are so in debt they don't have any capacity to take on debt.  What's going to happen is what happened in the years after the crash.

Those that are hoping for an FDR type effort had better think again.  There was plenty of evidence that all that spending, while providing some relief, did not get the economy going again.  It was WWII that did."

It is shameful that you are wagging your finger at those of us who are in ""lockdown"" when this may be the best measure for containing the virus.  I feel for those without the privilege to be less risky during these times, but less risk taking is not the appropriate response for the rest of us."
2020-08-19 12:39,"Why did the doctor need to pull her mask tighter when she was with the TB patient?  If he was wearing a mask, she was protected, right??  

Someone should tell her that, per the NYT commenters and some other media sources, we are only protected if OTHER people wear a mask.  OUR mask does not protect us.  

Given this new ""fact"", why was the dr wearing a mask at all?  The patient already had TB.  What was her mask protecting him from?  Some other disease?"
2020-08-19 13:11,"It honestly kind of blows my mind that there were apparently scores of people who previously gave no thought whatsoever to touching everything out in public and skipping hand washing.

As a resident of a state whose governor yammers on and on about ‘freedom’ and ‘personal responsibility’ while it is obvious that the irresponsible minority abuses their freedom to place all of us at risk, I strongly support her call for mandatory masking. One minor disagreement: perhaps the post office could install automatic doors, but I would much rather they use the money to make sure that the mail is delivered in a timely way, so that we can all vote safely this November. I have no need to go to the post office; I buy my stamps online and ship packages by weighing them on my digital kitchen scale, then arrange for a pickup by my local carrier."
2020-08-19 11:02,"Let's be clear...the coronavirus is but one of two pandemics.  The first causes COVID-19,  a life-threatening disease, which attacks our bodies. The second is Trumpism which attacks one's capacity to reason and one's moral compass.

We hope to have vaccines in 2021 to keep us safe from the coronavirus, but there is no hope of a vaccine to protect us from Trumpism. Even after Trump is gone, Trumpism, which has infected a third of our nation, will continue to prevent its victims from being able to discern conspiracy theories from reality and from being able to recognize right from wrong.

Long after America is able to open up, people emerge from their homes, attend schools and go to work and restaurants, we will still be living with the Trumpism virus.

Which is the greater threat?  Medical science is developing new treatments for COVID-19 and the coronavirus itself will have a vaccine to stop its spread.  The Trumpism virus cannot be cured and there is no vaccine to prevent a future outbreak.

The coronavirus is killing hundreds of thousands of Americans.  The Trumpism virus may kill America."

Human ignorance plus stupidity about COVID-19 makes risk assessment universally impossible. 

What we know is that human beings with underlying chronic health problems such as diabetes, heart and lung disease plus being 65 years or older while Black and brown working essential jobs makes you a COVID-19 buffet and petri dish.

It should be humbling and humiliating that the best that our human health medical science can currently provide as a defense to the COVID-19 infectious disease pandemic threat is wearing masks and social distancing.

There is a very strong probability that there will never be a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19.  Like malaria, HIV/AIDS and the common cold it may remain an endemic infectious disease danger after we are able to reduce it to a regional recurring epidemic.  

Treatable by safe and effective human three phased clinical trials therapeutics.  Which will still be very difficult with a new virus.

Approaching it from another related angle, how many deaths are acceptable?  Our national cultural gun sickness, an aberration re our peer countries results in app. 40k deaths yearly. Ditto for auto fatalities. App. 100k+ people die from infections in hospitals, app. 60-100k die from the flu every year.

Basically follow the guidelines set by people like Fauci but don't lock down the country completely and forever otherwise you will have problems greater than the pandemic. 

Cuomo might have blown it in the beginning with the nursing home situation but got his act together and the proof is the low Covid 19 death rate now. On some days you are more likely to get killed by a car or murdered than die from covid 19."
2020-08-19 12:38,"If this is true: ""the final answer may depend on your individual risk tolerance for exposure to infectious disease,"" we are all at great risk. Society relying upon individual decisionmaking needs to take into account the lowest common denominator - the worst actors.  And they are really bad.  People who don't wear masks or if forced to wear one do so only on their chin or over their mouths with their noses exposed.  What this virus has exposed is just how many people are awful, selfish human beings.  It's a mask, and they can't even be bothered to do that.  In short, planning and risk assessment aren't going to work.  Staying away from people is."
2020-08-19 13:02,"There is no balancing the risk against some normalcy, if the normalcy change the balance. It is as simple as that.
And even if you survive the virus, we already know, the virus does lasting harm, parts of your lungs are dead tissue forever, you will be permanently out of breath. Your heart can suffer serious damage. You may not die now, but your life will be misery, and you die sooner than without the infection. But up to now we do not know how many will be affected and how serious the long lasting impact of the infection is. 

And from a country like america i expect to do better. Get the infection rate down to the rate of other developed countries, this is the least you should expect. Than we can talk about normal."
2020-08-19 10:55,"You can keep your admonishing advice, Dr. Rosenthal. In the era of Trumpism and its perilous lack of professional leadership, where every message from the government feels like a rotten sleigh of hand, I reserve the right to risk my life to be a good consuming citizen again at a time of my own choice, thank you very much."
2020-08-19 12:02,"I agree that it's time to get back to work and school. Is there some risk? Yes, but if you told me that people with cancer had a 98.5% recovery rate I'd take it in a heartbeat.

So why are we so afraid? Because mass media, including the NYTimes have spent the last four months beating our fears like a drum.

The news is always how many new cases? How many new deaths? You never hear about the many treatments that front line doctors are using successfully and often quietly.

Carrying the virus SARSCoV-2 does not mean you will come down with the disease Covid-19. Nor does it mean you are likely to die from it.

But we're in a headlong rush to promote an untested vaccine that even its supporters now claim may not be more than 50% effective. Even Mayor di Blasio now claims that restaurants can't have indoor dinning until their is a vaccine? This is nuts.

If we allow this kind of policy driven by cherry picked and often inaccurate science to guide us then we are lost. It's also time to take the partisanship out of the equation.

Everything the Trump administration suggests isn't wrong and everything the liberal media promotes isn't right.

The science on Covid is unsettled. We wish it weren't, but that's the nature of science as it seeks to understand any new phenomena.

But with basic common sense we can go back to work, back to school and concentrate on strengthening our immune system so that IF we get an infection our bodies will fight it off like a bad case of flu."
2020-08-19 11:38,"On small problem with this theory. It is fine to assess your personal risk, but when others refuse to take even the most limited of precautions, the risk level of everyone else goes way up. It is like telling someone to drive carefully and then hear they got killed by a drunk driver. 

There are simply too many reckless people out there whose ignore the risks to themselves, and, in doing so, raise the risk for everyone else."
2020-08-19 10:10,"If only we lived in a country where science and concern for your fellow man, was the overriding ideation of our government and the majority of our fellow citizens.

Is any concrete assessment even possible with these two factors at play? In a global pandemic?

Sorry Ms. Rosenthal, this seems to be an analysis based on too outsize an IF... hard pass!

I’m going to live defensively right now, the same way you’d drive a car with wheels falling off. This chaos is a real life, bad sequel to “Speed“!!"
2020-08-19 11:26,"This article seems to be saying in part, If I can be a brave doctor, you can be a brave teacher. But it’s missing a clear explanation of how teachers can be kept reasonably safe. After all, teaching involves spending long periods of time indoors with crowds, which is precisely one of the situations Dr Rosenthal deems unsafe."
2020-08-19 14:05,"I agree wholeheartedly with Dr Rosenthal assessment. Like the flu that kills 200,000 Americans every year,the corona virus might be with us for a long while.However the unhealthy lifestyle of many Americans has to be addressed.
I am not a doctor but there has to be a correlation  in the way the virus reacts in people that are obese,smoke,abuse alcohol,use recreational drugs on a regular basis or lead a sedentary lifestyle.It's not just the virus itself but also how well a vaccine will work for them"
2020-08-19 11:43,"The president threatened not to fund schools that did not have in classroom teaching .We see many gatherings of people having a party. In some states wearing a mask is only suggested. Many businesses say the pandemic be damned and they must be opened to full capacity to survive. So yes, personal risk tolerance is important because with a lack of a cohesive approach to contain this virus,that is a person’s only defense."

Risk is a part of life."
2020-08-19 14:08,"I am 73 and expect to be living to some extent with coronavirus risk for the rest of my life. We do not know nearly enough about this disease at this point. In addition to the fact that we don't know how long immunity might last if a person gets and recovers, we have no idea what the long-term effects might be. Recently, I have read that young healthy people with mild cases who have recovered may have heart  or lung damage. Others are affected with cognitive decline; others are disabled by fatigue and a return of illness over months. In other words, we have no idea how this disease will affect us overall. We also will not be able to get a handle on the pandemic until there is a new administration running the country. Right now, it is out of control. Everybody;s risk tolerance should be a lot lower than it is now."
2020-08-19 14:09,"I live on Cape Cod. By mid March our small peninsula was crowded with tourists, which usually does not happen till the end of June.Many are not wearing masks.

I’m 63 with no pre-existing conditions, except for having to purchase health insurance through the ACA  since my husband retired last September, he is 66 and has Medicare. I retired as an RN about the same time, due to long standing shoulder and back injuries related to 30 years working as a RN at my local hospital.My bronze policy costs $678.84 every month. Covers 2 physicals a year,a mammogram every year, and a colonoscopy every 3 years.My deductible is $3800. So the 2 virtual visits I had since April cost me $500. So I have paid over $8000 in less than a year . You better believe I’m not going anywhere. I grocery shop every 10 days, at 7:30
In the morning. I’m hoping by winter most of the tourists will have left, but they are buying up houses. Wish I had moved to Canada when I had the chance at age 30."
2020-08-19 14:10,"Dear Dr Rosenthal, you certainly have a high risk tolerance. That’s your choice, good for you.
One point of agreement is that we can’t wait for a non existent vaccine to live our lives. 
However, there’s more about this disease that is unknown vs what is known. Health professionals make assertions every week as to what prevention/treatments work without having solid data to back that up, creating enormous confusion and contradictory messages to the public.
We don’t have mass convenient testing available, no effective PPE for general use, no affordable health care or paid time off for many that do get sick. No mention on how to handle the significant number of people that get sick long term and are conveniently left out of the headlines.
When we have a handle on all the above then I agree, we can learn to live with Covid, not one day sooner."
2020-08-19 10:06,"I am not in lockdown.  I go for walks every day.  Go to the grocery store and the pharmacy.   I will go to places where I need something.  But I will not eat indoors at a restaurant or go to a concert, show, or movie.  It's not that I don't trust those places to do the right thing and sanitize.  You can spray Lysol until the cows come home.  But if the next person who comes in and sits down next to you has been irresponsible, refuses to wear a mask, and attends large gatherings without a mask, all that cleaning will do very little good.  I am not afraid of the virus.  I am afraid of my fellow man.  Trump talks all about the rapists and murderers from Mexico.  But the people I am afraid of are the college students who think they have the right to party.  The rest of society be damned.  Pretty hard to limit risk when some of those those around you are are selfish and/or stupid.  The danger isn't coming acropss the border.  It may just be coming through the front door of wherever it is you want to go."
2020-08-19 14:13,"We each need to try to manage our own risk. Some people choose not to wear a mask. Certainly that is their right if masks are not mandated. So where does that leave the people who mask? How do we manage our risk around them? Well, that’s the problem. We can avoid them, but essential workers cannot. When I see unmasked patrons in stores, hotels,  restaurants I get angry. But anger doesn’t solve anything and I think all the anger and vitriol just make people dig their heels in further. The pandemic was mismanaged from the start. Too much controversy, even scientists disagreed at first about masking. It’s all a big mess. And all a big experiment. 

I’ve been a nurse for 40 years, so I trust my own judgement having lived through taking care of a lot of patients with transmittable diseases: Wear a mask, wash your hands, stay distant if possible. Wash your hands immediately; then remove mask, then wash again. Learn to don and doff properly. Take off your shoes before entering your home. Wash items you buy from public places. Limit exposure to crowds; but if you have to be in a crowd, protect yourself as if your life depended on it. N95 for sure. 

This is really all we can do. We have to also be aware of the peer pressure people face. From families, co-workers, friends. This causes stress as well, and makes many practice far less protective actions. 

I wish we were all on the same page with this, but that will never happen. And even with precautions, many will still fall ill."
2020-08-19 14:17,"My 88 year-old aunt had to consider the healath risks of going to the funeral of a favored nephew a month ago.  She did not make her decision to go without a lot of thought.  She went to the funeral but ended up spending the next two weeks self-quarantined and worrying a lot each day and night.  I don't believe she would make the same decision now.  She didn't get ill with Covid-19, but she made herself ill with worry.  The decision to take a risk and the decision that the risk is worth it are not just decisions of physical health, but also decisions of longer term mental health."
2020-08-19 14:19,"Risk tolerance is part of a broader ""cost-benefit"" analysis in which part of the cost is risk of getting infected and risk of spreading infection.  The entire enterprise requires something sorely missing: sufficiently distributed and timely testing and contact tracing. Without these tools, we don't really know the risks we are taking with either getting infected or passing along infection.  Unfortunately, that leaves the least worst calculation remaining: expose yourself and others as little as possible because you must assume the risk is far greater than you know.  We shouldn't have to make this overly negative calculation. We do, though.  Due to a vast lack of knowledge.  Public health interventions require information.  We do not have the information we need, either as individuals or communities.  This must change, or every other consideration is relegated to relative meaninglessness."
2020-08-19 12:29,"""There are many knowable parameters in the equation: your health...""

Really? I for one don't know if my body will create a cytokine storm or what my lungs', my heart's, or my kidneys' reaction would be to coronavirus and I'm willing to bet that a crack team of doctors couldn't tell me either. That by itself makes it IMPOSSIBLE to assess my risk. This is sociology's big problem, right? That science can tell us there will be so many murders in a given city in a given time frame, but it can't tell you if YOU will be murdered."

I am in my seventies with some lung problems and a history of high blood pressure. In your professional opinion, what is the greater risk for me of dying in the next, say, four years?  By catching Covid or raising my blood pressure to astronomical levels by having to listen to  Trump’s daily idiocies emanating from the White House and/or experiencing the consequences of his insane policies for another term? With respect, In risk assessment, everything is relative."
2020-08-19 14:22,"I have underlying conditions and am considered ""old."" Still, I get up early to bicycle, go to the grocery store and pharmacy. When our county opened up hair salons and churches, I waited a few weeks before attending to determine if our COVID infection rate increased.  When it didn't, I went for a haircut and Mass.

College students and school kids will be congregating in my town soon. If things get bad, I'll limit my outside exposure, which I'll have to do anyhow once winter comes to Northern NY.

You can't panic, but you can wear your mask, wash up, and be somewhat antisocial.  It's up to us, as our Government hasn't been much help."
2020-08-19 14:25,"This article is framed around individual risk tolerance. That is probably not a productive way of looking at it. People with a high risk tolerance pose a grave threat others. The article goes into how to protect yourself from contracting the virus, which is great, but our ""temperature"" for risk tolerance should all be the same--as low as humanly possible. 

The title and pre-amble to this article are just troubling.

For example, one's temperature also has almost nothing to do with COVID-19. Only a small number of infections with SARS-CoV-2 result in a higher temperature and only a fraction of elevated temperatures are related to the virus."
2020-08-19 14:28,"I agree with Dr. Rosenthal that, even after taking necessary precautions, there's still an element of risk -- something that's true in pretty much every area of life. But what makes me furious is the lack of consistency we have in the United States, where ""personal freedom"" has outweighed public health in too many places. 

It seems like our tolerance for risk has to be much higher in this country than almost anywhere else in the world. That's a risk I hate taking."
2020-08-19 12:23,"Something that’s never mentioned about masks is that wearing one keeps your fingers out of your mouth and nostrils. I first noticed this while trying to open a plastic bag in the supermarket. 
In days of yore I’d lick my fingers to help find the opening, but with a mask on, I just can’t do it. Being unable to touch my nose, lips and tongue strikes me as a useful counter-infection measure, as important as blocking aerosol transfer. As for getting used to all these small measures, most people have no problem with it, but some legal compulsion would help - too many stupid people out there who won’t accept  the consensus about the need to act together, without exception."
2020-08-19 12:50,"The fact that even Dems want the schools reopened should tell you something.

It should tell you that they've known all along how deadly this virus is NOT for almost everyone.  The deaths over the last several months are real, but are they all from Covid?  Unlikely.  TX does not require a positive blood test to classify a death as Covid.  

The virus is real, but the threat is way, way overblown to everyone, including people over 80.  Dems, using their proxies in the media, whipped it up, though, to cause problems in an election year.  

But even they know that without schools, the country will never move forward, which will hurt THEM in their wallets.  So notice the U-turn on schools.  By Democrats.  

Wake up, sheeple."
2020-08-19 14:13,Fun fact: you don't actually know that businesses that say they are being responsible actually ARE. You cannot accurately assess your risk tolerance if you are going in good faith on bad information. I work for a state university that assured parents and students that we were conducting significant additional cleaning protocols. This is untrue. We lost several housekeepers and have no replacements. These students new housekeepers? Me and my peers. I'm a secretary so naturally I know all about cleaning thousands of square feet efficiently and thoroughly. This is all so ridiculous.
2020-08-19 14:32,"It sounds like you’re trying to put probability on becoming infected based on the activities you might try as opposed to isolating. That’s great for mathematicians, but  am calculating it a different way. It’s surely less scientific and probably less accurate but it works for me.

No matter what I do, the odds of being exposed and contracting the virus are 50/50. There are too many secondary factors that could transmit the virus that wearing mask and gloves don’t cover. Just like the odds of the sun coming up in the morning are 50/50. But of course they’re not accurate.

I have ventured out and seen people wearing masks at the market but they crowd up closely. Unless it’s a dire need, I will leave and return at a different time. I just don’t know who might pose me to the coronavirus and as an older individual with some risk factors, I’m not taking that risk.

I see young people on the street, masks around their chins as they consume food and drink. I steer clear.

I could go on, but you don’t need to other examples from me. They’re numerous.

So I have the luxury of being able to stay home and get deliveries, which I wipe down with disinfectant before putting on the shelves or in the refrigerator. You can call me kooky or whatever, but after having traveled extensively in Asia during December and January, including visits to market and sampling delicious street food, I somehow managed not to get infected. I’ll reduce my risks as close to zero as I can get and read a lot."

Not true for the registration clerks in surgicenters or the lens technicians at the eye doc's office . 

Teachers  are smart and they are educated , and they can asses their risk tolerance , but they can't asses their risks day to day and hour to hour . They don't have years caring for sick people and spinal cord reflexes about staying ""clean"".

 We don't tell firefighters to asses their risk for this event and decide what PPE they might need .

Go to the movies. Dine indoors. Take a flight to a high outbreak zone for vacation and quarantine upon return? Those have very poor rewards to risk given other options. As far as school or office and commuting, can the author tell me which density is acceptable. Many people are participating at a comfort level that is healthy and plenty healthy for the economy."

The only thing that has not been done before is the media trying to convince us that the coronavirus is so very very different that it makes sense to sit in our houses for however long it takes for a vaccine to be developed, be it months or years."
2020-08-19 14:43,"If we want to talk about risk mitigation, why is there not a country-wide campaign to improve indoor air ventilation and purification. We know that the virus is airborne. If we can get it out of the bulk of the air before it can infect anyone (while still using proper social distancing and ppe), we should be able to return to indoor spaces more safely. As far as interim measures go I think it's a pretty sensible one."
2020-08-19 14:45,"A few weeks ago, I went to a regional urgent care health center that had a drive thru testing facility in the town where I live, and got tested for Covid even though I did not experience symptoms. I decided to do this for two reasons; one, my mother who has progressive dementia-Alzheimers was recently admitted to a skilled nursing facility ( which does weekly Covid testing and have been case free for nearly five weeks) and wanted to safeguard my mom during our socially distanced visits.

The other is knowing that asymptomatic individuals could carry the virus and not even know it. Thankfully, my test for Covid came up negative.

My point is that I am willing to take some risk in this time of Covid, but not take an uneducated, potentially dangerous risk. As I see it, you don't bring a pocket knife to a gunfight. 

And, like the old saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."

I am reassured that things have been opening up but the case numbers have not surged (yet?).  I appreciate how methodical your state authorities have been on gradually and slowly opening more venues. I see this as a careful weighing of risk vs. getting back to economic social life. Looks to me like the Yankees are winning this one.

People in TN were stunned when I reported after going to NY that things were STILL opening up in July--but your caseload is down and ours is climbing.  Good for y'all.

My risk tolerance is higher than his because I don’t care if I die (I do care if I get sick as I spent 5 weeks in rehab just a few years ago). Hubby tho does not want to die. Risk tolerance for DEATH drives us."
2020-08-19 14:49,"I'm in total agreement. The problem is that, with the apparent exception of Southwest Airlines (good for them!) virtually no one and no place has been willing to enforce mask rules with exceptions only for the smallest children. 

In Toronto, where masks are ""mandatory"" on public transit, the TTC has said they won't make drivers enforce that rule. Why not? Drivers don't allow passengers to get on without paying the fare -- they are willing to confront them then, so why not when it involves public health? Right now, there are very few places as safe as they should be."

I can't count the number of news pieces I've seen, read or heard that start with: 'Is it safe to do x?'

Unfortunately, there are people that have drastically different risk tolerance profiles e.g. the Yosemite free climber or the elderly man working out in the gym without a mask. When an individuals action impacts their community who gets to decide what behaviors are appropriate for an acceptable level of societal risk tolerance?"
2020-08-19 14:56,"The key message here, ""In those places where governments, businesses and administrators have set the stage properly..."" Unfortunately, this is not the case in too many places. Texas, Florida, Georgia to name a few. My home state, Utah, doesn't rank very high on the list either. In places where governors and their governments refuse to acknowledge the risks and pretend that nothing is happening, very little is left to progress. They, along with Trump himself, are the reasons why the US is number one in Covid illnesses and deaths. And that number one ranking is the reason why many of us remain in quarantine."
2020-08-19 15:01,"I agree with the perspective in this article, and it's how I make my own choices.

I think of what my risk profile would be if I lived how I used to before the pandemic: riding the subway every day; sharing recirculated air with strangers most days in restaurants, retail stores, bars, etc.; not taking care to wash my hands as soon as I come home or use hand sanitizer after touching things like doorknobs or money. 

Then I think of how I've reduced that risk by not riding the subway at all, limiting time inside with shared air to grocery shopping once per week, limiting time in prolonged proximity to people to outdoor dining once a week, being diligent about washing my hands frequently and using hand sanitizer. My risk is not zero, but it's much reduced. 

I'm comfortable with that much-reduced risk level, given my health status. Restricting my ability to leave the apartment completely for this many months would also have a pretty negative impact on my mental health, since I live alone, so I balance the potential risk to my physical health with the assured impact to my mental health.

Everyone can, and will, decide their own risk tolerance. The author wasn't suggesting what your personal risk tolerance should be, or that it should be lower than it is, just that you should consider it in terms of a scale and what you're comfortable with. It's the only way we can ease in to reopening the economy while balancing our health."
2020-08-19 15:01,"I am relatively young, and very fit and active, and my enjoyment of life pretty much depends on staying like this. So my risk tolerance is informed by my priorities. I want to keep hiking and biking and climbing — if I contract the virus and am left with long-term respiratory issues, will I be able to continue to do all that? Is it worth risking giving up all these activities that enhance my life so much to go out to a restaurant? Get a haircut? Go to the supermarket? Go to the doctor? Send my kids to school? Go to the office and do work that I can just as easily do from home? Are any of these things worth the small risk that I die and leave my family in a terrible and extremely unhappy situation?

None of these questions have simple answers, but clearly some of these activities are worth the small risks that go with them, while others clearly are not. But the fact is that, when it comes to non-mandatory activities, we have none of the information necessary to make this calculation. What are the real risks, both to my life and long-term health? If I end up being somebody with long-term virus-related issues, is there reasonable hope I can return to my normal life after three months? Or six? Or a year? My family needs to eat, so the supermarket seems worth the risk. But we can cook at home — and enjoy cooking — so the restaurant trip hardly seems worth the deep uncertainty."
2020-08-19 15:03,"I have worked in a clean lab for many decades. I know how to behave and how to take advantage of and handle PPE, for the purpose of achieving very low contamination levels. The article presents a false option. It is not about accepting a level of risk, it is about doing everything possible to reduce the risk. In my labs, I had the ability to require adherence to careful procedures and the option to fire anyone who would not follow approved procedures. I don't have that option with those who refuse to follow the simple instructions for Covid19, including the ""religious"" wearing of a mask, the same way that women cover their heads when entering a Catholic church and Jewish men wear a yarmulke in a Temple. And when the President irresponsibly and criminally refuses to follow and to mandate simple instructions by medical experts, then I am unable to calculate the risk. I don't think Ms Rosenthal can calculate the level of risk she suggests we accept."
2020-08-19 15:03,"Dr. Rosenthal, you may think that the risk is fine for you, personally.  However, as you well know, this is a contagious disease that spreads through communities and can kill or cause serious injury (on-going heart problems, to name just one).  We have high case numbers in many states.  We have seen that when we, or any nation, let down our guard, the virus comes sneaking back.  Look at what happened to my state of California, when salons, gyms, and bars opened up.  I find your position both disingenuous and irresponsible."
2020-08-19 15:04,"There are millions of immune compromised individuals who face much higher risks.  They, and those who live with them, are left out of the equation, and life in general, for the duration.

2020-08-19 12:10,"This article seems to shift the responsibility of keeping ourselves safe and determining our risk to the individual. Those of us without backgrounds in epidemiology or public health are poorly equipped to estimate our own risks. We need government to both assess and mitigate risks. Even intelligent, concerned people may decide that something is safe because the government has permitted it (such as going to a movie), while in fact economics, not safety, was the determining factor in allowing it. Also, safety in the Covid-19 era depends on everyone acting safely; my wellbeing depends upon others being responsible. I have been extremely cautious, but I caught Covid at work, where many people are not cautious, don’t wear masks, and are not taking this seriously. Thankfully, I have done well, but not everyone is so lucky."
2020-08-19 11:29,"I have been going to work since March, suggesting my risk tolerance is high. I am young and healthy, but I also have no delusions about the capabilities of this pernicious virus.

That is why I wear a mask. Masks are so effective that if everyone wore them appropriately, having a high risk tolerance would not be a prerequisite to going out in the community. Various studies show that when two people are wearing a mask and one of the individuals  is infected, the rate of transmission is extremely low. This is even true indoors.

We even can use entire nations as case studies. Japan’s virus count is vanishingly low because its citizens wear masks. Same for Singapore and South Korea. 

Wear a mask and enjoy life irrespective of your risk tolerance."
2020-08-19 15:06,"Great opinion pieces that speaks truth to Preventative measures that all citizens must, not should, follow.
All sports teams both college and professional need to cancel their seasons . Those teams who want push back on that idea are deAling a fools’ game which, ultimately, cannot Ne won my a hubris that willfully dismisses common sense. The penalty for not following caution is one that victim are never prepared to experience!"
2020-08-19 13:02,"The problem is not my risk tolerance, but the fact that I have no idea if the people running the restaurant are careful, or the people cleaning the school bus, or the people I can't see in the back of the store. In fact, I know many of them are not following guidelines and laws, because I have seen them with my own eyes: the transit worker that pulls down his mask, the waiters outside the restaurant on a smoke break, the postal worker delivering my packages, the person in the gas station who entered without a mask on, etc. Until we get everyone, or at least most people, onboard with taking sensible precautions none of us can correctly judge the risk we are taking."
2020-08-19 13:12,"I worked as an epidemiologist in a rural public health department until I was laid off due to budget cuts after the great recession. I have relatives in Singapore where mask wearing, contact tracing and public health are followed. If I lived in Singapore or some other country which has a decent public health system I might consider getting back to some semblance of ""normal"".  However, in a country in which the federal government and president have no ability or will to mitigate the effect of this virus, and in which an under funded and dysfunctional public health and medical system operate it is irrational to even consider getting back to ""normal""."
2020-08-19 10:09,"I agree with this completely. The challenge, in my opinion, is that a proper risk assessment relies on accurate data and we are presented with inconsistent, conflicting and misleading data on a daily basis. As a result, many of us find we lack confidence in our own ability to make a reasonable risk assessment."
2020-08-19 15:11,"I welcome Dr. Rosenthal to spend one day in ANY school in the US and to continue to support his statements.  Most schools are giving teachers a single mask for the year.  Teachers will be doing the cleaning in addition to the teaching. I don't know that I have ever heard of a surgical resident  or surgeon being required to create a safe surgical suite, perform the operation, and clean the facilities between operations.  I simply do not think the public understands that the long term consequences of defunding schools means they simply cannot be made safe enough in a pandemic."
2020-08-19 11:54,"""In those places where governments, businesses and administrators have set the stage properly, we can ... begin to live again."" 

But, isn't this the essence of the problem? There is no real agreement about what the proper stage setting looks like. It's almost random in this country. There's no strategic view being driven by the federal government that would provide and enforce such guidance. 

Every state, and localities in those states, have their own blueprint for the set stage. And some blueprints are not finished or have been drawn with ink that has faded invisible. We can't get where the good doctor is saying because the federal government in this country has failed miserably. Add to that a fierce partisanship and sense of individual choice that incentivizes bad behavior. Risk can only be reduced where there is agreement about the hazard and it's severity and the right controls are uniformly put in place."
2020-08-19 13:21,"The concern is not with my personal risk tolerance, nor my fear of contracting Covid-19. I am concerned that I can contribute to an outbreak. I catch it at my hair salon, then I give it to two people at the tennis club. This scenario occurs dozens of times in my community, causing an outbreak. That outbreak leads to deaths in the nursing home. I may be asymptomatic, but because of me, others are dead. That is the risk I am not willing to take."
2020-08-19 15:21,"The author mentions trains, which indicates a very high risk tolerance. You might be sitting near an unwitting bio-terrorist in a metal box with no open windows and have no idea. Why would anyone get on a train?

It is not just your risk tolerance, it. Is everyone else's. The more reckless otheers are, the more cautious you need to be. Not only is your risk magnified by others' carelessness, but how many people you might pass an infection to is as well.

Students are back on campus now. I am ramping up my precautions to prepper-esque levels in response, but my risk will still likely increase."
2020-08-19 15:21,"Many countries with a national plan of massive testing, contact tracing and quarantine; contained the virus and open businesses and school.  It doesn’t work without testing and a population that will take steps  er os, mask distance to stop the spread."
2020-08-19 15:24,"I am in the high risk group because of my age and preexisting conditions that essentially ensure that I will die if I contract this disease.

I was laid off due to the pandemic and must now look for work to be eligible for unemployment benefits; but few companies in my field offer working remotely. I have been turned down four times because I refuse to work in an office environment until there is a proven vaccine; seems companies are short-sighted and do not agree that a vaccine is on the horizon, or the ‘younger’ generation do not want to employ older Americans.

There are no discriminatory laws to protect me. The age discrimination law in this country is a joke and has never provided any security. 

I am at the whims of the pandemic and those that refuse to treat it seriously including the trump administration.

I look on in envy at countries like New Zealand that have slain the dragon and have some semblance of normality.

My wife and I continue our quarantine. We go out to pick up medications, medical appointments, and contact-less pick up of groceries. All our other needs are met by postal delivery (at least for now).

We have no choice but to wait for a proven vaccine, assuming there will be one for older folks.

The only reason I would break quarantine would be to ensure a fair, safe and final vote. I will give my life to ensure that the vote is final and fair, regardless the outcome and consequences. Future generations and our democracy are worth it."
2020-08-19 15:24,"Yes. I recently reached my 'sameness' limit with everyday being blursday. So, I have decided, for my sanity, to make at least one trip a week out of the neighborhood to re-engage my wider world.  To that end I went to the Art Institute taking the CTA to get downtown. The CTA was a mixed bag with quite a few with no mask or one under chin or nose (more men than women ignoring the guidance). Still, I wore mine, distanced as much as I could and will take the trip again soon. The museum itself was sparsely populated and mask wearing strictly enforced. 

It is a balance of need (psychological in my case) and risk. I have decided at this point that I will go to the museum, the zoo, or just downtown to visit the lake because my health needs more than walks around the neighborhood, lots of reading, and phone ""dates"" with friends..."
2020-08-19 15:24,"I am grateful to live in a state governed by a doctor and a smart team of doctors who have kept the state on an even  keel  and manageable with regard to hospitalizations throughout the pandemic. Everyone here takes it seriously  and wears masks and  socially distances.. Our gyms are opened with strict protocols as are restaurants,  inside and out and many stores. Those who perceive personal health risks to themselves or their housemates, certainly can sharply restrict their appearances in public. There is room here for all of us to conduct our lives as we see fit."
2020-08-19 15:25,"Unfortunately, most places are not ""gingerly"" beginning to reopen, not did they implement a ""near total lockdown."" They never really locked down in the first place, and what restrictions they did implement were too quickly lifted, because they were viewed as being ""too hard."" And so, here we are."
2020-08-19 15:26,"Dear Dr. Rosenthal: Everything you say about risk assessment makes sense. But, there is one variable that you skate over. The willingness of the population in general to follow rules. For as long as I have been alive, Americans by and large, believe in two sets of rules. Ones that apply to them, and ones that apply to everyone else. Until there is mass buy in of the safety measures that you suggest by the patrons of the businesses etc. that one wants (but does not need) to patronize, the risk variable is incalculable."
2020-08-19 15:30,"Was hoping for some line of thought, when I started the oped piece, that I had not already re-played in my head (every night, 1st thing every  morning).  Min. wage but need to work if I want to eat.  Rural so roll has been slow but insidiously steady (in the geo. area I track (29,000 pop 2700 sq miles) 10 new cases Sunday to Tues)

Rural, so half the population is militantly anti-mask.  (At WallMart that anchors southern boundary of area I trace, masks are rare, in store celebration of no mask rampant)

I have significant co-morbidity issues so am concerned for my existence, but as I said if I want to eat I have to work (have not been off the job for even a day), I'm also concerned that even with gloves & mask, daily temp.  I will infect others before I'm aware I'm infectious.  (have not been tested.  getting tested is easier (then in March) but locally you still have to be symptomatic (If my temp hits 100 I'm septic) or drive 100+ miles and pay a steep out of pocket."
2020-08-19 15:32,"What happened to the part of the doctors' oath that says, ""First do no harm?""  I would say that the 171,000+ dead fellow citizens amounts to a heck of a lot of harm.  Advocating for risk-taking during an outbreak of a contagious disease that spreads when humans are in proximity to one another is dangerous for us all.  Have you forgotten your lessons on exponential growth?"
2020-08-19 15:33,"In March, we expanded the garden.  I built new raised boxes, mended the fencing in the vulnerable spots, where critters were infiltrating.
We scrapped our plan to take down the large evergreens that hide our house from the road.  They will stay. I trimmed them up, so they seem less wild, but retain the privacy screening.
I built my kid a bike pump track around the perimeter of our property.  High banked berms, clay rollers, a constant double loop have us all on our bikes for as long as we can go.  The cedar swing set came down, and the reclaimed timber reassembled into a free standing climbing boulder.  After it’s finished, it will have a living roof and sides sculpted from the same vertical cement a zoo might use to make a habitat, or a fancy climbing gym would use to give the space the feel of real rock.  
One kid off on her own, her bedroom is now my wife’s office.  Reclaimed pallet wood and sound proof insulation have lined the walls of what was a detached garage, originally built in the 1920s. It’s been wired. Soundproof doors lock behind me, when I come in here to work. We’ve turned part of our middle schooler’s bedroom into an office of his own. He has what he needs for remote learning. 
Our pantry is stocked. I have been picking up firewood, as the storms ravage the area. Split and seasoning, four cords of hardwood are ready for winter fires.  We have propane. The solar panels will be hooked up before the month is out. 
Mitigating our risks.
It’s going to get bad, yo."
2020-08-19 15:35,"I've lived in a ""house in the countryside"" for more than 45 years.  Local parents are vigorously protesting the instructions that students need to wear masks.  I have no family bubble.  Extended family is too casual about mask wearing and distancing.  We, in our 70's, are skipping an important 7 year old's birthday party because no risk reduction is planned and some extended family are anti-mask in their lifestyle.  Living in the city might be safer!"
2020-08-19 15:36,"Sensible reflections, though people assess risk quite differently, some require and process much more data, and others not so much. 

In New York, at least, the public messaging about the virus is pretty primitive, and doesn't seem to factor in psychology and difference.  Public education needs to be more effective. Science-based measures to decrease risk... like replacing those doorhandles mentioned here... are only occasionally recognized. And don't get me started on the widespread failure to enforce.

A sense of social collapse and institutional failure lingers. While I frequently ride buses and shop in the city, I have grown to distrust the judgement of others, so unmindful of risk.  Sad that this unhealthy social dynamic can also result in distrust of science itself, rather than critical and constructive thinking."
2020-08-19 15:37,"Thank you for your insightful article, Dr. Rosenthal. What's obvious to me, but seems to slide under the table with many employers and politicians, is that most of your observations limiting the the spread of disease are based on common sense. 

For instance, you mention the automatic door in the post office. I wonder how many times people walk up to a door, cellphone in hand, or on a blue tooth connection, and, due to their distraction, grab a door handle or push a door open without any regard to the risk involved. 

I watched people buying produce in several markets, picking up produce, many without gloves, to check if it's ripe or damaged.  Tomatoes for instance, or bulk produce such as potatoes, apples, pears, etc. I'd also be willing to bet that not all produce is washed once they return home.

Many professionals become distracted for a moment or two due to the nature of their jobs. We expect, no demand, that employers take all steps necessary to make certain their employees are kept in good health. 

Politicians take an oath of office to protect and defend their constituents. The GOP has lost all claims to political office in the USA. 

As a nation we depend on science to help remedy many of the diseases that have afflicted mankind, Polio, Tuberculosis, Pneumonia, Flu, Measles, Shingles, Tetanus, etc. Hopefully, soon the Covid19 virus.

How can we vote for GOP candidates when they don't have the common sense to approve a policy as simple as wearing a mask in public"
2020-08-19 15:40,"It is impossible to even attempt to calculate risk, and evaluate that within our own risk tolerances, without reliable and accurate input data. 

Without this data, we are simply throwing up our hands and stepping out into the night.

This article would have been much more helpful and valuable had it discussed this."
2020-08-19 15:40,"The issue is not risk.  It's the stakes.  At age 71 and 73, the stakes are huge.  And with few exceptions, the news coverage just makes it a binary choice ... the risk is you are going to die (x%) or live (100-x%).  That oversimplifies the equation.  What about the people who will be permanently disabled with myocarditis or some other affliction that has been associated with this evil disease?  The calculation of risk is further complicated by the evil government we must contend with, and the political football it makes of its citizens' suffering.  Covid-19 anyone?  How about taking that without a dose of the ACA with excluded preexisting conditions or with a weakened Medicaid or Medicare?  No.  I'll remain in my bunker, thank you very much, occasionally emerging for a walk with mask."
2020-08-19 15:40,"Thank you!  I work in the field of risk management, and welcome this discussion about risk tolerance.

People talk about the risks other people are taking (or not) as a matter of moral right or wrong, rather than differing levels of risk tolerance.  I live in a city where people are really hunkered down, planning to wait this out.  But I have family in areas of the country that have been strongly pushing to reopen.  It's not that my city is overly paranoid, or that my relatives are ignorant and reckless--it's a difference in risk tolerance.

In my city, people want to stay safe by all means, and will undertake whatever economic and social and mental harm that entails.  For my relatives, they feel that the costs of living like that far outweigh the benefits.  They see that most people infected have no-to-moderate symptoms, and agree that higher risk people should be more cautious.  But they are willing to accept that some people will get very sick and even die--and it might even be them--because the costs of isolating for another year or so are too great; the economic and mental harm will have it's own consequences.

I'm not saying one side is wrong or right--and that's my point.  I wish we could stop moralizing about decisions on opening up, and understand that people aren't paranoid cowards (on one end) or terrible people (on the other end), and just have different perspectives."
2020-08-19 14:54,"I blame the left wing media. which you are part of Ms Rosenthal for continuing to gin up the risk of getting infected and suffering a poor outcome.This provides fodder tp relentlessly criticize the government for not doing enough to score political points. The risk of getting infected is low now in many parts of the country and the disease is manageable in the vast majority of the newly infected. Regardless, the hysterical, self styled vulnerable types will continue to shelter,despite a vaccine. Their risk of getting the virus will still not be zero."

2020-08-19 15:41,"The elderly and immune system compromised are being held hostage by our government’s failure to act to control Covid. Where is a national mask mandate? Where is comprehensive testing and data reporting? Where is contact tracing? Where is enforced quarantines for those exposed and exhibiting symptoms? Where is the money to pay for state and local government responses? Without any one of these things it is impossible to calculate risk, unless your calculation is all or nothing."
2020-08-19 15:46,"I am happy to finally see an article like this. The virus is here to stay and life needs to go on. Those who are at a greater risk for a bad outcome should continue to do whatever they can to reduce the chance that they get it.  For the rest of us who are comfortable with it, life needs to move on.  No one is thinking about all the lives being lost in other ways--through domestic violence, chronic illnesses left untreated, cancer screenings not being done, medical care not being sought, poverty, etc. There is great impact on our society, children, businesses, etc that cannot yet be measured.  Thank you Dr. Rosenthal for bringing this perspective to this problem.  I believe too many in the media concentrate on the worst case scenario, the saddest stories with the worst outcomes, the sensational material printed to attract more readers.  If you believe in getting out there again, you're a Trump loving, science denier.  I have watched my governor make contradictory decisions based on how she feels about things--not on any science based reasoning and somehow it is wrong to question her decisions. I hope your article will encourage some to go out and try to do some fun things like they used to that will be good for their mental health and well being.  We could all use that right now."
2020-08-19 15:46,"Thank you for point out that we're in this for the long haul.  I know many people who think this will all be over in a few months, and that's just not true.

As you point out, it's not enough for a vaccine to simply exist.  We need to get enough people immunized.  Beside the logistics of doing so, we can't assume most people are even willing to be immunized.  Many people--even pro-vaccine people-- are skeptical of the safety of a vaccine developed so quickly.

I read we need about 60% of the population immune in order to have herd immunity for this virus.  If a vaccine is only partially effective, then we basically need everyone vaccinated.  If everyone is willing to be vaccinated, it would still take many months to achieve that.  If a lot of people are reluctant to be vaccinated, it will be a long time before we have herd immunity.

In a few months, we'll start reading articles about what % of the population needs to be vaccinated before schools reopen, things are back to normal, etc."
2020-08-19 15:49,"My risk tolerance has evolved, like most people.
From March until about May, I ordered my groceries online, wiped them down with Clorox and let some of it sit for a few days.
I rarely left the house and was paranoid about other people in my vicinity. My kids nor I didn't really go anywhere. 
This was during the time when it was dead quiet in the city with very few cars on the road. Everyone was freaked out.
Today I go grocery shopping, do wear a mask but don't wipe it all down. I have traveled by car and RV, I jog unmasked in the city but keep my distance. My kids have play dates and sleepovers.
I have hand sanitizer in my car and use it whenever I get in. 
This is still conservative behavior compared to many people I know, who have been letting their kids do group sports etc. Traffic is almost as bad as ever around here.
I feel like masks make all the difference."
2020-08-19 15:51,"Risk is a funny thing.  In investing, you expect higher rewards for taking more risks, and choosing to take risks is considered a valid strategy for investors. In public health (or personal health), our goal is nearly always to minimize our risks. The problem now is that if you truly minimize your risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2, you will end up in isolation, as Dr. Rosenthal observes. The rewards of taking some risk are a return to some form of normal life. Human beings are notoriously bad at gauging risk--most of us are far more afraid of plane crashes than car accidents, even though the risk of injury or death in a car accident is many times higher than from a plane crash--and this pandemic is no exception. This column's advice--simply to think more carefully about risk and risk tolerance--is thus very important, whatever each individual decides."

Wait and see the fatality number from Covid creep up to 300,000, the number of GIs lost in WW2. The kids partying today are too spoiled and stupid to realize that this time the enemy is invisible - this crop of kids doesn't deserve a golden age of prosperity like the surviving GIs had in the 50s and 60s, and we will lose the Covid war unless we get rid of the coward-in-chief leading us."

So how best to minimize risk?  Stay six feet from strangers until and unless you get to know them. The further apart you are, the less the risk. This may be difficult for some. But it will be easier for those of us who are not in the habit of hugging strangers as well as those like me, who strangers instinctively avoid."

2020-08-19 15:52,"Every day, using the coronavirus maps at NY Times, I check the number of cases in nearby counties. But now I don't trust the maps to give me a very complete picture. Why? 

Recently the CDC estimated that 40% of those infected are asymptomatic. They NEVER show symptoms. Realistically that means that thousands of infected individuals nationwide, masked or not depending on their preference, are unaware that they are potentially spreading a deadly virus. Realistically that means that a slew of asymptomatic people never get tested. They never show up as cases, but they carry and spread a deadly virus. One may assume that rising cases indicate a similar number of asymptomatic carriers and spreaders. Dangerous!

On top of that, we have millions of people who wish to express their ""freedumb"" not to wear masks and follow other guidelines.

Nationwide, there are too many cases, and there are too many asymptomatic people who never get tested. The virus is out of control thanks to the Orange Menace in the White House. 

It will remain an extremely dangerous situation for the foreseeable future. I'm convinced that hundreds of thousands of Americans will die of Covid-19. And soon we will transition to a Twindemic - Covid-19 and seasonal flu. It's going to be so bad.

Fortunately I'm retired, live alone on a small farm, and I only risk grocery shopping trips and occasionally food to go."

2020-08-19 15:54,"When you say level of ""risk tolerance,"" unfortunately many people think in terms of emotional response instead of rational/statistical evaluation.

For example, what is my risk of getting infected when flying on a 2 hour flight, mask and all?  Is it 1 in 100?  1 in 10,000?  1 in 10 million?

If I send my child to in-person schooling in two weeks, what is the risk of infection?  1 in 100? 1 in 10,000?  1 in 10 million?

We are 6 months into this pandemic, and we just have no idea.  We don't know have the ""hard"" underlying information regarding risk for typical daily scenarios.  This has much to do with the lack of a rigorous testing regime that would provided at least some of the answers by now.

And, finally, risk tolerance must take into account the downside.  If the risk of rain is 1 in 50, I might be willing to chance leaving my umbrella behind, because the most severe downside is I may get wet.

But when it comes to the coronavirus, where you are talking long-term health consequences, death and infecting others, a situation where the risk of getting infected is 1 in 50 is pretty ""risky."""

His risk tolerance point has been rendered all but moot—because as far as I can see, these things are NOT happening. And leaders, liberal and conservative both, are doing nothing in earnest to require it. Quite the opposite actually. They’re opening up without the proper safeguards and mandates in place, and then blaming our reticence on risk aversion. 

Give me a break."
2020-08-19 16:05,"An important point that I do not see here is that one's risk tolerance is a function of their income.  The wealthier a person is, the less risk they will tolerate...in effect, they can and will pay more in the trade-off for personal safety.  As the wealthy  among us continue to retreat to vacation houses, pay for home offices, pay for tutors...while the less fortunate staff cash registers, drop off their kids with friends/relatives, and hope their insurance holds up, inequality of outcomes widens.  This is the case regardless of the ""sensible precautions"" we take in order to ""live again."""
2020-08-19 16:00,"Very cute... but to this day my one useful to all comment -- keep that surgical mask tucked up under your nose ont top of your upper lip-- while eating out and at the dentist.

Anyway -- the big problems are still here- the rich are getting richer and not paying taxes and we don't have the luxury tax back, and we're not talking about universal single payer medical care nor negotiating drug prices with the makers prohibited by the BUSH Congress, and the FED is allowed to buy junque bonds-- thanks Barrack!  -- and global warming and the destruction of rain forests and the pillaging and polluting of the waterways continues... oh well...

I LOVE SOCIAL DISTANCING  -- have always hated people in my space-- and hugs esp. from strangers -- not necessary.. 
I love not waiting in line inside in TJ's.  and having lived thru girdles and stocking in the summer and white gloves - and hats.. (thank heavens no corsets) a mask is not hugely uncomfortable in the cooler weather.   I am wary about eating out in a crowded resto -- always loved those where my friends and I constituted the customers at lunchtime... and my days of marching are behind me altho I might stand on BWay.  

We know so little about why some people are susceptible to this disease and other not.. (Oddly, my MD bro reminded me that pneumonia used to be called ""the old mans' friend.""  but now we can ""save"" a few after a very long time on ventilators. Que sera, sera."
2020-08-19 16:06,"Well, Dr Rosenthal, all I can say is that  this 70 yo widow sees things very differently than you, but, then, COVID has made it crystal clear that people my age are expendable, so why would it even matter that we are here in the first place?

The point is, seniors able to live independently likely find that life in the pandemic is not all that much different from our regular lives. There is no job to go to, no  children to care for. For me, there's daily online yoga and a 4 mi. walk daily during which I listen to newly-discovered podcasts (try 'Bob Sagat Is Here For You') plus little projects like genealogy, crosswords, reading, also long phone calls or video chats with friends and family all over the country. Columns like this make me wonder what else it is that I should be doing. Hanging out in bars? Flying somewhere for -- what? And why? That will happen again, just not right now when an average of 1,000 people a day are dying of COVID-- most of them right around my age

I am healthy and happy although like everyone else I will be thrilled when this pandemic subsides and I can hug my kids and be with friends again. What you consider 'risk avoidance' is what many seniors know as 'regular life' and it is not a horrible burden."
2020-08-19 16:09,"Love thy neighbor. This is the part that has me continuing to act not to be a vector-- by trying not to catch it myself and trying not to pass it on in case I'm an asymptomatic or presymptomatic carrier. 

True, it is impossible to do great risk-benefit analysis when we don't know all the input data. I approach my actions thinking not just about my own impact but of the impact of my impact and that of other similar thoughtful people, and I nourish myself on the collective benefit of our actions. And I nourish myself on feeling our collective love, and all that can accomplish."
2020-08-19 16:11,"The article is a contradiction.    Mask, social distancing and keep things sterile but safe to go back to schools.   Anyone who has spent ten minutes in even the best financed school systems know this is an impossibility    Masks will inevitably come off,  six feet is not going to happen and cleaning while well intentioned won’t do the trick.   This all sounds good until the numbers spike and they will.   Look at where they are today and talk to me at the December recess. That is if we get that far"
2020-08-19 16:12,"This article leaves out one factor that I consider:  how vital is it to my physical, mental and emotional health to engage in the activity I am contemplating?  When weighing risk, it makes sense to me to also consider the benefits.

So I go to medical appointments for which video visits are not an adequate substitute, using what seems to be the least risky form of transportation (walking), and taking into account that there is heightened care being taken in the clinical settings I am visiting.

But I settle for video visits with my friends and family, which satisfy my need to stay connected without exposing me to any risk.  The added joy of being in the same room and sharing a meal is missing, but it’s not vital to my well-being. 

These are very personal decisions; I don’t fault anyone who reaches a different conclusion.  We all have different needs and different coping strategies.  

I do, however, quarrel with the author’s phrasing “begin to live again.”  I am most definitely living.  My life now is different than it was before March, but it has many joys, some of which I discovered when I was forced to slow down and simplify my schedule."
2020-08-19 16:14,"Missing from this discussion is the other side of knowing one's risk tolerance: the expected reward. In calculating any decision during the time of a pandemic, one must ask ""what is the upside"" to taking a particular risk. So, for an overweight 65+ male - a ""high risk"" CoVid candidate - is it worth the risk to fly to Italy and visit Pompeii, or to fly to New York City and donate plasma blood stem cells to a brother battling leukemia? Clearly the ""upside"" of potentially saving a sibling's life versus visiting a site that's been around for 2000 years is the better upside and hence, worth the risk. Also, there are further risk reducing behaviors we can take if we know certain comparative risks: does one drive cross-country from California to New York to aid an ailing sibling, or fly? Even with the risk of on-board CoVid, driving 3000 miles is inherently riskier than flying under most circumstances. Over time, people will develop an internal calculus to make these decisions so that life goes on, as it did for our ancestors both distant (1348 Plague) and near (1918 Flu)."

2020-08-19 16:22,"Out of necessity, I have been going out to the grocery store since the beginning of the pandemic. Then my elderly dad got sick and there was no way I wasn't going to be with him. When he was hospitalized, the hospital allowed one visitor per 24-hours per patient, if they didn't have COVID. I never went to the bathroom, drank or ate anything when I was with him and I never removed my mask. I have to say that I felt very safe at the hospital and I didn't expect to. I often went during off hours, so as to avoid lots of people and I observed every single regulation. When my dad went to hospice, it was more relaxed (3 visitors, we had a nice patio to sit outside on)...but I still tried to do everything by the book. I have visited restaurants and sat outside five times now. I wear a mask every time I leave my home but outside, if there are no other people around, I remove it. I would not be comfortable going back to the office or going to the dentist or getting a facial. I did go to the hair salon for a haircut late last month but only because my salon is following all guidelines and has strict regulations in place. They report regularly that no new cases have developed. I cannot hug or touch my own mother, which is hard, since my father died recently. But we have to make choices that we think are right, based on science."

Then, too, there was talk of allegedly “cautious” and “gradual” reopening, best practices, etc. But the virus was uncontrolled and spreading. Now it has achieved greater ubiquity, such that even Deborah Birx has admitted it. And yet here we are again: “isolation is wearing thin.” What a soft, weak, mollycoddled people we are, if we can’t handle living in our pods until things here are like things in Europe. Young men stormed the beaches at Normandy, but we can’t stay home. For those who must work, this is a terrible cruelty, and indicative of the larger cruelty of our economic system. For everyone else: Boo hoo. No, it’s not the Black Death. But 170,000  deaths are nothing to sneeze at. We need a better reason than “isolation is wearing thin” to increase risk further. 

This column is deeply irresponsible and woefully cavalier. It’s this very attitude that has gotten and kept us here."

What I've seen so far, especially in the case of stores, are a number of insulting attempts to implement measures that aim to instill customer confidence without worrying too much about actual effectiveness.  
I see a lot of kindergarten level measures: little social distancing circles on the floor, which no one respects, employees and customers wearing face coverings that don't cover their noses, pulling those coverings down each time an employee talks to a customer, etc.   To rely on these types of ""measures"" in a small store with zero ventilation during an airborne virus pandemic is nothing short of silly.  
I wish our public health officials would level with us re their intentions.  A reduction in overall population anxiety can be achieved through the implementation of effective risk reduction measures, not through gauche exercises like finger painting circles on the ground and calling it a day."

They believe they can control things--don't eat x, and you will not get disease y. 100% of people who eat x will get y.  Unless one spends   time working with numbers, educated people don't understand risk reduction. They don't understand  why you didn't get TB, since you 'took a risk'.   They don't think over an event space of all doctors working with infected patients. I had a friend with an official high-level job ask me why she didn't get COVID, since a man in her office did.   At this point we need to find ways to address the issues of isolation and anxiety."
2020-08-19 16:31,"Thank you!  This is exactly what I've been thinking but I think we also need to have some faith - in our institutions and in our communities.   I am fortunate to live and work in a county that has had effective contact tracing from the beginning.  Most of the people here are wearing masks in public.   I go to work each day where there are good protocols and everybody is following them, and I have overcome my anxiety about this.  I cannot completely avoid exposure, but if I keep my mask on (and accept it as the new normal) and keep washing my hands and keeping my distance, I know I will probably not get sick.  Every tiny step of reclaiming 'normal' life (I took out a library book by appointment!) helps me emotionally and helps me adjust to the new, current definition of normal.  I am cheerfully trying to beckon my friends and neighbors out of their abject fear and back into a safely conducted more normal life."
2020-08-19 16:31,"Sanctimoniously and vaguely, Dr. Rosenthal  writes that ""But once schools have put in place appropriate science-based steps, most teachers (those not in high risk groups) should return to their jobs.""

However, at this point in time, the science is not well understood, even by scientists (many of whom are decidedly liberal or left-wing).  Every month, new discoveries are being made about Covid-19.

Based on the current state of knowledge, I might return as a teacher if I were a kindergarten teacher or a first-grade teacher.  But I do not like the odds for in-person high-school teachers.  They are all in ""high-risk groups"".

I am waiting for The New York Times to run a score-box with the number of infected and deceased high-school and middle-school teachers.

Variations will likely b based on how full an American's stomach is, not science.  In fact, Science has set itself a zero-tolerance standard - Medicine doesn't care about Economics; only that the disease is eliminated."
2020-08-19 16:39,"Missing from the risk tolerance discussion is the role that economics plays in our assessment of risk.

Social distancing is a lot easier for some people than others.  My parents are retired, and are happily throwing themselves into their new hobbies while enjoying some limited social activities in their social bubbles.

I have a job to go to, and kids to care for.  Not sending my kids to childcare would mean I would have to quit my job.  Not going to work would mean economic crisis for my family.

So I have the weigh the risks of COVID-19 for my family against the risks associated with economic crisis.  We aren't in high-risks groups, so our COVID-19 risks are low; not zero, but low.  Losing my income would bring a lot of other problems into our lives, meanwhile."
2020-08-19 16:40,"While a vaccine would be obviously very helpful, what I'm really waiting for is a comprehensive federal, state and local initiative to finally shutdown everywhere long enough to contain the virus. This is the most do-able and effective response and we haven't even come close. How about we start with the basics? Once we reduce cases down to an easily traceable number, the rest of the process is clear. We may never be completely free of the virus but we can certainly knock it down to where we can deal with it. Compared to just resigning ourselves to unlimited risk, it seems like its worth a try."
2020-08-19 16:40,"People tend to be more fearful of risks that are novel, or inspire dread. This is why most people fear nuclear power more than coal or gas which kill more people. They are also warier of risks they can’t control, so they hold airlines to higher standards of safety than their own driving.
Some of these psychological biases are at work with covid-19. According to the CDC, three times as many children died of flu between February and July as died of covid. But flu is familiar to parents and covid isn’t which triggers parental fear. Influential media voices routinely message that covid-19 is ""an equal opportunity killer"" when it clearly is not (in Massachusetts, 2/3 of fatalities are nursing home residents, with most in their 80s or 90s...not a single fatality was under 20 years old). The statistical reality is that  otherwise healthy people under 50 are not at risk of serious illness or death from covid. I mean “not at risk” the same way I would mean I am not at risk of dying as I drive to work, or my child is not at risk of getting kidnapped on his way to school i.e., it is so unlikely that it doesn’t paralyze me into fearful inaction, but I do take reasonable precautions for both.  We need a risk stratified approach which protects the elderly and those with chronic illnesses. As Dr. Rosenthal notes, our societal risk tolerance for exposure to covid-19 is essentially zero which makes it very difficult for society to function with or without a vaccine."

2020-08-19 16:49,"Yes, above all individual risk tolerance is most important to come out of the bunker. Risk tolerance varies person to person. Factors which decide one's risk tolerance is their food habits. Those people who eat home made preparations might be having good tolerance than those who eat outside junk foods. 

In India, you may not believe, from the day one people came to about the virus and its danger, started taking immune boosters, mostly ayurvedic preparations every day. 

There are some home made - kashayam (Kashayam refers to a water decoction or water extract of a single herb or group of herbs and can be used for ailments like indigestion, cough and common cold etc. It is an ancient form of medicine that has been used for a long time.)

These ayurvedic home made preparations also increases one's immune system.

If not for all these 'kashayams', India with a population of 130 plus crores would have overtaken all other nations and today might stands first in the most virus affected list.

I suggest my fellow human beings all around the world to try such types of ayurvedic preparations, which has absolutely no side effects and chase the virus from approaching you and live safe."
2020-08-19 16:51,"This seems well thought out and reasonable. And if everyone behaves in that manner, then we have a chance to restore some semblance of normalcy to our everyday lives.  I'm fortunate enough to live in a state which ascribes itself to science-based decisions, not political whimsy. Not everyone shares my fortune and there's the rub. Until we have a national effort, led by scientific fact, the current mode is a bit like placing a bet on the roulette wheel. Until then, I'll wear a mask and curtail my indoor activities to home. And adding automatic doors to 30,000 post offices is problematic considering their current budegtary restraints."
2020-08-19 16:52,"It's true that people have different tolerances for risk, and that we live in an imperfect world.  

Also worth remembering that around 50,000 people per year die is this country of influenza.  Only half the population bothers to get vaccinated each year.  Flu vaccination is not completely effective, but probably reduces the odds of dying of the flu by over half.

And then there's seatbelts.  Many don't wear them.   Now that airbags are required in all cars, they're not quite the necessity they once were, but they're still of great benefit, and substantially reduce the risk of death or serious injury in a car accident; they are usually required by law.  Yet, many people don't use seat belts, around 10% of the population in the US doesn't bother.

When it comes to risk, familiarity breeds contempt, and in the case of coronavirus, vice-versa.  Also: you can take a horse to water, but you can't make him/her drink."

Developmentally, teens and people in their twenties have a biological drive for rewarding experiences that can overwhelm their much more limited ability to judge risk.

The only people who drive are those who don't care about dying horribly or those who drive cement trucks. My risk depends on those around me, and it is pretty clear they just don't care: violent, irrational anti-maskers, Texans who visit but feel they can break the law and not quarantine and not wear a mask, law enforcement and federal agents (CBP and DEA talking to you) who break the law and don't mask up in public.

Both states shut down at similar times, for a similar length of time, and both have partially reopened. Most everyone wears masks in both locations and they are mandatory indoors in both locations. But cases in Oregon have increased while they’re greatly reduced in New York. You can pin that all on risk behavior. We still don’t know a lot about this disease."

2020-08-19 17:08,"This is decidedly NOT the time to advance an idea of Covid-19 personal risk tolerance. That time will come only after the pandemic has come under reasonable control throughout the nation, a successful vaccine has been administered to a large enough population to near ""herd immunity,"" and successful treatments have been found.

Without these fundamental protections a large subset of the US population, having already proven itself unwilling to follow medical advice, ensures continual disease spread. This combined with a total absence of responsible national leadership has brought us to our knees where Covid-19 is concerned.

Until we have achieved this measure of control err on the side of caution... while even that is not a guarantee. Other nations have shown us the way, we simply need the political will and fortitude to follow their example.

I am just an old pharmacist who has dispensed free medical advice for half a century. Please follow my advice, and stay safe."
2020-08-19 17:09,"Dr Rosenthal:

When you go to the grocery store, what type of mask do you wear?  surgical mask, N95, P100?

There are two types of masks:  those that protect others (somewhat), and those that protect the user (N95/P100).  If you don't differentiate  between the two in your writing, you do your readers a disservice. 

To assess your risk tolerance when going out into a possible virus exposure situation, are you wearing a mask that protects you (N95/P100) or protects others?

Make no mistake, the masks that protect medical personnel will protect anyone.  The N95 mask filters 95% of virus, the P100 filters 99.97% of virus.  

When I go to the store in goggles, P100 mask, and gloves, I accept the risk involved.  Otherwise, I stay home.

We can't safely 'open up' until everyone has the same kit.

To the reader's:  have you noticed that none of the experts tell us what type of mask they wear on their trips to the grocery store?  You can be sure it is either N95 or P100."
2020-08-19 17:19,"My risk tolerance for Covid-19 is extremely low. I've postponed all appointments since late March and go out only for exercise and grocery pickup. Until herd immunity occurs or I've been vaccinated, I expect to remain at home. To date, this has not been a burden."
2020-08-19 17:21,"I fail to believe doctors did not ""know the risk"" of infection when they decided on a career in medicine. You learn this as undergraduates. You learn how to deal with hazardous materials in Chemistry, Biology, Physics, and you even learn about environmental exposure risk.

As for this being a novel virus, this too is not accurate. This virus was identified as belonging to the SARS family straight away. Anyone who had a general chemistry lab class learned that when you have an unknown substance you treat it as the most hazardous substance until you identify it. 

I am a chemist and 25 year HAZMAT first responder.  If med schools are teaching that an unknown virus should be handled like the common cold or flu then we have a very serious problem. It is also my understanding that people wishing to become doctors have to take at least 2 years of chemistry and some biology so they should have enough knowledge to identify hazardous policies and procedures.

Secondly, the CDC and OSHA had websites with protocols and required PPE to work in areas where someone MIGHT be exposed to SARS since 2007. There is NOT EXCUSE. The owners of the hospitals need to be fined for failure to provide and train employees on how to use the required equipment. In places with egregious violations, the state/feds should take over ownship and operations."
2020-08-19 17:23,"“… we have science.  We know what causes Covid-19. We are learning more about how to detect, prevent and treat it every day.”

And, we are still learning more about what Covid-19 pathology actually IS — a reality that’s missing from this otherwise thoughtful editorial.

The scientific consensus on Covid-19 pathology has shifted steadily throughout the pandemic.  That’s expected for a new disease.  A recent paradigm shift proposes that SARS-CoV-2 is not a “respiratory virus,” as most had assumed, but instead targets and damages the cardiovascular system.  Some researchers and clinicians now propose that recovered patients — even “asymptomatic” ones — may have subclinical — but non-trivial — cardiovascular pathologies, and may be at elevated risk for life-threatening cardiomyopathy and/or arrhythmia going forward.  

What else remains to be discovered about Covid-19?  My point is, How can we evaluate Covid-19 *risk* if we don’t know what’s at stake in Covid-19 *disease*?  We can’t.  Accordingly, and in my opinion, Dr. Rosenthal’s prescription for dealing with the new reality of Covid-19 is premature.  I’ll wait for a clear signal that the clinical discovery phase is complete, before I ante my life up."
2020-08-19 17:24,"Thanks for this article.  I think that you should add that a person's own age and health is a very important determinant of how risky this virus is.  Elderly folks and people in poor health need to isolate themselves as much as possible--I am very disappointed that there is not any reporting that cases in nursing homes are at an all time high in the U.S., a demonstration of an abject failure to protect those most vulnerable residents.  Those of us in good health who venture out need to stay away from people in poor health as much as possible."
2020-08-19 17:25,"If one outcome of the pandemic is that more people realize that ""safety"" is not an either/or matter, that all decisions are complicated matters of balancing risky costs and risky benefits, that would be great.
I will make a distressingly repetitive complaint about the article, however, and that it is formulated entirely in terms of risks to the decision maker.  That's fine for deciding to bungee jump or not, but not In the case of a pandemic when our actions not only expose us to risks but expose others, too.  Without massive frequent testing, no one can know that they are not asymptomatically infectious, so when we fail to maintain social distance, fail to wear a mask in public we not only expose ourselves to risk, but the people we come in contact with."
2020-08-19 17:32,"I’m surprised this article did not mention each person’s risk of dying from the virus. I don’t run and hide from the seasonal flu, but as a 73-year old with a much higher risk of dying from Covid-19, I am very cautious. My social activities are on zoom or outdoors with appropriate distancing. My husband and I shop for groceries once every 2 or 3 weeks. Our dining adventures are takeout. My son’s family has joined with two other families in an extended bubble, which is age-appropriate behavior. But older people and others with risk factors that make them more likely to need care in the ICU or to die from this scourge have more factors to consider than whether they are risk-adverse or not. They have to factor in their higher risk of dying."
2020-08-19 17:35,"""Taking risks"" usually means putting someone else at risk, usually someone making much less money than the person urging the risk-taking. It's also about requiring that person to take that risk, not giving them a free choice with alternatives. In America, it's highly likely that that person will be a person of color and/or an immigrant.

And no, you don't have to right to put others at risk during a pandemic."
2020-08-19 17:36,"I have a fairly clear idea of what is likely to happen should I get coronavirus given my multiple comorbidities. I have been home alone with my cats since early March, reliant on grocery deliveries and help from friends. I’m used to being the help from friends. I’m used to being actively engaged in my community. Now most of my contact with people is through Zoom and it doesn’t begin to replace sharing real space with real people or actual contact, no matter how many hours you are on the computer. 

The reported corona rate has been low in my town, but I’m unwilling to trust that as I live in a resort area and there has been an influx of people from high risk areas since March. Testing results get reported to the home county/state and it takes a while to trickle back here. Town staff is doing a great job, but it's not all under their control. 

As we move into fall and back to being indoors, as schools reopen, testing continues to lag, the pandemic remains highly politicized, flu season approaches,  no corona vaccine in sight and reportedly 33% of the country won't get one anyway, what are my options but to stay isolated.  I at least had a pond for the summer and a kayak for my mental health but that will end soon. 

I have little faith that I will be able to rejoin the world any time soon. I am wholly dependent on the actions of others to change my circumstances and while there are a lot of people trying hard to do the right thing, there are too many who aren’t."

Sorry, but this is not a game show where we guess what is behind Door #1, Door #2 or Door #3.  This is a deadly serious ""game"" which has a significant chance of resulting in death if you contract the virus and are over the age of 65 y.o.  I cannot speak for Dr. Rosenthal but I do not want to die on a respirator in a strange ICU and my risk tolerance is ""Zero"".  Period. 

Fortunately, I fully understand all of the medical issues from the disease itself to a realistic time horizon for creation for an effective vaccine, successful Phase 3 testing on a large population, and distribution of the vaccine.  I am patient and can wait, alter my life and lifestyle appropriately, and sacrifice another 1-2 years before receiving an effective vaccination and resuming normal activity.

This is not a game, folks -this is your life.  You only get one of them so treat it with appropriate caution and respect."
2020-08-19 16:42,"This is a public health crisis, so personal risk is also a function of the risk taking behavior of others. Every single photo I see of people in the US has, at best, a 33% split. 1/3 weak masks, 1/3 don't, and 1/3 wear them improperly. So long as the public behavior of individuals is so wantonly reckless, I am not willing to put my health at the mercy of absurd disregard of public safety due to foolish strangers. It's like getting on the highway where 1/3 of the people think it's OK to drive drunk and 1/3 think it's OK to drink a little bit before driving. Absolute madness."
2020-08-19 17:04,"The doctor puzzles me with her antidote that health career professionals feel safer in the hospital! Which hospitals? Where are these hospitals? Who are these doctors? The NYC hospital that didn't provide proper protection to my RN spouse, now a ""long hauler"" after contracting the virus is culpable. He can no longer work. It is too risky for him to return to work.

There is ample evidence, from hospital workers and their unions that there's still not enough done to protect their employees. Maybe Dr. Rosenthal needs to suit up again and visit a ward in one of the MacHospitals. I hear there's a shortage of health care professionals due to burn out, sickness and fatalities."

Therein lies the problem. As far as I can tell, my metropolitan area has never been in anything like a ""near total lockdown"" and neither has most of the US. The US response is not national and is totally irrational. Each state and probably every local government has its own ""recommendations"" and ""plans."" But due to the mobility and let's face it, stupidity of Americans, no area can effectively contain the disease. The US is playing ""whack a mole"" with the virus. It is likely that the US will be battling Covid-19 long after most of the advanced world has properly dealt with it."
2020-08-19 17:06,Humans are notoriously bad at assessing the risk of a given hazard not because they cannot imagine the severity of the consequence but because they tend to woefully underestimate the probability of the hazardous event occurring.  Someone climbs a ladder understanding that they can fall off and kill themself but they imagine the probability of this happening as being infinitesimally low.  The reality is that it’s not as low as they think.  My point is that if you are unable to reliably assess risk then you can’t possibly know your risk tolerance.

2020-08-19 17:25,"I'm afraid of this virus, not only because I am at some higher risk, but also because we don't yet fully know what lasting damage it does, even to those who survive having it.

I am hopeful about a vaccine, because using the vaccine will at a minimum lessen my odds of contracting the virus, and also possibly reduce the effects if I do catch it.

I am staying home to the maximum extent possible until (at least) the vaccine.  When I go out I wear an N95 mask and a clear face shield.  It is hard to breathe and makes shopping difficult but I do it, plus sanitize and wash my hands.  I do my best to stay away from people.  Leadership has been pathetic from my nation and my state, so I'm on my own.  I know how profoundly fortunate I am to have good health insurance and a pension.

Due to the mixed messages we continue to receive from our federal government, there are still many who do not believe in wearing masks.  In fact, a few days ago it was again explained to me that, ""You will get sick from wearing a mask.  You are breathing back in all that CO2.""  I was also assured all I needed was 2 weekly dosages of hydroxychloroquine, by an individual who works in a long term care facility.
My brother lives in France.  They shutdown and stayed down until they got the virus curve flattened.  They have been able to return to some semblance of normal. 
Here in Florida, we are beginning to see a down turn in number of cases, but we are still more than 3 times the rate we went INTO the shutdown with.  And, at the end of our shutdown we had 50 deaths per day (rolling 7 day average) attributed to covid.  Our current 7 day rolling average is now 175 cases attributed to covid.  I find it hard to believe it is time for me to return to normal."
2020-08-19 17:49,"Like another poster said here, for me I am also concerned about spreading this to others and more vulnerable people. So it is not our risk tolerance for only ourselves. Also, getting VERY high quality air filters in interior spaces as well as scientifically approved UV devices would be a great thing - especially for classrooms and other spaces with poor ventilation. Lastly, I think there needs to be more activism as a society about our treatment of animals which is how we are getting these deadly diseases.

2020-08-19 17:20,"Oh please, not another “let’s get back out there” article. 
Especially since the pandemic is worse in many areas than it was in the spring. 
Some areas should be mandating masks by law or telling people to stop “getting out there”.

And I am not a cowering shut-in; I work directly with the public. I wear a mask at all times in my work-it is now the law in my city in all public places. 
It is indeed stiffling to wear a mask all day but I do it because it’s the very least any intelligent person can do in this situation. 

However, some of our political leaders and citizenry are very upset about our economy so they are brow beating people to “get back out there”!  ..Which has now resulted in our area having the highest numbers of covid in the country. 

And schools are open for full classes in September.  Many families were busy “getting back out there”, maskless, all summer so their kids will be primed to spread the virus in crowded classrooms.

At 70 I would be out there far more if I lived in Canada, NZ or even Germany, but here in my state where masking is mandated and then ignored, where there are enough anti science and public health people that in going anywhere one is confronted with people not following safety precautions so how can one get out there and take risk when we live in a country that is the epicenter of ignorance, stupidity and 35% of the citizens believe that the American mantra is ""The rules and laws are made for YOU not ME!"""
2020-08-19 17:53,"For an article advocating for informed choices, it would have helped to provide some useful context for readers about Covid risks. It seems most people commenting here over-estimate these risks for themselves and their families.

So here is a summary from a recent research paper posted to MedRX that summaries age-based Covid risks derived from the large number of studies done to date:

For people less than 35 years old, the infection fatality rate from Covid is estimate to be around 0.01% on average - which is a small fraction of the risk young people generally face each year from accidental death.

For people age 35 - 55, Covid Infection fatality risk is estimated to average about 0.1%, a little higher than the risk of accidental death, but well below typical all-reason mortality risk for this age group.  Covid infection fatality risk is estimated to be between 0.5% and 1% for people 55-65 -  in the range of typical all cause mortality risk for this age group.

For most people, Covid is simply not worth locking up yourself and your families for up to a year to avoid.  For the elderly and certain younger people with serious health conditions, Covid is a meaningful risk worth taking significant precautions to avoid.  

It seems clear the answer for society should be to encourage most people to live their lives with common sense precautions like masks in public, while strongly encouraging strict social distancing, including from younger family members, for those most at risk."
2020-08-19 17:54,"Ah, risk/benefit. So delightfully straightforward, until it's directed at you.

My sister is a public high school teacher. Her family happens to love her a lot. The ""risk"" you say we should tolerate is that of her dying alone behind glass with a tube shoved down her throat as her children and husband and the rest of us watch--to say nothing of the chain of deaths she might inadvertently contribute to. 

This, not so that she can save lives, but so that she can teach in person rather that remotely this fall. What level of risk should we consider correct, for this benefit? No higher than one in 500,000, thanks. It matters a lot to me that my nephews have a mom."
2020-08-19 17:59,"Beautifully written.  The truth is that this disease is going to be with us for a long time before we can return to some semblance of normality.  Those of us at heightened risk, due to age and/or medical status need to do just what Dr. Rosenthal suggests: mitigate risk of exposure while finding ways to live our lives.  All others, regardless of risk of mortality, need to mask up, distance, and remember our motto: E Pluribus Unum"
2020-08-19 18:00,"Is there any science behind the advice to wash hands and clean frequently used surfaces? The evidence that someone can contract Covid-19 by touching a doorknob and then touching your face seems underwhelming. We are spending billions deep cleaning and routinely sanitizing surfaces. If there is no evidence to support these practices, then people are becoming unnecessarily fearful and given a false sense of security. The misuse of sanitizers is also a serious health problem."

When the pandemic started, I stopped going for my weekly allergy injections and finally, several weeks ago, I decided had to go back. I have been so miserable. I am very allergic to mold. 
My doctor's office was spotless. I was the only one there, masks on me and all the employees, air scrubbers at work and I start my injections again next week at 8 am. 
Severe Dental: 
I was getting consultations for dental implants mid March but stopped due to Covid. 
The condition of my teeth have been a constant worry. I have dental pain every day and I have missing teeth, as well. 
Yesterday, I visited an oral surgeon whose office is like a space station. 
Super clean. Of course, masks required. I was ushered into a consultation room that was private, door shut. No other procedures going on, no dental sprays I  have been so worried about. It was totally a great experience. The doctor and I discussed what I needed to do and my worries, except I am no longer felt afraid. 
In the same building is a dentist who can also work with me to finish my dental needs after the oral surgeon has done the implants. My surgeon assured me the other dentist's office is run the same way his is.

2020-08-19 18:03,"I wonder: would the doctor who wrote this article give similar advice to people who take other risks regarding their health?  Would she tell a patient who is obese to ""just assess your tolerance for risk and keep eating as normal""?  Or tell a smoker to ""assess your risk tolerance and keep smoking as normal""?

Smoking and obesity are both behaviors where the risk is well documented and known, and that don't rely on the behavior of other people to reduce your risk.  Yet, doctors would never tell patients to just ""assess your risk tolerance and carry on as normal"" with either condition.

Unlike obesity or smoking, with Covid-19, the risk is not yet well documented or known, and unlike with obesity or smoking, we are dependent on the ""kindness of strangers"" to help us stay safe.

A doctor telling us to ""assess your risk tolerance and go forth!"" is silly under these circumstances.  None of us are safe or in control of our ""risk"" in the current environment."
2020-08-19 18:05,"""Covid-19 is a very serious disease. But it is not the Black Death, which killed up to half of Europe in the 14th century.""

Ugh, not this line of reasoning, again. 

Sure, it may not *kill* as many of us, but anecdotal evidence is mounting about people suffering devastating symptoms for months at a time: fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, myocarditis, neurological issues, and more. 

Don't just take my word for it. Today's online edition of The Atlantic has an article entitled ""Long Haulers Are Re-Defining Covid-19"" (their Covid-19 coverage is free to non-subscribers). 

We need to stop cloaking ourselves in this false dichotomy that if it doesn't kill you, then you're gonna be fine. As ""red"" states around this nation curtail the rate of testing to flatten the case counts just in time for Trump's re-election bid, I suspect that there's a lot we have not been told about the severity of this disease. 

Yes, everyday life must go on, but I get really frustrated when I see simplistic assessments like this, which fail to recognize genuine suffering in those who don't die and who are labeled as having ""mild"" cases. As has been the case throughout this pandemic in this country, the lack of information is severely hampering our nation's ability to effectively respond to this crisis."
2020-08-19 18:12,"I don't know, what is my risk tolerance?

So how do you assess risk without a tool that allows for some kind of multi-factor analysis that helps us understand what our risk tolerance should be? One that takes into account each individuals' unique situation (age, health conditions, household exposures, etc.) and relates those to each unique activity or situation under consideration? 
I found this missing in the article, and it would have been helpful, but at least now I'm motivated to start a search!"

I am very disappointed, however, that we have not done more to reduce spread of the disease. Part of the problem is that no one knew how much to invest.  

With the president's constant lies about the virus disappearing within a matter of weeks, why would anyone invest in a costly solution that took months to implement?  Why would restaurants create pods to insulate customers from one another? Etc.

Had we known that we would still be battling this now, and probably will for another 6 months or a year, such investment starts to make sense."

Even the indubitable Dr. Facuci is restrained and controlled by political considerations, and every “leader” who spouts off about school reopening (Florida today is like Germany in 1936) or any other significant decision is patently more motivated by political rather than health considerations, and none seems to be willing to express how he or she has balanced health risk with economic issues.  And our Department of Education is an embarrassment in the world.  So, this rather idealistic commentary simply lack the foundation to make it work effectively for anyone making individual or group decisions.

No, people are aware that a vaccine may only be partially effective and will take months to roll out. Given the circumstances (govt response, infection rate, rate of mask-wearing), having a partially effective vaccine is the point at which those people are willing to accept more risk in their lives."

Even if I felt comfortable at a restaurant myself, do I feel comfortable adding risk to the life of my server, who has far less choice in being there? For me...no.

My risk tolerance—not for myself, but for infecting others—is zero.

I am able to isolate at home with my family, and I will do so until there is widespread herd immunity (vaccine/antibodies). Yes, this may take years. I know this, and I am prepared. Months/a few years of a comfortable home life with my family is easily doable, thanks to the immense privilege of my remote work. We do not go out at all. I personally do not find isolation all that difficult, because I can wake up every day knowing for sure that I am not the reason anyone died of this virus.

My ability to choose my isolation is an enormous, immense privilege. And I feel a responsibility to use this privilege to reduce the overall infectiousness of my community, for those who cannot choose."
2020-08-19 18:37,"One very big problem is that the level of risk in any given area is not static because people are traveling around and are potential virus vectors. I just saw a report on TV that said that genetic testing has revealed that a large resurgence in cases in Melbourne, Australia could be traced to one family who had quarantined at a hotel upon arrival in Melbourne after an overseas trip. My own area in NY has fared quite well and currently has a very low positivity rate, but that could all change if travelers bring the virus with them; many of us are particularly concerned about what will happen as Cornell University's  reopening brings thousands of students into the area. Assessing one's individual risk and starting to move back into public makes sense at some point, but due to the lack of a widely enforced, nationwide plan to control the virus, we are nowhere near the point where we can follow the model suggested in this column."

In my fit of hyper precaution, I was convinced I made a potentially fatal mistake—even worse, through no one’s fault but my own!  Nothing happened, but it became quite clear then that heightened anxiety and near panic were to be avoided. Best to stay calm, deliberate and try to sensibly minimize risk. That said, the many people visiting Montauk are wearing masks as a rule, though they clearly think that summer vacations are a great idea. I’ve been staying home."

I feel safe enough by following all of the guidelines and strictly regulating how I interact with others. 

There is an exit strategy and it is very very basic: masks everywhere, at all time, by everyone. Thank gods most NYers and the NE generally get it and are creating room for a sane reopening."
2020-08-19 18:47,"The real problem is that because so many others act irresponsibly and there are no universal rules, it is very difficult for us to control our level of risk even if we take all the proper precautions.

I taught bicycling skills and safety for many years. I know there is no way to eliminate all risk. But a big part of reducing risk on the road lies in the rules and traffic principles that almost everyone knows and follows. Outside of the medical facilities you cite, we really have no parallel to this when it comes to how we are handling the virus. It's a hodgepodge of regulations with many people who won't even accept minor inconveniences. It's the social and  epidemiological equivalent of having noisy political activists and fact deniers who want to ban traffic lights and stop signs and speed limits and hope for the best."
2020-08-19 18:51,"There's one glaring issue with Dr. Rosenthal's argument and it's about schools. She mentions that many physicians feel more comfortable in a hospital than in the general public, and that teachers should return to schools once there are appropriate precautions put in place.

This recommendation implies that there exists a possibility that schools can be as safe as hospitals, but anybody who's spent more than a few hours in a public school knows that children are not medical students. The level of sanitation and safety that one feels in a hospital simply cannot exist in schools without a drastic increase in school staff and ability to enforce sanitary procedures. This goes beyond the scope of ""science-based steps.""

I appreciate the reality check since a vaccine may be a long ways away, but I believe that Dr. Rosenthal may need one of her own - the science-based steps that schools would need are nigh-impossible to implement effectively."

They all worked weeks without face masks, temp checks or symptoms review. 

The stress working in less risky professions is real, I have no idea how medical staff professionals are doing it. 

I am totally fine with only necessary outings in addition to my in office days, as long as it takes."
2020-08-19 18:57,"“In those places where governments, businesses and administrators have set the stage properly...”

Where are those places? And are they free of the class of citizen that believes wearing a mask infringes on their individual rights? I belong to the group of very high risk people, for whom COVID-19 might well be a death sentence. There is no place our group can go and be safe. I also happen to live in Texas, a place with many, many very fine and law abiding folks, but also with more than a few people like Louis Gohmert. So I mostly stay home, and when I must venture out, like to a pharmacy, I mask up, look around carefully once there, take care of business and go home.

I may never again know the pleasures of dining out or having a drink in a bar. Risk avoidance is now the biggest part of my life. So count me among those who fervently hope that good therapeutics and even a half-effective vaccine are available soon."
2020-08-19 19:09,"""In those places where governments, businesses and administrators have set the stage properly, we can ... begin to live again."" 

The school district where I teach to this date has not resolved the issue of requiring mask wearing of students in classrooms come September. A significant number of parents do not want their children to wear masks in the classroom.
This is what we are facing."
2020-08-19 19:17,"Just want to note that I find the author's request that her local post office get an automatic door to be very strange, given the rest of her column. For one thing, the evidence suggests that while surfaces can certainly be a problem, they are less dangerous than sharing breathing space with other human beings. For another, the danger they present can be reduced by using gloves or paper towels or other barriers between your hand and the surface and by immediately disinfecting your hands after touching the surface (and before touching your face). This is a lot easier than dealing with a poor ventilation system in a school or office. Finally, I sure hope the author realizes that the vast majority of businesses and schools in this country are not about to redesign all frequently touched doors and other surfaces, for her safety or anyone else's. If she thinks the money and will to do this actually exist, then she really is living in a bubble."
2020-08-19 19:20,"I feel this author's opinion is credible and makes common sense to me. One point of contention however, is that once school districts successfully put infection control procedures in place, that younger teachers and students should return to the classroom.

 I am a retired primary grades teacher. It is easier said than done to maintain and monitor procedures with young children. Avoid staying for long periods of time in an enclosed room. Well that would be unavoidable in a classroom. Avoid common touch points or sanitize them frequently. Kids touch everything (as do some adults). There is typically not enough janitors in a school to wipe down surfaces all day. The teacher would have to do this or instruct the kids to do it,   There would need to be enough cleaning supplies available  (which normally there is not).I still have trouble finding sanitizing wipes at my local stores. Kids keeping masks on and keeping them clean? Good luck with that. Do these schools have supplies of masks for those kids who don't? Staying 6 feet apart or somewhat apart. The teacher would be refereeing this all day. Heck, adults at my supermarket can't or won't do this in the aisles. I probably wouldn't be as concerned about the kids spreading the virus as I would my fellow teachers. Some younger teachers I know have been traveling out of state, flying on planes, going to indoor restaurants, and even one attended a wedding. They go to risky group settings maybe more than young children do."
2020-08-19 19:22,"I don't understand the emphasis on temperature-taking, etc. As far as I understand, not having an elevated temperature in no way guarantees that a person is not an asymptomatic carrier who can infect others who are working with the same faulty assumption. Colleges are asking students to check their own temperatures daily, and note if they have any other possible symptoms--is that not meaningless? By the time a person exhibits symptoms, they may have already been Ground Zero for many other infections in that community.
""Risk tolerance"" involves both the individual and anyone with whom he or she may come into contact.
I feel absolutely great today, and I know that I don't have a fever. Does that mean that I would feel free to go into a relatively crowded area and assume that I am not putting anyone in harm's way? Absolutely not."
2020-08-19 19:24,"I'm not sure most citizens are skilled at personal risk assessment during a pandemic of this magnitude. As much as I fancy reading peer-reviewed literature, I'm no expert in the fields necessary to evaluate what my risks are (and how to mitigate them - beyond the basic advice covered in your article).

COVID is complex & we're learning at a rapid pace. Providing risk assessments for geographic locales, available health care resources, scenarios, and demographic profiles requires a lot of work and a multi-disciplinary team! That team may take the form of federal, state, and local government and health officials, academics, and specialists like epidemiologists, virologists, microbiologists, geneticists, plus those with expertise in HVAC, engineering, to name a few. 

We then need to effectively communicate the risk info to  audiences in ways people easily understand and are willing to receive. This assumes we have basic agreement on the science, the risks, and the mitigation, and a coordinated, nationwide effort.

Bottom line: making an accurate personal risk tolerance requires current, valid information communicated in ways that make it easy to understand what activities translate into what risks, and what the potential outcomes are if things go south. Unless and until we have all these elements (not to mention access to appropriate PPE and hand sanitizer!), most of us are still limited in our ability to figure out what's safe, what's not, and everything in between."
2020-08-19 19:26,"Reading just a few comments, writers offer statistics on deaths that range from .05% to 1.5% of those diagnosed.  A big difference, and both commentators think they have the right statistic.  Too many unknowns and the Federal Government can't be trusted to be honest because Trump won't allow it.

I agree with most remarks in that if it were just me, my risk would be moderate since I am 74, do my own grocery shopping and live in a house and have a car, both in need of repairs from time to time.  I like to walk my street and nearby park with mask in hand if I meet someone.  Other than that, I isolate.  No restaurants, social gatherings or clothes shopping (where would I go?).  No museums and concerts are not happening anyway.  I won't go to a nearby beach.  There are just too many people who think the rules don't apply to them, and a President who encourages that dangerous behavior.

Add on the fact that this administration does nothing to fight the virus other than offer platitudes and mythologies, I'm sorry for the economy but I'm not contributing.  If Trump is re-elected, considering not paying taxes.  I'm not contributing to the thieves in this government that lets health workers and ordinary people die while they enrich themselves.  Shameful.  Impeach him now, save American lives."
2020-08-19 19:28,"Thanks for this great read.  My risk tolerance is very low and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. I am shocked with how many are still not wearing masks and maintaining distance. And then there are mostly well meaning but ill informed folks) wearing masks which are loose fitting and not even covering their nose. This includes both patrons and employees of my local grocery stores).

In terms of  your note to post office, I can't imagine they would have the money now to install automated drop doors at their boxes!  They're putting their lives at risk as they sort (if sorting machines are still available), deliver and touch all kinds of mail and packages, mail boxes.  We'll be lucky if USPS survives intact after all the defunding, dismantling and tampering going on with surgical like precision at the hands of Trump and the Post Master General.  Just use hand sanitizer and don't touch your face after you use any commonly used surfaces such as gas pumps."
2020-08-19 19:33,"Here in Missouri, I'm just not seeing government set the stage for a safe return to pre-pandemic life.  There is little to no contact tracing occurring, and the governor has taken a mulligan on a statewide mask order, leaving the burden to local governments and causing confusion for travelers.

The mayor of Kansas City has just endorsed fans returning for fall Chiefs games, and local universities are starting class.  To be sure, there is a local mask ordinance, and K-12 school districts are being cautious, so things are not the everyone-for-themselves situation we had earlier in the year.

That said, I live in an apartment building with roughly 20 other people, most of whom are not wearing masks indoors, even in common areas.  I have aging parents and a girlfriend with aging parents.  For the foreseeable future, I intend to work remotely, exercise outdoors, and apart from my girlfriend visit with friends and family outdoors or online.  I plan on going into buildings only rarely and only when necessary.  I'll do carry-out and drive-thru restaurants, but don't plan on dining in.  I'll cut my own hair, and can hopefully get my fall flu shot while on a trip to the grocery store.

The holiday season will be the real test of all of this: what sorts of family pressure will there be to eat indoors, open presents, and go to parties?  Can I hold up under that?"
2020-08-19 19:33,"Another factor to consider when trying to decide whether or not ""getting out of our bunkers"" is a safe bet, is to consider your blood type.  

The ""New England Journal of Medicine"" just published an analysis of 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms"", and concluded, among other things:  ""The association signal at locus 9q34.2 coincided with the ABO blood group locus; in this cohort, a blood-group-specific analysis showed a higher risk in blood group A than in other blood groups"", . . . ""and a protective effect in blood group O as compared with other blood groups"".

Chinese scientists had come up with this conclusion earlier, but before the NEJM article, this information was considered only preliminary, in the absence of further study.  Knowing one's blood type now seems to be an important factor in determining how far to go to get our of our bunkers."
2020-08-19 19:43,"I am very lucky to live in Western Massachusetts where people aggressively isolated and continue to follow masking recommendations and distancing as a demonstration of their understanding of personal responsibility and respect for others. This continues in a county that has had no positive cases in the month of August in spite of out of state vacationers, admittedly many from New York and other Northeastern states that also currently follows guidelines.
I recently drove with my family to Northern Michigan to drop my son off at his school - passing through NY, PA, OH on our way. We limited our activities, masked and distanced, but did swim on a beach with other people present and stand in line for ice cream and sandwiches. We saw many examples of people displaying their ""constitutional right"" to be stupid, including several government employees including members of the police, but were never threatened by any of these patriots.

You need at least 60% of the public being vaccinated to get herd immunity.

The key is to act as if everyone has it.  The risk is too great to have a less than diligent respect for a virus that gets the last word.  There is no getting around the fact that we are at its mercy.  Every day more elementary, secondary schools and colleges shut down when infections break out.  Who saw this coming?

The total lack of management of this virus by this country's leaders has given it free reign to run amok.  If I were living in say, New Zealand, I'd likely have a more carefree attitude.  America is the  global hot zone leader, useless passports and all.  

Even if a patient can be brought back from the brink of death, many of the ""recovered"" suffer from chronic health issues afterwards.  Covid-19 is a crap shoot. The dice tumble randomly and the outcome is not predictable.

First, nowhere in America came close to ""near total lockdown""; for that, you'd have to look to China or Italy, places that properly enforced quarantine with police patrols and massive fines.

And saying ""once schools have put in place appropriate science-based steps, most teachers (those not in high risk groups) should return to their jobs"" flat out tells all teachers not in high risk groups what their risk tolerance should be.

By all means, people should inform themselves of what the risks actually are and how to minimize them.  But, after that, your risk tolerance is up to you. It is not true that ""everyone is going to have to assess their risk tolerance and cautiously push their personal boundaries bit by bit.""  Assessing your risk tolerance and (if you are fortunate enough that your job/finances allow it) adhering to it is perfectly fine.  No boundary pushing required."

And they weren’t contagious the entire time.

If you’re outdoors with nobody around, there’s no reason to mask. Just walking by someone doesn’t seem risky. Surfaces aren’t as dangerous as we thought and anyway, don’t you wash hands before eating?

As it happens, 20-somethings are setting their own risk tolerance all over the place and it is causing flare ups in cases, not only among this age group, but amongst their contacts, co-workers, families and the like.  Their risk tolerance means my risk goes up.

Moreover, the risk tolerance of another person impacts my risk. Thus, someone can decide not to wear a mask because they are tolerant of the risk of getting covid. Perhaps they've decided it's better to get the disease than to stay home. However, that person's mask protects me as well. They might already be asymptomatic. Now my risk level is elevated.

It is absolutely the wrong message that each of us can 'dial up' or 'dial down' risk at our choice.  Rather, the correct message is that if ALL of us collectively take steps to reduce risk, then all of us will be at a lower risk. At that point, the incidence goes way down, and all of us can resume normal activities.

The virus is still partly a black box, with too many unknowns.  Our state is approaching it that way, more reactively (albeit with intelligence) than fully proactively.   For example, schools here have a delayed and partial opening.  I am dubious of this attempt, but the state is going into it gingerly, and will likely modify or back out of their plan rapidly if it, sadly, goes the way I fear it will.

Our state is being as generous as a relatively poor state can be with with social benefits, seems to be well-prepared medically, and seems to have our population on board.  We are neither being passive nor heedless; as a doctor I get regular updates of state governmental procedures by email, and our governor has weekly, or more frequent, press conferences to keep us informed.    

Mostly, my own personal risk assessment correlates well with what I am hearing and reading.   And it basically states that safety measures need to be paramount, and taking risks needs to await a scientific rationale."

For example, if I was a teacher (I’m not) and her patient (also clearly not) and I asked her what her view was on my going back to the classroom, would the answer be yes, assuming certain precautions were taken? 

Seems like in that case a doctor would have to think only about the patient, not about other things."

Like abstinence-only education is a failure, so to is shaming those who are making these kinds of risk assessments. 

The situation is what it is. The federal leadership is what it is. While we work on that situation (vote!), we should be mindful that abstinence-only COVID education will fall on many deaf ears. If those we are that view this dichotomously, can instead hear feedback that it's okay to go out to eat, but eat outside- or its okay to send your kid to school, but advocate hard that their district does distancing/policies  properly--this results in a more achievable outcome than just shouting form the rooftops that everything is horrible and you aren't to do anything or go anywhere. People who hear that message and can't or won't stay home, might take some of the risk mitigation measures."
2020-08-19 21:20,"I have a high tolerance for the risk involved and long for the world to reopen fully. For those who want to isolate, that’s easy enough. Happy to wear a mask and wash hands, but the world needs to open. More people are going to start dying because of lack of health I suranné and poverty. We don’t have the social safety net to compensate. This has gone on long enough."
2020-08-19 20:56,I'm telling everyone I know to read this
2020-08-19 21:31,"This is a long article about almost nothing and I aim to critique the author in the same way she rambles on and on.

First, medical professionals know their career choice entails some additional risk vs. not entering a patient care profession. Sure, they expect and deserve to have PPE. That said, any quick study of history should tell you that the risk in patient care will vary depending on the practice context and time period. Virus outbreaks happen. Needle sticks happen. Even with PPE, caring for people in March or April in a NYC hospital was somewhat risky. This is one of many reasons I myself did not elect to become a doctor - and trust me, I had my pick of any medical school.

Second, a vaccine will greatly reduce the risk of getting COVID. It won't eliminate the risk. But, that is missing the point. By the end of 2021 the risk will be dramatically reduced for me and any other individual who takes a vaccine in multiple ways. A vaccine will reduce the chances I will become ill by at least 50% (threshold set by FDA), and likely by a greater degree that I'd become severely ill or hospitalized. Also, if 50% of the country gets the vaccine, that reduces the risk even further by boosting the herd's collective immunity and reducing transmission. Finally, by the end of 2020, many more people will have caught the virus and gained some immunity, further reducing transmission as has happened in NYC."
2020-08-19 21:36,"Schools need to reopen (K-12 and colleges), with these measures in place. Corona will be with us forever now, and we need to treat it appropriately. For some people, it is very risky--they must take (and be allowed to take) all precautions. For most of us, distancing and masking will reduce the risks enough to open society and get some semblance of life back.

Also: We have no idea what the effect will be of reducing/eliminating exposure to ALL viruses will be, long-term. And yet that is exactly what we are doing with lock-downs. Our immune systems will be toast in a few years without that exposure (and no, I'm not talking about measles etc., I mean to common colds and flus)."
2020-08-19 21:42,"Something feels off about this piece.  Particularly where she writes that ""most teachers (those not in high-risk groups) should return to their jobs.""  

From a doctor and reporter who has experience treating and writing about infectious disease, she should know that children, teenagers, and healthy young adults (I am one of them) have gotten very sick from covid (and some have died).  

It is irresponsible to give people false comfort that only ""high-risk groups"" can die from this disease or be severely compromised for life, when that is simply not true and we know that now."
2020-08-19 21:45,"If you decide you want or need to apply for Social Security benefits during this season of plague, you will discover that office appointments are no longer available. Instead, you must arrange for a phone appointment. Now, I do understand that the majority of Social Security applicants are in their sixties or older and therefore don’t need to be breathing anyone else’s air in a small, stuffy room; but a significant number are younger, and in some cases much younger. Therefore, until the federal government decides to reopen Social Security offices nationwide, I will maintain that Covid-19 poses a significant risk nationwide and that individual risk assessment is just another way of saying people are free nationwide to spread—and contract— the virus."
2020-08-19 21:59,"If every citizen were issued several fitting n95 masks and wore them everywhere but their bedroom and bathroom, this would probably be over in a month, and that could have been done months ago with proper planning and action at the federal level. 

Instead, 170,000 dead, who knows how many disabled for life, and still no semblance of control."
2020-08-19 22:04,"I herniated a disc in my back in March. I wasn’t even able to get diagnosed until May, and have been in weekly physical therapy since then. didn’t start My condition is only now starting to improve but I still can’t cough or sneeze without excruciating pain. My parents are mid-70s, my dad drives me to my doctor appointments. I am working from home, I don’t go anywhere except physical therapy & doctors offices, the grocery store & drugstore, and taking my small dog on short outdoor walks in a local park. My risk tolerance is very low. I have developed a lot of patience in these past months and am perfectly willing to continue to stay home as much as possible as long as necessary. This, too, shall pass."
2020-08-19 22:09,"""In contrast, on the sidewalk, the coronavirus could be roaming free if people aren’t wearing masks.""

Low outdoor risk, especially when there's a breeze.

""Which is why masking should be mandated and enforced."" 

How will it be enforced? Police won't do it, so...

""In addition to wearing masks and social distancing when not at home, we should avoid prolonged periods in indoor spaces with crowds or strangers.""

How is ""prolonged"" defined? And any public place will have strangers in it, so...

""And we have to demand that anywhere we go — bookstores, medical offices, trains or hair salons — requires that patrons follow these guidelines.""

And how will the ""demand"" be made. There's only one way to deal with it. If rule flouters are inside, leave, and before doing so, tell the owner/manager why you are leaving."
2020-08-19 22:25,"I've been vigilant and on lockdown since March.  I only leave the house to pick up curbside groceries and daily walks in a remote area.  I unfortunately live in the county in my state with the currently highest covid infection rate in WA (actually the tri-county area around me is ranked worst in my state).  But I have been fighting a sinus infection for months and have had to go to the Dr office twice in the past month.  I went today and as scary as it is to venture out it is oddly a normalizing feeling to go out an do things that we used to do all the time.  Put on your mask, maintain social distance but at some point we have to come out from our bunkers and live our lives.  I wish I would have gone to the Dr for this back in May, before it got so bad.....Be safe out there."
2020-08-19 22:35,"In order to adequately and reasonably determine our appetite for risk, we need to have a reliable measure of mortality risk, not risk of infection. I am shocked that 6 months into this that there is not some trusted measure that can give a person their odds of death / serious complications based on their age and any comorbidities. Instead, everyone simply talks about mitigation of spread."
2020-08-19 22:37,"I know of three households that aren't leaving the house except to walk around the neighborhood.

One of the three left New York City for upstate, where they have food delivered to their rural location. Both in mid-60s.

Another is in Berkeley, Calif.; both in early 70s.

The third stays put in a high-rise luxury condominium in Manhattan. I gather that the building is virtually empty. He's in his mid-60s.

None of these households has gone anywhere since about March, except, in the case of the upstate couple, back to New York for two dental appointments.

That's my age too. I continue to mountain bike, road ride, grocery shop, go to a café with outdoor seating, and occasionally visit a store like Home Depot or a bookstore. I had my teeth cleaned a couple of weeks ago. I visit friends, but we sit outside; if we go inside, we mask up.

I draw the line at having my hair cut (doing it myself), going to my gym (doing pushups at home but not enough of them), or flying anywhere.

My best friend (mid-50s) goes to work every day; she's in health care but could work at home if she chose.

So, risk tolerances vary. The Berkeley friend is only a bit older than me but for some years has been unwilling to drive herself on freeways and maybe over bridges."
2020-08-19 22:48,"My risk tolerance is pretty high, and it has been since the beginning of this mess. Unlike others my age (67), I actually remember the Hong Kong Flu Pandemic of 1968-1969, when between 1 and 4 million people died worldwide (estimates of 100-400,000 deaths in the US alone), and yet, there were no lockdowns, no school closures, no masks outside of hospitals, no bar closures, no closed movie theaters, etc etc. Nothing at all changed for my junior and senior year of High School. Nobody blinked an eye at the Vietnam War protestors, the Civil Rights protestors, or the Woodstock Music Festival. Crowds gathered in Florida to watch the blastoff of the rocket carrying Neil Armstrong to space for the Moon Landing.

The author is exactly correct that people under 60, and especially under 50, don’t realize that during the 68-69 Pandemic, we had soldiers dying in Vietnam, and at home people were dying of TB and Polio, in addition to the Hong Kong Flu. The population was used to death and dying and realized it’s part of life. We had more hospital beds, more doctors and nurses (3 shifts instead of 2), and loads of PPE in stock (none of this buy it when you need it).

I didn’t start wearing a mask until July. We’ve been going to dine-in restaurants all summer. Ditto the grocery store, weekly. I meet friends for lunch once a week, and we dine inside. I just brought my son to the airport (it smelled like lysol). I would fly if I had somewhere to go. I can’t wait to get back on a cruise ship."
2020-08-19 22:50,"One issue with risk assessment is the human desire for short-term gratification.  This has been experienced by everyone who has ever tried to lose weight.  The pleasure of eating your favorite fattening foods is immediate.  The health consequences are uncertain and may be years away, giving you the argument that you can eat french fries today but ignore them tomorrow, and all will be well in the long run. Maybe it will. But we need to stop thinking of catching Covid-19 as something that can happen only in the long run, so you may as well experience the gratification of attending that party tonight. Covid can easily happen to you today and either kill you, or give you long-term damage to your health."
2020-08-19 22:55,"In most of the US, it's not time to open up. Or states already opened up and now have to close back down. We're about to head into winter when outdoor gathering options aren't available in many states. Universities and schools are foolishly opening. 

Most of the country has never actually enacted a real social distancing scheme. Too many cheats and cut corners, or just innocent mistakes due to ignorance. It won't be safe for a very long time because we didn't do it right the first time."
2020-08-19 22:59,"My sister is in the educational system for decades. and knows many school nurses.

They were completely overwhelmed with both emotional and physical issues before COVID.  After COVID?"
2020-08-19 23:04,"Unfortunately, states such as New York botched the response to Covid-19 so badly that it put an extraordinary amount of fear into people. This fear (extremely low risk tolerance) is now very difficult for people to overcome."
2020-08-19 23:40,"I find myself almost unique among my friends and acquaintances because I continue to understand that COVID-19 hasn't changed a bit. Just because the numbers are down, if someone becomes infected, it remains a terrible death sentence for some and a very dangerous and perhaps permanently debilitating illness for others. And my tolerance for risk is low. So, I stay inside our apartment. I do not see anyone other than my husband, who ventures out of the apartment down to the lobby to pick up deliveries and down the hall to throw away the trash. Do I think this is “sensible” or “logical”.No, not particularly, but I am an anxious person and any time I might get a haircut or dine inside or outside a restaurant or go to a store or visit a friend or even hug my old dearest son, I would be asking myself “is this particular moment of pleasure worth it?”. And the answer would always be no because any risk taking behavior would, at best,  cause me at least 14 days of terror, at worst, well, we know what worst might mean. Should others live like we do? Certainly not, but everyone should understand that any interaction outside their bubble brings risk, they need to estimate that risk using all the information which we now know about how the virus is transmitted and they should know themselves, how well they can tolerate that risk. Unfortunately, I think many people skip one or the other of those steps, putting themselves or others at unnecessary risk of illness or fear."
2020-08-19 23:41,"""most teachers (those not in high-risk groups) should return to their jobs"" - What about teachers who recognize that hybrid plans will worsen the pandemic, damage everyone's mental health, and still not get anyone back to work? What about teachers who use their professional expertise to say ""education in these conditions will not be an improvement."" What about teachers who have their own school-age children and would need to pay their entire salaries to put  their children at risk (in daycares/school) and themselves at risk rather than taking care of them themselves?  What about teachers who recognize that they never get supplies so why should they trust they will get PPE? Why are teachers the only professionals whose opinions about their field are not trusted? Teachers are saying: hybrid plans will not help the situation. They are not answers to the problems we have -- lack of childcare, wellness, academic deficits.  Doctors and nurses knew they were helping society with their work in the pandemic; teachers know that going back in-person will not make things better for education or public health."
2020-08-19 23:55,"Getting a nasal swab test is risky.  You have to take off your mask and be inches from a health care worker’s face.   Even if the health care worker wears a mask this only cuts down on your risk.  It doesn’t eliminate it.  Also, corona droplets could be lurking on the protective clothing of the test taker and aerosols  can be floating around from the previous patients.  
Standing in line with infected people and going up in the elevator to the testing facility present more hazards."
2020-08-20 0:07,I agree with the author.  Risk tolerance does reflect one's risk at the individual level.   Risk for infection?  The elderly are more at risk for serious harm from infection.    Should 20 year olds practice the same caution as 80 year olds?   Doesn't seem logical and quite unrealistic.  CDC and others recommend 80 year olds stay home except for essential needs.   It is clear that 20 year olds are far more likely to survive infection than 80 year olds making it sensible that their risk tolerance be higher.  Risk tolerance is an individual matter.  But it goes further.  Some people are terribly anxious about any threat to themselves long before covid.  Their risk tolerance even if younger will be lower.
2020-08-20 0:33,"I agree with so many readers who posted comments here about not having control over others' behavior. How can we judge risk with so many unknowns?  My husband has compromised lungs (not Covid-related). I had to retire early from my work because my co-workers and boss were not wearing masks in the office. Our governor has done his best, but he is facing tough opposition. Churches sued him to be allowed to worship inside, and they won, and our governor chose not to appeal. Thus, inside worship began, unregulated.   The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, only 30 minutes from my home attempted to hold classes in person and was forced to shut down only days after opening because of multiple outbreaks. Risk that can be weighed with a sense of confidence is not available to us at this time. Thus, we stay home except for outside social distance visits and medical appointments. This column is more hopeful than realistic -- at least where I live."

2020-08-19 23:21,"I've moved on, and so have others. It's ok for your life not to be about coronavirus. In fact, that is silly. I laugh at the bunker people, but not to their faces of course. I think most of us do."
2020-08-19 21:07,"""Which is why masking should be mandated and enforced. It’s not just about your individual risk tolerance, but about keeping everyone safe.""

Excellent observation!  My own sense is that the mask I wear is primarily for the protection of people I pass by.  I happen to believe that I am not infected, but really, I JUST DON'T KNOW!   The mask is much more about source control than anything else.  It does very little to protect me.   

My wearing a mask is very much a matter of politeness, something I do to convince others that I am not a blithering jerk.   Like those who refuse to mask up."
2020-08-19 22:04,"My daughter just started her freshman year in college. In  a dorm. I could not convince my daughter or wife that this was folly. Lots of universities have already discovered their folly and shut down. What do I do with my daughter when her university realizes their folly and sends her home? I'm 71, male, recovering from surgery and have type A+ blood, all high risk factors. Should I send her to a hotel? If she comes home infected, and I get it, I could die or worse. This is serious!"
2020-08-19 22:56,"Peculiarly rambling and contradictory piece of I-don't-know-what. Perhaps the doctor title means confusion passes editorial scrutiny. Yes, some people are waiting for a vaccine or readily available home testing with rapid results before engaging in pursuits that could bring short-term satisfaction but erase the chance for many more healthy years."
2020-08-19 23:47,"It was truly cruel to expect health care workers to go to work without providing them the protective gear they wanted and needed. And it is astounding that the Trump administration did not early on demand that the relevant industries get to work in supplying the gear and equipment that medical professionals said we need. Such incompetence, thoughtlessness and selfishness, on the part of Trump and of his weak-willed subordinates, surely deserves punishment."

2020-08-19 20:54,I thought all post offices were required to have one button operated door under ADA. Our little PO has one and I use that and do not use my hand.

I wear gloves for those occasions and wash them when I get home.
2020-08-19 21:10,"The huge, huge thing about this is that it's NOT only about you and how risk averse *you* are about getting COVID - Its about how risk averse you are about killing someone else, which with this particular disease is so easy to do. 

We have not in most of our memories ever had a disease that is so easily passed and too often from people who are actually showing no symptoms themselves..... There are terrible diseases out there for sure - you can be risk averse and avoid things like AIDS and Ebola for yourself - by avoiding risky behaviors or visiting certain areas, or more common diseases like measles by being vaccinated, but with COVID, the simply act of your going to the grocery store can kill someone if you've got it. You may be 25 and feel like if you get it, you'll be fine (maybe.... now we are finding out that many - up to possibly 80% -  who've had it,  even asymptomatic people, are showing signs of myocarditis/endocarditis...) so you have continued to got out, not social distance, not protect yourself and others with PPE, but just remember it's not only your own health and life that you are risking... there are plenty of people out there who may be harmed by your lack of risk aversion. Me - I wouldn't want to live with the burden of having started an outbreak that kills people.... I will remain highly risk averse, not for myself, but for other people."
2020-08-19 23:46,"I have no fear of Covid-19.  None.  I know of 5 people who have had the virus, 4 of which were in health care and 1 who was an asymptomatic college student.

Add to this the stress of COVID-19 and no seeing friends at school or elsewhere? And travel restrictions that keep us on the other coast? Small wonder everybody’s anxiety level is through the roof some days. But they carry on, for all of us. And all we can do from here is hope our son-in-law remains out of harm’s way.

""My wife and other doctors are figuring out who to test and when ...""

Anyone serving in the close confines so often required by active duty should be tested early and often, especially if their symptoms bear the slightest hint of a Covid-like condition. In such cases, otherwise symptomless patients may spread the virus to more healthy, symptomless people and thence to someone(s) who must be taken off active duty for long periods.

Forget the White House blather. Knowing is better and safer than not knowing, especially when military proficiency depends on healthy teams of troops and sailors."

She says this has been the hardest move in their 20 yrs. and think of the kids-how hard it is for them to make new friends under the circumstances).

2020-08-20 14:12,"No other President in modern times has attempted to so weaponize the military against our own citizens as Trump.  He us already tried to delegitimize the outcome of the election if he looses and with that comes the clear implication he will not leave the Whitehouse no matter the outcome.  

The fact he has surrounded himself with sycophants
in the highest level of government  whose allegiance is to him alone instead of to the Nation has all the trappings of an attempted coup d'état should he lose.

As unthinkable as all this may seem, these past three and half years of Trump have demonstrated that nothing is beyond the realm of possibility he might do.

If the unthinkable does happen it will likely fall upon the conscience of our military, from the lowest to the highest ranks and from those who carry weapons to those who treat the sick, including Mr. McCaulley's wife to protect us from a would be dictator.  That will be their ultimate duty.

Let every soldier know they are obliged to follow lawful orders only, and that come November 3rd, 2020, with the grace of ""nature and natures God"" that Trump looses the election, no order that in any way undermines the peaceful transfer of power will be lawful.

But most of all, it is the duty of every citizen to vote in such overwhelming numbers there will be no need for our men and woman of the military to save us from ourselves."
2020-08-20 14:14,"May she come back home to y'all safe and sound.
Good luck with your incredibly difficult situation.

(I'm a disabled-retired firefighter; married 22 years, but really only 14. ""Deployed"" 1 day out of three, per shifts.)"
2020-08-20 14:15,She got called to duty as per the agreement right? Quid pro quo.
2020-08-20 14:16,"My husband is in a very specialized field in the DOD. it is the same field he specialized in while serving. He is aware, if there is need, he could be called upon to work where his expertise is needed. His skill should not be needed out side of the base he is at now unless it was a a global declared war. He is also a trained combat medic. He received a letter earlier this year stating those who met current certification requirements could be sent to areas of need. His certifications were were a bit dated to meet the requirements, but he would have gone had he been called. many DOD civil servants, who served in the military, still consider themselves a civilian members of the military, and in my opinion, so does the military. He has never even questioned the occasional TDY. None of those have ever been dangerous so I haven't either. Inconvenient often, but I am so proud of my husband and his devotion to the pledge he took as a young Airmen to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States from all invaders foreign and domestic. Including this invisible invader. I wish your wife, you and your family all my best. Spouses who did not take this pledge often find it harder than our spouses, but I did take a pledge to support him in good times and bad him when I became his wife. This helps me during difficult times."
2020-08-20 14:21,"Retired Army doc, and Army brat here. Thank you for this column. It is very hard for many civilians to grasp the kinds of sacrifices that military families make.  That said: I would not trade my growing up as an Army brat, or my ~36 years in uniform for the alternative.  I got to live in Japan and in Germany as a child. I got to practice medicine on three continents, had responsibilities at a younger age than I'd ever have had had in civilian life, and, heck: got paid for rappelling out of a helicopter and firing weapons of war in perfect safety.  I love socialized medicine, too."
2020-08-20 13:28,"My friend, the role of a military spouse is one of the highest calls to duty.  Keep your head up and know that your job is very important, and an essential cog in the wheel of the military machine.  An active duty service member can not be 100% effective if they must constantly worry about their family at home.  We salute you!"
2020-08-20 13:00,"Ask any republican what their reaction to the word ""deserve"" is?  Ask them what they think of ""entitlements"".  Ask them about billionaires and 'businessmen'.  You will note a pattern.  It is that the rich are deserving of tax cuts because why should the government take their money, and the poor deserve nothing but derision for their condition.  This may seem curt and worse, but as Obama intoned last night, this isn't not a time to reflect on things, it is a time for action; and that action is to throw every Republican out because all of them are complicit in 'Trump'."
2020-08-20 13:12,Thank you both for your service.
2020-08-20 13:41,"Universal public service for all for 2 years out of everyone’s life. The fit, the sick, lazy and lame, bone spurs and all. Man the fighting holes, cockpit or bridge, fire-line, phone line, food-line, kitchen, drive a truck, counsel kids, tutor kids or adults, make holes and patch holes in roads, fields or on people. Lots to do, many to do it and most willing. In college right now? Good!  Serve after you get your degree. The Universal American Patriot Service will pay for two years of that fine education in History. Or three if you stay another year. You can teach the history to soldiers being deployed to that conflict zone. Helpful to know the history of where we are killing and being killed. Don’t want to serve?  Perform your two years in Camp Timeout. Make license plates and Chef in that institution. No weekend passes and no criminal record. Flee the country lose your citizenship. Bone spurs and all."
2020-08-20 13:44,"The military never gives our veterans the best possible health care available. Tell that drivel to the thousands who took their own lives because of PTSD. Tell that to the vets still suffering from Agent orange and dioxin poisoning, gulf war syndrome or the myriad of mental health complexities. Our vets are treated like expendable assets during and after deployment. I know one who will never work again and he’s not even 40 yet."
2020-08-20 13:45,"This is a fantastic opinion piece, written by someone who has a sense that we are part of something bigger than just ourselves. This attitude is in stark contrast to the selfishness of Trump and the Republicans."
2020-08-20 14:20,Hard to see the negative comments. She is serving her country. It's hard. Service men and women often do not get the thanks they deserve. So THANK YOU.
2020-08-20 14:13,"I'm sorry. This is absurd. Your wife has been in the military for 15 years and this is her first deployment? The idea that her ""luck"" ran out is absolutely abhorrent. I've spent nearly 16 years in the military. I'm currently on my sixth deployment. I've spent nearly 5 years in Iraq/Afghanistan. You're supposed to want to deploy. It's what we do. We deploy. She's been well compensated for this small deployment, considering she had her medical school paid for. I commend the sentiment behind this column. However, your wife's luck didn't run out. Her number was called. And, by the way, it's about time it was."
2020-08-20 14:27,"We are grateful for your wife's service and for the sacrifices of the entire family. Many have been where you are, myself and my family included, and you are very likely to not only get through it but to develop a deeper appreciation for the gifts you've been given. 

Good luck as you move toward that point."
2020-08-20 14:28,You had me at “kids were at camp”.  So weird that seems like such a far off fantasy... a relic or a bygone era.  There’s still camp?  A safe camp free of the coronavirus?  Lucky indeed.
2020-08-20 14:38,"Life is what happens after you make a plan. 

When I practiced, reservists who were called up often lost their employer provided health care. We didn't bother to create a bill for the kids when they got sick or injured. 

 As someone who grew up in a military town, I knew it was my duty to take care of them ... while they were off taking care of others. 

Not creating a bill was liberating. I highly recommend single payer health care because it returns the doctor-patient relationship to what it should be: a humanitarian endeavor. Don't saddle docs with med school debt, pay them a good wage, and then everyone wins."
2020-08-20 12:25,"As a reservist twice recalled and deployed overseas, I know you have the hard job.  I could focus solely on my people and the mission to which I was assigned.  My wife, back home, had to deal with teenagers and keeping the entire family on track.  

I came back physically to the USA in 2010 but I am still in the process of gathering up parts of my soul.  They were broken off as part of my investment in doing the right thing for my people and the locals with whom I worked.  I remain in awe of the caliber of the people I served with, and the faith, family and community of the local people I tried to serve as best I could.  

Please know that your wife's return will probably be the start of another education and transition.  It takes time to remember how fortunate we are to still walk this earth, and figure how best to use this knowledge and responsibility.  

Sounds like you have a tough and strong family.  Call on me should I be of any help, and know that my wife is eager to share her education as to how to make it work.  I can help you to avoid mistakes I made that you will not want to repeat. 

My two kids can serve yours also. They were, and are, my rock along with their mother.  

You and your family not only serve alongside those military family members, I believe you have the tougher job.  I am grateful for what you and your children are doing."
2020-08-20 13:09,"Thank you for this insight about how your wife's deployment impacts you and your children. It's time that this country pulled together. Perhaps it is time for a universal service requirement by young Americans ... men and women ... military or other form of service for a period of time. When I read your words and felt your pain of loss and support, I recalled a statement I overheard on Park Avenue in NYC from the mouth of a young man:  ""We pay for a military, don't we?"" (this was in 2001 in response to 9/11). Until every one of us is required to SERVE this country, to protect it and nurture our deepest values, then there will always be the Elite, who think they can buy anything and everything they need. Money is God. That's wrong. Service is the great leveler. We ALL need to serve our country. Thank you for being part of a grounded and loving team!"
2020-08-20 12:55,"Thank you for your family's service in this difficult time. I hope that you find, as I did, that your children are more resilient than you ever anticipated during a parent's deployment.  My spouse has been out for years, but my children now look back on that time in the service with pride. They are both proud of my husband for serving and proud of themselves - they know they can face down hardship because they have done it. I hope your children arrive at the same conclusion. I pray for your family's continued peace and safety."
2020-08-20 12:59,Thanks for your family's sacrifice. Write again if there's anything constructive that we can do.
2020-08-20 14:36,"And, “In a moment, our anniversary, the start of school, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Eve were all transformed.”  
This sounds like everybody.  
Not to discount the loss that the author experiences.  
But that about sums it up... on top of the losses of Easter, Mothers Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, birthday celebrations, Labor Day, vacations.....
Join the crowd. It’s sad and awful.
Just a day ago my daughter in law realized that Halloween for her 5 and 6 year olds, as we know it, will not happen either."
2020-08-20 14:14,"Thank Y❤️U for your family’s service and sacrifices to our country. I must admit the title made me think something terrible had happened to your wife.

The rest of us could take note of how military families care for one another, and do the same, especially now."
2020-08-20 14:21,How profoundly we crave a president worthy of our people.
2020-08-20 14:57,"The growing military-civilian divide is eroding not only our military's lethality but also our foreign policy. 

Many civilians have simply forgotten about us and the ""wars"" we fight because they don't know anybody in the military. The number of SMs that come from miliatry families is large, and increasing. There just aren't enough candidates who are the first in their family to volunteer, and the military must do a better job of attracting a more diverse and talented pool of candidates (yes, it should be a volunteer force). 

Conversely, many SMs and their families will read this article and think: ""So what? That's what you signed up for, welcome to the club."" That seems harsh, but it's true. Dr. McCaulley has a job to do, she is well trained to do it, and I'm sure she will execute her job at a high level. That is what she and her family signed up for. Military Spouses understand this. They may not like it, but they understand it. Kids though... the sacrifices of military children are largely lost among most Americans. 

Many things about the military are impossible to understand if you or your family have never had to do it yourself. And the evidence shows that there are few who do understand. That makes the military life easy to forget about at the ballot box. Perhaps if more people did understand, we'd think twice about our foreign forays."
2020-08-20 14:51,"Luck has nothing to do with it.

It always irritates me when someone in the military thinks it's a hardship when they are called to do the job they signed up for.

These people really just signed up for the financial benefits, hoping they would never, actually, have to do their job.

You should be proud your wife had an opportunity to serve."
2020-08-20 13:33,"We've been doing this for 26 years...multiple deployments overseas, even more month or longer training exercises, and over a dozen moves including two overseas moves.  I do find it a little ironic that it took 15 years for your family to finally experience what most of those in the military experience yearly. That being said, welcome to the club! This has been the norm since 9/11 and even before than when Balkan and Kuwait deployments were regular as clockwork.  

Thank you for supporting your military spouse who volunteered for the military and was paid by the military for her training. 

Having seen how my spouse has had to deal with all the deployments, crappy housing, shoddy medical care, the daily things everyone has to overcome, but now as a ""semi-single"" parent, my respect for all military families will always be first and foremost in my thoughts.  

Too many in our country forget what sacrifices are asked of our all-volunteer military. Thanks for highlighting this to an audience that may not have the same experience we have and you now have."
2020-08-20 14:01,"Thank you for your service. My immediate service and duty to my country is abundantly clear. The commander in chief is not qualified to hold his post and it's my duty to speak to every military person I can to convince them similarly. Based on the Mueller Report and the followup senate report issued two days ago, Trump should be impeached but his stranglehold on the senate and DOJ has allowed him to escape due process. 

I fully expect Trump to use the military to force his occupation of the white house after he loses the election but the oath we take as servicemen and women is not to Trump. Rather, our oath is to COUNTRY so when the ""would be"" dictator attempts his coup, I trust the military will remember its duty is to nation, not some bankrupt real estate developer whose lead the country to hell for the last 4 years. 

The military will be the final defense of our democracy and I expect the best."
2020-08-20 13:46,Thank you .... thank you .... thank you

2020-08-20 15:12,"You are lucky that you were together for so many years without any separations until now.  Many military wives must live alone on and off base for months at a time, either pregnant, with a small baby, or multiple children.  Many military wives go through their entire pregnancy with their husband on a TDY in the States or posted overseas.  Sounds like you live where you have support from the community.  Just hope that your wife will go to serve as a doctor wherever the pandemic is rampant, as the medical personnel there are exhausted and at their wits' end trying to help patients.  They need a B team to come in to help."
2020-08-20 15:16,"I too have a family member in the military. He spent a good part of the last 18 years in the Middle East. He missed a lot of his kids' growing up. The sacrifices his family made were enormous.

All the best to your family, and our love goes with you all."
2020-08-20 15:25,"As a former Vietnam era Navy corpsman, I'd like to send my sincere appreciation to your wife for her service to our men and women in uniform; to you for being her constant support; and to your children for having to learn the hard way what ""sacrifice for the greater good"" really means."
2020-08-20 15:27,"I am the child of military parents.  This story really hit home.  Being a military kid is difficult.  I also wouldn't change a thing regarding my upbringing.  However, having a parent deployed away from the family for any extended period of time can be very disruptive.  I was in 7th grade when my dad was deployed away for one year.  He came home a different man.    Myself, going through puberty & the drama that brings with it became a different person.  We never really recovered from that year.  I wish these people only the best of luck.  It will change your life."
2020-08-20 15:45,"Here's a few things that may provide perspective on Mr. McCaulley's domestic circumstances: His wife did receive a medical education typically worth around $250k in return for her military commitment which included her potential for deployment.

Her seven month assignment is not unduly long by comparable standards. For instance, Foreign Service officers are typically sent on two-year assignments, increasingly in hardship posts which means that their families can't accompany them.

Sacrifice by all military ranks, many in far more difficult circumstances, have been a common aspect of military service for generations. The pandemic certainly makes more difficult but not unusually so."
2020-08-20 15:45,This is a graceful essay with a poor and misleading headline.  Your luck is in the health and safety of your family and so far no one has been compromised.  But as we are at war with Covid your wife's role as a doctor is urgently needed.  We will work and pray that all will remain safe and healthy into the future.
2020-08-20 15:51,"Thank you Mr. McCaulley for your story. I grew up on military bases.   The medical teams were always professional and overworked, even by civilian doctor standards.  But we still got excellent care. 
My family was lucky. My father rarely deployed away from home.   Few civilians understand the breath and depth of the commitment of military's personnel."
2020-08-20 15:52,Must be difficult when so much time goes by before a deployment but your family handled it gracefully. I’d love reading a follow up.

I am truly sorry that your wife was called up, but I thank her for being willing to serve her country, and I thank you and your family, from my family, from the depths of our hearts.

Be well, and may the months pass swiftly."
2020-08-20 16:23,"Parents are essential workers, always have been and always will be.

2020-08-20 16:35,"Thank you, your spouse, and your children for your service.  Being family members of uniformed service personnel is a vocation in and of itself.  When I was a military chaplain I often counseled spouses facing the deployment of their Sailors or Marines that  everyone member of the family serves in their own way -- and everyone sacrifices.  And while some of the best support mechanisms for young military families are the more-seasoned families who've ""been there, done that,"" the separation is always difficult.  This column reminds us all of the incredible debt we owe not only to uniformed personnel but to their loved ones, as well.  Good luck and godspeed!"
2020-08-20 16:41,"As the mother of three active duty children and the wife of a newly retired AF Lieutenant Colonel, I'm thankful for the sacrifice of your wife, but also the sacrifice you and your children are making. As you say, it's not out of blindness to our country's troubled past that our military women and men serve, nor of a love of violence. It's service before self. It's refreshing to read your story, as more and more people have little connection to our military and their families. Kyrie Eleison."

2020-08-20 16:54,"Being one of those born and raised in the military, moving and deployments were a part of the life. We moved at least 3 times before I entered the 1st grade; Nebraska, Virginia Beach, NYC. After that it was Maine, during the Korean War and the start of the Cold War, and then off to Morocco for more of the Cold War in one of the hottest places on earth, the edge of the Sahara Desert. Before I was born mother and four other wives drove Military 4x4s and 6x6s up and down the coast carrying equipment and supplies from Virginia to the Carolinas and back while the husbands searched out areas to practice landing the gliders that would be used in the invasion of Normandy. And they would have dinner ready when the guys landed at the end of the day. The women received no compensation or citations for their part in these war efforts, it was considered part of their marriage, but at least they got to stay stateside when the men where deployed to India for the CBI campaign. I think the burdens of family deployments today would make my mother and the other women laugh over a cocktail by the pool. Of course it’s difficult but in comparison?"
2020-08-20 16:54,"Three weeks after i was married I deployed for a one-year remote tour to S. Korea. I didn't have to wait. There were numerous other times I was gone for two-four weeks.

2020-08-20 16:57,"First, thank you for your service. Military spouse is still the hardest job in the armed services.

I served as a Navy pilot and spent my share of time out at sea--I was part of the 1986 Libya Expedition on the USS Enterprise. It was a sacrifice but rewarding. My son is now a Navy officer serving in nuclear power on the John Stennis.

During the Cold War, with tensions with the Soviet Union and Iran, there were reasons for our deployments. However, in this time of relative peace and enormous military budgets, I keep hearing about Reservists being called up and incredibly long deployments.

This is a sign of how the war hawks care nothing about the military. They use it as a status symbol and deploy it foolishly to occupy far away countries for now purpose. I think the military budget needs to be cut. I also think that all those serving, especially the enlisted, should be given 10T raises. We could accomplish this, and more, by treating the military with the restraint and good judgment it deserves."

2020-08-20 15:38,"You've gotta be joking me dude. Anybody in the military who dodges or resents deployments is just there riding off the benefits and a nice paycheck. You've collected the benefits for 15 years so stop whining and accept that it's time to make a sacrifice - exactly what all soldier should expect and should be honored to do. As a veteran, and former combat medic my biggest regret is that I never got to deploy to a combat zone."
2020-08-20 16:26,You now know the plight of the Reservist.   I hope your wife still has her day job when she gets back.  A lot of us who deployed didn't.   But.  If she lives to the age of 60 you will enjoy a check and TRICARE for the rest of your lives.   There is no better healthcare than TRICARE and you can't buy it on the open market.  And one of your children can go to college on the GI bill for free.   All Americans should live in the socialism provided by the military.

No member of the Donald John Trump, Sr. family has ever been bravely honorable and patriotic enough to ever wear the military uniform of any American armed force.

Marriage and blood ties essentially always bring entire families into experiencing whatever one family members does.

My Black African American father and four Black African American uncles fought in Europe and the Pacific during World War II for a lynching separate and unequal terrorist Jim Crow America that treated Werner Von Braun and his fellow Nazi German war criminal engineers and rocket scientists as persons and Americans under the Constitution of our Republic.

Members of my family have fought in every war since the American Revolution. But neither their patriotism nor their education nor their commercial prowess nor family stability nor superb character ever made any of them or their heirs equal to the least white European American Judeo-Christian."

2020-08-20 15:52,You have kids AT camp?  I am speechless.
2020-08-20 15:09,"There was a word active duty Marines had years ago for a dependent spouse, CINCHOUSE."
2020-08-20 17:29,"This has been the norm for a very long time.  My Uncle graduated from Annapolis in 1923 and served as a sea going officer for a number of years.  He was then in the Naval Reserve for years. In 1940 he was called back to serve on the Battleship Arkansas until 1945.  He was at Argentia in Newfoundland in August 1941 with Roosevelt and Churchill on the British Battleship HMS Prince of Wales on which the Atlantic Charter was created.  He continued to serve on the “Arky” through the Battle of the Atlantic, the bombardment of Omaha Beach on D-Day, and the invasion of Southern France.  He was the Executive Officer of the ship and retired as a Rear Admiral.  He, and many others served continually in the War for almost five years."
2020-08-20 17:30,"As I've lived in Norfolk, Baltimore, and Annapolis, I've had many close friends in the military. I remember seeing a bumper sticker years ago in Norfolk: ""Navy Wife; the toughest job in the military"" And although my friends generally had relatively 'good' deployments, and they are all still alive and intact, the tolls those deployments took were evident. 

Your wife took two oaths, in essence; one as a physician, and another as a career military officer. Yes, her medical school may have been paid for by the military, but the amount of time you reference suggests that her debt for her medical education (seven years, I believe) was repaid a while back, and she has continued to serve as a matter of dedication and commitment. A tip of the hat to her from a fellow physician, and to all of you for the sacrifices your family has made and continue to make."
2020-08-20 17:34,"My father was a graduate of Annapolis 1945. I was my parents 3rd child. After we finally moved to San Diego in my sophomore year I moved a total of eleven times to nine different cities. As a computer scientist for the Navy during the 40s-60s he was constantly being sent back to school to keep up including to M.I.T. for doctorate. He was instrumental in the development of new technologies for the Navy to help keep us secure.

So, yeah, I think active service members are essential.

We should, however reduce our military budget, decrease spending on technology used for land wars and increase cyber spending. 

The Naval budget should be increased as they have been seriously cutting corners. The Navy should not have to and needs to stop expecting their service members to be responsible for many jobs and to be masters of none. That is the reason the Navy has had so many accidents lately and why few know how to correctly install fundamental items such as pump seals, even in carriers."
2020-08-20 17:36,"When my husband was on long deployments (before anything but occasional few minute telephone over static calls and snail mail, I found for our sanity a good deal was a monthly exchange of the kids with another deployed spouse. We all had a breather from each other and it was amazing how all the sunny personalities good mannerisms returned ""at the other house."""
2020-08-20 17:36,"I'm a military brat, so I understand how this works. Use Skype or something to stay together. Maybe the three of you can travel to where she is stationed for Christmas? Best wishes to all of you."
2020-08-20 17:37,"Serving in the military is a sacrifice any way you cut it.

I’m just so thankful that we had and have those that volunteered to serve and protect our constitution.

A far cry from the current occupant of the White House.

Thank your wife for her service, and thank you for supporting her during these stressful times."
2020-08-20 17:38,"I was a military spouse for 8 years. For me, I felt isolated from my extended family, yet very bonded to my husband and child as the three of us were experiencing the same reality. I think it is different for everyone who serves along side an active duty spouse. I was grateful we weren't apart for long periods of time, and honestly felt free when we got out. The military families are our original essential workers. My heart goes out to you and yours. It will be hard, but you will probably be stronger for it."
2020-08-20 17:41,How in the world you managed to spend 15 years in the military without a deployment is beyond me.  We are on year 24 and deployment 5 and that's nothing compared to some.  The last deployment was 13 months with no R&R because of Covid.  Enlisted personnel deploy even more. Be grateful for the free education and guaranteed income. I certainly am..
2020-08-20 17:44,"By any measure, Mr McCaulley, you, your wife and children have had an exceptional life in the military. Free medical school, deployments at all while on active duty, just 3 moves during all this time. I suppose your wife’s recall could be felt like a slap in the face. Any deployment is tough, but it’s relatively short and non-hazardous. And you have a superb community to help your family. By any measure, your family has indeed been amazingly lucky. But your luck didn’t run out with your wife’s deployment. The Navy just made her a simple request, one it is certainly entitled to. And indeed with a light deployment, your good fortune has actually continued. Given that shipboard Navy personnel during this pandemic have no idea when they’ll return to the US, your situation is really cause for immense relief. I truly appreciate the sacrifice and service of everyone in the military. God bless your wife for her service and to you for caring for your children while she’s gone."
2020-08-20 17:38,Thanks to your wife and you; take good care through these rough times brother.
2020-08-20 17:55,Thank god for my DD-214.
2020-08-20 17:57,"I'm glad your wife and you are willing to serve the nation in this capacity as paid volunteers. I realize that there are some people who are called up to dangerous assignments, but most of the call-ups are more like this one where she can serve without being shot at. It is nice that our country offers this deal to people and requires their employer to save their place while they are deployed, find someone else to fill in for their duties while they are gone (uncompensated), and also gives the volunteer person extra deployment points toward a generous retirement. It's really fantastic."
2020-08-20 17:58,"I appreciate a dependa bringing the ordeal of deployment on military families to a higher profile, yet I would ask him why he didn't take it to the next level. I pushed seven times during my service, the last three all more than a year. The lifestyle inherently comes with alienated children, ruptured friendships, and broken promises. 

If the author wishes to point out the hardships, then he should also be asking the public: is the mission worth it? What American interest is being served, and who profits from these ruptures? Combat and accident casualties are possible, lost time and damaged relationships are a certainty. 

It needs to be worth it, for what it costs both the servicemember, and the families."
2020-08-20 17:59,"As someone who has been a military spouse longer, has more children, has been through many combat deployments and unaccompanied overseas tours (including while pregnant and with newborn babies), and who moves every few years as so does not enjoy the stability that a one weekend a month reservist does in their daily life please let me say this:

You’ll be fine. Your kids will be fine. It’s not going to feel like a walk in the park but it’ll be ok. Make a daily video chat a routine thing. Avoid countdown calendars, they can create huge disappointments for kids who expect a parent to return that exact day only to have things be extended."
2020-08-20 17:54,"I’m sorry but “your luck” didn’t run out. There was literally zero chance as a medical officer in the reserves that your wife wouldn’t be mobilized at some point. 

It’s part and parcel of being a reservist. And yes compared to many people I knew who were mobilized to the far outposts of Afghanistan or Iraq, a clean mobilization is all things considered not that bad. 

Good luck to you and your family."
2020-08-20 17:51,"A fair wind and a following sea. and a safe return to you, Dr. McCaulley."
2020-08-20 17:39,"Military spouses ALSO serve, but we are not treated as if we do. 

Unlike this spouse's experience, my experience as a Navy spouse was the the military IN NO WAY ""takes care of its own."" ""If the Navy wanted you to have a wife, they would have issued one in your seabag,"" so goes the old saw.

In addition, the military burdens military divorcées even if they have ONE DAY LESS than 20 years overlap with an active duty career. Over 20 years, and your decades of selfless sacrifice earns you medical insurance for the rest of your life. ONE DAY LESS and you  get one year ""to arrange new coverage."" Even if you were married for 20+ years and have spend literally your whole adult life with military medical coverage... they throw you off. If you have less than 15 years overlap, you don't even get that year to arrange coverage, you get thrown off on your date of divorce. This was changed in the 80s as a ""cost cutting measure,"" borne completely on the backs of military spouses. 

For a divorcée in their late 40s or early 50s, the cost of medical insurance is no small thing. After my year of Tricare ends, it will cost me 20% of my gross monthly income to remain insured. For this, I sacrificed half my career for my whole earning life. When you are responsible for every possible real life situation and you move every couple years, it doesn't matter how good your education: no one will hire you. 

I would close with an acronym many spouses know well, but it's not printable in the NYT, -TN."
2020-08-20 18:03,"Your kids will cue off of you. If you show Sad, they'll stay Sad. But if you show Proud, they'll be Proud too. And if you show ""Life goes on, it's our job to keep making it until Mom comes back, we can do this"", they will too. Your youngest will adjust quickly. That's the way it was when my Dad deployed for 8 months at a time (on a ship, pre-Internet so all we got were occasional batches of mailed letters) and the way it's been for military families as long as there have been sailors and soldiers."
2020-08-20 18:05,"Some of the commenters above are harping on how grateful she should be for her benefits or for the fact this is her first deployment. While it is true that those in the reserves have an obligation to deploy when needed,
it is also true that deployment is a hardship for service member, spouse and family. As well, we should be pleased that those who have served may find themselves with excellent insurance coverage. Best wishes and thank you for the sacrifices both of you are making."
2020-08-20 18:06,"I greatly appreciate your wife's service and your family's support to enable it. However, how is this new or newsworthy? Is it because you are a male spouse writing about wondering how you and your children will cope in a single-parent household (however temporary)? Female spouses have been handling this situation since time immemorial."
2020-08-20 17:25,"I am tired of being asked to worship at the feet of the military.  We pay their salaries, we pay their healthcare, we pay their retirement, and we do it while being underpaid in jobs that do not provide healthcare or retirement or vacations. I am waiting for the day a military person thanks me for what I give to them. Not a single member of the military today has ever fought to preserve American freedom, just American oil and military weaponry corporations. The military and its budget is a millstone around the necks of the poor in the US, and maybe it is time people started viewing it as it actually is."
2020-08-20 18:07,"I’m glad that “god” is paying so much attention to the minutiae of your lives! Wish that he, she, or it would spend a little more time on things like a global pandemic, climate change, police brutality, and the devastating corruption going on in the White House."
2020-08-20 14:21,"I was astonished by the LUCK of this military family. Fifteen years in and seven on active duty... and this is their first “deployment?”
I’m an army veteran and wife of 26 years to an active duty soldier who deployed nine times and also served two solo overseas “hardship” tours of two years each. During our child’s upbringing he was never home for more than a year at a time. His deployments were often during uncertain times—right after a move to a new place, during major health crises or a death in the family. We can’t count the number of Christmases and birthdays he missed. In 2002 we started a second adoption so our daughter could have a sibling, but the Iraq war and my husband’s subsequent, almost perpetual absences ended our chances to complete our family. 
Yet we love what we do! We never, ever thought “why us?”  Why NOT us? We signed up for this.
 We’re happy to do our part because we know we’re contributing to a cause far bigger than ourselves. And many horribly disfigured and disabled combat-injured friends of ours say the exact same thing. 
Professor McCaulley, please count your blessings because your luck has NOT run out."
2020-08-20 18:14,"This is what patriotism is all about. I've often thought it should be mandatory for anyone running for Congress to have, at a minimum, served in the military/National Guard reserves. For the enlisted ranks, I believe that's only 6 months of active-duty training, followed by 5.5 years of 2 weeks in the summer and 1 weekend per month. Best thing about it?...you meet Americans from all walks of life (well...not the 1%...who like the Trumps, never serve. ) Yes, there's a chance of being called-up, but in most cases that's very short term for helping with natural disasters, etc. Better yet...join the regular military and serve one full term of active duty, whether the enlisted or officer ranks. And...how about the idea of...no service in the well-regulated militia also known as the the U.S. military, not even the reserves/Guard?... then no ownership of an assault weapon."
2020-08-20 18:26,"Thank you, and thanks to your wife, for your service."
2020-08-20 18:20,"I have no sympathy at all. This is all about money. His wife joined the Navy to get free medical school. When she could of gotten out she went to the reserves because of the great money and pension. Now she got called up, so what."
2020-08-20 18:18,"“But the military is another part of our society that cannot be shut down because of a virus.” 

Yes, the military can be shut down, and should be. We use them to get involved in optional conflicts thousands of miles from home. Both of our stupid wars are winding down. The military has nothing really defensive to do. Fight terrorism? The attack on The World Trade Center showed how useless a huge traditional military structure is against individual evil people. No other country keeps such big fleets of aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines and atomic bombs. We have 1000 amphibious assault vehicles (Wikipedia) in case D-day happens again. “We spend too much on the military”, as President Trump said one time only during his first campaign."
2020-08-20 18:47,"This touching piece reminded me of the Times documentary on Netflix, ""Father Soldier Son,"" - another look at life from the perspective of a military family. 

Both the piece and the film cry out for restoration of the draft so the consequences of military policy can be felt by most if not all American families. At least those without bone spurs."
2020-08-20 18:47,"I applaud your family's service. My father was 29 years old, married with 3 very young kids when he was drafted in 1943. He served as a battlefield medic in Patton's 3rd Army in Europe through V-E day and beyond. I shudder to think of the sacrifices he and my mother made to serve and endure those days."
2020-08-20 18:52,"A wonderfully important last line: ""My wife isn't the one only one who serves. We all do."" And a good reminder to us all that we never know what a family is going through or the sacrifices they are making -- and this includes both military AND non-military families. Always, being there for your community in ways small and big can make a difference.

The one thing that seemed passed over in this article is -- where did this author find an overnight summer camp that was open and safe for his children? I must admit, that comment somewhat stopped me in my tracks without any context to it in the age of COVID."
2020-08-20 19:01,"Disclosure:  Navy veteran here.

It is said that the hardest job in the US Navy is Navy Spouse.  There is a great deal of truth in this.  She needs your support in order to be able to properly do her job.

She married you because she loves you.  You married her because you love her.  Remember that and stand firm during the stress of her deployment.

And good luck to the both of you."

2020-08-20 19:21,"As a retired Air Force officer with a combat tour and other overseas assignments all i can say is, it comes with job. You are in service and that service is to the country. I loved  and still love my time in service. I was honored to be able to serve with the men and women I served with. And yes, I would do it again."
2020-08-20 18:51,How messed up is it that one of the only ways people can afford higher education is to sign up to potentially have to kill/get killed in the first place?
2020-08-20 17:33,"For everyone looking at this and telling the author to stop whining, maybe you should read it again!

I've spent my entire adult life in and around the military - guard/reserves, active duty, active duty spouse, and retiree spouse - he isn't saying anything any other military spouse hasn't thought. He's right, he and his wife got lucky when she was on active duty. Some would consider me lucky because my spouse never deployed to a combat zone, but that doesn't mean he came home every night for dinner. There months long deployments to Rwanda shortly after the genocide, month long TDY's, FTXs, and selection and qualification courses for some of his positions that left me at home - one time with a five week old baby and 17 mth old. It sucked, there is no other word to describe it. Yes, I was lucky, my husband didn't go to Iraq or Afghanistan. In a way, it might have been easier for our kids if he had instead of the constant TDY schedule that consumed him for the last six years he served. The kids would just get adjusted to him being gone and he'd get home. They'd get adjusted to that and he'd leave again. 

Military spouse is truly the hardest job in the military."
2020-08-20 19:29,"Don't you like how Trump treats the military?  If we got covid under control, she would not have to deploy."
2020-08-20 19:38,"One of the (many) regrettable patterns in online comments involves commenters who love to come on braying proudly and loudly about how they ""don't have any sympathy"" for whatever the situation described is. 

This is really a narrow and nasty position to take. What's it for? Does this announcement make the unsympathetic feel good about themselves? Are they proud of ""reserving"" their sympathy for people they believe to ""deserve"" it more? Is sympathy a finite resource?"
2020-08-20 19:39,"Reflecting on the economic and human high cost of Covid-19 to our nation, the moral and emotional burden of the current administration and the unnecessary violence use against the American people by the federal government forgive me if I find it really hard to empathize with you. Your kids were in a camp in the middle of a pandemic, your family was fully and is fully employed, you harvest the benefits of being married 15 yrs to the military and when duty calls for the first time in 15 yrs in the middle of one of the most difficult times in our national history your commentary comes across petty, selfish and insensitive to all those who lives have been already been lost fighting the pandemic."
2020-08-20 19:44,"My brother & his wife were both Army ophthalmologists; 30+ years active duty, each. They would see & treat more eye trauma cases in a year, and write journal articles, than their ""civilian"" counterparts would see in a lifetime of practice. There are a lot of jokes about ""military  medicine"" or ""military (anything)."" But they are on the cutting edge of a lot of medicine: eyes, PTSD, brain trauma, limbs & prosthetics. Yes, deployments are difficult for everyone in the family. And yes, that's what our military does - deploy. I have no doubt she is a wonderful doc, but I'm telling you now, she will return a better doctor. And thank her & your family."

2020-08-20 19:48,"I remember when Jim Baker and the Iraqi stooge Aziz came out of failed negotiations.
I’d been rock climbing outside of El Paso.  Three years earlier, I had no been a civilian, but a new Army recruit, doing my basic training at Fort Bliss.
That day, when the first part of Desert Storm began, I had been out of the Army for my first semester at college.
Winter break, I went rock climbing with some friends. There is video somewhere, of my face when I watched the news. I knew my time as a civilian was over.
It was fun, while it lasted.  
Next thing I knew, I had a telegram telling me to report back to active duty.
I got my haircut.
A girlfriend offered to fly me to New Zealand.  
I declined. I was a medic.
I went.
My friends had not been discharged. They were already off to Saudi Arabia.
I had a duty. I swore an oath.
Even if I had a heinous case of bone spurs, I would have gone.
And I did.  I dropped out of college and served again, recalled through the Inactive Ready Reserve.
I gave my country my word.
I’m still keeping it, decades after my second honorable discharge.

2020-08-20 19:52,"Yes, even the non military spouse serves.  The one thing that the military does have that most civilians don't is a support system for the spouses during a crisis like this.  The restrictions of this epidemic have forced us to behave as strangers to each other and that's sad.  

Good luck to you, your wife, and your children."
2020-08-20 20:00,"I thank your wife and you with your kids. Deployments were hard, on submarines there was no communications for months at a time. I respect my Navy Drs and and actually go to one that saw me when I was in the military. 

One thing that many don’t know are how many of the  trauma doctors and others got their training in the field. Literally trial by fire. May you Be blessed and stay healthy."

He tells me when he's about to do something dangerous and calls me as soon as he can afterward. None of it is easy, and as the author said, the whole family serves.
However, never did we ask ""why us?"" when he chose to enlist. The question to ask is ""Why not us?""

2020-08-20 20:24,"Deployments are change.  Change is hard, no matter how many years in the service.  You will figure it out just like every other military family does.

I loved serving - I stayed in 30 years.  I never got tired of soldiers, or the mission.  I did get tired of some things though.

I got tired of the military community feeling as if we had a monopoly on service or sacrifice.  We don’t.  Dedication, courage, and service to the nation doesn’t need a uniform.

I got tired of the “no one has deployed as much as me or my soldier” response to people talking about a first deployment.  It’s always the same boring pattern: 1) list multiple deployments going as far back as Gettysburg 2) state that no one has Ever had it as hard 3) say they love this life no matter what 4) tell the new guy he’s a punk and should feel lucky to serve.  Everyone has a first deployment, so why not use your experience to be supportive?  Sure, you should be proud of doing your duty. Quit wearing it like a crown of thorns.

I also got tired of people ranking the value of one’s service by the number of deployments.  Serving honorably is the only true measure.  All volunteered, all raised their right hand and took the same oath.

So let Esau write his article, and let his Sailor do her duty without having to listen to posturing and preening from the gallery.  Be supportive, and maybe the Mcaulley family will be able to pass their newfound experience wisdom on to another family later on.
It’s the Military Way."

I am pleased to see this article from the viewpoint of a male spouse left behind.  In today's world most of us do not know someone who is currently serving in the military - either active duty or reserve.  They continue to answer the call to serve in whatever way they are asked and 2020 has put unique demands on all our forces.  At 76 I realize my Mom was a saint and her service was as significant as my Dad's - she just didn't get any medals to pin on.

You share the dilemmas of “single” parents everywhere now, the juggle of daily life without the ready support of your parenting partner. In addition you have the unknowns of military deployment. Thankfully as you say she has a good deployment, and not in a combat position. So many others - moms and dads alike - have the added burden of a loved one being placed in direct harm’s way.

Let’s now extrapolate your situation to all families who are out there juggling careers, multiple children, home schooling, limited or no availability of affordable childcare. We have a huge issue in this country as expressed so eloquently by Elizabeth Warren at the DNC. Very few people have an “Aunt Bee” who can step up and help. Military families are at even greater deficit as there are times when they are out of country, or out of touch with even the closest available relative or support system. I applaud the efforts of Dr. Jill Biden when she was second lady. She understood the need for better support for our military families, and I only hope she has the opportunity as First Lady to continue and expand upon those programs, as well as programs for non-military families.

I made the same mistake for the HPSP medical school program, and regretted it every single day of active duty."
2020-08-20 22:47,"Twenty six yers, half of it my husband was deployed.  Some were planned, others were, ""You've got 12 hours before you're wheels up.""  From the time our daughter was six months old to four and a half, he rarely spent more than two or three months at home at a stretch.  Now, our oldest is stuck in Europe on an exercise that turned into a deployment.  They can't even get to main post for some Popeye's chicken.  In his post military career, my husband has been stuck in South America under closed air space keeping the office down there going.

We've missed holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, vacations, deaths, funerals, etc.

Your luck didn't run out.  Your wife's number came up."
2020-08-20 23:31,"Thank your wife for her service.
I was a Naval Officer years ago.  I enlisted in 69, went to OCS, and came home in 72.  Our deployments (we called them “cruises” then) were six months to the Med and nine months if it was to the Pacific.  It was hard but not unbearable. I admire today’s sailors who are , due to the downsizing of the Navy, doing much longer stints at sea."
2020-08-21 0:01,I have had the opportunity & privilege to  work with service members and their families over the past ten years spending a good bit of time at pre-deployment briefings & day one returns...no such thing as an easy deployment...an experience difficult for civilians fully understand...thank you and your spouse...
2020-08-20 21:49,What a lovely article.  Thank you.
2020-08-20 23:26,"It’s called “the service” for a reason.  That said it’s not now, nor has it ever been, only the service member in a family that serves."
2020-08-21 1:41,"The deaa was that medical school becomes a freebie, in return for which she has to provide medical services to the armed forces. In taking the offer, clearly considerations of inconvenience and familial disruptions would have been discussed and, ultimately rejected since the free education package was so tempting. She got a good deal; live with it."
2020-08-20 22:13,Hang in there and know that you have lots of moral support out here in the US.  Thanks for the service from all of you!
2020-08-20 21:05,"What we need is free medical education AND national healthcare with required service and rational salaries so people are attracted to medicine in order to help the sick, not  in order to get their shot at upper middle class incomes.

 I hope you and your family stay healthy and your kids, who never signed on for this, are OK, but joining the military with the hope of never being deployed is a ridiculous gamble and really reprehensible--the whole reason we have so many military employees is so there are always enough to deploy--your wife joined to avoid the mission of your employer while reaping financial gain."
2020-08-20 21:42,"Let's see...America pays for your wife's medical school, she spend a weekend a month training and two weeks a year on active duty for the term of the agreement for medical school. 
She gets residencies at various hospitals, some military,some civilian to continue her education.

When she  serves her contract,she is free to practice medicine.

Her situation is far different from some person who enlists, goes to basic and advanced training and then gets deployed for a year to Iraq or Afghanistan. 

At the height of Iraq and Afghanistan Army soldiers served 15 months with stop loss orders.

I think you have been very fortunate.

Vietnam Vet

The cost of four years of medical school at either Fort Sam Houston or Bethesda and residency was probably $300,000.  You are paid a salary.

And then you are deployed to care for injured and wounded American service memebers.

You may be deployed in natural disasters.

Buddy, you aren't serving and you are sacrificing little in return for what you have received."
2020-08-21 0:05,"it was not your luck that ran out.  if i understand this correctly your call up is a direct result of the covid19 pandemic.  as such it is the direct result of the incompetence and corruption of the commander in chief.  as a retired naval aviator it is utterly beyond my comprehension how anyone in the military past or present could vote for a commander in chief who is in fact a traitor to the United States, and who uses the military as canon fodder for his political benefit."
2020-08-21 0:13,Thank you for reminding us. And thank your wife too.
2020-08-21 0:18,She got through med school debt free; there is always a price to pay and I for one am proud of her good sense and sacrifice. You sound extremely level-headed and I believe your family will get through her deployment fine. She is fighting a war that is more important than Iraq or Afghanistan.
