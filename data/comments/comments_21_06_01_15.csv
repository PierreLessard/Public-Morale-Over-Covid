2021-06-15 10:33,"If asymptomatic patients experience long term health effects, the concern arises that patients who get covid-19 even after they've been vaccinated might be at risk for long term problems.

The number of people who get covid-19 after immunization is small, and it will get smaller as immunization of our population slows viral spread.  Moreover, vaccinated people who get covid-19 usually have mild disease or no acute symptoms.  But if mild disease can lead to long term problems in unvaccinated people, we need to know if vaccination protects against long term effects, which can be serious."
2021-06-15 10:35,Why exactly was there no control group of people who did not get covid in this study? Wouldn't that be easy to do if they already had access to insurance records? Why would any good scientific study opt to not have a control group when one could easily have been added? Seems suspicious to me as a scientist.
2021-06-15 10:37,"""Post-Covid health problems were common even among people who had not gotten sick from the virus at all, the study found.""

Perhaps the medical issues aren't being caused the virus itself, but rather by the societal response which has affected every aspect of our lives for the worse."
2021-06-15 10:48,"Just one more reason not to resume a so called normal lifestyle, not yet. Just learn about the ACE2 receptor, it’s function and the damage that this virus causes. It is metabolic, that’s why the obese were hit so hard. I won’t get on a plane or any other incubator of disease until cases are extremely rare."
2021-06-15 10:57,"The absence of a control group is a major limitation.  How many people complain of nerve or muscle pain, fatigue or memory loss everyday, pre-Covid, in my clinic? The majority."
2021-06-15 10:58,If there’s no mechanistic explanation for how all these symptoms are caused by mild COVID infections then linking all theses conditions to COVID totally unfounded. If random viral infections can have all these long-term effects how do we know these symptoms aren’t caused by some other asymptomatic viral infection?
2021-06-15 11:00,The lack of control group in this study is a weak link and makes the results borderline suspect.  Seems more like pro vaccination psy-ops.  And that’s coming from someone who opted for the vaccine.
2021-06-15 11:05,"Am I wrong, or do older Americans have a 3% increase per year of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and aches and pains, even without Covid? This phenomenon is troubling as it relates to young people, but the numbers in the article seem skewed."
2021-06-15 11:05,"This is the reason I got the vaccine. Death is easy. I know so many ""COVID-19 is like the flu"" people, who got it and are still suffering. 

How can you have a moderate case three months ago and still are only at 50 percent baseline? That's frightening."
2021-06-15 11:05,Yet more compelling evidence that everyone needs to get vaccinated. Not that more is actually needed.
2021-06-15 11:07,"Correlation is not causation. But I think I am always going to wonder — and am never going to know — if my 77-year-old mother’s asymptomatic Covid in early November had anything to do with her utterly shocking massive brain hemorrhage in early March of this year. She was previously fit, healthy, and active, with no history of high blood pressure, and yet that is the only explanation her puzzled doctors have been able to come up with. Every time I mention her (truly asymptomatic) Covid, I am dismissed—but I do wonder if she is yet another casualty of the virus or if it’s just a coincidence. My mother never sought care after her quarantine ended, because she felt just fine; then her stroke happened right before she would have seen her doctor for her annual. If we had known that newly high blood pressure can be an effect of asymptomatic Covid, perhaps she would have gone to see her doctor earlier, or else her doctor would have urged her to come in to be evaluated. That kind of second-guessing is too painful for me to continue, but I offer this for anyone else whose senior parent(s) had a case of the virus: have them get a routine checkup without delay, just in case."
2021-06-15 11:09,"I wish someone would investigate whether these people with long-term health problems are suffering from an under diagnosed autoimmune illness called mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). A chronic illness that can be set off by infections and viruses such as COVID-19.
It’s an underreported illness that affects multiple systems in the body. Many of us are￼ suffering from this, and histamine intolerance, a related multi-system illness, but can’t be diagnosed because it’s under the￼ radar of many mainstream doctors. There are few tests for it, and it’s often only identified by taking a careful patient history. Indeed, relies on patient self-reporting."
2021-06-15 11:11,"I appreciate this article. My wife’s (40 years old, vigorously exercises) cholesterol which was previously absolutely normal, has spiked after suffering from the virus. I’m anxious to read further about the link between cholesterol and long-haul survivors of Coronavirus."
2021-06-15 11:13,Were these symptoms also experienced by people who survived the 1918 pandemic?
2021-06-15 11:13,"“Their most common new health problems were pain, including in nerves and muscles; breathing difficulties; high cholesterol; malaise and fatigue; and high blood pressure. Other issues included intestinal symptoms; migraines; skin problems; heart abnormalities; sleep disorders; and mental health conditions like anxiety and depression.”

These are also symptoms of living with Stanley Kowalski as President."
2021-06-15 11:15,"Two days after my quarantine for testing positive for Covid I had a retina occlusion in my right eye -total, a blue/gray shade over the eye.  It cleared up day by day and I wasn’t alarmed - but of course should have been - that’s an emergency for anyone reading.  Long story short, the eye cleared up 85% in a week before an eye doctor rushed me to the ER.  4 months later my eye is now starting to slowly improve -per recent photos of internal eye via eye retina specialist.    I did have Covid and I had a heart echo and other tests to see if this was of a different cause.  No physical originators.  It’s post Covid and the retina specialist said initially ‘this is a compelling case for post-Covid.’  Now the ‘sure’ prognosis for recoveryis unsure since the cause is new.  It’s a blood clot in my eye artery."
2021-06-15 11:15,"Let’s hope that astute infectious disease and neurology physicians will begin real interrogations of the symptoms with lumbar punctures for neurotransmitters and aberrant proteins in those with brain fog and autonomic symptoms, nasal biopsies to examine nerve endings in those who cannot smell, cardiopulmonary assessments including biopsies in those with shortness of breath. There is a tremendous amount we can learn from COVID because of the high numbers of individuals about long-term sequelae from viral infections. NIH, we could gain tremendous insight into how viruses trigger lasting autoimmune and inflammatory processes through key diagnostics in these patients and unaffected family members."
2021-06-15 10:27,They didn’t compare these patients to a control group?
2021-06-15 10:53,This study is pretty meaningless without a control group. An increase of high cholesterol and blood pressure in people in their 40s and 50s??---umm....that is who is first diagnosed with high blood pressure. They have little idea is that rates are higher in post COVOD folks without a control. You should have highlighted this limitation with more care especially if you are writing fora general audience.
2021-06-15 10:50,"It boggles the mind how many people are unwilling to get the vaccine. Someone said to me she wasn't getting the vaccine because she had COVID last year and her body fought it off fine. (She’s in her young 20s.) She didn’t seem to care that if she caught it again, she would be contagious and perhaps give it to someone who might die from it. She didn’t seem to think that having COVID would be worse from being protected from it by a vaccine. 

Too many people think the vaccine, which is meant to protect you from this virus that has killed millions in the last year, is scarier than the virus itself. Hopefully studies like these will show them how ridiculous that idea is."
2021-06-15 11:13,"I am doubling up on Boxengo's comment. 

Where is the control group? Where is the comparison of the incidence of these same symptoms prior to Covid.  

This may be very significant data. Or it may be irresponsible data collection and reporting."
2021-06-15 11:20,"A lot of people delayed seeking medical care during the pandemic to avoid hospitals and doctors’ offices. It could be that after people got COVID, they were no longer worried about infection, so they went to see their doctors and were then diagnosed.

Also, what percentage of the non-infected population sought care during the same time period? We don’t have anything to compare this to."
2021-06-15 11:20,This is an important story. But the study’s limitations should be made clear much earlier. Leaving out those insured through Medicaid and traditional Medicare misses a very large population.
2021-06-15 11:24,"It would be interesting to know if vaccinated people with ""breakthrough"" asymptomatic, mild, or moderate covid infections also develop these new conditions or if the vaccine protects them from ""long covid"".  Unfortunately, the CDC has stopped tracking all but serious breakthrough cases that lead to hospitalization or death.  Shouldn't the CDC want to know this?"
2021-06-15 11:28,"This quote ""Another limitation of the study is that it did not compare people who had Covid-19 with those who did not, making it unclear if rates of post-Covid symptoms were higher than in a more general population"" basically undermines the entire study."
2021-06-15 11:30,The lack of a Control group makes this study very irrelevant. I have never heard of a scientific study without a control group.
2021-06-15 11:31,"The hidden consequence of COVID 19 is extremely disturbing and anti-vaccination individuals need to take notice. This microbe is unpredictable and insidious.  I hope everyone get the shot and awakens to the perils of all types of infectious diseases.  Already, untimely morbidity and mortality of infectious disease leads all other causes of death and global efforts are inadequate regarding pathogenic microbes."
2021-06-15 11:32,"The most revealing part of this ""study"" that it analyzed not the actual medical data, but insurance claims. The conclusions are foregone and redundant to many other studies, involving actual medical histories, but the circumstance sheds light on the fragmented and chaotic healthcare ""system"" in US. The reason Pfizer sought health outcomes feedback on its vaccine administration from Israel, and not US is that Israel by and large has an integrated healthcare system that collects highly detailed and well regulated medical info. US doesn't have a healthcare system, instead we have a loose assortment of healthcare providers - mostly sellers, where medical help is dispensed not according to health needs but ability to pay. The most integrated health information space in our case are indeed the few major health insurance purveyors who collate the claims. Naturally outside accounting insurance claims represent what's called bad and noisy data: not only these claims exclude under- and uninsured people, the data-rich medical info collected by medical professionals is therein degraded into medical coding categories by personnel with no medical training. Instead of analysing blood test results, say, for high cholesterol, the study looks at the billing for the same..."
2021-06-15 11:35,"“People with long Covid need multidisciplinary care,” said Dr. Al-Aly, “and our health systems should adapt to this reality and develop capacity to deal with these patients.” All patients need this. Lyme disease, also an epidemic, has long highlighted the need for a multidisciplinary approach to medical care. Our healthcare system has been fragmented for a long time because we undervalue the primary care practitioners in our society as compared to the specialists."
2021-06-15 11:36,Then there are those of us coping with post Covid issues who do not have health care and therefore are not included in this study. And I’ll bet there are millions of us.
2021-06-15 11:37,"Correlation is not causation. Or maybe people are more conscious of their health or are being followed more closely by their physicians due to having covid and minor symptoms for which they wouldn’t normally have sought medical attention are being investigated and attributed to covid. Or maybe things with other causes are being attributed to covid due to time of onset. My husband did not have covid (tested weekly for much of the pandemic so we’re sure). He also started having smelling distortions during the pandemic. Because he was able to be adamant that he did not have covid at any point, his doctors explored other causes and it was most likely caused by damage during sinus surgery."
2021-06-15 11:38,"this article only shows more study needs to be done. Don't forget we are coming out of a very stressful year of Covid. People were isolated from each other. They gained weight, lost loved ones, worried every day, lost their jobs or worried about them, lost their homes too. People changed their lives, figuring out or trying to figure out how to survive differently. Places of employment changed, retail business changed. One would expect all sorts of symptoms to come out. 
I don't know how it can be known that those who are experiencing these symptoms are actually post-asymptomatic covid if they did not even know they were asymptomatic.
We need a universal health care system, one that would be better informed centrally about such long term issues."
2021-06-15 11:38,"Many of the reported conditions mimic those of fibromyalgia.  Brain fog, pain, fatigue are common problems for this syndrome.  A blood test for the Epstein-Barre marker confirm that."
2021-06-15 11:46,"I think a lot of this has to do with the stress of the days of covid. My doctors thought I had a very mild case of covid early but I couldn’t tested. I had no antibodies so it seems unlikely  that I did not have it. I’ve had severe weakness that lasted for weeks  I’ve been through a battery of tests, including MRIs but nothing. 

I now believe that it was anxiety and related issues have increased beyond measure since the beginning of the lockdown. Panic attacks create extreme weakness in my body that seem to take days to recovery from."
2021-06-15 11:47,"Infection is associated with the onset of certain autoimmune conditions, acting like a trigger. It will be interesting to see if Covid acts like that or something else is happening. In the meantime, I hope we can get everyone to take it seriously (unlikely, I know). And I hope we support people dealing with these outcomes at work, school and in medical care."
2021-06-15 11:54,"Association does not prove causality.  
During the pandemic we heard a lot about the importance of controlled studies, even though they delayed vaccine deployment by half a year, costing many lives.
This is de facto an uncontrolled study.  The appropriate control would be to lock up the planet for a year in a parallel universe and see how sick people become.
In this universe, appropriate control groups do not exist.  Simply using uninfected controls is not valid, since it is already established that many people delayed medical care, even for emergencies, because of the virus.  By contrast, there would be a follow up bias towards those who were infected."
2021-06-15 11:57,"There is an opportunity to place those that choose not to be vaccinated for non-health issues to be in a separate insurance pool.  Reprice the risk and cost for health, life and other insurance for employers."
2021-06-15 11:57,Doesn't the fact that the study didn't compare people who had Covid-19 with those who did not invalidate the results? Wouldn't you have to subtract the percentage of people without Covid who presented with new diagnoses during that period from those who had Covid to get a picture of the effect of the disease?
2021-06-15 12:01,"This study is so helpful, even without a control group, etc. I had covid 19 in April last year. While I haven’t been exactly struggling since then, I haven’t been thriving either. Having an explanation for some of what I’ve gone through this past year is soothing. It’s also a rallying cry to take better care of myself."
2021-06-15 12:02,"There should be or perhaps there are ongoing studies dealing with physical problems associated with after effects of the vaccinations.  I, personally, developed intensely painful sciatica within a month of receiving the Medina vaccine.  I had very severe symptoms after both doses of the vaccine.  I am still suffering with the sciatica 3 months  after the onset of the condition and now have to use a walker to get around.  Although I did have sciatica once before, it responded within a short time to the anti inflammatory medicine.  This time I had a course of the drugs 3 times with very little relief.  I continue to suffer with pain, which is a result of inflammation of the nerves in the spine and worry that the condition has now become chronic.  I do hope studies are being done tracking the possible after effects of the vaccines.  I am still happy that I received the vaccine even if it may have caused my present physical problem. At least the sciatica is not life threatening as the Covid 19 is."
2021-06-15 12:06,"For residents of senior living facilities,  more emphasis is needed on after effects.   They were targeted by  no restrictions on workers, either deliberate or unknowing.  For those patients who deliberately chose bad choices, such as no maskers,  I have no pity and expect them to pay the full cost of care needed.   Too many Americans are draining the tax dollars by making bad health choices.   Everyone should pay according to health vs bad health choices."
2021-06-15 12:08,"As to high blood pressure and cholesterol, it might just be that people had not those checked in a while and it was just a coincidence. Sometimes, people go years without knowing that they have either one or both."
2021-06-15 12:10,"Just to mention ""Many studies of long-haul COVID have been relatively small. The study thought to be the largest to date, which made use of US Department of Veterans Affairs national healthcare databases, involved 73,435 non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and 13,654 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, as well as approximately 5 million controls.""  

The VA electronic health records sytem is the finest tin the world.  It was almost completely the conceptualization of  product of GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES   including my wife. 

It is a priceless national resource and the gold standard for the world."
2021-06-15 12:12,What lifestyle changes were people making during this time?  We’re they eating better or worse?  We’re they exercising more or less?  How much did stress have an impact.  I think it’s important to separate the actual virus from the changes we made because of the virus.
2021-06-15 12:16,Recently I learned that a doctor friend acquired post-covid diabetes.
2021-06-15 12:17,"many of the comments seem to dismiss the conclusions of the study and, indeed, more research is warranted. however, as I had a silent heart attack and my thyroid was damaged by a viral infection a number of years ago, I don't think the conclusions are unreasonable."
2021-06-15 12:17,"This is not useful information without a comparison group. I would wager that the stress of living through this past year, even in people without COVID, likely increased all the issues reported as being higher in people who tested positive for COVID, but we cannot know this for certain without more data."
2021-06-15 12:26,"I’m glad that the article mentioned limitations of the study, unfortunately the key limitation was not mentioned until the end.  That is the fact there was no matched control group that did not have Covid. Without a comparison group the reality is that a study like this has zero validity to determine anything about so called “long Covid”.  Any person that has any type of illness and recovers is more likely to see a physician in the months after their recovery. 
This would not be unique to Covid. Do we then call that “long pneumonia”, or “long Shingles”, etc.?  I am a GI doc in practice for 34 years, many patients who have acute gastroenteritis from food borne illness can have symptoms that last for several months after they have recovered. We don’t necessarily define this as a new illness. The other weakness is that the study was just based on insurance claims and not actual evaluation of the patients. This tells us nothing about long Covid. The patient may have been seen for back pain, a cold, etc, things that have absolutely nothing to do with their preceding Covid infection. Whether long Covid even exists is debated by many physicians. It requires actual Scientific study to determine whether it is a real entity or not.  This study does nothing to help with that, in my opinion. It is however going to result in millions of patients  going to their Doctor convinced that every minor symptom they have going forward is due to “long Covid”. That is highly unlikely."
2021-06-15 12:27,"A similar study needs to be done for post-vaccine health complications. I know of one woman who suffered a blood clot that nearly reached her heart two days after her vaccine- otherwise extremely healthy 65 yo woman with no history of heart or vascular issues. And, another young woman (28) whose eosinophil levels (a white blood cell) were discovered to be 3000  to 6000(normal is under 500) after she suffered from an outbreak of hives after being vaccinated. Considering how the immune systems went wild in COVID patients, attacking organs, causing death, a closer look at why these eosinophils are so high post vaccine is warranted. Granted, may be another cause, but again, an otherwise totally healthy young woman with a sudden health complication."
2021-06-15 12:30,"I was diagnosed with post-Covid reactive arthritis. The virus attacked my brachial plexus nerves in my chest which were damaged during a bypass surgery over a year ago. I have no sense of feeling in my hands most of the time. In addition, Covid reactivated an old vertebral injury, leaving me with excruciating leg pain. Long Covid is very real."
2021-06-15 12:30,"Reading the comments, it seems that no one wants to hear this disturbing new information that even a mild case can have long-term consequences. Everyone wants to get back to normal, but it's important to understand that the pandemic isn't really over."
2021-06-15 12:31,"This study tracks the Va study published in Nature 

Epidemiology is not done in a single study.  each study adds to the overall picture."
2021-06-15 12:32,"There are long covid studies have been done in a  controlled manner (though smaller, including one  by Al-Aly referenced in this article). So you have take it comprehensively: you look at the symptoms of long covid in the controlled studies and then you can use this as an engineering exercise: if most common side effect of ibuprofen is reported to be stomach aches (say) based on the RCT data, and you now have a new sample of ibuprofen people who  have the same side effect, you can draw some logical conclusions from there."
2021-06-15 12:36,"From the Nature Study Referenced in this study 


""Beyond the first 30 days of illness, individuals with COVID-19 had an increased risk of death (hazard ratio of 1.59 (1.46–1.73)). We also estimated the adjusted excess burden of death due to COVID-19 per 1,000 persons at 6 months on the basis of the difference between the estimated incidence rate in individuals with COVID-19 and all VHA users. The excess death was estimated at 8.39 (7.09–9.58) per 1,000 patients with COVID-19 at 6 months. Individuals with COVID-19 had a higher risk of requiring outpatient care (hazard ratio of 1.20 (1.19–1.21)), at an excess burden of 33.22 (30.89–35.58; all excess burdens are given per 1,000 patients with COVID-19 at 6 months) and at a greater frequency of 0.47 (0.44–0.49) additional encounters every 30 days (Extended Data Table 2b, c).""

This provides a usable control group for the larger study referenced here."
2021-06-15 12:45,"Historically, there were thousands of a disease ""Moebius Encephalitis"" in the time period 1920-1930. The sufferers would fall asleep while sitting and talking or eating. As far as I am aware, the Moebius Encephalitis sufferers all died. 

Some believe that this was a result of  the ""Spanish Flu"" epidemic of 1918. So such reports should not be a very big surprise. The question is how to treat these cases."
2021-06-15 12:46,"I wonder if some of this could be PTSD.

I have not had Covid, but I do have fibromyalgia, and I have a lot of these symptoms.  I also have C-PTSD, and one theory is that the fibromyalgia arose from that."
2021-06-15 12:46,"What about those of us who never had COVID, but now suffer anxiety and depression after being vaccinated?"
2021-06-15 12:48,"This study lost me at ""no control group"".   They could easily have looked at non-COVID in the same time period. 

I was already halfway out the door at ""not peer reviewed"" and on the porch when I saw it was claims data.

""Largest"" doesn't mean ""best at establishing a causal connection"", given the limitations

I'm not denying long COVID, I believe in it--just that this is not a great way to learn more about its impact and nature.  Too much noise."
2021-06-15 12:57,"You have to live it, to believe it. I had COVID in December, a mild case. I felt very fatigued and had a bit of a fever and a cough that lingered for a while, but none of it was life-threatening.
Now six months later I still can't smell a thing, which is getting to me. My sense of taste is only working to 50%, everything tastes familiar, but I can't really pinpoint it. 
I haven't felt well in six months. Something is off, but I can't say what. I wake up tired, my energy level is near zero. My joints and bones hurt. Not really sick, but not well either. I don't feel bad enough to see a doctor, neither would I know what exactly to ask for. 'Get me back to my old self?' Perhaps a tall order. 
The other day I could smell the popcorn my husband made, and I smiled. I could smell something for a little while. Maybe in a month or so my life will be back to normal. I sure hope so.
It scares me to see how little we know about this virus."
2021-06-15 12:59,"I’m not surprised at all. Those of us with POTS, MCAS and other potential post-viral/post-infectious syndromes have been screaming into a void for years."
2021-06-15 13:02,"As a nurse working in a COVID surge ICU in Boston last March we would see a lot of patients with “new” diabetes.  Many were somewhat overweight. Many were Latina since COVID raged through some of their communities.  At first we assumed they were either diabetic and did not know or pre-diabetic and the stress tipped them over. (A great example of how implicit bias hurts patients.  There were many assumptions about their access to care and their knowledge of diabetes.) When we caught our breath we went back and looked more closely at medical records. Many patients had no markers for diabetes, active or pre diabetic metabolic syndrome.  We slowly realized that the virus was causing new onset diabetes in some patients.  Just like we realized it was causing cardiovascular issues. There are many viruses that can have long term complications,  like PANDAS or Guillain-Barre.  Want to be terrified?  Look up SSPE and measles. COVID is a double whammy.  It seems particularly good at setting off these long term issues at a higher than usually rate and so many people got it in a relative short period of time.  I am very curious is the work that comes out of long term compilations from COVID changes the way we look at more common viruses.  Are there other things people routinely suffer from that are actually viral related?  We already know it happens, but we don’t take it into account often enough."
2021-06-15 13:04,"Correlation isn’t causation and antidote isn’t evidence, but it seems pretty obviously to me that my body hasn’t been quite right after I had COVID-19 in January. Like everyone, between the global pandemic, politics, and various personal things, 2020 was an unusually stressful year, but if I compare how my body felt in early January, with all that stress, to say early March, a little over a month after I had recovered, there is a marked difference. 

For me it’s been unusually bad skin issues (I’ve had eczema before, though not in several years). I know my non-seasonal allergies (and my seasonal allergies) have been worse too. As someone who has had some kind of allergies my whole life, it has felt like my body is extra inflamed and freaking out, like my immune system hasn’t relaxed fully. That could explain why there are a range of symptoms between different people.

I had heard that for some people getting the vaccine helped post-COVID symptoms, but I’ve been fully vaccinated for over a month with no noticeable change. I had the bad-flu level of COVID and reasonably strong reactions to both shots, for perspective. I don’t have insurance because I’m a consultant with NYC level rent and older millennial levels of student loan payments, so yeah, I’m not being included in this survey."
2021-06-15 13:05,"""Post-Covid health problems were common even among people who had not gotten sick from the virus at all, the study found.""

Correlation is not causation.

Sigh."
2021-06-15 13:07,"To me, this just points out the more reasons people should get vaccinated rather than taking their chances on acquiring the virus and dealing with illness and the after-effects.

Weighing the risks of either choice, I chose to get vaccinated."
2021-06-15 13:08,"My son and i had mild covid symptoms for 2 weeks in early Jan 2020 (prior to the ""official"" start of the pandemic).  Basically a dry hacking cough for two weeks. I didn't suspect i had it until after i started periodically calling my doctor in the following months with various, unknown to me at the time, long haul covid symptoms The oddest was low body temperature which my doctor just attributed to ""it's common in older people"".  Then I happened to read Dr. Fauci mention temperature dysregulation."
2021-06-15 13:09,My mother survived cancer but also had dementia and Alzheimer’s (82 yo). She contracted Covid in late November 2020 in the assisted living facility. She had mild symptoms but because of policy she was moved to a nursing facility where she “got better”. 6 weeks later she was rather abruptly unable to swallow. The nurse told us that they saw a lot of Covid patients suffer additional issues about 4-6 weeks after initially contracting Covid. She died 3 days later. The “doctor” who had never even seen my mother indicated a myocardial infarction as cause of death. She died of Covid. We have no idea how huge this issue is and don’t appear to be studying it well.
2021-06-15 13:11,"Long Covid seems plausible. The science suggests it's likely. People suffering from Long Covid deserve compassionate care and empathy, and we need to continue research. We also need to continue efforts to eradicate Covid both here at home and globally. It ain't over yet, folks. 

That said, from the earliest reports of Long Covid there's been little mention of the overlap of symptoms between Long Covid and Anxiety. Sure, anxiety wouldn't cause smell loss, but almost every other symptom could be explained by anxiety. Hypertension, nerve pain, insomnia, etc: all potential symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety has very real physical components that we rarely address, perhaps because we consider the mind to be separate from the body. It's time to change this. Presenting physical symptoms of anxiety is no less real and is not a lesser diagnosis than a diagnosis of anything else. Anxiety is not just ""in your head."" 

Covid is real and quite obviously causes physical symptoms, there's no Covid denial in this comment. But what is also true is that we politicized an invisible threat, which originated in an already shaky time in American history. Trump was/is a disrupter, to say the least, and there's no bias in that statement; Trump supporters know it's true, and perhaps that's part of the appeal. Humans don't handle uncertainty well, and our handling of Covid didn't make things any easier, so of course anxiety would run rampant during the pandemic, and we can't discount its physical effects."
2021-06-15 13:14,"Is it possible that SARS-Cov-2 isn't cleared entirely by the immune system, but instead goes into hiding somewhere in the body, like the chicken pox virus, which lingers in nerves and can cause shingles decades after the initial infection?"
2021-06-15 13:15,"This data confirms the importance of vaccination. Everybody should get vaccinated, no matter their age, in order to protect their own long-term health and the long-term health of those for whom vaccination is not possible or does not work. And public policy should mandate vaccination whenever possible."
2021-06-15 13:17,"I contacted Covid in March, 2020 and was sick with multiple symptoms for six months. Even today I am not 100%: still on an  inhaler, still taking meds and supplements. And I still have lingering neurological and breathing symptoms. 

I belong to Long Covid social media groups, and am so grateful for their information and support. A couple of weeks ago one of the long-suffering young members took her life. And more and more I am noticing hopeless posts and desperate threats. 

I fear another problem is coming with so many very sick people and a  situation without answers. More research needs to be done, as soon as possible."
2021-06-15 13:17,"I am not aware of actually having had Covid, had but since my second shot which kept me in bed very sick for a week, I have recurring lethargy and fatigue, muscle aches and joint pain.  I’ve walked 3 miles every day for years and some days now I can only go a block and have to come hone and lay down all day.  I always feel anxious and can’t watch a television show that lasts more than a half hour without a break.  I have some excellent books on my nightstand, Beloved, the Silent Patient, the Great Alone, the Invisible Life of Addie Larue…but I can’t focus for more than a few pages at a time.  I am depressed at all of this so my new normal is not to let it completely deplete me because I know I am not alone."
2021-06-15 13:18,"The conclusions drawn from this report shouldn't be used for anything other than evidence that an actual study is warranted.  Not a review of insurance records but an actual study with control groups and blinded analysis.  This is not to say I don't believe there are possible long term repercussions from Covid, just that this report doesn't prove anything.  It is not peer reviewed science - which was mentioned in the article.

Unfortunately the public is going to run with this and assume that every new medical condition they acquire is Covid related.  This will extend into special benefits being demanded, I'm sure.  It won't be long before ambulance chasing lawyers will start in with commercials asking ""Have you or a loved one suffered from Long Covid?"" They've pretty much run out of asbestos victims now.

My college profs drilled into our heads the following: ""Bad data is worse than no data at all"".  Don't read into this report more than what it has to offer."
2021-06-15 13:19,"It took 20 paragraphs for the story to mention that the study ""did not compare people who had Covid-19 with those who did not, making it unclear if rates of post-Covid symptoms were higher than in a more general population."" I honestly can't see anything newsworthy about this study at all!"
2021-06-15 13:21,"After working many years as a practitioner and then a physician administrator analyzing health insurance records, I can tell you that this is merely a notice of an interesting place to look with some real research tools.   Psychological and social variables have a huge impact on symptoms that people experience and for which they seek medical attention instead of sitting on.   Then there is the matter of what the doctor pays attention to finds worthy of mentioning in the record.  Then there is the structure of modern electronic records that shapes what gets recorded.   Then there is the doctor’s actual use of the record which results in records full of inaccurate data due  to cut and paste of normal exam and history findings or prior visits where they actually never looked or asked.  Then there is delayed entry at night or on the weekend when they barely remember the visit. 

Put all that together and you have a fountain of misinformation."
2021-06-15 13:23,"It amazes me is that so many people are afraid to get the vaccine because of uncertainty about the ""long term effects of the vaccine"" but are willing to gamble on the unknown, long term effects of a Covid infection. And this article shows there are plenty of reasons to be concerned about the long-term impacts of a Covid infection."
2021-06-15 13:29,"This is an observational study with no controls.  The symptoms reported are common, and individual symptoms had frequencies in the single digits.  Without even a basic control group, we don’t know if any of the reported symptoms are abnormally frequent in the population studied."
2021-06-15 11:32,"Lack of a control group makes the conclusions of this study somewhat spurious, high blood pressure and cholesterol? Could it be that those conditions are occurring because we were all stuck at home sitting on the sofa during lockdown? 
Better data is needed here folks (as well as better reporting NYT), but hey, if it scares the unvaccinated to go get a shot, have at it."
2021-06-15 12:58,It makes me angry to think that we can not end the pandemic in part because of the of the selfishness or ignorance of anti-vaxx people. Why do we have to tolerate it when the consequences are so profoundly damaging to all of us?
2021-06-15 11:57,"I have questions about differences between the population of people who have had COVID and those who have no had COVID. Surely those who got COVID also have characteristics  that  make them vulnerable to many other health conditions? They are older for sure. But we also know this impacted minorities and low income populations, as well as those living in cramped conditions or working low paying jobs. Those who are obese ... 
I also wonder about the link with low-education white male Republican men. Are there higher rates of various conditions and behaviors among that cohort?"
2021-06-15 12:47,How many people discontinued use of widely advertised drugs that warn of potential compromise of the immune system as serene music backed bubbly family scenes in ad after ad after ad where this leads off the list of possible side effects required to be listed ?
2021-06-15 12:43,"Now everyone is a Scientist? Couldn't be bothered to place a layer of cloth between your germs and my mouth, but you can howl about control groups and anecdotal evidence? Rich. Two people in my immediate family got Covid, a daughter and her boyfriend. Neither was vaccinated by choice, my daughter lost her sense of smell and taste. Her boyfriend was hospitalized for high blood pressure and a nasty fever. Now he is suffering with symptoms of ear ringing and brain fog. He ended up seeking emergency care for his post-Covid symptoms. His story is common, too common to be dismissed by anyone, especially a NYT commenter."
2021-06-15 12:39,This shows that the probability of contracting a health issue from the COVID-19 virus is substantially high the the likelihood of a health issue stemming from a vaccine.

I would bet big money on outbreaks in low vaccination rate regions of the country."
2021-06-15 13:40,"Given that many long haulers have had at least some improvement after vaccination, that should be the first recommendation if they haven't already been vaccinated.

As a retired physician, I keep coming back to a simple fact: we have never seen this virus before, we are still learning about it, we don't know the natural history of the complaints people have, we have no known cures for them, and we don't know if we ever will have them.  I was a neurologist and dealt with the ""no known cures and don't know if we ever will"" in my practice every day, and that was with conditions that had been known for decades.

Empathy and patience are needed, along a willingness to look at treatments both skeptically and at the same time with hope. This is a tall order."
2021-06-15 13:40,"Those symptoms are all consistent with lockdown syndrome: a year and a half of poor diet and exercise, and social isolation. If covid survivors start growing horns or something, let me know. Otherwise, I can say with confidence that I never got covid, but I developed all of those symptoms too. Hmmm ...."

2021-06-15 12:09,"Long-term post-COVID health issues are NOT restricted to people with severe illness who have been hospitalized.
Particularly concerning is the after-effect known as “long COVID”, which produces lingering effects similar to chronic-fatigue syndrome, including long-term debilitating neurological effects, even in young people whose initial COVID infection was relatively mild.

2021-06-15 13:44,"I had mild Covid, and there are too many people out there who are NOT vaccinated.  Maybe the vaccine will protect me from variants--it keeps mutating--but I'm not pushing my luck

The CDC and the Feds have been too erratic for me...I feel like we're all on our own."

2021-06-15 13:48,This is not science.  There are no controls for confounding variables at all.  There are so many more likely causes for these conditions other than COVID.  The NYC has a duty to retract this article I think.
2021-06-15 13:48,"Thank for this this article on CA's Open Back To ""Normal"" Day. I realized as a 70-somethng women with a set of underlying issues that I have been really jealous of those who can return to restaurants, in person religious services, ""meetings"" and street fairs with less of a chance of a ""mild case"" than I would have. However, this article helps me get over my jealousy and brings me back to earth with my knowledge from too many I've seen on Zooms with ""mild cases""--a woman who felt exhausted loading a dishwasher, a rabbi with months of brain fog and fatigue, a teacher who said her food still tasted like burned popcorn four months later.                                                                                               And for the ""long haulers,"" disabled and losing valuables in their lives beyond anything we can know. I just can hope no health care provider dismisses any--especially women, older men and people of Color--as malingering or neurotic just because they are too prideful to get knowledge from others as to how to help them I also hope Congress expands Social Security Disability benefits to help them survive financially."
2021-06-15 13:50,"I contracted Covid-19 in March 2020, and know of its after effects.
I live with them on a daily basis.
Still, I'm thankful to still be alive after spending two months in the hospital, and then one month in rehab learning how to walk again. It wasn't easy.
And to this day I must contend with short-term memory loss, near constant fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle aches and a lingering cough. 
I also ended up on Dialysis because my kidneys gave out. 
But at least my hair has grown back after coming out in clumps.
Oddly enough I never lost my sense of taste or smell, but had no appetite and lost over 35 pounds.
Given my experience with Covid-19, it's hard to fathom why anyone would hesitate being vaccinated -- it's certainly much better than the alternative.  
However I remain ever-thankful for all the medical staff and frontline workers who guided us through the first and darkest days of this pandemic, while fearing ( and rightfully so) that it's not all over yet.
In any case, not for those of us who have survived it."
2021-06-15 13:53,"Another example of why I refuse to let my guard down with this virus.  There’s so much we don’t know about the long-term effects of it.

If you read anything about the 1918 flu epidemic, you’ll learn that there were instances of people who reported that they never felt quite as well again as they did before their illness.  So, what’s happening isn’t new."
2021-06-15 13:53,"“Another limitation of the study is that it did not compare people who had Covid-19 with those who did”

I’m not a medical researcher but this seems a pretty substantial weakness of the study. Frankly, seem to me there is nothing whatsoever to ascribe these medical conditions definitively to Covid without a comparison of people who did not get Covid."
2021-06-15 13:54,"People, look up the term ""observational study."" Observational studies are an important part of the research toolkit and shouldn't be dismissed out of hand as in many of the comments herein. It's not always practical for a variety of reasons for there to be a control group in medical observations.  It doesn't automatically invalidate the results, it just limits their reliability.  One benefit is that studies such as this provide fertile ground for further research and can be used as a basis for a controlled experiment with a smaller group."
2021-06-15 13:58,"I have always been concerned about whether asymptomatic or mild infection can cause long-term symptoms in vaccinated people. I got the J&J vaccine and it's only 60% effective against the new Delta variant whose prevalence is growing in the US. It's obvious that unless the virus is well managed globally, which is unlikely, new variants will surface and raise the risk of infection. I find it very difficult to empathize with those who don't want the vaccine—there seems to be to be no understanding about how unvaccinated people help the virus to proliferate."
2021-06-15 14:02,"Many comments about the lack of a control group.

But without frequent, repeated testing for Covid infection (every month?, every week?), how do you determine if any individual has had Covid and been asymptomatic, or has never had Covid?  Has it been established how long a detectable level of antibodies persists after a Covid infection?

The question is, does an individual belong in the study group, or the control group?"
2021-06-15 14:03,"It is difficult to consider this a scientifically valid study despite the amount of data.  It was not a random sample.  There was no control group.  The amount of data means that the certain assumptions, which are clearly invalid, will be met.  As was mentioned in the article, excluding people on public health insurance has definitely skewed the data.  No doubt certain ethnic groups are not well represented.  From what has been reported it is difficult to know if any group was well represented.
     With a large pool of data 2.4% is barely reaching significance.  With no control group it is impossible to say that it is significant.  Could the reports of increased blood pressure and cholesterol have something to do with age?
Without a control group it is difficult to accept any of the data as significant.

This study is so scientifically flawed it is remarkable to see it as a headline."
2021-06-15 14:07,"""... patients and doctors can know to consider the possibility that some health issues may actually be aftereffects of the coronavirus.""

So, I guess that COVID could, at some point in the future, be considered a pre-existing condition.

We can only hope the Republicans remain an unorganized mess that is too concerned with overthrowing the government and re-installing trump so they'll keep their hands off of health insurance. If they ever get their act together, they'll reinstate pre-existing conditions as grounds to deny coverage."
2021-06-15 14:08,"Imagine everyday waking in pain, unable to think clearly as if you were always hungover, unable to play sports as  you did just yesterday. I have struggled with many of the symptoms listed here for over a year. They started a month after having a cold in early March 2020. There is no way for me to know if the conditions are related to a CoVid infection but they are real and persistent.  If CoVid really does have a connection to long term damage we must treat it seriously. If nothing else let us double down on getting everyone in the world vaccinated so we can stop the mutation process before a variant takes us back to full lock down again."
2021-06-15 14:08,"Had my 2nd Moderna vaccine March 11th. All was fine initially, but here I am 3 months later with a constant muscle cramp in my left calf, radiating up into my hip. At night my left calf feels as though the circulation is being cut off and can be extremely painful. Saw my PCP last Thursday and had a doppler study done to check for a possible DVT, results were negative. Is this possibly a reaction to my vaccination after 2 months of nothing?🤔"
2021-06-15 14:15,"It is curious that so many anti-vaxxers are saying that every health problem people have after getting the vaccine is caused by the vaccine, yet here is an article saying every health problem after surviving Covid is due to Covid. Either correlation is causation, or it isn't."

2021-06-15 14:19,"Sixty-six years old.  Not on any medicines.

I think I had Covid twice. Couldn't breathe well.  Serious fatigue. Body aches.

Didn't get tested.  Got the two Moderna shots in March and April.  

Now my blood pressure is up.

So is my cholesterol.

Article didn't mention it, but my eyes are now failing rapidly.  Astigmatism.  Glaucoma. Cataracts.

On the plus side, my pre-Covid health regimen continues.

Plant-based diet.  Qigong and yoga exercises.

Overall I don't feel bad.

But mowing the lawn now slams me for the day.

I'm seriously considering a bucket list."

We're experiencing a lull right now, but I expect it's like being in the eye of a hurricane."

They are several hundred percent more likely to develop any disease- including long term Covid- if they persist in eating poorly and not exercising.  This study is suspect because depression can lead to fatigue . Age can lead to “brain fog” sometimes.  Is the brain fog just age or a hangover?  We need to be careful that long term Covid doesn’t include ailments that Covid didn’t cause, ailments that could be pre-existing or developed after a Covid infection but had nothing to do with it"

After having covid in May 2020 (positive test yes) in which the virus attacked her GI system only, she has had great difficulty keeping food down. Nearly daily vomiting and diarrhea along with severe weight loss, and obviously accompanying lifestyle limitations. The only real nutritional food she can tolerate are avocados. I don’t know what the tests will show, and am doubtful they will resolve much.

Today in our schools kids are required to get vaccinations for all kinds of diseases.  And yet we are — in our efforts to appear nonjudgmental and non-wimpy — somehow allowing an exception for one of the nastiest viruses we’ve seen in a hundred years.

I still have no diagnosis for the neurological progressive disease.  I'm very sensitive and have had major neurological attacks triggered by pharma, surgery, herbals ( 6 since 2006).  It doesn't take much to trigger my immune system. I walk a tightrope.  I opted to take the pfizer vaccine thinking that would be my least risk  option.  Within 5 hours my head/neck was tremoring and head/brain /neck felt inflammed ( as in past neurological attacks). I became weak all over, numbness, dizzy/sick and myoclonic jerking, proprioception loss , stuttering, etc It's been 8 weeks and I'm not bouncing back.  I reached out to an author of books on autoimmune disease who is a sufferer with past history of neurological attacks and she also had a neurological /immune reaction.  Many with chronic illness are handling the vaccine, but some of us aren't.  The CDC is yet to make a statement on safety for those with autoimmune and chronic disease. I'm so sick,  I don't see how I can possible take the 2nd dose of the vaccine, let alone  tolerate ongoing annual shots.  Am I an outlier? who knows and is anyone really studying it?  Will I have to live the rest of my life in isolation?  I reported all this on the phone app, and I've yet get a call from anyone.  I'm seeing a immunologist in July at Brigham and Women's."

I’m pretty sure I had a “mild” Covid infection mid-March 2020 after returning from a long weekend in Miami right before the entire country shut down. For several days I had a rash (first ever rash in my life), intense body aches, bloating and diarrhea, fatigue and a moderate headache right between the eyes that wouldn’t go away. At that time none of these were known symptoms. I never had any breathing issues and thought I had fully recovered from what seemed like a flu bug at the time. In the 15 months since, I have experienced bouts of insomnia (never an issue for me pre-Covid), sporadic ringing in the ears and strange smells like toast and pancake syrup that manifest at all hours of the day and night. I do not live near a diner or bodega."
2021-06-15 14:56,"I wonder if this study focused on patients who already had a record of regular health exams including BP, cholesterol, and other standards of regular physicals. If not, then this study is of very little value. I had a healthy physical exam and a few months later I got COVID with typical symptoms. My next physical was a few weeks after my quarantine ended and had some odd results. I had a good record to compare past data with recent COVID. I retested everything that was unusual a few weeks later with everything back to normal. It would seem likely that many people would show higher cholesterol and BP if they put on weight and binged on various food whether they contracted COVID or not. There should be another study identifying the non-COVID health affects of the global pandemic."

2021-06-15 14:24,"This is no surprise. COVID does do lung damage by multiplying in the lungs but it is the immune system's overreaction to COVID that triggers a sub optimal response of causing systemic damage while clearing the virus.

It has been 7 tough months since I tested negative for COVID after testing positive 8 months ago. While I acquired robust immunity from encounter with COVID in Nov 2020, it required a ton of rehabilitation and followup to reach a point where I can say I am happy to be alive and get on with life 2.0. My brush with death over 1 weekend in ICU laying unconscious in a ventilator bag, recovery has given me a new energy and enthusiasm to make post COVID life more productive, pleasant and appreciative of the doctors and nurses who were by my side to ensure that I could breathe again on my own. Recently, in Little Rock AR, I met an emergency nurse and she went almost hysterical when she heard my story of being close to death and then recovering. She recalled the horror of deaths due to COVID a year ago when the standard of care was developing.

 I went from not able to stand on my own feet or utter a word to where I am now.  Has been challenging and required considerable effort and medical care from experts. While most organs have returned closer to 100% capacity, compared to my pre-COVID days, my post COVID brain function recovery is not 100%, but considering that Kent Taylor, CEO of TX Roadhouse ended his life post COVID due to torment by Tinnitus, thankful to breathe"
2021-06-15 14:40,Just because we see one thing (covid illness) come before another thing (various other subsequent illnesses) doesn't mean one is caused by the other. The logic is faulty.

2021-06-15 13:40,"Having a control group is important. There have been a number of reassuring studies on long COVID in children, suggesting that symptoms are largely resolved within a couple of months.

I do not doubt that there are some serious cases of long COVID, and we should absolutely provide appropriate cross-departmental care for those patients. But much like the ambiguity at the moment of the risks/benefits of vaccinating healthy children for COVID, more data is needed before we can come to a thoughtful conclusion. Again, control groups are very important."
2021-06-15 13:47,"Why didn't the reporter ask the number one question: Were they vaccinated?  Is the vaccination the problem?  Is the spike protein, created by the vaccine or the viral infection, the problem? 

The spike protein itself is toxic and creates vascular covid.  So-called respiratory covid is actually vascular covid as autopsies have found micro blood clots in the lungs. 

The spike protein itself, which the vaccine triggers throughout your body, has been determined to agglutinate both red blood cells and platelets.

Two have told me they ""believe we have the antibodies"" and that they've traveled numerous times across the country and engage socially (etc) and ""nuthin"" / ""all good"".

A lot of people in their 30s and 40s have high blood pressure, heart issues and high cholesterol, but they don't know it because they don't ""feel sick.""  I think part of what has happened in many survivors is a heightened sense of vulnerability, of one's own mortality, after being diagnosed with a virus that could have killed them, but didn't.  Fear of dying can be a driving force behind people now seeking medical attention who would never have thought to do so before.  I am not dismissing all symptoms and health issues, but this study isn't going to provide the information doctors and researchers really need to get a grip on what we face with COVID-19 survivors."

The only covid symptom I really had was, naturally the headache, which wouldn't respond to anything, not even my migraine medications. The rest of it was a slight cold. Then I had long covid. which was major abdominal problems and increased migraines. The Moderna shots cured the abdominal problems within 24 hours of the second vaccination, but haven't done much for the migraines. I ended up in the emergency room with a migraine a few weeks ago, and my heart rate had dropped to 30; I felt fine. My heart was also skipping beats. I have watched my pulse since, and it is a lot slower than usual, mostly because of skipped beats, so the covid may have also affected my heart. It's kind of scary but I wouldn't have known unless it gets a lot worse, if I hadn't ended up in the ER for something else."

While I managed my weight through rigorous exercise (there was not much more to do since I was newly retired), my cholesterol and blood pressure is elevated.  It is also possible that those who had COVID sought post illness medical care that they otherwise would not have done.

2021-06-15 15:44,"In response to some comments about the methodology of this study, and its lack of certain controls and whatnot...

This study is important and  publishable because the information can clearly help a lot of real people who need this information right now, not in a year. The exact statistics aren't as important as the general, ""a heck of a lot of the people with this history are having X..."" 

The source needs to be reputable for certain people to accept it. This study does that.

Without such info, a lot of people get doubted by their medical professionals, insurance companies, workplaces, etc. That doubt is particularly bad for members of certain groups who often get disbelieved, called fakers, even while having a heart attack! 

This gaslighting may happen more often to women, people of Color, people diagnosed with certain mental illnesses, etc. It can cost lives; that's in existing peer-reviewed literature."

I'm sure there are people with horrible long-term effects from Covid - mainly those who were so sick they ended up in hospital. 

But I suspect a lot of people clinging to 'long Covid' after a mild bout of coronavirus could use a dose of therapy rather than the indulgences of national newspapers."
2021-06-15 15:44,"Irrespective of the quality of the study which by its very nature is limited, the one thing we can certainly say is that the U.S. healthcare system is ill-equipped to deal with the long term healthcare issues of post-covid patients.   Not a surprise given the healthcare system is a relic that was in need of drastic change even before the pandemic.  Post-pandemic would seem like an ideal time to overhaul our healthcare system and ensure that every American receives high quality healthcare regardless of income.  This is not a radical idea, - most of the world has made this transition.  Politicians will resist change because the political system is corrupt to the bone, but ordinary Americans deserve a system that serves all with high quality and lower costs.  Post-covid (at least for some states) we should build back better and smarter."

2021-06-15 15:46,"If this study shows anything then that the covid pandemic is far from over. I'm utterly disappointed in our populist leaders, including Democrats, who drop reasonable mask mandates and travel restrictions far too early. The Delta variant already cuts through our vaccines. And the next variant will be most likely worse and more effective. Call it evolutionary pressure or whatever, each dominant new covid variant seems to find a more effective way, not only to be somehow different like each season's influenza virus, but to circumvent the human immune response and our vaccines altogether. And who will have the guts to ask China for reparations? Germany had to pay up after WWI & II."
2021-06-15 15:54,"Sorry, but this study needs a baseline to be credible. Since their data set is *only* Covid positive patients, we have no idea what a similar analysis on a similar non-infected population would say. It's not enough to say 23% of such-and-such population suffered new symptoms. You have to evaluate this against a baseline without automatically assuming that non-infected populations have a 0% rate of new symptoms."

The brain fog, severe headaches, and fatigue are the worst symptoms now but immediately after covid my lung capacity was way down even though I had no cough during Covid.

It is also frustrating because my doctor does not have a way to help me or document it."

By the time I was in my early 20s  I knew to expect sensory distortions, hair loss or change and skin irritations.  I have told people if ill with ANY virus since then to try and cleanse in tepid water if they can to rinse the excretions off skin. Sometimes hair would fall out to some degree others changed texture.  All resolved over the course of a few months NONE LIFE THREATENING in nuisance range.  Persistent productive coughs up to two months.  If these effects do not trail off gradually it is then time to see a physician.  Not that any of them have the slightest idea what to do"

I've been vaccinated for months, because I follow the science, and it's been such a relief to not have to worry about dying from COVID. But I'm concerned that we vaccinated people could still go on to get Long COVID. Among my 3 friends with Long COVID,  one's symptoms actually got worse after she was vaccinated (though some are lucky to have their symptoms subside after vaccination).

I'm concerned that if the vaccine doesn't fully prevent Long COVID, then our national premature reopening before we reach herd immunity will lead to millions of people getting seriously disabling long covid even if they've been vaccinated."

During a year where the prevalence of prior or current SarsCov2 infection in patients presenting to their doctors was likely extremely high, I would argue that this revised headline above is almost just as informative to the public.  Or maybe not.  We will never know the significance of COVID with respect to long term health outcomes if we do not minimally attempt to discover if there is any evidence at all that COVID infection is positively correlated with increased health burden in post-COVID patients, let alone about whether it is directly or indirectly causative.

(My cat also caught a ""cold"" from me at that time, and died a couple of months later.  Vet thought heart failure.)    I'd love to record my rash symptoms in such a registry and learn if many other people are suffering similar symptoms.  Such a registry becomes a basis for medical specialists to start to see connections between certain symptoms and covid, then start to research possible treatments for each symptom.   Without a national or global summation of N=1's, (be they few or millions), we're all blundering around in the dark, without help, subject to dismissal, accusations of hysteria, withholding of insurance payments, etc.  Let's start with the science--collect the evidence, then follow where it leads.

I´ve found that the Western medicine approach to long COVID is like playing whack-a-mole...each symptom is treated separately.  This means a lot of appointments and diagnostic tests.  However, there is a holistic approach out there: Acupuncture.

I can not do justice to the impact this approach has had on my symptoms.  Wildly positive results.  Also very affordable.  Community style acupuncture (a large room with many people getting treated at the same time.) has lowered prices for this treatment strategy significantly.

I could have told you that without conducting a study.

What I struggle to understand is why publications like the Times continue fearmongering to make Covid look scarier than it is. That is the only explanation I can think of for the headline and tone of the story and the burying of the extreme limitation of the study. In March 2020 I can see why liberal outlets wanted to deliberately play up the risks of Covid in an effort to counter what they perceived to be misinformation from Trump and a lack of scientific information available.

But the same argument can't be made today with Biden as President and the reams of data we've collected over the past 18 months. Yet stories like this get played up and any research showing Covid might not have been as bad as we thought (e.g. a recent study showing at least half of children who were classified as Covid deaths were likely from other causes) get no play at all. It's time for outlets on both sides to stop politicizing the virus and report the facts and let people make up their own minds about risk tolerance.

Unfortunately, there are some diseases that will remain in a person's system no matter what type of medical treatment or care. Covid-19 may be one of them. 

My husband is under the care of an infectious disease specialist.  He knows the disease and its ramifications.   From time-to-time, he has changed my husband's medication, and has referred him to another specialist.   

Like Malaria patients, Covid-19 long haulers need health care professionals who understand the disease.  They need a doctor who will take the time to listen, and not afraid to refer them to another specialist.  And, all specialists involved must communicate with one another.   

With our fragmented health care system, getting the proper care will be a challenge.  My husband ha been lucky.  But, if post-Covid patients can't get  the treatment they need then, we've needlessly failed them."

2. I read a report a few months ago that pointed out that those who had long covid had their symptoms disappear when they got a vaccine. That study/information should have been discussed in this news article as well (either confirmed or dismissed)."
2021-06-15 11:49,I have a friend that is right now in the hospital... She has always been healthy... She had only a headache as a symptom for covid... But now she has pain that she can not tolerate .... She has been the ER twice...And now has been admitted to do tests to figure out where this pain is coming from... She had a positive Covid test... but only the headache... Well now she is showing exactly what this is talking about... This virus is going to show us way more damage than we could have expected...
2021-06-15 12:01,"Because long Covid can follow a mild or asymptomatic infection, I was shocked and appalled when Rochelle Walensky relaxed masking guidelines a month ago.

Up to 96% protection leaves too big hole in my opinion.  You would hesitate to leave the house if there was a 1 in 25 chance of your pants falling down.

I will not share air indoors with strangers until Covid is gone, gone, gone.

My mask is my seat belt.  My vaccination is my airbag.  Protected by both.

Don't be the last person to die in this war, or be disabled by long-haul Covid."
2021-06-15 17:15,These will all be fantastic pre-existing conditions when SCOTUS strikes down obamacare. Buy your health insurance stocks now! Profits will go through the roof when all of the people previously infected with covid-19 are kicked out of the insurance marketplace.

2021-06-15 14:43,SMH-here is a non-peer reviewed report that was reviewed “by an academic” with no comparison group and the NYT puts this on the front page. And we wonder why our trust in science and the media is eroding.
2021-06-15 17:17,"A few people I know whom I would describe as ""otherwise intelligent"" are still avoiding the vaccine because they're afraid of unknown and possibly long-term side effects.  The facts about Covid--both short-term and long-term--blow that illogical (not to mention selfish) stance completely out of the water.  The by-now overwhelmingly demonstrable fact of Covid vaccine safety does the same.

Thanks for this article which I intend to forward.  Meanwhile, particularly as someone who takes immunosuppressants, I'm avoiding the vaccine avoiders.  I might add that the people I'm thinking of are seniors who live beachfront in Malibu and haven't missed a beat in hosting guests and parties during the pandemic.  A certain sense of entitlement seems to be playing a role: ""we won't get it--we're healthy and our friends (vaccinated or not) are safe"".  Meanwhile, back on planet Earth..."
2021-06-15 17:24,"Fine article on an interesting study.
But it should have cited a feature article in the NY Times Magazine in January, “What if you never get better from COVID-19?”, covering the same topic.

2021-06-15 17:51,This information is exactly the reason why I will not let up by guard even though I've been fully vaccinated. At the age of 71 I won't take a chance socializing indoors with unmasked folks even if they've been vaccinated. I will continue to be patient as long as is necessary. I don't want to live out whatever remains of my life in a disabled condition.
2021-06-15 17:47,"As usual, the unspoken message is to frighten the readers into concluding that these thousands of patients sought care because of “long Covid”. No such conclusion is possible from this kind of “study”, which is simply a report of insurance records.  Long Covid is supposed to be responsible for high cholesterol and hypertension?  This is ridiculous!  Please stop the fear mongering and change the topic to a topic with some substance."
2021-06-15 17:57,"I see COVID as a traumatic illness.  Physically, it causes multi-organ inflammation.  Psychologically, it causes anxiety and depression. Thus, it follows, not unexpectedly, that post-traumatic effects are seen.  As a primary care physician who has seen 225+ COVID survivors, I ask about these symptoms and find them almost universally."
2021-06-15 17:56,"Who, if anyone, is studying the frequency and severity of long Covid in breakthrough infections?

I don’t think the CDC is bothering to track breakthroughs except if they cause hospitalization or death. So, like, it’ll be sorta tough to find out.

You’d think we’d want to know. If post-vax long Covid essentially never happens, worry not. If it’s 35%, that’s a thing, especially as breakthroughs will rise with increasingly immunity-escaping variants, the evolution of which is likely, since it’ll be years, if ever, before we vaccinate the species to herd immunity.

I’m sorry—I mean, It’s all over! Lost the script there for a second but Positive Psychology saved me. Let’s not bicker and argue about silly stuff like potentially avoidable bad futures, not after a million-odd Americans have died, most of them avoidably!

Now I bet you’ll besmirch my beautiful mind with whining about carbon and nukes, too. 

Well, we all know what to do about that: engage in the total denial (complete with reflexive lip-servicing to soothe our consciences) that near-guarantees the worst outcomes. We have learned from Covid that you never ever want to entertain such icky Bad Thoughts. Might marginally affect one’s productivity at work—or our inflated views of our own moral worth.

Continue shopping."
2021-06-15 18:06,"This is a poor quality study from which little can be reliably concluded. We know that many people report lingering symptoms -- usually vague and often emotionally triggered ones like fatigue, ""brain fog"", myalgia and neuralgia, and GI upset such as irritable bowel - after relatively trivial viral infections. Such reportage is much more common in women. We have no idea why. We suspect, and there's some evidence, that emotional distress and physical symptoms associated with distress are elevated across the entire population due to covid and the social and economic consequences the pandemic has caused. But any explanation of why any of this might be so or how serious any of this might prove to be will almost certainly be wide of the mark."
2021-06-15 18:24,"The existence of these   co morbidities after recovery from the novel virus, makes the  most powerful  argument for government and business, (state and local) to insist on  vaccination as a requirement for working, for being in a government building or school, or even a subway, bus or restaurant/bar . So far, no one has called for the official enforcement of any  requirement demanding and enforcing vaccination. The numerous ""novel"" illnesses and conditions appearing now, after people are alleged to have recovered, make enforced vaccination, especially now as vaccine is plentiful, all over the USA and Canada reasonable. I know too many free-riders on the back of a herd immunity they assume they benefit from-. They seem to be more fearful of needles than merely defiant of social medical procedures like polio vaccinations. 
This is too much like a global war-it has killed more than WWII did here. vaccination is the least people can do for their nation and humanity-or the virus may mutate again, and again and we could all be sickened-because a few want to say ""no"" for local political reasons."
2021-06-15 18:25,"The symptoms listed of post covid, remind me of those of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. It would be nice for those of us who suffer either, to have to some effective treatments and even a cure. At least with Covid, doctors acknowledge its existence."
2021-06-15 18:28,"About 15 years ago, I went through a bout of antibiotic resistant pneumonia which caused high fever, trouble breathing, etc. for several weeks.  It took about 2 years for me to fully recover, and there is one strange and scary symptom that has continued to linger.  As a surface chemist, I read the research literature and learned about how pneumonia can damage the lung surfactant, and that it can take quite a long time for the surfactant to fully re-establish.  It appears that COVID can also damage the lung surfactants and it would be reasonable to suspect that this could take quite awhile to fully repair/recover from.  While it's nice to see studies on after effects of COVID, I think there could be a lot to learn from going back and looking at after effects of severe pneumonia, as well.  Lingering illness is nothing new-- but this is a good excuse to devote more thought and research to it."
2021-06-15 18:32,"I’m an RN who has been working through this pandemic. While it is a blessing to note that the number of infectious COVID patients in the hospitals have declined, our overall hospital census is still high at a time when our numbers would traditionally dip. Many of these patients had previous COVID infections. COVID has long legs, even if the initial infection may have seemed mild. This is another reason I get frustrated when I hear people who refuse the vaccine claim “I had COVID and it wasn’t that bad.”"
2021-06-15 18:47,"Oh come on.  You know, when someone gets the Covid vaccine and then experiences a medical issue after, the most common response is: well, millions of people are getting vaccinated and these issues probably would have come up anyway, so they were probably not caused by the vaccine. It's the same situation with people who have had Covid; health issues post-infection are most likely unrelated to the prior Covid infection.  

The PROPER scientific way to measure this is a controlled study with two groups of people with similar characteristics, except that one group had had Covid and the other has not had Covid.  Such as study was done in the UK measuring long Covid (MIS-C) in kids--and found no meaningful difference between the Covid-infected group and the noninfected group."
2021-06-15 18:50,"Thanks for the reminder! As a semi-retired Nurse Practitioner, I continue to be disappointed that so many eligible folks refuse to get their vaccine. Like many other serious infectious diseases, there are after effects even when one has recovered from the initial infection.  And just because many folks had Covid without any serious side effects does not mean that this is the universal case So please get your vaccine if you have not yet done so and if around kids continue to use your masks and pracice safe distancing . Better safe than sorry!"
2021-06-15 18:52,"We are learning more about this virus, and the more we find out, the more that we should be happy if we do not get infected by it. What we can be certain about is that the long-term health effects of Covid-19 are real. All the more reason to get vaccinated.These vaccines are a major scientific achievement."
2021-06-15 18:58,"There is no control here at all, and conclusions are premature.  Eg: Anxiety post covid?  Many people, children and adults, have worsened anxiety this year, with or without a covid infection.  HYpertension?  Stress is a HUGE factor for hypertension.  Etc"
2021-06-15 19:00,They need to do a control group —- that is they need to also look at medical records for those that didn’t get COVID. We are all noticing more symptoms and problems are more evident now that we don’t get as many’s colds and flus this year….
2021-06-15 19:05,"Hi PhD social scientist here to clear something up. Social science research does not require a control group- we aren't in a lab...the world is our lab and you can't ethically control it. So while some top commenters are making noise about lack of a control group I'd like to remind them that the control is the normal rate of occurrence for these complaints (how often they occur in the general population). So, for example, we do see from this study that rates of heart inflammation (myocarditis) are much higher in the post-covid population than in the general population (seriously, you can google this stuff if you are too lazy to read the study). Also, while correlation does not equal causation, in the case of COVID-19 we have a unique stimuli in the natural world where everything basically held constant except the disease- said another way, the thing that changed is that some people got covid and are now getting sicker with chronic conditions. This study was descriptive, but the kinds of questions it raises for other social scientists who study health aren't the methodological complaints that are being lobbed at it from the comment section."
2021-06-15 19:12,How many people who have not had Covid developed high blood pressure and high cholesterol?  Probably close to the same percent that have gotten it post Covid symptoms in any given year.  Especially if they are in their 40s and 50s.   Developing high blood pressure and high cholesterol is fairly common in this age group.
2021-06-15 19:12,"The breadth and reach of new diagnoses following exposure to Covid begs the question of how much inflammatory disease history plays as a contributing factor in many of these chronic conditions. If so determined, is there a therapeutic pathway for some or all of them messaging through knowledge of inflammation as an epigenetic factor or otherwise?"

2021-06-15 19:30,"These are all somatic illness.  They might have been initiated by the virus or the stress of the pandemic, but at this point, healing comes through correctly understanding the root cause of their physical symptoms, which is emotional.  Anyone interested in learned more should read The Divided Mind by John Sarno."
2021-06-15 19:34,"Towards the end of the article a count is provided of the numbers of Covid victims who consulted their doctors about medical issues within 30 days of having the viral infection. One assumes there are control numbers available (i.e. comparative numbers of consultations by those who didn’t have Covid) and also recognition that many people do not run to the doctor when they have bearable maladies, especially when doing so carries risks of exposure."
2021-06-15 19:35,"Correlation is not causation.  It should be understood by people reading these stories, even as we continue to learn the effects of this virus."
2021-06-15 19:39,"Yeah, the huge caveat in this study is the lack of controls, as they mention themselves.  You really can't trust any of this data.  They do mention another, smaller study that did have controls and that data is useful."
2021-06-15 19:48,"And the numbers don’t include all of the survivors of undiagnosed Covid19 — those whose infections were asymptomatic or with such mild symptoms that they didn’t get tested or perhaps even know they were infected.

We know a number of people who fit this category — who, looking back after either delayed notice of exposure or illness very early in the pandemic or even before it was declared a pandemic, now realize that certain symptoms they or close contacts may have been or probably were Covid19.  One hopes that somehow these people will find support as well."
2021-06-15 19:51,"I don't believe the article indicates whether these folks took any of the vaccines since getting sick. What I can say is I struggled with several of these issues for months, I just could not expel Covid from my body, it just lingered. Then I took the vaccine. Within 48 hours I had the most pronounced fever sweats of my life, essentially waking up like I just stepped out of a pool, and within a week I began to feel like myself again. Just one more reason to take the vaccine.

The fact that both my sister and I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and my brother who got a mild version of COVID (no hospitalization) but now has ""long haul"" may provide some further proof of the connection between the two...."

He told us that his symptoms were mild: a little difficultly breathing, a slight fever, headaches, and some GI trouble. After quarantining for the required ten days, he returned to school and work feeling OK. But his breathing difficulties are still there. He said they subsided after he was finally able to get vaccinated in April, but he is still not 100 percent himself — and this is June. Of course, his case won’t be tracked, because he has no healthcare at all now that he’s graduated."

The paucity of testing and tracking is one of the biggest reasons why we have a death count having reached 600,000 and still continuing."
2021-06-15 19:59,"What did the researchers do to assure themselves that maladies like high cholesterol and blood pressure weren't present before these people got Covid, but had simply been overlooked before? Did all these patients have histories of regular check-ups? How many rarely, if ever, saw a doctor, and only sought one out after becoming noticeably ill?"
2021-06-15 20:00,I wonder how many of them have been vaccinated.  Yes the CDC highly recommends those who have been infected to get the vaccine as well.

2021-06-15 19:21,"Garbage methodology results in garbage data and conclusions. 

The study provided data on what diseases covid infected patients may have developed on what charges were made for billing. But what anyone would really want to know is how many more diseases were diagnosed as a result of COVID which the study did not provide any data for. 

For that question, they would have had to compared their data to a population that did not get COVID. 

Nothing-burger"
2021-06-15 19:48,I don’t think the intent of the article was to prove one thing or the other or present a definitive scientific result.   The intent is to just keep people scared.

2021-06-15 20:08,"I've been suffering from the gamut of these symptoms for over ten years, including fatigue, brain fog, skin issues, nerve issues, etc.   They got much worse after a period of stress five years ago.  Doctors have been stumped, but what I can infer is that these issues are likely related to chronic yeast and bacterial infections, including Borrelia bacteria (Lyme).  Once you're in this cohort, you begin to see what a silent epidemic it is, and how many people are suffering from such issues.  My point here is that these symptoms in Covid patients might not be cause by Covid.  It is highly possible that these are people who already had similar chronic yeast/bacterial issues, but their immune systems were able to keep them in check.  Then, along came Covid and their immune systems were compromised (as they were by my period of stress).  It gives the chronic issues room to take hold.  This is just a hypothesis, and clearly much work needs to be done, but I think it is a mistake to assume that Covid itself is necessarily causing these delayed symptoms.  It might just be giving previously latent pathogens a chance to emerge."
2021-06-15 20:14,"I won't pull any punches on this one: the elephant in the room is the lack of lifestyle and pre-COVID health condition information about these individuals. I'm not inclined to believe there is a problem until I see hundreds of thousands of individuals that have no pre-existing health conditions showing new symptoms. 

This has always felt as if it has been glossed over to avoid making people feel bad and that is becoming more clear as time goes on..."
2021-06-15 20:35,"I had a fairly mild case of Covid in December.  I lost my sense of taste and smell, which came back completely in May.  Now my hair is turning gray and falling out, my energy level is low, and my face has broken out with small bumps.  I've been to two doctors and they both seem to agree that it's all due to Covid.  Great!"
2021-06-15 19:37,"Slight correction needed. Doctors do not assign diagnosis codes. They aren't trained for that. In the inpatient setting, coding is performed by credentialed individuals with training in medical science, oncology, and ICD-10 coding."

I have never had any of these problems before. I am 35, vegan, and until last year did cardio and yoga almost daily. Now I feel like a shadow of me. I’ve just been vaccinated with the Pfizer last week, am hoping desperately that the “reset” some people report and just want my life back.

2021-06-15 20:38,"To everyone that comments on the lack of a control in this study: while it can be shown from medical records that a person has had COVID, it is impossible to know -from the same records- that they DID NOT have COVID, even if they tested negative at one point in time."
2021-06-15 20:38,"While I agree this study is not ideal (no controls, no pre-covid health information - not small problems), it seems most of the commenters to this article haven't been keeping up.  Many studies are coming along which have been documenting the same findings: this virus affects all systems in the body and leaves damage - some quite long lasting.  Most of these studies are not reaching the mainstream media (thank you, NYT, for this one), but keep looking, people.  You don't want to accept this, mostly because anything unknown like this must be the patients' fault.  Not knowing the cause is not the same as there is no cause, therefore, it's all in their heads.  Like myalgic encephalomyelitis  (ME) - yes, it's real whether you believe it or not - these symptoms are post-viral symptoms, and similar symptoms occur after a number of viral and bacterial diseases.  In many cases the original germ clears but has changed the neurological - immunological systems and all other systems in the body  permanently.  And basically, no one knows how to cure these post-viral effects."

Or just stop buying made in CHINA products !.."
2021-06-15 20:35,"Do I have this right?  In a heavy flu season about 50,000 deaths are possible.  With Covid deaths RECORDED so far are over 600,000.  Likely actual deaths are well over a million.  So does this mean that covid deaths are over 2,000 times worse than a bad flu?
My math must be wrong."
2021-06-15 20:51,"Acupuncture can be western medicine's best ally in treating long Covid patients.  Recovery doesn’t mean just going home from the hospital but also regaining one’s vitality.  Fever and fatigue and breathlessness may be long -term effects of the virus on the body long after the virus is gone. Lingering symptoms are explainable in acupuncture energetics

If there are late afternoon fever spikes the virus depleted the Yin reserves; if there is extreme fatigue in daily life, the virus depleted the Yang upright qi; if there is a remaining sense of breathless, the qi of the chest collapsed.  Yin reserves, Upright qi, the Qi of the chest, these physiologic functions can be restored through treatment and there can be full recovery.  

Acupuncture’s effectiveness lies in returning physiology to proper functioning after a virus has dissipated the body’s strength.  It is a valuable resource in our health care arsenal to get our citizens back up and vital.  Western medicine having done a superb job in helping the body defeat the virus should now turn to acupuncture to promote full recovery.  Every discharge instruction ought to read: “See your acupuncturist for post viral care.”"
2021-06-15 19:35,"Please forgive the cynic in me who is thinking about the coming tidal wave of elixirs, nostrums, and snakeoil marketing about to engulf these poor unfortunates. The charlatans among us will never let this crisis go to waste.

Ps. What happened to all those millions of hydroquinobaloney pills the former guy bought with our taxpayer money? Sitting in a warehouse somewhere, biding its time until plundered and sold to Jair Bolsonaro at a fat profit?"
2021-06-15 18:07,"I find it amusing that certain articles drag a particular set of commenters out. This one gathered up the “poor study” commenters when in fact this is presenting information in a meta-study kind of way. 

And the NYT is not a peer reviewed journal. So what yer problem, anti-vaxers crawling out of the woodwork? 

I wanna know how the increasingly strangled pain treatment centers are going to deal with long-haulers with nerve pain. 

Time to buy stock in the pharmaceutical company manufacturing Neurontin."
2021-06-15 20:43,I am feeling more and more sorry for the folks opposed to the miraculous Covid-19 vaccines. They need to stop fearing the term EUA and listen to the reality of the disease they are denying themselves and perhaps their children incredible protection against.
2021-06-15 20:59,"Judging from the comments here, there seems to be a real desire to resist and discredit the idea that widespread, chronic health conditions are occurring in people with previous COVID infections.  It is fine to be skeptical, but this seems to be more than that.  It is so sad that this pandemic became so politicized.  COVID-19 is not the flu.  The flu doesn't affect the nervous system.  The flu doesn't cause a person to lose their sense of taste and smell, COVID does.  COVID is a different animal that doesn't just affect the respiratory system.  As people are deciding whether or not to get vaccinated, hopefully, they will consider more that just fatality rates.  Hopefully they will consider the real possibility of the long term health consequences that might arise from  getting even a mild infection of COVID-19."
2021-06-15 21:06,"over six months after I had Covid symptoms, the strangest thing happened, which I would liken to ""brain fog.""

I would get in the car, to drive, and then just sit there, waiting for the driving to start.  When I would get out into traffic, I would have to sternly remind myself to go or stop or anything that was ""active.""  It was like I was just watching a movie or a TV show, passively participating in it.  Eventually, after a few weeks, this went away."
2021-06-15 21:09,"Many readers here are commenting on whether the study proves cause and effect, which is valid criticism.  There seems to be little recognition though that whether COVID-19 was the cause or not, whether conditions preexisted or not, there now appear to be many many people experiencing problems and this is going to be a big health issue, probably affecting things like GNP, employment, and cost and availability of medical care for a long time to come.  It does appear that symptoms like these were widely ignored in the past (CFS) and could have been a common unacknowledged or unknown side effect of many types of viral infections, and may continue to be unacknowledged in the future, which is a widespread failing of the USA medical system.  Anecdotally I've been hearing people say for decades that the newer flu's wipe them out more severely and for longer than in the past.  I've experienced that myself.  Maybe that's due to aging, maybe the flu's are actually getting worse, maybe it's a side effect of poor diet, but it would seem to indicate a general trend towards poorer health on a large scale that articles like this can raise awareness about.  All these issues, old and new, are causing and going to cause problems and the medical and political communities should be dealing with them, as the last sentence in the article points out.  This could be one of the causes of the current ""worker shortage"", besides the low pay and crummy jobs, for example, and it may persist."
2021-06-15 21:10,"More data is needed! I hope that a really detailed picture results, and soon, from what I assume is ongoing reporting and research, so that we get answers to crucial questions such as how long do symptoms persist, how long do they take to develop, what treatments are effective for which, etc. Note that many if not all of the symptoms are ascribable to inflammation- we need better treatments than Prednisone and other side-effect-ridden steroids, for what is clearly going to be a problem affecting millions of the infected."
2021-06-15 19:07,"Finally, deep into the article it reveals that there is no control group for this study and the data are therefore completely inconclusive. This story is not worthy of the New York Times."
2021-06-15 21:16,"There are a number of recipients of the covid vaccine who have similar ongoing effects, and research on this is limited. We are glad to have the vaccine but see that the spike protein could be the cause of some of the long covid effects, which also impact us as recipients of the vaccine. More research needs to be done."
2021-06-15 21:17,"Perhaps the virus is not the problem, but some other pervasive toxic element of our modern life.  There are plenty of those to choose from - electromagnetic fields (watch out, here comes 5G to amp up the mix); non-nutritious agribusiness foods laden with pesticides; and toxics in air, water, and just about everything we use in everyday life (e.g., laundry soap, furniture, flooring, paint, etc..).  Then there are the less tangible, but potentially equally deadly, societal stressors - you know, rising poverty, increased isolation, political anger, and maybe the threat of being shot at your local grocery store by another deranged gun owner.  Add all this up, and it's surprising that anybody is healthy!"
2021-06-15 21:19,"Since this study found such a high prevalence of long-term complications even among those who had asymptomatic Covid, it would seem to this layman to raise the question of whether vaccinated persons, who experience mild or asymptomatic Covid infection, are also at risk of long-term complications. Thoughts, scientists?"
2021-06-15 21:19,"The following is clearly not statistically significant, but is one more data point.  Both my wife and I  survived COVID without hospitalization after catching it very early (January 2020 during a visit to NYC), but it was challenging for both of us, with all the symptoms that have been widely reported. In most ways, we feel back to normal with one big exception:  Neither of us has regained our full lung capacity since that time---we estimate that we have not more than half to two thirds the capacity we had pre-Covid.  Not sure if this has been reported by others, but it seems to be a direct outcome of our infections.  The lung capacity has not really changed in the many months since we were sick."
2021-06-15 21:22,"Sure, there was no control. 

But I doubt that a random sample of two million would yield 500,000 with these types of symptoms."
2021-06-15 21:21,"I know too many with long haul symptoms including our healthiest cousin who contracted COVID last November and not only did he *not* regain his sense of taste, but developed high blood pressure before suffering a stroke. I also have a good friend who's been in and out of hospitals for months in the N.Y.C. area. And they're under 60. I'm not a gun ho 'vaccine' person and never get a flu shot. But when it was my turn, I was first in line for the Pfizer vaccine.  I'm sure that my two sweet neighbors (mother and daughter) who died from the virus last August would have been in that line to...if they had had the chance."
2021-06-15 21:31,"I’m currently suffering long Covid myself, although no testing was available (extremely narrow criteria) when I was sick in March 2020.  So far I’ve read only one article about the long term implications for our economy, as most long Covid victims are in their prime working years.  So we need to step up our social,safety net in addition to our multidisciplinary medical approaches.  Long Covid is going to leave a long tail of economic destruction, both for individuals and for the country.  And so much of it could have been avoided if we had shut down the divisive rhetoric surrounding the science."
2021-06-15 21:34,"What boggles my mind is how so many people who refuse to take the vaccine ignore the short and long term dangers of  Covid. They cite they don't know the effects of the 'experimental' vaccine long term. Yet it's now 6 months in and the vaccines have proven safe for the vast majority of people. Yet Covid IS showing many long term affects for at least 25% of sufferers. Common sense says get the vaccine, reduce your risk of Covid and most importantly protect other people."
2021-06-15 21:38,"There was a terrible pandemic. People were forced into isolation. No longer able to go to the gym, they honed their baking skills. They began to gain weight and their fitness declined. Anxious and deprived of society, many developed mental health issues. Some turned to drink; domestic violence increased. Afraid of the virus, many put off trips to the doctor. Afterward, researchers found that even people who had asymptomatic cases of the virus had new health problems.  This seems sort of uninteresting unless we can compare the health problems faced by the people who got the virus and those who did not."
2021-06-15 21:56,"This is just the beginning.

There are many more cases to come with mild or asymptomatic conditions that will go unreported as testing is now deemed obsolete given overconfidence in the vaccine.

""The cure here may be worse than the disease"" as we are ""in fates right hand"" awaiting the next move of a virus seemingly in defeat, running from unapproved vaccines and in summer retreat.

Let us not forget last fall's resurgence."
2021-06-15 21:58,"""Other issues included intestinal symptoms; migraines; skin problems; heart abnormalities; sleep disorders; and mental health conditions like anxiety and depression.""

Sounds like what I feel like all the time at 77. Some days are better than others, although I don't have migraines. I told my doc I suffered from malaise one time and he said that's not a medical condition."
2021-06-15 21:58,"Interesting for the number of records examined, but absent a more definitive, clinical study with a control group, insight into post-acute sequelae of Covid, or PASC syndrome, is impossible, especially given the long list of common conditions reported. We aren’t hearing much from the sufferers. We aren’t hearing much from doctors on how this relates to the virus and whether it should be considered a single disease entity, such as an immune dysfunction, or a more generalized response to stress. 

Because SARS CoV-2 can infect the heart and blood vessel linings, reports of chest pain, breathing problems and cardiac inflammation are almost certainly direct virus effects; special MRIs have been done on the heart in recovered patients. But general physical and psychological stress isn’t trivial. Covid was already frightening enough, whence the lurid stories, moon suits and isolation rules heightened the terror. Hospital costs, bereavements, evictions and job losses loomed over survivors. Stress can cause or exacerbate hypertension, hyperlipidemia, arthralgia and muscle aches, among other things.

If PASC is determined to have a single etiology from SARS CoV-2 infection, it won’t be the first long-term viral syndrome we learned about, and research into treatment will follow."
2021-06-15 22:07,"Most definitely. 
Falling asleep within 20 Minutes after the part-time work shift, when I was completely awake at work, gave me cause for great concern. 
Aches and pains come and go, but I never had them before COVID. Friends like to say, “it’s old age,” but “old age” doesn’t suddenly appear two months after the virus. In the intestinal stuff continues. Some days it’s fair and Sundays it’s not, but the days it’s there, it’s almost like I’m wearing pants better three sizes too small for my waist. And I’m 70 and a man and I normally have a 32 inch waist. Except for those days when the intestines swell up and it looks like I’m four months pregnant.

Well, we’re learning things all the time, aren’t we? So much for those “Golden years.”"
2021-06-15 22:15,"Three months post -Covid, my 31 yr old daughter and myself (age 64) are suffering hair loss. Anyone else experiencing this?"
2021-06-15 22:15,These results are meaningless without knowing the frequency of medical visits in a control group. High cholesterol? Are visits for that more common post covid than in those who didn't have covid or are they about equally common?
2021-06-15 22:01,"Does J&J prevent long COVID?

Remember when the experts were telling everyone that one vaccine was just as good as another, so go ahead and get whatever is available?

What are they saying now?"
2021-06-15 22:24,"This is a simple retrospective review of healthcare data, not a well-controlled study.  It points to areas where further inquiry  may be warranted (perhaps in the form of well-controlled studies), but does not provide strong enough data from which to draw conclusions (again, other than the conclusion that further study is justified)."
2021-06-15 22:25,"I don't doubt that many people are suffering from long covid, but when you talk about ""new medical problems,"" it's also worth noting that many people in the US get pretty sporadic access to health care. Someone might have high cholesterol for years but not know about it until they go to the doctor to check up on their health post-covid."
2021-06-15 22:01,When will people wake up to the fact this is not just another flu? I was in a Florida Halifax hospital over the weekend and one of the staff who is in close contact with patients was not vaccinated and wasn't going to be. Her argument was that she wanted to have children and thought the vaccine would harm her future kids. Where do people get these crazy ideas? And why do hospitals hire these people to be around sick people? I think those lack policies could end up killing some of their patients.
2021-06-15 22:20,"I wish every anti-vaxxer would read these readers' comments.  It drives home the point that Covid is not just like a regular flu that you can get over. 

The debilitating long term effects can be widespread and terrifying.  

And someone explain to me how my choice to continue to wear a mask indoors negatively affects non maskers.

Why do anti-maskers act so offended?  

I choose to cover my breasts with a shirt and no one hassles me.  I choose to cover my feet with shoes and don't get hassled.  
 
What difference does it make that I still choose to cover my nose/mouth in a crowded store as a precaution to avoid catching all viruses."
2021-06-15 22:14,"My 71 father had a near death experience with Covid in December and has completely lost the ability to urinate, among a host of other issues mentioned here. The urologists are mystified (their word). It’s looking more and more like he’ll be using a catheter the rest of his life. It’s devastating."
2021-06-15 22:10,As stated in the article the study group was not compared to a group without COVID. So.....
2021-06-15 22:18,"This is going to be the virus that keeps on giving, its so much more virulent that the Spanish flu, over 600K are dead from it now in the US."
2021-06-15 22:38,"I am curious as to why is this condition being referred to as ""Long Covid"" rather than ""Chronic Covid"".  

Chronic is the standard medical term for persistent or ongoing disease. There is a myriad of examples, but readers might be familiar with examples such as COPD (Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease) and CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome).

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) committee is a notoriously slow-moving body, lagging far behind diseases and medical advances. However, this is one instance in which the ICD should step up."
2021-06-15 22:47,"If former President Trump was as smart as he believes he is, then he would have quickly adapted to evolving COVID public health initiatives known during his tenure, thus appearing as an empathetic leader! 

 He very likely would have been credited in saving many American lives and would still be President and home free regarding his legal jeopardy.

It is embarrassing how so many Trump supporters are so disdainful of science. 

Unfortunately I’m afraid President Trump has a good chance of a second coming, thus leading to untold misery and with the possibility of the end of democracy as we know it. I hope I’m wrong."
2021-06-15 23:10,I had Dengue in SE Asia and have been dealing with the after effects for years. Doctors constantly tell me my pain and issues are all in my head (except my new heart condition - they just write that off as ‘nothing to worry about’). The one thing I hope is that Covid will open the doors for those of us who have been suffering for years from viral after effects to actually be taken seriously. We can only hope.
2021-06-15 23:13,"When I became aware of the horrendous long-covid sufferings of so many, I realized I had to avoid infection. Now vaccinated, I still do not figure I'm safe. A doctor from Texas posted in a comment to an article here that she wouldn't take such risks either. There's no guarantee that if you get an asymptomatic breakthrough case you won't have issues going forward. We won't have anything like real safety until we have herd immunity. Of course, given where we are, we may never get there. A lot is going on now to nudge the hesitant and deniers to get their shots and I'm behind that stuff 100%, I don't care how. Lotteries, free tickets, information campaigns, knocking on doors, TV commercials, let it rip. We need people to get vaccinated!"
2021-06-15 23:18,"Post infectious syndromes have been neglected for far too long. 

Diseases ranging from Typhus to polio to Lyme disease to Ebola and more have documented relationships to autoimmunity and damage to the autonomic nervous system.

If there is a silver lining to the COVID10 pandemic, it may be that committed researchers will, at long last, discover how this happens and what can be done about it."
2021-06-15 23:21,"A lot of these sound more like co-morboities then long covid. The actual corona virus probably isn't responsible for depression and anxiety -- but the whole experience of having COVID, living in lockdown, fear of infecting family (ad nasum) are obviously exacerbating factors for mental health issues.

We should attempt to treat environmental factors and address life style problems before we jump into putting people on medication they may not actually need.

Ya it can feel bad when the doctor says ""lose weight, excerisize, and have close relationships"" but that really, medically, is often times better advice then over proscription of medications with all their risks and side effects."
2021-06-15 23:20,"Medical professionals who are still skeptical about long Covid-- dismissing it as ""just stress""or similar-- should go back and review the history of post-chemotherapy ""brain fog.""

For many year patients (often women) complaining of this were told they were just malingering and making it up, and then told it was real, but merely psychological, and antidepressants would take care of it.

And then the research came out about how chemo damages the maintenance cells called microglia. Brain fog was was real and physiological the whole time. The antidepressants that helped, helped because of their physiological effects. There was no self fulfilling prophecy, or thinking yourself out of brain fog.

Given this history, and given that researchers have already found wide-ranging damage, including the recent study on severe inflammation in the brain (complete with microglia malfunctions!), your certainty is likely misplaced and likely harmful to any patient so dismissed."
2021-06-15 22:51,"Over a year into the pandemic, why have they not yet come up with a mask that protects the wearer?"
2021-06-15 23:03,"I would hope that this new info makes some antivaxxers change their minds, but I don’t think it will."

2021-06-15 23:01,Should this be surprising? We have forgotten our history. My Grandpa's bout with rheumatic fever as a child led to a lifetime of cardiac problems.
2021-06-15 23:01,"I have in-laws who don’t think wearing masks and getting vaccines is necessary. These bright spots decided to catch Covid19 on purpose so they could acquire immunity. It almost killed one of them: last October, he had two separate strokes, two cases of severe pneumonia, long-term ventilation, removal of part of the bowel and gall bladder, a tracheotomy, a feeding tube,  and more. He was in the hospital for over two months, then in and out of emergency rooms. He is still on oxygen, mostly bed-ridden, and requiring multiple therapists. The financial burden on our family is large and ongoing. I’m sure that the US will be paying long-term disability benefits to many adults with long or chronic COVID-19."
2021-06-15 23:42,"The long term effects of the coronavirus are not fully understood. (It's too early yet.) However, that some people do have mysterious side effects is now well documented.  And while we've come a long way (spectacularly) in holding the virus at arm's length with our vaccines, and are beginning to reopen ...it all feels a little weird. I'm guessing the more data we collect, the greater our chances of zeroing in on the most lingering side effects affecting some of us. In the meantime, get your vaccination and make a note on the calendar for when you might be up for a booster."
2021-06-15 23:52,"Not mentioned in this otherwise useful article are the memory effects. I had covid in April 2020 and spent a week in a hospital. My one lasting effect has been an apparently permanent deterioration of short-term memory, and of the ability to transfer short-term memories into long-term memory storage. Fortunately, I can report that there has been no cognitive decline. I would like to know the frequency and severity of this side effect."
2021-06-15 23:52,"And let’s not forget that some of us who were extremely fit and healthy prior to our Covid infections are now, after almost a year, having to pay health related bills that are not covered. There are MANY people who haven’t been tracked and no one even knows about us, so you can probably add some percentage points to those suffering long Covid. My health care provider could not care any less that my new Heath issues are related to Covid, and my insurance company could care even less than that.  I’ll be paying bills for the rest of my life related to this virus."
2021-06-15 23:54,"This was brought home to me with relatives who apparently suffered long-haul effects from the Spanish Flu. Little known or studied but a significant number developed mental problems, fatigue, etc. One cousin committed suicide after being unable to go to work."

2021-06-16 0:18,"I had covid for 12 days in March. I recovered at home without breathing problems, but with a lot of fatigue and some fevers.
I've been experiencing continuing fatique, anxiety and brain fog.
I'd hoped the ""long covid"" symptoms would go away after getting my vaccines a month after having covid, but I still feel off."
2021-06-16 0:32,"Many people dismiss Covid-19 as “just the flu” and are not willing to take precautions to prevent infection including vaccines.  Information about the long term effects may result in more people taking this seriously.  Apart from the serious consequences including death and stroke, these effects will have a significant impact on quality of life."
2021-06-16 0:39,"Thank you Dr. Chu for focusing on the study’s strengths, including its size and inclusion of a range in disease severity.  There is so much more to learn about COVID-19 and it’s good to know this helped.  I do wonder how the authors protected patient data and kept it anonymous."
2021-06-16 0:41,"Long Covid seems to be a US-specific phenomenon. Extremely limited number of reports outside of the US related to the longevity of the disease. I hope these patients get the care they need and if it's an undiscovered medical condition, the earlier they seek help, the better."
2021-06-16 0:51,"My own N-1 study: I had moderate Covid in December (with mild pneumonia). I've recovered except my left ear has been ringing with tinnitus nonstop since. No hearing loss, no neuroma, nothing unusual on the CT and MRI. Could be age, could be stress, could be many things, could just be a correlation, but it's probably a causation. It's annoying but many have fared much worse."
2021-06-16 0:51,"Anecdotally and for posterity, I likely caught covid in Feb 2020. Tests were not available. rapid flu and rapid strep tests in an ER came back negative. I was ill for 5 weeks with respiratory problems like a bad cold with hacking cough. I lot my sense of smell about 3 or 4 weeks in which was not a recognized symptom at the time - it was, though, a few weeks later iirc.

A few months later one symptom I had was a headache for two weeks straight. I've never had a multi-day headache before that I can recall. After a few weeks of dealing with the pain I decided to take a small dose of Klonipin. Headache went away and didn't come back which led me to hypothesize that it had been the result of stress and the benzo relieved it.

Only time will tell how many of these people are just stressed out beyond anything they had ever experienced."
2021-06-16 0:38,"This article provides no information in regard to the possible inclusion of a control group for comparison of the incidence of the same symptom complaints in persons who tested negative for Covid.  In order for the data from people who tested positive for Covid to be statistically valid as a group, it is helpful to match them for same health complaints by age category and previous medical history with people who tested negative for Covid.  This would then allow the data to be evaluated for probable cause-effect relationship to the virus instead of the possibility of coincidental association.  Technical writers and reporters without formal knowledge in statistical analysis should have their articles reviewed by someone competent in the field before it is published."
2021-06-16 1:04,"I'm wondering how Dr. Al-Aly expects  the U.S. healthcare systems  to ""adapt to the reality and develop the capacity "" to treat Long Covid  in millions of Americans, and what he believes that treatment  would look like.

My doctor went into  Acute Respiratory Distress due to COVID-19 in early March 2020, was hospitalized multiple times for Severe COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia, and has been  suffering from severe Long Haul Covid.

He's been under the care of doctors since March 2020. Doctors haven't been able to do anything  for him, other than to give him an inhaler for the asthma which he developed, as one of multiple symptoms  of Long Covid.

If some kind of treatment is available for the debilitating fatigue, shortness of breath, severe headaches and ""Covid Brain""(my doctor's term), I'd be interested  in knowing what it is, and passing this information onto my doctor, who waited for months to be seen by someone at the Mt. Sinai Long Covid  program.
All Mt. Sinai can do for him is to refer him to a respiratory therapist.

It took my doctor over four months to get an appointment to get an appointment with Mt. Sinai.

How does Dr. Al-Aly expect  the health care system to produce the number of treatment professionals to treat millions of American with Long Covid, and how does Dr. Al-Aly except the Covid ""Long Haulers"" to be treated ?

2021-06-16 1:43,"I had a pretty bad case of Covid in March 2020.  It was early on and they didn't really understand what was going on. I have been left with limited taste and smell, joint pain, tiredness and shortness of breath. I have headaches and brain fog, I have markers for inflammation in my blood. I am a different person and it is depressing.  I had been living in the US for over 30 years, but have now decided that I may never return because I have free healthcare in Canada and I need continuing care.  My doctor here calls it post viral syndrome and does not seem to be able to say it will go away.  I am so grateful to have Canada as my second country, at least I can get care here, but I do miss the place that I had called home for so many years."
2021-06-16 1:47,"I believe we will be dealing with Long-Covid for some time to come.  Many of these patients are being diagnosed with POTS, a form of dysautonomia that is poorly understood and is in desperate need of research.
I do wish there had been a comparison group because my first question in reading this was ""What is the 'average' rate of patients seeking treatment for new symptoms?""  I assume it's much higher in the Post-Covid patients, but hard to tell without comparison/control group."
2021-06-16 2:00,"“Another limitation of the study is that it did not compare people who had Covid-19 with those who did not, making it unclear if rates of post-Covid symptoms were higher than in a more general population.”

This makes the study fairly useless. They can’t differentiate anxiety caused by long COVID from that caused by a year-long lock down.

I think long COVID is real. I think this study, as described in this article, does those suffering from the disease a disservice. I hope there’s more substance in the final version of the study."

There are plenty of people contracting covid who unfortunately are passing away or recovering from long haul symptoms who were in great health prior to infection.  As many other research articles have stated, there isn't a clear cause  (yet) for why certain populations are dealing with debilitating symptoms after the initial period of an active infection. Also the number of people dealing with long haul symptoms seems to be a more common outcome than passing from it. Hopefully more people will get vaccinated and better understand the risks."

I’ve had these symptoms since 2005, and had to stop working in 2011, age 49. It’s not Covid-19, it’s a very common thyroid disease called Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, a chronic autoimmune disease officially affecting 5% of the population but I’d wager 10% because it took me much research, five doctor visits to get tests and a proper diagnosis (first diagnosis, depression of course), and then three more tests and doctor visits to be prescribed the thyroid hormone replacement meds that I knew I needed (without which people can become quite ill or die). It has a viral or bacterial component but just try getting tests of the 5-6 most likely culprits from your doctor. I’m paying on my own for lab testing. I hope that all of this research into viral infections will include the ones that have been here for a long time."

He decided it was a migraine, although I know it wasn't.  A few days later I had a rash over my body.  A few weeks later I had numbness and tingling in my hands. A few weeks later, numbness and tingling in my feet.  I had episodes of brain fog.  I fatigue easily, waking up tired.  I had a bout of painful muscles and high blood pressure (150's over 130's - very abnormal for me).

This was all at the beginning of February 2019 and for months afterwards, when no one was really looking for COVID, and when they finally did, no one thought of ""long haul"" symptoms.    

I don't know, of course, if I had COVID, since no one tested for that at that time.  I had a test for antibodies, but that was in June, four months later, with negative results.

The more I read about the aftereffects, the more I believe I did have COVID.  I wonder how many others have had the same experience I've had?"

The vaccine makers have been granted protection from lawsuits if people have vaccine side effects.  As long as vaccine makers do not hide known health side effects  when they provided the vaccine then they are not held liable.
Lets hope these rushed vaccines prove to be as safe as the many well meaning experts are hoping they will be.

2021-06-16 3:13,"The ACE2 receptor targeted by Covid-19 is present on the surfaces of cells in many parts of the body. This receptor normally interacts with the messenger molecule angiotensin, which has effects that have been studied in some organs like the heart and kidneys, but its actions are little known and poorly understood in most other parts of the body. 
When the virus latches on to the ACE2 receptor, there will be knock-on effects as the normal angiotensin signaling gets disrupted, and the range of organs affected is astonishing.

2021-06-16 6:50,"A few weeks ago, I read with absolute horror the article in this paper about how the CDC was no longer tracking mild breakthrough cases in vaccinated people.

My instinct is that the CDC does not want to discourage people from getting vaccinated, so they keep quiet about anything that might call into question the vaccines' efficacy in preventing serious long-term disease.

I have never really been scared of dying of Covid – it is extraordinary rare for my demographic. What I am terrified of is Long Covid, and it seems that this condition is both underreported and shrugged at among those in charge.

If vaccines don't prevent mild infections, and thus Long Covid, and if vaccinated people feel invincible and more likely to spend time indoors together – especially in the winter – does it also follow that we may see increased incidences of Long Covid in the very near future?

This entire situation is frightening. I will continue wearing a mask until we have more information on this topic, and I don't care if people mock me for doing so. Someone rolling their eyes at me is a small price to pay to avoid contracting Long Covid."

My Mother in law and Father in law were both infected with COVID in late December 2020. My Father in law died in the hospital of acute hypoxia. My Mother in law appeared, like my Mother, to have a mild case of COVID. While she seemed to clear COVID she had persistent cardiac problems after the infection and died in May of cardiac myocarditis.  I think when the deaths of people like my Mom and Mother in law are counted we will find that well over one million (1,000,000) Americans will have died from COVID.  My Mom and my in laws lived long wonderful lives. We grieve for them. But, I and my family will never, ever get over the fact that so many Americans could not possibly care less about their lives. The minor annoyance of wearing a mask was too much for them. What they said to me and all the families that lost loved ones is that they are too selfish, self-centered, ignorant,and new devoid of even a drop of empathy.    I will never get over what I have learned of my fellow citizens, they are truly horrible people who would step over the dead and dying to be able to drink in a  bar.

2021-06-18 15:32,"Early March of last year, my husband and I both got really sick with a bad cough, high fever, and weird body aches. We only had the fever for about 3-4 days, but it took about a month to get back to our regular energy levels - by which, of course, the world had fallen apart. Covid was in the news at that time, but when I called our doctor, he said the only way to get tested in our city at that time (around March 5) was to go to the emergency room; he couldn't help us. We weren't that sick, so we just waited it out. My husband and I both worked with people who traveled frequently internationally, including several who had been in China in January of 2020, just before Wuhan locked down. 

For months afterward (until probably September of last year) I persistently would smell something burning, go investigate, and find nothing. It was so puzzling to me. It was interesting to me to read that Ms. Jeffries had the same symptom after a positive Covid test.

If all the data emerging about ""long Covid"" and post-Covid syndrome doesn't scare people into being vaccinated, I don't know what will. Coupled with today's news about Heidi Ferrer electing to take her own life after struggling for over a year to recover from Covid. Death is not the worst thing that can happen to you."

First he had ""a dead arm,"" and now he struggles to make it through four or five innings. I cannot help but think this post-COVID19 syndrome will be with him for the rest of his life. Of course, he's a high profile person with great healthcare and the best physicians to help him cope with his issues. Imagine if he were someone without health insurance at all."

2021-06-18 16:22,"Maybe now that 'Long Covid' is a thing, the medical profession will come around to accepting that Post-Lyme Syndrome is also a reality, & its symptoms of debilitating fatigue, brain fog, depression, chronic aches & pains, will finally be taken seriously.

The theory that chronic covid symptoms are produced by an autoimmune brain inflammation triggered by the initial infection, has perhaps some relevance.

One wonders if the use of NSAIDs like Celecoxib to treat such inflammation could be applicable to Lyme CFS. But of course it would be hard to know, since Celebrex is hundreds of dollars a month & insurance only pays for it if you have specific forms of arthritis.

How about applying some of this attention to the chronic, disabling disease of Post-Lyme? It's real, cuts your functionality by like 2/3rds, basically ruins your life permanently, & most doctors think your making it up, & have nothing to offer anyway.

Both Long Covid & Long Lyme sufferers need some leniency from Social Security disability. Your ability to work & support yourself is crushed."

The studies doo’t seem to address, however, the effect of quarantine and isolation on health.  Sedentary living, especially if a departure from normally active life, can quickly cause medical and psychological problems.  Some recovering, home bound Corona virus patients with too much time on their hands and not much to do, probably spent a lot of times worrying about their health and visited doctors who were happy to give a diagnosis because it was “billable.”  This could also skew statistics!"

A control group is not needed - because this is a correlation study - aka an associational or observational study.  

This is not an RCT or clinical trial study.  Only RCT's require a control group so you can answer Why or causation questions.  You'd need that for policy-level evidence.  (But you could still be wrong for many reasons)

An example of bad policy - you could probably sue the state - are the mask mandates because they had no policy-level evidence backing them, no RCTs, just observational studies.  

Imagine millions of oldsters driving around with masks and suffering from both low O2 and high CO2.  (The high CO2 is worse)

Considering that covid patients have too low blood oxygen levels, maybe all those masks caused Covid.  Has that been studied?"

I can't imagine telling someone on the verge of death that a proven therapy needs approval from a second opinion of a federal agency. If the first vaccines were fast tracked with emergency approvals, so must the new ones. It's not only an equality issue, but a moral imperative to stop people from dying, after all, if they died, how do you tell the person's family you had to follow protocols beyond those of the first professionally conducted? Please fast track all vaccines if initial effectiveness is proven. As a leader of the world, we can also save it."

Less thrilled by the fact that FDA approval, if it comes at all, won’t come until the fall. I need to have had an FDA-approved vaccine to return to the classroom in August, and the one I’ve had is “only” highly effective, not approved. What exactly are Novavax’s 30,000 US trial participants supposed to do if they need an approved vaccine for work or travel - especially given that there are no studies (though plenty of anecdata) on the safety of having, say, a full course of Pfizer after you’ve had a full course of something else? Novavax trial participants shouldn’t be left in limbo like this."

From what I have read elsewhere. Novavax may be particularly important in vaccinating immunocompromised individuals.,  Unlike other vaccines the immune system is not involved in creating the spike protein but rather it is directly in the vaccine.
This means those with weakened immune systems can find protection from Covid 19 that other vaccines do not offer.  At present about 3% of the population is immunocompromised."

The volunteers are faced with either taking additional vaccines from another company (effects not tested) and dropping out of the test so that any long term issues will not be known, or not traveling because our credentials are not recognized. That is a real problem. Novavax is aware of this situation and done nothing for the volunteers who allowed them to prove the efficacy of the product, not knowing the outcome. Yes we are protected for which we are grateful, but we now are not able to have the credentials that others have."
2021-06-14 12:08,"This coverage is inadequate. Every article about a vaccine should include the method it uses for disease protection (mRNA, inactivated virus, etc), cost, spacing of doses, and details about refrigeration and handling requirements. You shouldn't have to hunt through the text for clues that allow the reader to put the coverage in context of other vaccines."
2021-06-14 12:15,"Several comments come from those who have received the Novavax vaccine and are worried that without an EUA they will not be considered immune for travel and work.

The traditional test of immune status is antibody levels that are recognized as being associated with immunity.

Having these tests broadly available at “reasonable” charge would be a useful tool in certifying the status of people who have been vaccinated, as well as those who have had undiagnosed COVID-19 infections."
2021-06-14 12:38,"According to this article, both Novavax and Covaxin (2 US pharmaceutical companies) have applied for approval for E.U.A. with better efficacy than the Johnson and Johnson, and with fewer side effects in the case of Novavax.
To summarize, these two US companies, one of which is a smaller pharmaceutical, both meet the higher standards of Pfizer and Moderna, with fewer side effects noted in one case.  However, because the market is saturated by the Pfizer, Moderna and the lesser efficacious J&J vaccines, the US FDA is asking that these companies - or at least the smaller US company - gain approval through a longer and more strenuous approval process, rather than the emergency use protocol under which the large pharma vaccines gained approval.  
If FDA is going to force these smaller countries to gain approval via the standard path, which will be more expensive and require longer testing time, then they should incentivize financially and require that Pfizer, Moderna and J&J stop production until they too meet those standards, once these companies receive the higher standard approval.
It is wrong that the US FDA hold Ocugen and Novavax to the standard approval pathway for US use, while allowing Pfizer and Moderna and J&J to produce in the US with lesser standards.
Capitalism does not make good medicine. Never has and never will."
2021-06-14 12:53,"Were immune system disorder patients such as those with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) included in the Novavax testing of the vaccines efficacy? Immune system disorder patients were excluded from the Pfizer, Moderna and J&J studies. I am still trying to find out if the Pfizer vaccine that I finished 4 months ago was effective on me. I have RA and do take methotrexate an immune suppressant medication. I did stop taking methotrexate while taking the vaccine and two weeks after my second Pfizer shot but do not know for sure if the vaccine worked. So far, I have not found a proper antibody test that is designed to tell me that is available or offered to someone with an immune disorder."
2021-06-14 13:03,"The U.S. may be ""awash"" in vaccines, but the world is not. The U.S. should buy every available dose and provide it to countries that need it. That would not only save many lives, but it would boost world GDP along with U.S. prestige."
2021-06-14 13:14,"Why is sufficient supply in the U.S. the standard for the EUA?  In a pandemic such as we are in, it should be sufficient supply globally.  Also:  isn't it of concern that the final product quality testing is not defined?"
2021-06-14 13:15,"Despite its problems in South Africa, where Novavax found an efficacy of just 49 percent, the company should submit its results to WHO for permission to distribute to other poor countries. They are the ones needed most.

Among Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants, Delta is the most deadly which also spreads fast.  It will be good to find out if Novavax can be effective to fight against Delta variant."
2021-06-14 13:20,"The fact that a third effective vaccine (90%) is about to come on the market is a strong addition to the already effective vaccines on the market, i.e., Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

However, it's the middle of June & still only 43% of the country is fully vaccinated while many states have opened completely.

Even with the addition of another vaccine, if people continue to refuse to get vaccinated, the virus will continue infecting folks.

My husband and I took a drive to WI yesterday and made the critical error in judgement when we stopped at a restaurant chain that is known for its fish sandwiches.  The restaurant was packed, people stood next to tables, waiting to order while others ate, tables were NOT cleaned after each use & while some of the workers preparing the food wore masks, some but did not cover their noses. NO customers wore masks.

We could not get out of there fast enough.  We have no idea how many, if any, of these folks were vaccinated.  We were the only customers with masks, and man, did we get the dirty looks of disdain.

Another food establishment in WI crossed off the list.

I understand the need to loosen up the reins a bit, but customers and some employees at this restaurant acted as if the coronavirus disappeared over night.  There was absolute zero sense of common sense or the mildest precautions taken.  

Somehow having a 4th vaccine available may do little good in this country, but perhaps other countries will take full advantage of them."
2021-06-14 13:22,"Article should note (if I have it right) that Novavax takes 2 shots & can be shipped and stored at 2-8 deg Celsius (35-46 F, ie at normal refrigerator temperatures) thus it is easier to deploy & store than Moderna & Pfizer.

It would also be helpful to include a brief explanation of how it differs in bio-manufacture as it is a ""recombinant nanoparticle vaccine""(?) which, I gather,  delivers spike protein itself, rather than m-RNA instructions for one's body to synthesize it as per Moderna & Pfizer."
2021-06-14 13:27,"Article fails to note storage requirements. One commenter says similar to J&J's which is a massive improvement, especially for rural areas and poorer populations. At this point the US's vaccine problem is getting people to take the shot, so short-term more vaccine types are like deckchairs on the Titanic. Providing some diversity to potentially enhance boosters is very important for the US but for (most?) of the world's population, less restrictive handling and storage requirements are likely its real value."
2021-06-14 13:29,"This vaccine might help transplant patients and other patients receiving immunosuppressants as it contains an adjuvant. These patients often mount only a limited or no immune response to the currently available vaccines and are therefore not protected.

Furthermore as this is a vaccine more along the traditional model using purified proteins, it might be acceptable to hold outs who don't want mRNA or DNA-vactors. 

This vaccine is important for the US market, not only as a booster but as a full fledged, 2 shot vaccine."
2021-06-14 13:39,"The article is a bit lacking in the kind of detail we are accustomed to reading about the technology used, it's administration and storage requirements, etc. I suspect this will come shortly.

My understanding is that the technology used is similar to that which has been used for many years for flu, hepatitis, and pertussis.  Also, the storage requirements are similar to the J&J. 

While there is a lot of vaccine hesitancy around the 'new' technology of the mRNA vaccines, I am hoping that the more familiar technology of this vaccine will be reassuring to some of those folks who hesitate but, presumably, have had (or their children have had) some or all of those older vaccines sometime in their lives.  Those facts along with the apparently milder side effects might change the minds of some people if we can get the information to them.

And when the world needs as much vaccine as possible, why without EUA?"
2021-06-14 13:56,"Instead of history with a certain known outcome the COVID-19 pandemic is still mostly breaking news.

And thus COVID-19 is still evolving to be more covert asymptomatic contagious driven by natural selection from our  vaccines. And most of Earth's people are not fully nor partially vaccinated giving it more chances to mutate.

The more vaccines that we have based upon varied technology aka a multi- prong effort the more data and information we will have from clinical trials to get beyond desperation Emergency Use Authorization."
2021-06-14 14:14,"This article does not address the elephant in the room, i.e. efficacy against the Delta variant. Going by the way it is ravaging India, and the high number of breakthrough cases with the existing vaccines there, that is the key to any future vaccine's success. The Beta variant is seemingly not as dangerous, but they are focusing their efforts on that for some reason."

But I read in another newspaper that around six lakh shots are getting wasted and states like Tennessee and North Carolina are returning excess shots to the government. In the same report  it is mentioned that till date only 50 per cent of the total population got the shots. Rest? Some are not willing to take, may be out of fear, and some are careless about their own health."
2021-06-14 11:42,"It's smart of Novavax to seek approval for the vaccine in other countries. America doesn't need more vaccine choices. There are 194 other countries more in need of a vaccine. Millions of people in other countries are still catching the virus and dying. Novavax should concentrate its efforts there. If we are to control the virus, the whole world needs access to at least one vaccine brand."

Vaccines are great...get the shot...I had zero reaction to either shot.  But I'm wondering...with US diets so poor, and with the obesity issues, were we prone to more deaths from the start.  And we have more seniors being kept alive by drugs, but overall poor health with so many.  Could this be a wake up call to improve the foods we eat and to get more exericse?"

2021-06-14 12:30,"Every day, I view the vaccination statistics you publish and the tallies of new cases and deaths. I'm alarmed that only 42% of Americans are fully vaccinated. It's true the virus is subdued for now, But I believe that fact is weather related as the flu is. We have now seen a year and a half of statistics that indicate a definite weather factor in transmission and prevalence of Covid-19. It is imperative that everyone expect the disease to resurge in the fall and the public must be taught that often until it is widely known to save lives and misery. Beyond that, we must accept that there will be those who simply will not save themselves and be content all efforts were made to save them. But the low 42% vaccination rate must be viewed with alarm for now. Therefore, the Novavax vaccine should be given adequate attention to assure approval and production in time for next fall and winter."

2021-06-14 12:41,"FDA already told manufacturers who were not already in talks about vaccines approval/authorization to basically can it. Electroporatable DNA vaccine from Innovio was one of them, and Novavax should be another. At this point the latter doesn't offer any benefits over those already approved (except adenovirus-based ones like AstraZeneca or J&J/Janssen), has middling efficacy against new variants, uses the same antigen (2P-S protein), is more difficult to produce and reconfigure than mRNA vaccines. With Moderna testing and producing boosters like mrna-1273.351 to deal with new variants (gamma and those with sameset of mutations), why would we need the back-looking one? If one wants a virus-like nanoparticle vaccine, Canadian Medicago is ready to go with plant virus-based vaccine (Novavax is a protein nanoparticle one made in insect cells). 
As for non-redundant vaccines to bring into circulation, we should look at multitope ones, targeting different SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19 proteins - such as US-Taiwanese UB-612. Russians have decent success with similar (although less sophisticated) multitope EpiVacCorona. These provide better restriction of emerging mutants going forward and are easy to mix and match to meet the challenge of new strains."
2021-06-14 13:37,"Covid has been a shot in the arm for advancing the technology of vaccines. This is a third novel vaccine platform. First, adenovirus vectors, then mRNA, now recombinant nanoparticle vaccines. This is going to play huge dividends for our health down the road and opens in roads to better gene therapy, new vaccines (eg, HIV), and personalized cancer treatments. In the end, we will save more lives with these technologies than lost due to Covid by an order of magnitude."

2021-06-14 11:55,They should start developing a booster. The Covid virus is here to stay and an annual booster will help in keeping it in check.
2021-06-14 14:22,"As with many of the trials,  the efficacy rates of the different vaccines are a little misleading.  Pfizer and Moderna had high efficacy rates primarily because they did their trials only in the U.S and in the Fall of 2020 during a down period in cases, whereas, in addition to the  U.S., Astra Zeneca and J & J conducted trials in Europe and other countries where cases were still high and variants were starting to take hold, hence, their lower efficacy rate numbers.  In order to get a better idea of the effectiveness of their vaccines, Novavax should really be doing the same thing.

In any case, what is most important is that they seem to be all equally effective in preventing serious illness."
2021-06-14 14:22,"We need to get ahead of the curve. By the time a multi-valent booster that includes targeting Beta is available, Delta will be the dominant strain globally. By the time a MV booster that includes targeting Delta is available, some other one will be. The FDA needs to at least fast track MV booster trials for all companies that can produce them. The mRNA vaccines can be synthesized to target new variant in a matter of weeks. We are still in an emergency."
2021-06-14 14:30,"Novavax is a more established technology.  I didn't want to wait for it, but it would have been my first choice.

I think at least some of the vaccine holdouts might go for it with the novavax.  So they absolutely need to offer it in the US."
2021-06-14 14:32,"Crank out these and all other vaccines at scale and deliver them wherever people are sane enough to vaccinate, mostly abroad it seems, and as fast as is safe. Spend whatever is necessary: money well spent. Warp Speed II: same idea.

We need to outpace viral evolution with mass vaccination. It’s as self-interested as it is altruistic. Helps others; projects soft power. 

In this case, you can’t even tell the difference between self interest and saintliness. All roads other than insanity lead to the same destination.

Yet still we fail. Bodes well for carbon, doesn’t it?"
2021-06-14 14:45,"This article was very interesting to me. It was good to read about how hard our scientists are working to try and keep us safe. I am sure making a vaccine for a new, and fast spreading virus is very difficult. Scientists know very little about COVID-19 and they still keep on making many different vaccines to keep us all safe. 

It was good to hear how they are making this new vaccine and when it could be ready. in the article it says it may not be in the US for a bit considering Europe needs it more. The US is struggling, but, is smaller than Europe as a whole. This vaccine is most likely the strongest and most effective vaccine of them all. It will help the people be safer. 

Though, they probably tested this vaccine on only fully healthy people, but what about the people that aren't that healthy. How will the vaccine effect them? Will it harm or help them? They need to test all of that then see if it is safe and healthy to give this to the public?"
2021-06-14 14:55,"There are holdouts who are willing to try the Novavax vaccines as it seems to have less severe side effects than the mRNA and the vector vaccines.

2021-06-14 14:34,"One of the anti-vaccine talking points has been that the current vaccines are ""experimental gene therapy agents.""  It might be reassuring to at least a few people that Novavax contains no genetic material -- if that had been their excuse, it doesn't apply to this one.  (Of course many of them will just find a different excuse.)"
2021-06-14 14:57,"While this is very positive news the lack of domestic need coupled with the suggestion this new vaccine be used in more ""needy"" countries suggests the US needs to proceed with caution.

Exporting, particularly donating, this vaccine without also using it at home could lead to accusations that the US is ""experimenting"" on other peoples.  

As the article notes, this Novavax vaccine has efficacy rates similar to those of Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines.  Both of those prior doses also seem to have some efficacy against variants such as the Delta -- albeit the science remains unsettled.  It remains to be tested whether Novavax's version is also effective against Delta and other variants.

Perhaps what we really need now is for the drug companies to focus their future efforts on developing both ""booster"" doses and new concoctions that will be even more effective versus current and future variants.

My expectation is that ultimately, each year as is the case with the flu vaccine, we'll get ""shots"" to protect against the quickly-evolving Covid virus.

That is now the area that needs the greatest degree of concentration."

This is one that should be brought into the fold, for sure."
2021-06-14 15:38,"The Novavax vaccine may not be needed in the United States but whe demand for effective vaccine world wide is immense. The At present, Russian and Chinese vaccines have efficacy and production problems. Emergency authorization makes Novavaccine available quickly and the world market is assured. Delaying it use until the fourth quarter when deaths are soaring world wide makes no sense. The United States provided a huge investment that made the vaccine possible. It should now distribute it world wide. As the CDC has said, until the world is protected we cannot stop the pandemic."
2021-06-14 15:52,"Move quickly to approve in the US. Then work hard to distribute around the world, especially where cold-chain requirements make it difficult for the earlier successful vaccines. Approval in US is really important so all can see that we're not shoving a ""lesser"" product into poor countries."
2021-06-14 15:54,"Novavax is a unique technology and an interesting one.  There's no adenovirus involved like with J&J and Astra Zeneca. Your body doesn't make the antigen, it's in the shot along with just a protein structure to hold it.  It's pretty clean so it wouldn't be surprising if it's relatively free of side effects.  It needed more development work than mRNA but it definitely wasn't a waste of money to develop it."
2021-06-14 15:37,"As a physician and public health epidemiologist my spouse and  I are waiting for the Novavax vaccine. Its design is simple: a dummy virus of spike proteins that the body has an immediate immune response to. There is no endocytosis into the cell cytosol, or mRNA translation to spike protein or exocytosis of spike proteins needed before an antigen response takes place. 

The protein sub unit design has a track record: the Hepatitis B vaccine Recombivax HB and Shingrix. The bottom line here is this is the only SARsCoV2 vaccine that does not ultimately use the cell to manufacture the immune response antigen through a series of steps. Its simplicity is what appeals to many of us who understand the complexity of intra and extracellular reactions and functions. Its favorable cold chain requirement certainly make it ideal for administration to hard to reach populations. 

Novavax should get EUA here in the US as the FDA is seen as the reassuring authority on safety by many nations, although I question that. Novavax should seek FDA EUA authorization of NVX-CoV2373, use in the US, with immediate widespread distribution internationally. What is good for us will then be seen as good for other less developed countries who may not want our discarded vaccines."
2021-06-14 15:54,Congratulations to the Novovax team. This is great news for all!
2021-06-14 15:57,"This is an EXCELLENT vaccine! My spouse and I are both over 65 and participated in a clinical trial in late December. We experienced only the most minimal reaction at the injection site--a bit of soreness when palpated or flexed but really nothing. We have two virologist friends out of state who have naturally been tracking the reports all along with interest--and they concur that Novavax confers excellent protection, even against variants. 
""The vaccine I'd love to get if I had a choice,"" one summed up. ""You're lucky to have gotten it.""
What peace of mind to know we are nit a danger to others! For the first time in 18 months we were able to fly to our 3-year-old grandchild!
Not to share it with the world as much as we  can possibly afford would be immoral and ultimately self defeating. Why let this demon destroy the world's economies, destabilize governments, and grant it free range to evolve more resistant variants? Strike now and hard, together!"

I don't know that much about the medical situation of very many people,  so I think there may be a significant number people in their situation. Given the reports in this article of fewer side effects from the Novavax vaccine, I think it has a place in the U.S. vaccine panoply."
2021-06-14 16:48,"At this point, with 4 very good vaccines available and 1 soon, what is now important is how long the protection persists. Usually, strong T-cell response correlates with longer immunological memory, and I think Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are the leaders. Of course, two-shot vaccines may have advantage in promoting longer immunity, however in the future single booster shot each year could be more than sufficient."
2021-06-14 16:48,"Please, NYT, reconsider how to report such news. 
This is the first article  I've seen  in the whole pandemic that reports efficacy in a sensible way, although it presents the important news as a a secondary way. 
Let's review: according to a sentence ten paragraphs deep in the article, this vaccination, like the other three widely approved in the U.S. are ONE HUNDRED PERCENT effective in preventing even moderate disease, let alone death. 
Yet way up in the sub-headline, we see ""90%"" efficacy reported. 
Having had to learn during a pandemic what scientists mean by ""efficacy"" in such studies, I beg the media to report the important news. 
With so many people hesitant about vaccines, it would do a world of good to report, ""No one died, no one even got very sick."" That's pretty persuasive, and true. 
Please report the news that makes sense to report to the general public, not the science-study version. Thanks."

2021-06-14 17:10,"It is unfortunate that Mr. Zimmer did not mention some salient facts the NVAX vaccine that place it as primus inter pares (first among equals) in the Covid vaccine saga. The most important difference is that only the NVAX vaccine contains a tested adjuvant, a proprietary lipid substance that has been shown to significantly boost immune responses. In particular it augments cellular immunity via T-cells that can remain long after humoral (antibody immunity]wains. It is very likely that the NVAX vaccine will confer longer lasting immune responses against COVID and become the booster vaccine of choice. Furthermore, the NVAX vaccine technology easily permits a combination of vaccines (eg. Covid & flu) in one shot. As an aside, their Flu vaccine, while not yet approved for use has been shown in phase 3 trials to be superior to the standard Sanofi egg-based flu vaccine.
Covid is here to stay just as the flu is, and a vaccine containing multiple viral antigens will be significant should prove significant in future fights against Covid and influenza as well as other viruses that are lurking under cover."

2021-06-14 18:13,"While the country may be awash in Covid vaccines, there is a severe shortage of vaccines that the unvaccinated will take. Many do not trust unproven technology that was rushed through trials. Novavax is an excellent candidate to get a portion of this population on board and vaccinated. This includes a sizeable group of medical professionals.
It is a tried and true approach, protects as well as the others and has limited side effects. Of the 5,000 who dropped out during the US trials when EUA's made other vaccines available, many had actually received the Novavax vaccine during the trial, but dropped thinking they had received the placebo. 
The current administration should do more to get this vaccine out and available in the US. To date, they have only been a hinderance to this vaccine. Making this vaccine available only leaves one excuse for those who refuse to get vaccinated, which is they do not believe in science."

Time to stop making excuses for these people.  If they have been able go out, without masks, and buy booze, then they surely could have stopped at the drugstore along the way and gotten themselves vaccinated. We should not be stockpiling tens of millions of doses for all the unvaccinated fools, just in case they come around to wanting to protect their own lives. Vaccine manufacturers are producing enough vaccines every week to accomate the trickle of later-comers if and when they show up. No need to stockpile for them.  We should be shipping all excess vaccines to countries where people want the vaccines but can't get them.  The availability of the Novavax vaccine underscores the urgency of refocusing the attention of US policy makers on vaccinating the world."
2021-06-14 22:08,"The Novavax vaccine sounds wonderful.  It's a shame though it has taken them so long to get to this point and they are still seemingly quite a ways from getting approved for use in the US.  In the meantime, I am so grateful for the opportunity to get the Pfizer BioNtech MRNA vaccine back in March/April.  Experienced no more side effects than I had for the Shingrix vaccine (very minimal, just feeling a little tired for a day and half as a result of the immune system working as intended).  The peace of mind that results from being fully vaccinated is a beautiful thing especially for older folks like myself.  

If the Novavax vaccine proves to be a more effective booster or to provide more enduring protection than the other vaccines that would be great too.  I think the FDA should approve it for emergency use in the US as soon as practicable unless there is some compelling reason not to which does not appear to be the case.  I also think the FDA should hurry up and grant regular non-emergency approval to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.  It seems pretty clear there is no compelling reason not to given the millions of doses administered with no (or very few) serious  side effects or complications."

So how about giving a vaccine mix in both the prime and the boost shot ? Targeting more than one antigen in the prime shot and boosting the response to those same antigens."
2021-06-15 2:09,"Research with Novavax in mice and baboons went up on BioRxiv last June. It is a full-length Spike with an adjuvant that increases the immune response, which notably involves helper T cells in the lymph node follicles. These cells activate B cells in the same follicles the virus may attack during natural infections. In the culture vat, Spike is made by insect cells to ensure it will have the appropriate carbohydrate side chains, and stabilized with the proline substitutions Pfizer and Moderna had used for their corresponding mRNA-encoded products. It is additionally stabilized by altering the furin recognition motif so the host enzymes won’t cleave it while it’s being “discovered” by patrolling immune cells. An early concern with the mouse experiments was a form of antibody-dependent virulence enhancement that would have nixed the vaccine but didn’t occur.

Best wishes for this new vaccine. It might be a good idea to use it in South America and Africa during the southern winter, before strains evolving there migrate north later in the year, though I don’t know how long it will take to authorize and set up factories.

One answer is that the dog cannot tell the situation has changed and needs to learn that the world is now different.  The dog needs to learn the new circumstances and so you see a learning curve in the opposite direction (aka extinction).

Over 15 million people a day are getting vaccinated with vaccines that are comparable to our Johnson and Johnson vaccine.  For the most part the people have a choice in China which vaccine they take. You can simply walk over to a local hospital or clinic, which are all over the place and get your vaccine. The only people who can travel into China right now are Chinese citizens, special visa holders who are mostly business people who have serious business interests there with listed companies, and permanent residents. They have to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival which is the same as the US was doing up to now. People wear masks when they go to the large train hubs, airports, etc. but locally they don't. There is no national mask mandate. When the government locates an outbreak, they immediately shut down an area, isolate and test. Standard procedure. By September the US and China both will have this Covid situation done. Look for a mutual opening up soon after.

Parts of Britain have decided to extend lockdown restrictions because of the spread of a new, highly contagious variant first detected in India known as Delta.   This past week, the government tightened its travel rules, including for the fully vaccinated.

With all that being said, I tend to read and pay attention whenever another outbreak occurs, especially when it involves a highly contagious variant.

This notion that being fully vaccinated will definitely keep me safe from harm is ludicrous, especially at my ever increasing senior age.

There isn't a medical professional I know who strongly believe that this no mask, continue to meet in large groups is dangerous and this virus will return with a variant vengeance down the road. No one is our of the woods yet.

2021-06-09 18:58,"Apparently, the little rights and freedoms accorded to its people (and maybe even its big businesses) by the Chinese government has its positives, e.g. the relatively short duration of China's Covid-19 outbreak crisis. About 16 months ago, I watched in amusement TV images of some citizens being literally dragged (one or two invertedly!) back into their residences to help contain virus transmission. ...
     
Today, with the temporary exception of India, Canada’s government allows non-essential air travel to and from Covid-19 devastated nations, notably Brazil. While the airlines benefit from continued ticket sales, I’d venture there’s little or no public interest in permitting such unnecessary air travel. It does, however, create further risk of Covid-19 variant importation.
  
I believe that when the coronavirus crisis began, big business was the most influential voice to have the ear of government, when it should have been the independent health-sciences community. The result was resistance against an immediate halt in non-essential travel, including international flights — weeks of delay that may have translated into many additional and needless COVID-19 deaths. 

I've heard many people ask why there are/were travel restrictions on car trips in Canada while international flights are/were basically unhindered? I say, perhaps that’s because car travelers, unlike the airlines, don’t have very potent lobbyists in the nation’s capital, a.k.a. Parliament Hill."

Over 800 mln COVID-19 vaccine doses administered across China

More than 800 mln doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in China as of Tuesday as the country steps up its inoculation drive.

A total of 808.96 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered, according to the National Health Commission (NHC) on Wednesday.

At least 70 percent of the target population in China is expected to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by the end of this year, said Zeng Yixin, deputy head of the NHC, during a recent interview with Xinhua.

[ Domestically, about 20 million doses of 5 Chinese vaccines are now being administered daily. Internationally, more than 350 million doses of Chinese vaccines have been distributed. ]"
2021-06-09 19:50,"Hate to say this, but we have states and rural pockets where very few people are vaccinated. Or people who are partially vaccinated — only one of the set of two or had COVID, think that suffices.

Then there are the little ones not vaccinated yet. And the UK is finding out about the one variant they have and young people getting sick now.

We have a tenuous, temporary COVID reprieve. 

Add underlying medical issues and geriatric persons in household. Yes, we’re still masking when in enclosed spaces."
2021-06-09 19:44,"I am as much a critic of the totalitarian regime in China as anyone, but this has a whiff of the classic American desire to declare victory - in keeping with the finest tradition of Trump’s Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross saying - on January 31, 2020 - the pandemic in China will be great for the US economy. It seems after over a year of bungling, some Americans just need some news to tell them that America has “won” the epidemic after all."
2021-06-09 20:11,"My real concern is that even in Illinois, we are just now edging above the 50% level, and the daily doses are dropping.

Even worse, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a native of India, made GBD or natural immunity without vaccine early last year. They all supported that India achieved natural immunity before the latest outbreak and countless deaths. They have never apologized.  

While I hated the draconian rule in China and disliked wearing masks, we have to be open to evidence from the world. 

Being conservative is not always wrong!"

Once there, travelers must spend at least two weeks and sometimes three or longer in government-supervised quarantine, even if they are fully vaccinated.""

At least on this front, sounds to me like China is doing things about right. I wish we had two weeks of government-supervised quarantine for anyone visiting the United States, and I wish we'd had that policy in place starting in February 2020.

As for: ""Foreign businesses have worried that those limits on international travelers could snarl their plans."" Inconvenience for international travelers is pretty low on the world's list of concerns right now."

By focusing on scapegoating China, we have on both conscious and unconscious levels reinforced the perception of China as ""other"". I believe that this has been part of the reason that our response has been so delayed and inadequate. Remember the ""relief"" when this hit Italy because then we would get some ""real"" information and see how a modern Western nation could successfully deal with Covid without resorting to the ""draconian"", ""totalitarian"" and ""Maoist"" strategies employed by China. Then to our astonishment and horror, we saw this thing literally steamroll Italy. Oops. It really doesn't matter what China publicly said, they gave us a step by step playbook of how to handle this. What they did to contain and mitigate was literally visible by satellite and based on sound reasoning and science. If we did not see them as ""other"" we would have appreciated the severity of the threat sooner and would have followed their, now proven, strategies. We are blaming them for our own failures and continuing to do so will jeopardize the global cooperation that is required to deal with this and future pandemics.

The fact is that China's vaccines are just as effective as Pfizer or Moderna, and more versatile; they protect against mutations. NYT should admit this."
2021-06-09 20:49,"God help us if there is an alien invasion :-)
The world reaction to the pandemic is a good preview.

The virus is not going away until this is dealt with at a global scale. It still is a wonderful opportunity for everyone to come together and build a template of cooperation that can be used for the other impending disasters like climate change and ecological extinction of species..."
2021-06-09 20:51,"People are reluctant to take vaccines. It is the same everywhere.  NY Times reported yesterday that Houston Methodist Hospital put about 200 medical professional on alert since they don't want to take shots for one reason or another.  Not to mention that China has about 1.4 billion people. It is very difficult to convince the majority of people to get a jab in their arms since China pretty much has been free of virus for sometime and people's lives are back to normal already.  Why bother?

Luckily, Guangzhou is not one of the most important and traveled cities in China.  Its neighboring Shenzhen is. Foreigners normally go to Hong Kong & Shenzhen for business and high tech products.

But once you are there and overcome the initial hurdle of observation period, you are born free to go places and have fun."
2021-06-09 21:00,"Nothing unusual about here beyond some strange China bashing. 

The reaction to the breakout is very similar to what happens in Australia and New Zealand. None of the countries that have  eliminated the virus are complacent about the Delta variant and the key remains to have zero tolerance for any outbreak. ￼￼￼That means instant lockdowns and surges in testing."

Whatever else anyone might say about China, this quote leaves me with a sense of awe and admiration for the determination of the Chinese people.  While we talk about our ""freedoms"", we've lost almost 600,000 lives in pursuit of our right to NOT have to wear masks or protect others by protecting ourselves."
2021-06-09 21:03,"With a population of 1.4 billion, China has only administered 800 million doses. Even if those vaccinated had already had two jabs, just around 400 million peple would have been fully vaccinated. 
Once again China’s statistics are too good to be true - it has  a total of some 91,300 confirmed infections, and  the death toll stands unchanged at 4,636.
Early this year, both China and India tried to outdo each other in their vaccine diplomacy by stepping up their contribution to poor countries.   
That China has been spooked by a rise of Covid-19 infections since May sends a signal that Beijing must do everything possible to get the pandemic under control, for the sake of hosting the Winter Olympics in February 2022. Imagine the schadenfreude in the West if the event were cancelled. There had been calls to boycott the Olympics due to China’s handling of the Uighurs."

Has the NYT attempted to confirm this claim? 

Over a 3-day period, this would require processing, testing and administering results for an average of 260K people per hour 24 hours per day; tens of thousands of testers working around the clock, presumably in hundreds of facilities. 

Certainly China has a ""can-do-anything-it-puts-its-mind-to"" reputation, but this statistic gives me pause."

2021-06-09 21:23,"So many people are missing the forest from the trees. The only way to ever really deal with the pandemic was, is, and will be vaccines in 70-80% of the population. That's it. 

It's true that Australia/NZ/China can take draconian measures to limit infections: lock down entire cities, make people get tested, etc, but who really wants to live like that? 

As Aaron Carroll wrote earlier this week, covid won't ever go away. Epidemiologists think that after enough time, it's likely that it will become more like a common cold and less like the current disease. We just need to get local case counts to the point where we have an acceptable level of deaths. As Carroll wrote, in a normal flu year, 100 people die on average/day. We've accepted that risk for decades, and the same will be for covid. 

For all of our problems in the US, we have rationally accepted that covid won't be eliminated, and there here will always be some deaths, even with 70-80% of the population vaccinated. To lock down a population every time there's a small cluster of infections is ridiculous and, quite literally, inhumane. Time to face reality and just get on with normal life. 

And yes, we absolutely have to prioritize vaccinating the entire world as best as we can."
2021-06-09 21:48,We must support Australia in its quest for a full independent enquiry as to the origins of this virus which has killed millions and left economies and lives ruined. The WHO has proven itself not to be fit for purpose in this regard. China may be a commercial powerhouse however it's plagiarism on the back of a distorted regime that is Communism will never allow it to flourish in the long term. Not one state in history has ever survived such controlled fiefdoms - China will be no exception.
2021-06-09 22:02,"I'm in Shanghai.  I may have been in China too long, but I believe that this country's lockdown measures and entry restrictions are effective, that they will get a handle on the Delta variant before it spreads further, and they will inoculate 70-80% of their population before the end of the year."

Lines are up to five hours long during the day and in high heat 95 deg+ and high humidity. He has had a 2-vaccine course, but has no idea what vaccine he received. You do as you are told, or else your phone tracking app, which is required, has a red classification and you can’t go anywhere unless you can show a green status on your phone app. You can’t get on transportation or get in the door of a store. About all you can do is buy fruit and veggies from a street vendor. 

I’m glad the Times is now reporting about the vaccine escape even in people with Pfizer. I’ve been hearing from a friend in Singapore that Pfizer vaccinated are still catching the Delta variant."
2021-06-09 22:34,"Well, well, well.  Looks like the ""variant"" that news reports increasingly are attributing to some gain of function experimentation in a Chinese lab is coming back to bite.

Because China is run by a totalitarian regime, we will never, ever know the truth.  

About anything that goes on there."
2021-06-09 23:14,"Leaving aside the politco/ideological chatter I would imagine that what concerns the Chinese authorities most is that the current outbreak is attributed to the Delta variant.

China has only to look at nearby India to understand how dangerous such an outbreak can be.  Particularly given both the relatively low current vaccination rate and the questionable efficacy of the Chinese vaccines in dealing with it.

I have no sympathy with those Commentators here who find either schadenfreude glee or outright hatred.

Whether Chinese or American, anyone who gets Covid deserves help and understanding.

This is a global pandemic ravaging through humankind.  We would be more successful in fighting it if we worked together than in engaging in ridiculous internet snarkiness and sniping."

Why wait until the second-to-last paragraph to report hard numbers on the outbreak?  China is so far ahead of the US in handling its outbreaks, that the Guangzhou outbreak wouldn’t even be considered an outbreak in the US!  China’s vaccine numbers (both efficacy and people vaccinated) are comparable to the US.  China has used its government to directly confront the crisis in a way that the US has refused to do because of anti-government ideology and pro-business limitations on government that rule both parties. 

So why such negative coverage of what’s happening in China, rather than just giving us the facts?  Only the NYT can answer that…"
2021-06-10 1:03,"The community discipline that is required to beat this thing until vaccines get the job done does NOT have to be imposed by government. It can also, and SHOULD, derive from community spirit and partnering with government against a common enemy. 
Just because an effective epidemiological control strategy has been implemented in a draconian, totalitarian way, does not make the strategy itself draconian or totalitarian. I mean, just look at that lovely Jacinda Ardern (the Prime Minister of New Zealand). No-one could call NZ totalitarian. They just implemented Epidemiological Control 101. It requires a lot of organization and expertise, hence government. But the necessary community partnership comes from within the community itself.
What is a real shame is that so many people seem incapable of recognizing that an effective epidemiological control strategy can work in a country that isn't totalitarian. It's like they just don't WANT to recognize it. Or they've been dangerously misled."
2021-06-10 1:00,"As a foreigner in China I can speak to an utter wariness about the travel restrictions and am really questioning my future here. There is alot of pride and smugness here about the Chinese covid response, a response made possible not by the superior nature of Chinese people but by an authoritarian security state and previous experience with pandemics. From the beginning I wondered how China could ever consolidate its zero tolerance response with a world that is either unwilling or unable to do the same. Meanwhile, China wonders why the rest of the world resents its 'leadership,' a country that truly only seems to care about itself, deeply insecure and controlling of any narrative that shades the state. While I can tolerate ham handed propaganda coming from the state, I can only roll my eyes when I hear it coming from the educated people I work with here. All to say, if China closes its self any further, to foreigners to media narratives to the benefits of real diversity... I will not be able to live here. Or in other words, if these restrictions do not change by next year I am most certainly leaving."

UK cases have seen large jumps the last few days, even after AZ vaccination, yet only the Mongolian case increases post-Chinese vaccination is getting ""increasing scrutiny."" There was an Indonesian real-world study of a Chinese vaccine showing very high rates of efficacy; that study was nowhere to be found in western media outlets.

I am sure this outbreak will be brought under control but I don't expect to read about the success in the New York  Times."
2021-06-10 7:01,"This article is misleading at best. 

1. Starting with the title: no, China as a country has not returned to strict limits; it is one Chinese mega-city (Guanzhou) that sees new restrictions. 

2. The ""new outbreak"" is totally overblown: there are no more than a dozen cases a day. Guangzhou's actions are similar to measures against other flareups in the country. Similarly, Australia & New Zealand all copied the Chinese method to control similar situations with good results.    

3. Chinese vaccines from Sinopharm and Sinovac are both approved by the WHO for emergency use, just like BioNTech, Moderna, AZ, and JJ. Excellent real life results have been reported for these vaccines in large parts of the world (e.g. Brazil, Indonesia, Uruguay, etc.). See one such example reported by WSJ on May 31. Problem seems to be the low anti-body level after only one shot.

4. Unlike the US, vaccine hesitation in China basically disappeared: about 20 million doses have been given on a daily basis for several weeks now. Despite a late start, the country has now given nearly 60 doses per 100 people, approaching the level of the EU and exceeding levels in other countries with low infection rates by a wider margin (e.g. Australia and NZ). China will have have much higher inoculation rate than the US this fall.

It was a gift to us —our culture or filthy Mongolian hordes bent on imposing the will of their emperor on our children and enslaving our people. The reality is China is a menace in regional sense and we should guard against importing too much of their authoritarian tendencies here.

This may require subsidies and toleration of higher costs, but public welfare burden will drop as locals can get better jobs. The parts of the former base that are important but no longer economically viable in the developed countries should be moved to seriously underdeveloped countries e.g. Africa, South America to help improve their economies and reduce immigration flow into the developed countries. All of this may help induce the Chinese people to reconsider their internal compromise with the current government.

The theory of an accidental leak from a lab has not been disproved, however; it would be in China's interest and the world's interest for China to allow a fully transparent international scientific exercise to either validate or invalidate this possibility. 

Meanwhile, if the effectiveness of the Chinese vaccine were somehow deficient, it would also be in the interest of the international community to work with China on improving their ability to immunize the population properly.

During the worst phases of covid, while I noticed a lot of white people not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, and assumed that most were reality-denying Trumpie idiots ""protesting"" the ""hoax"" and asserting their ""FreeDUMB"", I also noticed a lot of Latinos and people of color not doing same, most of them not appearing to be affluent, and couldn't understand why, since most probably weren't brainwashed cultists like the former were.

2021-06-14 18:06,"I know many will blame the ER physicians who sent Jesse Ruby home, but what those commenters don’t know is that triage in those emergency rooms was tight at that time.  There were not enough nurses/respiratory therapists or beds to go around. 
It is the other tragedy of Mr Ruby’s passing. 

Condolences to his family.  He sounds like he was an exceptional person who made a  turnaround of his life and will leave behind a positive legacy."
2021-06-14 18:19,"This is a tragic story about a good man too early taken from his family, friends and our country. 

I also note a few worrying trends. First, the role of obesity and its related health problems. Many people photographed here are overweight. Second, healthcare access and wellness options (including affordable access to healthy foods and nutrition), which are low for lower-income families. Third is an economy which makes it easier for white people to hold the jobs that allowed them to work from home during the pandemic. And of course, easy access to vaccines, which has been a problem in many communities. 

As long as anyone is susceptible to Covid or it’s variants, we all are. And as long as anyone is vulnerable because of an unequal health care and economic system, we all are."
2021-06-14 18:05,"Recently, there was a vaccine promotion during an Hispanic event at Cesar Chavez Park in Sacramento. They had 16 voluntary health professionals and 500 doses of Pfizer/Biontek.  Despite a 3 hour effort with Spanish speaking health professionals, they were only able to convince 15 people to get a vaccine. Hundreds refused the vaccine!"

While we can all pick apart their actions before infection, we truly do not know where he contracted COVID. Thousands people of all backgrounds wereinfected this year, and many of these have no idea where they came in contact with the virus. This family deserves our sympathy. I hope they get vaccinated and encourage their friends and family to get vaccinated too."
2021-06-14 18:33,"Using statistics to (heavily) imply that a virus targeted people based on their race is some the clumsiest reporting I've ever seen from the NYT.  

Statistics don't lie, and this disparage between infections and deaths (and the ages of those who died) between races and social-economic status is something that needs to looked at and addressed.

However, that said, statistics don't tell the whole story, and neither did this article. You can't solve a problem just by pointing it out, you need to address the underlying issues that caused it."
2021-06-14 18:55,"I live in Silicon Valley, in a relatively affluent area of Mountain View. During the winter months, at the peak of the pandemic and before vaccines were made available, even to seniors, there were regular organized soccer games in one of the local parks.  It was surprising to me that, although white and Asian visitors to the park were fully masked up, the Hispanic visitors of all ages, playing or watching the games were 99% mask-free.  Was this a deliberate choice or lack of targeted information? There were, and still are, signs all around the park reminding visitors to mask up and maintain social distance."
2021-06-14 19:07,"Existing health conditions, income level, occupation type, location of residence, age, and educational level are factors highly correlated with Covid19 rate of infections and deaths. Unfortunately, not following public health mandates and recommendations is playing fast and loose with a very smart and lethal virus that does not care one bit for whether a person meets or exceeds the above social factors."

My daughter had seen a free uber ride for vaxing and signed the checker up on the spot.  Low vaccination rates are often due to such problems in lower income areas.  Riverside County is also an example of the inopportunity of both vaxes and rides to vaxes.

As tragic as an individual story is, Santa Clara county's population wealth is  vastly first generation, earned, not inherited, based on talent and very hard work along with some luck. There is a hand to hand combat for tech talent, but there are way too many people wanting to landscape and the charges have been relatively stagnant for over 20 years - leading to overcrowding. The first generation does not expect equality, but opportunity for their children. The public school system is failing to equip the next generation, even where high per pupil spending has been tried to fix the problem. Quick check on STEM proclivity by age/ethnicity tells the story.  The disproportionate Covid impact is indeed sad...."
2021-06-14 19:55,"Since so many people are saying obesity and ethnicity are to blame, did you ever think deeply about why Americans are obese? And no, it's not all about self-control and not necessarily about ethnicity/ race. 

A significant number of Latinx people in the US are of Mexican background. It may surprise some Americans that the original Mexican diet of rice, beans, veggies, and not too much meat (sometimes due to poverty)  is relatively healthy. It's when Mexicans immigrate to the US and their children are born here that the diet becomes less and less healthy and more and more obese. This is also true of some Asian groups although as time goes on, Mexico and other Asian countries are being dominated more and more by a US-like diet full of US-imported/ influenced soda, fast food, meat, etc. so the differences are less. 

This question has not been entirely worked out yet but it might be something in the way US food is grown, produced, processed, manufactured. It may have to do with the way we package our foods (plastics) or the way we store it.  The NY Times should do an article about endocrine disrupters and other chemicals  in our food (and water) supply and the effect they may have on obesity. 

Also, wealthy people have the time and money to buy and prepare higher quality foods. They also are able to pick less stressful jobs and sleep more. All of these qualities also impact obesity rates."

2021-06-14 20:12,"Another opinion based on cherry picked facts. I have worked 6 days a week , every week since this pandemic started. All our employees are recent immigrants from India , Sri Lanka and the Phillipines. Out of 200 employees , one died after contracting Covid early on from an outside source. We masked up early, disinfected the factory with alcohol daily and educated our employees. We had about 25 employees get sick, all from contact outside the factory. All through this pandemic I watched many many people flaunt healthcare professional's advice, no masks, gathering with others, and even now, a refusal to get vaccinated. After surviving this pandemic I have developed a very low tolerance for anyone not following the rules and have no sympathy for those who died because they were just plain selfish and ignorant. It was not "" survival of the fittest"" it was survival of the informed. All our employees are minimum wage earners and we have not experienced this magnitude of sickness and death that this article portrays.
This pandemic is by no means over but you wouldn't know it by this article or the hundreds like it talking about maskless shoppers and travellers. More variants will emerge,more will get sick and more will die."
2021-06-14 20:22,"Tragic, no doubt, but he made the crucial mistake of visiting a household, by the description a crowded one at that, of a person person who had just been hospitalized for Covid.  That was very careless.  By doing that, he and his girlfriend most likely exposed their household to Covid.  
What on earth were they thinking?"
2021-06-14 20:24,"I hope they realize that 50% of the 600,000 deaths from Covid could have been avoided had Trump taken the Pandemic seriously.

2021-06-14 20:38,"My son is 36 and attends a day program because he is mentally disabled.  (he lives with me and my husband and we are his legal guardians)  He was vaccinated on April 1st (the first day he was eligible here in CT.)   
All of the employees at his program were eligible back in Feb and March, and many refused it then and some continue to refuse the  vaccine now.   One of the supervisors  told me that the employees who are refusing the shot are minorities who are skeptical of the vaccine.  In our area, there have been numerous outreach efforts at  local health depts,  local grocery stores, and local churches;  (all on the busline)  and still some refuse the vaccine at my son's program.  Everyone at his program is still mandated to wear masks.  Personally, I think it's very irresponsible for these employees to continue to refuse a vaccine when they work with a segment of society that have pre existing conditions and underlying medical problems."
2021-06-14 20:38,"16.5% of the U.S. population is over 65 and they accounted for 80% of covid deaths. The lives shattered, couples separated never to see one another again, many in financial ruin. That is the story of covid my friends. The young people that got covid mostly survived (99+%). Yes, there were exceptions, but please don't forget our elders. The whole thing is heartbreaking."
2021-06-14 20:56,"Some 100 years ago, two of my great uncles and a great aunt died of tuberculosis while still in adolescence.  
The infection first hit one of my uncles and the family, acting out of pure ignorance, believed relatives could not infect each other.  They all died.

My grandfather, born in 1896, had married and moved away when the tragedy struck.  

Decades later he still mourned the loss of his siblings.  He acknowledged that the deaths were the product of ignorance, which itself was the product of poverty and an absence of education.  They lived in rural West Texas and were not offered formal education.

""We just did not know better,"" my grandfather said.

It's disconcerting to see so many posters suggest that the victims should have known better and, thus, in some twisted way deserved to die."
2021-06-14 21:00,This is what happens when you treat health care as a privilege rather than a right.   I would like to see the relationship between those with health care and those without.   Zip codes which are differentiated by income will always show the poor suffer more.   We need universal health care as a right and then revisit this or similar studies
2021-06-14 21:11,"Aside from risk factors (weight, diabetes, etc) and having to work in the public/not being able to take time off, I wonder how many wore masks and when they started.  China knew and said (but it was just a blip in US news) that 80% of early infections were within families.  It wasn't until after the election that Birx said family members who work in the public may want to wear masks when home with the family.   Then there's the issue of no N95 masks available to the public - which they are now.   

Our country was led by an incompetent man who turned the best defense against transmission - the mask - into a political issue (even though Trump was first to say we could use scarfs/face coverings).  Many deaths could have been avoided had we learned from other countries."
2021-06-14 21:20,"This is a sad tale.  However, it is clear that social issues were major contributing factors.  Where was Ms. Herreras partner that fathered her children?  Perhaps, if he was present or able, he could have helped out.  The article states that’ll he had several high risk health factors and drank excessively.  Surely that did not help.  Perhaps if Ms. Herrera took her and his health situation more seriously all of this may have been averted.  Covid has forced all of us to realizing we must be health conscious and active in controlling bad behaviors."
2021-06-14 20:54,"Very tragic to lose loved ones! My heart goes out to these folks. Yes, obesity is a factor, many have Type 2 Diabetes without it being diagnosed, because they work at minimal jobs without healthcare. Often in the poor inner cities there are few if any grocery stores that sell fresh fruits and vegetables, so the diet of poor, Working Class Latinos and Blacks is awful! Add Covid-19 and it’s a complete disaster. Unfortunately, some of the Latinos bought into the “this is a hoax” lie from the former guy! They continued to gather with friends and family, refused to wear masks! Unfortunately, they have died in large numbers. 

We need to do a better job or educating kids about nutrition, handling finances instead Algebra! Let’s give Americans real life information and education. Also, I blame Trump completely for his incompetence and the lies! He has the deaths of over 600K Americans on his hands! I hope there’s a hell for him!"

2021-06-14 20:43,"My guess is that the higher occurrence of coronavirus among Latino-Hispanic Americans is due to the fact that they are much more prevalent in the ""service"" industries where they must come in contact with lots of people.

Related to that is the fact that being lower wage earners than most Americans, they live in greater numbers in smaller spaces, hence being more vulnerable to infections diseases.

This country has yet to understand and appreciate how much it's  economy and prosperity depends on Latino-Hispanic people.

Instead the Republicans are busy at work in suppressing the voting rights of the whole segment of the electorate that is poorer than the entitled white class.

Shame on them."
2021-06-14 20:54,"So...COVID did NOT unravel black families, Asian families, Native American families, white families?

2021-06-14 21:17,"Hispanics have suffered many more cases than would be expected based solely on their proportion of the population, at 28.8% of all cases vs18.5% of the population. In the US, parent and working age persons suffered over half of all cases, so one might infer that Hispanics stayed on the job. Think: service and agriculture. 
CDC case ethnicity data (url below) is only available for 62% of all cases, and 82% for deaths. We always know more about death counts than cases because deaths are mandatorily reportable and cases are not. 
As to deaths vs population, this was surprising. Hispanics suffered 18.7% of all deaths vs the 18.5% of population. Given their much higher case counts, case fatality rates appear much lower. That's good news. 
For Blacks and Whites, proportion of deaths vs proportion of the population were closer, one to the other. 
Blacks: 12.2% of the population suffered 13.7% of deaths but relatively fewer cases at 11.3% of total cases. 
Whites: 60% of the population, 58.6% of all deaths, and 50% of all cases. Clearly white privilege reduced the proportional number of cases but their case fatality rates seem higher. 
Fatalities per number of cases: for Hispanics, 1.533%, Blacks 2.87% and Whites, 2.76%. But, these might be high given that overall US deaths/#cases have averaged 1.80% using other data (Hopkins).  BUT it does suggest Hispanic deaths/case is notably lower.

2021-06-14 21:08,"We lost a wonderful woman who had served as a surrogate grandmother for our kids. Her own daughter had convinced her that the virus was all a Democrat hoax and encouraged her to go to church and otherwise socialize without wearing a mask. We have lost other friends and relatives as well all of them having refused to wear a mask. The only left leaning person we know who has died was a woman in her 90's with severe dementia, who died very early on in the pandemic before masks were being mandated.

We live for one half of each year in each of two different counties in two different states.  One had nearly 100% compliance when people are shopping or working and the other has very little compliance. The death rate per capita for the non complying county is about 3 times as high as the complying county."
2021-06-14 21:19,"This story is heartbreaking and made even more so because the transmission was preventable if the family had adhered to local guidance of social distancing.  This death was not caused by someone being forced to do essential work, the article reports that it was caused by a visit to a family member's house.  That is not racism or inequality transmitting this virus, that is just negligence on their part and not following well publicized guidance (which was the law in California).  It is tragic.  And the continued lack of urgency to get vaccinated among many Hispanic/Lantinx people (evidenced by the much lower vaccination rates despite multiple free locations for vaccinations in California across all communities) continues to be baffling."
2021-06-14 21:32,"I see continued resistance in younger Hispanic men when it comes to vaccinations. Of course, I only have anecdotal data. My landscape architect has had a crew working to redo my backyard in the past few weeks and, when asked about vaccination, the older men were vaccinated but younger men were mostly not vaccinated even in the cases where they were father and son. The dad is vaccinated but the son is not and was citing that “the vaccine is not good” as the reason for not getting vaccinated. The county has made abundant access to vaccines for anyone and they are doing lots of outreach. 
This implies that unless the misinformation can be counteracted, the trend continues. This can only change when community leaders from within step up and drive change."
2021-06-14 21:29,"The amount of judgement in the comment section of these individuals' lifestyle choices is astounding: ""They're overweight"" ""They visited sick family members"" ""They refuse the vaccine""

NYT readers lean democrat for the most part, and then they're shocked when hispanic voters start switching to voting R? These types of comments and judgements are the exact reason why they're switching. 

A little more empathy towards their situation: from recognizing their lack of access to healthcare, long hours at low paying jobs, to common multi-generational / crowded housing due to high rent prices would go much farther towards persuading them to get a vaccine as opposed to a keyboard lecture from someone who has had the luxury to work from home during this pandemic."
2021-06-14 22:03,"I think the Hispanic poverty rate is larger than the white's poverty rate, this is probably the reason why their death rate during the COVID-19 is way higher than whites and Asians. The article mentioned some Hispanics live in homeless communities because their income is lower than the median income of most Americans. most of these people don't have medical insurance, when they get sick they have nowhere to go. This is really easy to cause the widespread of COVID-19 around their communities. I feel really bad for those people that lose their family during the COVID-19 If the vaccination could come sooner maybe everything would be different, fewer people will die. At last, I want to say to every NYT reader, stay safe!"
2021-06-14 21:39,"It is hard to draw conclusions about racial disparities from the available data. Why? Because so much of the conclusions start with infection rates, but the infection rates used are known to be too low for every group, but by unknown amounts.

E.G. Black people comprise reported cases at 2.0x the rate as whites, but have 2.3x the death rate. Certainly blacks fared worse than whites. But what if their real infection rate is 3x that of whites? That would imply that their health outcomes—if they had the virus—are better than whites.

Higher infection rates imply more about living conditions, jobs, social behavior than medical access. It is especially likely that undocumented immigrants were less likely to get tested, or report cases, or seek treatment than other groups. Thus their true incidence of infection is probably misstated by more than for other groups.

To a certain extent, self segregation—the tendency to live with people most like you—also drives disparate outcomes as a contagious disease spreads. A few carriers can infect large, homogeneous communities.

Not saying it isn’t tragic, by the Times continuing to harp on racial disparities without exploring why that might be, is getting old."
2021-06-14 22:10,"Please pay attention to the intersections of race, class, immigration status, and ethnicity. I am certain that the data bear out that non-White Hispanics passed away from Covid at a much higher rate than e.g. White Hispanics."

He did something he should not have done visiting someone that has been diagnosed and they had been told to stay away.
So all the prior text of the article about having to work low paid jobs, being tight in houses, and having no insurance has NO RELEVANCE on what happened here.
Wonder how many others have this same story but are pleading that other factors are to blame???"

Doesn't this very same publication preach that Covid is color-blind? That anyone can get it?"

The person they visited was not the person who tested COVID positive. It was the husband who was then in the hospital. The wife who cancelled the dinner is not described as having had symptoms or having been tested. No information is given for her status. Other than you know she resided with the person who tested positive and was hospitalized.

I am pretty sure variations on this theme happened all over. Either persons didn’t understand or were lulled into complacency by the familiarity.

2021-06-14 23:05,"While so many are ignoring several major factors that contribute significantly to the number of deaths from COVID in the Hispanic population in the US, let’s look at the situation in India. There were recently large scale religious gatherings that were packed.  Political rallies that were also extremely crowded, along with cricket matches that had huge crowds attending.  Most households, markets and public transport in India are crowded.  There is wide spread obesity and diabetes.  So far, it is believed that millions in India have died.  Both India and American Latinos have largely ignored social distancing recommendations.  Both groups have high rates of obesity and diabetes.  Both groups suffered grievously in the pandemic.  Individual behaviors will need to change.  Diet modification is challenging, but doable.  Avoiding gatherings and other crowded venues is up to the individuals.  At this point, getting vaccinated must become a priority."
2021-06-14 23:15,"Sad story. Income inequality is at the root of this problem. It's not really about cultural differences.  More hispanics are poor.

With greater income, many different things happen that also help prevent the spread of COVID.

1. Ability to live on your own, and not within large households of extended family. 

2. Ability to eat a healthier diet, and not be reliant on cheap, fast, calorie dense foods.

3. Ability to quarantine, because your job is not as a front line worker and/or you have reserves to help cover your expenses if you limit hours.

4. Ability to attend higher education to understand the importance of science and health mandates, and be able to process information from various sources.

5. Ability to have access to healthcare and sound health"

In addition, the messaging of our country from the CDC to the president and to others was ambiguous about masks. I live in the state with the lowest vaccination rate, I just shake my head at the denial that is going on in our country about the vaccine. We should be at 90% vaccinations and we're at 43%.

I know what it’s like to live in an immigrant family, sleeping 2 or 3 to a room in a small house.  And everyone working more than one job. 

It isn’t a surprise to me that poorer people would suffer more in a pandemic.  
The history of human plagues shows that those living and working in close quarters with others are more likely to die. 

Add in a modern economy with thousands working in windowless warehouses and packing plants breathing each other’s air for long shifts and one can see how this would unfold. 

Records from plagues in ancient Rome tell of the wealthy escaping to their country villas and the poor left in crowded cities to suffer and die. 

We all thought we had evolved well beyond this history."
2021-06-14 23:26,"Here in the tiny northern Virginia, defense contractor zone, cul-de-sac where we are, there has been a steady coming and going of Hispanic folks — doing the lawn maintenance, cleaning the homes, walking the dogs, fixing the gutters, rehabbing the turned over townhouses before sales, gutter cleaners, many of the DoorDash, PostMate delivery drivers, the Lyft/Uber drivers, FedEx or Amazon deliverers, even the mobile dog grooming trailer, etc. Literally almost every one.

But there are a few residents, too, the ones with diplomatic plates on the BMW …..

Informal, hyper-local survey suggests considerably increased vulnerability for Hispanic folks.

2021-06-15 0:19,"Maybe the hospital would have admitted Mr. Ruby otherwise, but sent him home because it had too many Covid patients sicker than he was at that time, and not enough nurses and doctors to care for them all. Hospitals were rationing services during repeated waves of the epidemic, and triage was an unacknowledged reality that led to some deaths. That’s why I think it’s important to take advantage of the current lull and get vaccinated. The downward trend in Utah hospital Covid censuses has leveled off, with chances to start going up again, especially after schools open and cold weather returns.

These Covid deaths were sad when we didn’t have a vaccine to prevent them. It’ll be a crying shame if we continue losing lives because of people underestimating the virus. Hispanic inoculation rates are lagging nationwide and in Utah. No good reason for that now; the shots are available free at clinics such as Intermountain and U of U."

Why expose yourself to the virus when you know your odds of being able to withstand it aren’t great? Does this supposed study the NYT has done correct for prior health and/ or poor lifestyle choices?

We have to have some perspective.  San Jose was NOT the city of choice for the tech titans.  It became the choice, within the last six years.  The countless San Jose residents' volunteer and unpaid government commissioners  efforts and work to make San Jose beautiful and better was devoured by Google.  It literally devoured the entire area where the volunteers and the city/council and commissioners developed rolling gardens and large navigable paths for bicyclists and joggers. There is only one city in San Jose.

Why San Jose?- the fantastically easy to get to airport. 

We have a housing crisis in America but more concentrated in urban areas.  California has a housing crisis.  Frankly that is not being monitored. 

The Indians of the continent India and rural or urban Hispanic or Native American populations have one thing in common, insecure housing.  

Indians are accustomed to being outdoors, for extended periods of time.  The medical idea that the Covid-19 and its many variants are only transmissible in a closed space is challenged by the Latinx laborers of California who work outdoors and by the raging Covid-19 infection rate in India."
2021-06-14 23:36,"I am interested in whether or not the ""researchers"" have tied obesity to the deaths of Hispanics.  I observed, early on in the pandemic, what seemed to be a vast majority of those who were not seniors who died were obese.  My guess is that obesity and lack of mask wearing, by the deceased and by those who share homes with those who died, are as much responsible as any other reason for their deaths.

I am disappointed to read critical comments about Mr. Ruby when he did not have the same freedoms that I have enjoyed.  Out in the real world he had to live with the fact that the virus was rampant.  In the end it felled him - and that was sad and unfair.

My doctor has discussed weight loss with me.  Her comment was ""easier said than done"" and ""weight loss is extremely difficult"".  (She favours bariatric surgery).  I can also state that weight gain is  not always a result of self indulgence.  Some of us have slower metabolisms and more of a tendency to be fat.  

Mr. Ruby was a normal person in a world where the virus was not fair.  He succumbed to it at a young age.  Comments that essentially say it was his own fault are unfair.  He was a human being as important as any one of us.  His loss is a tragedy."
2021-06-15 0:41,"Great reporting on a tragic death.
As for the comments, some are revealing in a way the posters don’t imagine."
2021-06-15 1:51,"The amount of blame on Mr. Ruby's dietary and ""lifestyle"" choices are shameful. I challenge the readers to find a nutritious meal on a low wage salary. By all indications in the article, Mr. Ruby was a hard worker who even worked overtime in order to gain income for what appears to be a very meagre existence. How then was he supposed to find nutritional food at low-cost?"
2021-06-15 1:28,"This pandemic revealed a major deficiency in our tools: we can’t compel people to act and, oftentimes, can’t get to them to explain what needs to be done. Many people aren’t tuned in to the news. They don’t read newspapers, watch TV, or listen to news on the radio. This pandemic, many “never got the memo”.

For much of the pandemic, the media focused on the “disparate impact” on various groups as though there was some nefarious plot. The message should have been “If you are diabetic and living in a large family group, this virus is coming for you and your family. You need to be especially careful. Minimize contact, wear masks, wash up, pay attention to the news.”"
2021-06-15 0:57,"The misinformation campaign by right wing media hurt poor people the most. 

If you are wealthy you might be convinced that masks and vaccines are nonsense, as you go to your well ventilated workplaces and a few social events. 
And if you are unlucky and get sick, you will have a medical staff that cares and medicates your earliest symptoms- like the care received by some politicians this past year. 
And if you want to be really naughty, you can tease everyone about the covid hoax- but then quietly put yourself first in line for the vaccine. 

If you are poor and working, you will be exposed to thousands of possible infections- many, many more times than people who are better off and have options. 
It’s a numbers game, and your odds are far worse if you are in a position like Mr Ruby. 

This is what public health is supposed to do: distinguish where risk is high and tell people if they are high risk and educate and deliver and follow up on the preventative measures. 

Rather, we’ve had cynical politicians, television media and social media saying it’s a violation of freedom to have sensible health measures in a pandemic. 
And the poor have consumed these messages to their detriment."
2021-06-15 1:27,"It is so sad that people want to blame an innocent person for their death in a pandemic.  All one has to do is put themself in that person’s place or their family’s place and imagine what your thoughts would be then. There are obese people worldwide and its not nearly as much people’s fault as it is the fault of what has happened in society: fast food, hormones, preservatives, cheap food that those who do not have enough wealth, often rely on to make their meals. Combine it with less access to good health care when you are poor, of color, or speak a different language and that accounts  for more illness and death. And by the way, I’ve never met anyone who wants to be fat. I’ve met plenty of people who try to lose weight and can’t. Or do and can’t keep it off. Stop blaming and shaming and lets have some respect for the dead and some sympathy for the grieving family. Yes, obesity is a risk factor for severe Covid. It doesn’t mean the person deserved to get it or that you shouldn’t sympathize or blame them."
2021-06-15 2:35,"Isn’t it pretty obvious from the photos that these individuals are severely overweight which is one of the biggest risk factors for covid? What are the rates of obesity among the Hispanics vs other groups? This isn’t poverty, this is cultural and culinary preferences that lead to obesity which among other issues turned out to be a huge risk for covid."
2021-06-15 2:52,"There’s a big issue with the comments here not quite understanding the cultural reality (and knowledge gap) that this story shows. They visited not because they didn’t realize they could get sick, but because they trusted the person they visited & valued time together (and comfort that seeing a sick family member can bring). Im doing a pandemic impact study right now with this population in a different county and I have heard over and over -we didn’t stop seeing family, you know you know everyone- you trust them so it wasn’t a problem.— A lack of understanding about disease spread (they all talk about washing hands and being careful right after saying this) plus this cultural norm of family comes first equals a disaster within a disaster. And we can’t expect these families to know better when the public health response was all over the place, not uniform, AND when so few actually watch the news in our country. Maybe if instead we could have gotten prime time tv and influencers to explain why they needed to stay home/not see eachother— but we didn’t and so people died."
2021-06-15 7:04,"These are very good people but the virus doesn’t care - so if you don’t vaccinate and mask and social distance consistently you will get it - and overweight people often die from this virus- they need to be especially careful.

It’s not a race or culture issue- we all received the same information over and over and over again.  

I am sorry for your loss."
2021-06-15 8:01,"Here in California, we have definitely seen the impact of COVID on Latinix families. There have been numerous cases of pregnant Latinas delivering babies while infected, and dying shortly after, leaving children motherless. We also have seen that jobs in agriculture and food production, such as those here in Merced County, put workers at high risk and led to deaths."
2021-06-15 10:14,"Yet another in a string of stories by NYTimes fostering race divisions. The virus does not recognize race.  I don't think it looks at the color of the skin before impacting. 
It affects everyone and the impact is higher in people with co-morbidities, living conditions unhealthy lifestyles, lack of access to health, and a variety of other factors. 
It may boil down to two factors - educational attainment and income (poverty level), not necessarily race/color of your skin. 
Other brownish folks - South Asians, for example - in the US may have done better, but the story is different in their native countries."
2021-06-15 5:38,I walked in a park during the peak of the pandemics. Everyone was wearing a mask. Except for one man sitting on a bench and speaking Spanish on the phone.
2021-06-15 5:09,"I know families of five living in a apartment in home in less than 1000 sq feet.  I know 2 families that have 4 kids sleeping in a bedroom. I live in a suburb that has 3 families and 15 people in a 2 bedroom, 1000 sq ft rental. Increased mortality of Covid deaths could be caused by living, working, and previous health conditions than just race. 

In Ohio, there are shots available for anyone willing to make a call to get one,  within days.  Are people unable to get a shot in America based on race?  I would like to read an article why millions of minorities are not getting vaccinated now, not why more minorities died months ago.  The same for people undocumented in this country. We are exporting shot to other countries because of surpluses.  That should be the headline."
2021-06-15 6:24,"I find this article really confusing— we only find out at the end the cause of Mr. Ruby’s severe COVID disease and death— diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol. Contributing to this is poor access to care, and general lack of understanding of how sars cov 2 is transmitted (ie you do not go to someone’s home who is sick). Is this the typical experience of Hispanic working class in California or US? Why was there so much discussion about the homeless? Mr. Ruby was not homeless. Hispanic working class are not homeless. This family was not living in a tent (and doesn’t seem like addiction and mental illness were at play), rather had a strong network of family and friends— which was sadly a contributing factor."
2021-06-15 5:53,"Interesting quirk to this map.  I live in zip code 94303, which spans two counties -- Santa Clara and San Mateo.  I wondered for a minute why the map showed Palo Alto with a higher than average Hispanic population.  Palo Alto is almost entirely White and Asian.  But the San Mateo side of the zip code is heavily Hispanic.  The COVID infection rate there has been much, much higher than in the Palo Alto side of the zip code.  For many reasons this zip code needs to be split along county lines, but the Post Office refuses.  They say zip codes are only about delivering mail!!"
2021-06-15 11:55,"I was full of sympathy until I got to this part 

""But Ms. Herrera and Mr. Ruby stopped by for a brief visit, and then the virus raced through the two households."" 

Yep. They did this to themselves. Most of us have avoided family for the last 18 months. My parents and brother abroad are yet to meet our newest addition that is now 15 months old. 

They gambled and lost. It is indeed sad, but was entirely preventable."
2021-06-15 12:06,"Just looking at photos of many victims, overweight seems to play a part.  Diabetes or pre-diabetes also.  Diets high in carbohydrates are common in the community of Mexican descent.  A lack of adequate medical attention in the early years also plays a part.  A child whose weight is allowed to get out of control is ripe for diabetes and heart disease later.  These facts, and many others, are known.  Yet we continue to oppose universal health care which would address these problems early.  We sow what we reap.  Among poorer communities lack of knowledge plays a big part.  If minorities are to become majorities, the health of the nation is at risk, health and economics are closely linked."
2021-06-15 13:01,"It would add validity to the study of ethnicity's effects on the deadliness of the virus if you removed patients who had a previous condition that compromised their likelihood of surviving the virus.  The man who was the exemplar in the article had three pre-existing conditions that contributed to his death.  So often, I've read articles of people who have died who were obviously obese but described as young and healthy.  I think the emphasis should be on economic details of the group rather than ethnicity.   Poor people don't have access to good health care.  That's a fact that cannot be denied."
2021-06-15 14:30,"I live on a small tree-lined street with two and three-family homes - many - such as ours - are situated in close proximity and use a shared driveway -- 

We live on the top floor of our house - Directly across from us lives a large Hispanic family - working mother, three kids - grandmother, aunts, etc -- along with a constant stream of visitors and young sleepover nieces and nephews - 

We share the back area with the two garages - and our back porches are separated by less than ten feet -- 

The Hispanic family has been living here for about eighteen months - Not once -- NOT ONCE - did I ever see any of the adults or children wearing masks around the property -- in fact - the only rare times I ever saw any of them with a mask was when they were going to the supermarket - which requires a mask for entry - 

The kids were outdoors playing all the time - the elderly women and caretakers were in and out - while having visitors and other relatives - and they occasionally had big parties with lots of people -- NONE of them wearing masks - 

New York City has a very vigorous public-health initiative regarding covid safety - such as masks and vaccinations - which includes outreach programs to the large Hispanic population here -- 

And yet - many Hispanics still CHOOSE to ignore the warnings - 

Claiming ""fear, ignorance and superstition"" are not valid excuses - because even many educated Hispanics still CHOOSE to shrug their shoulders and pretend everything is okay ..."
2021-06-15 4:40,"The author should be more careful when mixing ethnic identity and race.

""Hispanic"" isn't a race, it's an ethnicity. Many Hispanics are White, many are Black, many are Indigenous, many are a mix of the three (Mestizo, Mulato, Zambo).

It's like contrasting English speakers with Whites."
2021-06-15 5:36,"Isolation was critical for this virus to not kill. 
Unfortunately, when it happened, the socio-economic conditions were so unequal in some communities (Black and Hispanic, particuarly) that we were unable to adapt quickly enough. Lives depended on daily interactions.The mother with Alzheimer's we had to care for, the sick, elderly aunt, the  unemployed sister with children but no food unless someone cooked for them, all this and more impacted the Black and Hispanic communities, the poorest in the US. 
The inequality of wealth AND the inferior health care system contributed to why this impacted us so fatally. We can look at other factors. ""Isolate."" ""Do not come close to each other. Wash your hands."" But the disease struck too fast  for many of us to COMPLETELY  absorb the reality. The human mind takes time to TRULY absorb an invisible danger, like a virus. ""It CAN'T be as bad as they're saying,"" we tell ourselves. Only to discover, it CAN be that bad. And we discover it far too late. THAT was the danger here.

As an old, Black gay man, I saw the same thing happen with AIDS in San Francisco. It took the gay community nearly 18 months before we realized, ""THIS IS VERY BAD."" Straight American didn't learn from our pandemic. They ignored us. (Some weren't even born then, so how could they know?) But some were, yet ignored ""the gays."" What a tragedy.

2021-06-15 13:52,"A good man with 3 underage children and no life insurance. 

Every day I am asked to help someone’s go fund me.  Often I participate as it is something I can do.  However I don’t ever see myself doing the same as I am probably overly insured.  Am I the only person who plans for the worst and buys insurance?

So many of these troubles were avoidable.
Vaccination, masking, social distancing, life insurance. This life style of we will deal with it as it comes to pass with no planning and no preparation and no structure or organization is what is really killing Americans."
2021-06-15 13:29,"""Researchers have long remarked on the social networks and expansive family ties that help explain why Hispanic Americans tend to be as healthy as, or healthier than, white Americans. Hispanic Americans have high rates of diabetes and obesity but live longer than white Americans, despite lower average incomes and educational levels and reduced access to health care.

But the phenomenon, called the Hispanic paradox, has not held up during the pandemic. A recent study in Health Affairs found that 70 percent of Covid-19 cases in California where race and ethnicity were known had struck Hispanic individuals, though that group makes up only 39 percent of the state population. Hispanic Americans also accounted for nearly half of the deaths from Covid-19 in the state.""

------------------Sounds like those strong family ties and a reluctance to get vaccinated worked against Hispanics in the case of Covid."
2021-06-15 4:03,"Not to in any way diminish the importance of economic circumstances and healthcare here, or even those who see attention physical health as an factor, but there are serious studies unfolding daily revealing significant correlation between genetics and morbidity. In some sense, failing to address this might cause the best intentions to muddle our understanding of what makes a particular group more vulnerable to covid morbidity. We may not have a definitive correlation yet but studies like that published in Nature are showing significant correlation. Recognizing how economically vulnerable groups may indeed be victims of severely inequitable healthcare and vulnerable as ‘essential’ public facing workers is important. But attention to DNA and vulnerability is extremely important as well."
2021-06-15 0:05,Enough of the stories that focus on race and ethnicity in the COVID context. Hispanics are no more or less impacted than millions of others worldwide.
2021-06-14 23:38,"Is this really about ethnicity...? Maybe indirectly, but it seems to me to be more about poverty, lack of education, and cultural norms. If it's more important to visit a family member who's got the virus than it is to keep the rest of the family safe - and we all grapple with that - what is the cause here? It's not ethnicity. Not directly, anyhow. I hate to say it's religion, because I would like everyone to practice whatever faith they choose to, but anyone who thinks 'Jesus will keep you safe' is deluding themselves, and putting themselves and their family at risk. That is a cultural thing, not an ethnic thing. It crosses ethnic boundaries."
2021-06-14 16:33,"Mr. Ruby was clearly an amazing person. But COVID  doesn’t care about that. It cares, however, if you are obese and have the problems associated with it. Hispanics may have avoided some of the perils that come with being overweight prior to COVID ( the paradox mentioned) but whatever protections they had against the slow killers that target the obese,  were overcome by a disease that killed the overweight in  extraordinary  numbers and with unbelievable rapidity. Being thin didn’t protect everyone, of course. There were a very very small percentage of young healthy weight people who were felled. But on a percentage basis it’s no wonder the mostly whippet thin Silicon Valley elite were almost universally spared."
2021-06-15 11:12,"""But in places like Australia, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, infection rates and deaths were kept relatively low with border restrictions, public compliance with antivirus measures, and widespread testing and contact tracing."" Don't include Japan in that mix. There is no widespread testing and contract tracing in Japan. Japan's COVID-19 tracing app failed miserably and gave the country the equivalent of a digital black eye given its reputation for cutting-edge technology and innovation. Border controls, definitely. When I returned to Tokyo in October 2020, my local district emailed me for 10 days and asked how I felt and what my temperature was. All these months later, the population is weary of voluntary states of emergency and the 3 Cs policy to avoid closed spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings. The Suga government, IOC, and the Tokyo Olympic Committee have imposed their collective will on the vast majority of Japanese who do not want these Olympics. The last thing the authorities seemed to ever want was an accurate assessment of just how many are/were infected because that would have put the Games in jeopardy. The Games are full steam ahead now, with even the G7 Summit Communiqué last sentence including this: ""reiterate our support for the holding of the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 in a safe and secure manner as a symbol of global unity in overcoming COVID-19."" I very much doubt that global unity is priority one to holding the Games."
2021-06-15 11:28,Unmentioned is the fact that certain vaccines administered in Asia and other nations are simply not as effective. Both the Chinese vaccines and Russian vaccines are not nearly effective as the vaccines in Europe and America. It is not surprising that outbreaks would occur in China based on that alone.
2021-06-15 11:07,China struggles because CCP knows that they don’t have a good vaccine.

2021-06-15 11:18,"The turtle wins the race again. Amazing how over 15 months ago Covid-19 was ravaging the U.S. Our country was led by a man who publicly ignored this threat and touted bleach as a cure while infections and death reminded me of the daily deaths reported during the Vietnam and Middle East conflicts. Yes, we were at war, similar to the London bombings where we had to shelter in place. 
President Bleach did make one good decision with Operation Warp Speed but I suspect he just got good advice but he still did not take it over the goal line. Joe scored the touchdown. 
America is back. When you have a capable leader who rolled out 100mm vaccines in 100 days, the current NATO visit clearly demonstrates that the rest of the world wants to be led by America."
2021-06-15 10:44,"Please, no strutting and chest-thumping about how the US is returning to ""normalcy"".   This so-called return was paid for by the lives of 600,000 Americans.   There is nothing ""normal"" about a loss of this magnitude.   What is much more moral, and normal, is the low death toll in the Asian countries."
2021-06-15 12:06,"The lesson here has really been obvious all along. When push comes to shove, technology gives the edge in the end. But the places in Asia, especially China, have demonstrated what humans can achieve if they are scientifically informed and able to work in concert. So, the answer was, and still is, ""both"". Think of the countless lives that might have been saved, the suffering prevented, if humans worked together, to follow the science, to help each other through, and then to thoughtfully apply the technology when it became available. Just imagine."
2021-06-15 12:26,"The bottom line, I think, is still that Asia handled the pandemic far, far better than the Western states that have hoarded the vaccines. The US was an unmitigated disaster and what that fact says about American society merits careful consideration. The Europeans did a much better job, but only after failing abysmally, in part because of Western arrogance and a sense of superiority over other parts of the world. When the disease was just emerging, many Westerners underplayed its significance, claiming that modern, WEstern medical systems would handle it easily. They paid the price. It may take a bit longer for Asian states to get back to normal, but they will do so having saved potentially millions of lives that would otherwise have been lost. In the US, Americans just basically decided that making sacrifices for the good of others was too much bother. That typifies a lot of what goes on the in US, including the deficient welfare state and the inability to do anything about guns. One of the other lessons of the pandemic is that states need their own vaccine facilities and that the intellectual property rights on such important commodities need to be waived. Here in CAanda, the vaccines we ordered are finally arriving in the millions and about 70% of the population has received one dose, drastically cutting infection. The govt is investing $200 million in building our own vaccine facility so we will never be dependent on the free market and other countries again."
2021-06-15 12:31,"Yet again another article in a western paper that somehow thinks that there's some kind of equivalency between the public response in Japan with the public response in places like Korea, Australia and New Zealand.  Japan's leaders have been just as incompetent, in complete denial, as the leaders in the the EU and the US.  The Covid stats in Japan are nowhere near the levels of Korea, Australia and New Zealand.  The only reason that their stats aren't as bad as in the EU and the US is that the Japanese are accustomed to mask wearing like most of the rest of Asia."
2021-06-15 12:44,"More than 900,000 Americans have died more than would be expected since the start of the pandemic. Even now, I'll be wearing masks until the infection rates drops further. As a Chnese-American, there are scary problems no vaccines can cure every time I step out of my home. There's no return to normalcy."
2021-06-15 12:44,"This piece really seems to gloss over the sheer volume of dead Americans due to Covid, just saying ""hey, it's all good now tho!"" because you can go to bars. Each of those deaths is not a statistic - it is a lasting trauma for loved ones.
Here in Australia, while we are frustrated at not being able to travel internationally, and annoyed at some state-level restrictions, we have had 'only' just over 900 (yes, hundred) Covid deaths in total. And we are frustrated and annoyed at the slow vaccine rollout here, but we can see the dangers of opening up and letting Covid run free - we just look at America.
Plus there have been advantages. Almost no tourists overcrowding scenic natural areas, renewed activity in local and interstate travel, a turning focus to health and food self-sufficiency, the benefits for many of working from home, regenerating ecosystems in some places due to less human activity etc.
And all this time, other than some lockdowns in Melbourne and the state of Victoria, we have been almost entirely free to go to bars, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, sporting events and live life almost normally, albeit often with masks and a few tracking procedures. 
For many, life here has not been that different - and we've avoided many thousands of unnecessary deaths."
2021-06-15 13:34,"Even if everyone in the world gets a shot, there is normalcy.. If we see this case as the whole, the most important thing is how many lives are saved rather than how long it takes to return to the real normalcy.. Because, anyhow, we still dream of hope to live with our family, friends, and lovers now and after this misery. In South Korea, vaccination rates are still low, but people around me are calm and enjoy their lives within the recommendations. We wear a mask, wash my hands, shop, go to a restaurant and go out to a nearby place. We experienced, discovered and learned so many things through this pandemic. Just a task remains for the future!"
2021-06-15 13:46,"When you compare Australia and the United states, two countries that are the most similar, it is striking how different they have responded to the pandemic. For instance, look at Melbourne, a city of five million, that is in serious lockdown but with just 12 covid cases today.  Boston, a comparable city, has 105 covid cases and five deaths today but has no restrictions, or very few.  
Virus numbers deemed to be an outbreak are viewed differently, it appears.  The goal in Australia is to never ever allow the virus to get out of control.  In America, well, a tragic government and cultural response. 
One could argue, of course, whether Melbourne's response is too over the top.
As for vaccinations and the reasons behind the slowness, the article is correct."

2021-06-15 12:37,"The idea that your going to put an end to corona viruses by trying to vaccinate the entire world is just whimsical thinking.  Variants that arise are the rule rather than the exception, and they will eventually mutate and evolve to avoid the efficacy of vaccines.  What scares me is that the arrogance of science may actually be creating more problems.  Whose to say that by controlling the COVID-19 virus thru vaccines that we are not opening a pandora box of evils with even more virulent corona viruses to take their place.  Study the animal world where corona viruses run rampant and you will see vaccination programs are a hit and miss proposition."
2021-06-15 13:01,"The number one job of political leadership is to plan ahead, forecast, and prepare for what would happen in the short and medium terms.  The political leadership across Asia-Pacific failed miserably given the fact that most countries in the region have experience with MERS and various kinds of bird flu.  Successful in containing the coronavirus initially was not an excuse for complacency.  During the last six months of 2020, these countries should have urgently signed contracts with the drug companies so that they could increase their production capacities based on demand.
Pictures from these countries, especially from SE Asia, show deserted streets and closed storefronts.  People are fearful from venturing out due to lockdowns and fines from the authority.  The economies are devastated.  It will take years for these economies to recover from the pandemic making worse by incompetent governments' response."
2021-06-15 13:29,There is also a “wide gulf with the United States and Europe” in terms of deaths …. the US and Europe top the “deaths/million population” charts. And as far as vaccines go … I think we in Asia will need to wait till you guys in the Global North each get vaccinated 6 times over.
2021-06-15 14:16,It’s not simply a matter of the differences in vaccination numbers between these region. The widespread use of vaccines with less protective capacity means that many parts of Asia will likely need to be revaccinated before reopening.
2021-06-15 12:23,"""The result now is a wide gulf with the United States and Europe."" More to the point, it is a wide gulf with Brazil. In Rio, where I am writing from, 50% of the adult population has received at least one dose, and half of those have received two. 95% of the over-60 population has received at least one dose, and three quarters of those have received two.

This is obviously not thanks to a wildly incompetent federal government, but because the vaccination infrastructure put in place over decades in Brazil is well-oiled. And because political pressure was finally put to bear on Bolsonaro and his equally incompetent financial team, who realized that without vaccines, the economy would continue to linger, or worse."
2021-06-15 13:33,"The simple fact about vaccine, at least in South Korea, is that the government purchased more than enough doses for the entire population in the beginning of vaccine development yet the power nations are keeping them for themselves. This is the only reason America is far ahead, there is nothing to be proud of. However vaccine roll-out in S. Korea has been very organized and smooth with whatever is available, unlike here when everyone was frantic to get an appointment in the beginning. Also nothing will change the fact that over 600,000 people are dead here compare to less than 2000 people dead in South Korea."
2021-06-15 12:07,"How can an article about delayed vaccine access in the Asia-Pacific region completely ignore the fact that there are facilities there with the capability to manufacture huge amounts of vaccine for themselves, but who have been excluded from accessing the knowledge of how to do so? For example, a major vaccine producer in Bangla Desh. Not exactly one of the world's wealthiest countries. The US has gotten out of the way of a temporary waiver of WTO Intellectual Property rights for covid vaccine production but is doing nothing to make it happen. Biden is meeting right now with the leaders of some of the countries still blocking it and does not even seem to have it on his agenda. Instead, the G7 countries have pledged to provide a small (relative to the need) amount of vaccine to poor countries some time next year.

2021-06-15 12:47,"As an American who has lived in Southeast Asia for the past decade, I’d much rather put up with the ongoing restrictions and lag in vaccination availability than I would freezer trucks filled with bodies, 600k lives lost, failing cities (like my former home of NYC), anti-maskers, skyrocketing violence, overwhelmed hospitals, countless conspiracy theorists and a broken government at a time when pro-social attitudes and policies are crucial. 

Let’s not gloss over the appalling tragedy of America circa 2020 and the antisocial, narcissistic posturing which ended up harming millions. 

Wear masks. Sanitize your hands. Get vaccinated. Support your communities. Stop the endless shootings. And please- choose truth and clarity over a “feel good” narrative that helps no one."
2021-06-15 13:23,"America may be headed for the sunlit uplands, but I don’t think I would have liked to go through the valley of death it went through to get there."
2021-06-15 12:00,"South Korea had > 25% of its population got vaccinated at least for the first time, and is planned to reach herd immunity (> 70% of its population fully vaccinated) by this September. They discuss travel bubble with Guam, Saipan, Singapore, Taiwan for fully vaccinated folks this summer and will start allowing spectators up to 4k for outdoor concerts/sporting events starting next month.

Also there was no border closure there throughout the pandemic. The entrants have been subject to 2 week-quarantine, now the government just announced that those who are fully vaccinated and come to the country for family visit or business etc. can get exempted from the quarantine also starting in July.

It seems that at least a few countries in the Asia Pacific can return to normalcy by this fall or winter, except for international travel for leisure while keeping vigil for any new variants (we shall do the same on this matter)."
2021-06-15 14:00,"A lot of people are writing addressing the idea of returning to normalcy - whatever that is.  It doesn’t exist.  Life is messy and full of caprice and it always will be,  if normalcy means the right to pollute, consume, and move about freely without care while spewing CO2, then it is this normalcy that will destroy our planet, our only home."
2021-06-15 12:25,"Alternatively, the focus of the article is really be on the need for the US, UK and others to hoard vaccines due to their gross incompetence in handling the pandemic, not on Asia-Pacific countries responses. 
The US, UK and others are only coming round to live a lifestyle that we in Asia-Pacific have mostly been living for the last 18 months, so perhaps a bit more modesty is in order."
2021-06-15 12:57,"Great to see the U.S.leading the world with vaccinations and recovery.

Maybe it’s because our crash was so severe that the recovery appears unprecedented. 

The threats are still out there though: a delta variant that will infect the unvaccinated and possibly mutate again, many are still being infected and dying every day, a majority of republicans still refuse vaccination and threaten the gains we’ve made.

Too soon to declare total victory; the mop up continues."
2021-06-15 13:46,"Many Asian Pacific countries also took a wait-and-see approach with respect to the new vaccines. Since their viral case and death counts were under control, the governments and the populaces in many places had different risk-reward calculations with respect to vaccination than places where the virus was raging out-of-control. The old saying “There are no atheists in foxholes” applies quite well to the embrace of the power of vaccines in places where the virus was, literally, going viral."
2021-06-15 12:59,"An unwritten factor in this article is the false reporting of numbers in China. Does anybody believe that a country of 1 billion people, often in high density urban settings, actually suffered as few deaths as they claim? The control of the media by the Chinese government has surely led them to underreporting deaths and overreporting vaccinations. That should worry everybody in the region, and indeed the world."
2021-06-15 12:36,"China is different from Japan and S. Korea in that China has virus under control and the other two not.

China is very cautious and prepared in dealing with imported virus especially the Delta and Alpha variants. Guanzhou city lockdown is due to double digit infections. Regardless of its size, local government just wants to nip the buds right in the beginning and won't let it spread out to other cities and countryside.    

China is ramping up its inoculation rates to reach the 70% level of herd immunity. They have three vaccines in mass productions, two of which have been approved by WHO.  Soon they will have other vaccines including mNRA vaccine too.  So far, they have sent out 350 millions of vaccine shots to other countries. It is a vote of their own confidence in dealing with virus."
2021-06-15 11:37,"As an Australian in the US I am absolutely horrified at the Australian response. We have high level scientists, an extensive General Practice/ Family Medicine network, a strong public health capability, universal healthcare and what I thought was a genuine commitment to the community. But we also have a series of Federal and State governments that couldn't organize a one-person car pool, pockets of population like Queensland and Western Australia where the virus impact has been minimal due to 'Im all right Jack' border closures, and a near universal indifference by the media and key public figures. Honestly its one of those rare times its embarrassing to see the Australian response - wake up."
2021-06-15 12:57,"Our fear mongers would have us believe that America is threatened by powerful sinister foreign powers who are invincible. In the 1980s it was Japan Inc and now it is China the new superpower and even the EU. Utter nonsense.  Japan has been mired in a self inflicted recession for decades and the worse thing that can happen to an economic engine in need of workers China is undergoing an irreversible population collapse while the EU has had its brightest star, Britain, severed off its GDP by the idiocy of Brexit. Who does that leave?  Russia?  Russia’s entire economy is supported by fossil fuels which will be obsolete in five years replaced entirely by sustainable energy leaving 146 million of its people unemployed and its oligarchs out of the country holding Western citizenship."
2021-06-15 13:05,"No matter how much I wish the pandemic had never happened, one thing has come out of it: it has thrown into sharp relief the following:

1. Medical care should be a service, not a business.
Before you start about how the ""private sector made the vaccines"" : they did it using knowledge and resources provided by the government. Besides, ut was the ""gubmint"" who arranged for nationwide free vaccination.

2. Hoarding vaccines made us look shallow and petty - like some rich guy buying a seat on a lifeboat in the Titanic. 
India, on the other hand, donated vaccines even when they themselves were in need. Jesus would have been impressed."
2021-06-15 11:54,"Nothing mentioned in this article about the South Asian Continent of India where Modi's incompetency and actions which created ""Super spreader"" events such as Rallies for ""HIM"". The largest producer of Vaccines in the World threw away an opportunity to prepare and resulted in probably more than a million deaths."
2021-06-15 15:29,"Does anyone remember last year, when Japan, South Korea and Australia were being held up as models for us to emulate.  Not that we've done well, but it seems that people who had the chance to do things really right have botched it."
2021-06-15 15:29,It's not directly mentioned but if not for the Trump admin aggressively funding vaccine development and procurement during the spring 2020 we won't be sitting so pretty with vaccine availability. Even Europe was haggling with vaccine manufacturers that resulted in shortage in EU. Let us give credits where credits due.
2021-06-15 15:51,It is clear why these countries have low rates of vaccinations and it is not by choice. The countries that make the vaccines have put themselves at the head of the queue. At the moment vaccination is a zero-sum game because vaccine supplies are limited so many countries are restricting exports.
2021-06-15 15:51,"We have had plenty of time with vaccines now. Personally I think we should reserve right of first refusal for go-forward needs (eg those who can’t get inoculated temporarily for medical reasons like chemo, and for 11 year olds about to age in) and donate the rest to India and Asia."
2021-06-15 15:52,"Pandemic is over in Asia. Move on. Vaccination isn’t the only route out of a pandemic if a virus hasn’t made a difference to a country with

1. Cross immunity from past exposure 
2. Better health overall per capita 
3. Better healthcare with full social benefits 
4. Better weather for the virus"
2021-06-15 15:56,"The vastly different responses to the pandemic and the vastly different levels of suffering world wide show up differences in behavioral modification, the strength of governmental policies and medical systems and vaccines availability. It would seem many countries in Asia kept deaths down in the first waves of the pandemic by their behavior and governmental policies. However, when vaccines became available, it was the West,with its affluence and greater need that took full advantage.

Still, looking at the Johns Hopkins data today, the deaths/100K  remain  in the single digits with the low exception being Vietnam (0.06) and the high exception of Japan (11.15). For Germany, France, US and UK, the deaths/100K are all in triple digits with Germany the lowest at 108.19 and the UK at 191.77.

My hunch is that the behavior and governmental actions that had kept Asian countries safer during the early stages of the pandemic are still helping them at this time. What is increasing their deaths now is likely to be the more aggressive variants.  

Let's hope the vaccines hold strong against the variants. But the UK has started to lock down again, as the delta variants proliferate there. And the UK has a 42% vaccination rate, the same as in the US. 

There are no data for Russia."
2021-06-15 16:23,"So how many doses have these countries actually bought? Even if companies have not been able to deliver the doses yet – isn't it important to ask whether or not the governments sufficiently invested in obtaining vaccines? I'm surprised the article didn't report the amount of vaccines ordered by each of the countries mentioned. 

After all, the United States is rightly lauded for securing more than enough doses of vaccines for its population. Have other countries done the same? If not, why? And if not, shouldn't they be roundly criticized for failing to invest in the one measure which promises to end the pandemic swiftly and efficiently, without extremely expensive lockdowns on economic and social activity?"
2021-06-15 15:32,"Asia is indeed the pandemic champion especially China. Between 1959 to 2019 several viral outbreaks all originated in China.
You can read Wikipedia and other sources for the long list of viral diseases originating from that country. Wet animal markets or a possible lab leak is the source of origin for COVID 19.
Wet animal markets are still flourishing in China and other East Asian countries. I am surprised that no major European country or the W.H.O is willing to put pressure on China 
to let the scientists from other countries to investigate the origin of this COVID virus from Wuhan. European countries even powerful Germany do not want to upset their relations with China either because of fear or trade relations. I am happy that at least President Biden wants to know what happened in the Wuhan lab. Also it is time to close all wet animal markets everywhere this is a disgrace.
Would the W.H.O do it?"
2021-06-15 15:52,"The main difference between the USA/EU and Asia/ANZ is that they latter countries controlled the virus in 2020 in part by scaring the population into believing that Covid was the most deadly virus ever.  

Now there is no way for them to reopen and risk even one extra case without also risking their political futures.  

This is something the “let it rip” countries like the USA, UK and Sweden don’t need to worry about which is why the EU and USA will come out of this year in a much better position than Australasia.  

I don’t pity the Chinese or Australians, they have enough money to lock themselves in forever.  It’s the Thais, the Vietnamese, the Malaysians and the Indonesians that will suffer the most from this zero cases or bust strategy.  Their people suffer untold economic harm so their politicians can claim to have “protected” them."
2021-06-15 16:28,"I am sad and mystified about the vaccine puzzle in Japan.   Yet I sometimes yearn to live there because it's such a safe place otherwise with a low crime rate.   I'm more apprehensive about being beaten up or killed than getting a Covid infection with long-haul consequences, even vaccinated."
2021-06-15 15:49,"Wow, what an absurd piece of classic American exceptionalism and triumphalism.

The per capita death and case rates in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan have been a tiny fraction of America's and most Western countries', and they have had nothing like the sweeping, economy shattering full lockdowns we've had here, especially South Korea, where the economy and many everyday activities have continued with masks and contact tracing from day one.

Yes, they are short on vaccine supply right now.  In 6 months or so they will have caught up and will be emerging from the pandemic with far less of an economic and human toll than the west.

America will never stop thinking of itself as the greatest nation, but among first world countries, it would be the last I would ever want to live in."
2021-06-15 14:22,"Not even half of Americans are fully vaccinated and that number will not rise any time soon. As soon as Delta becomes the dominant variant many many more here will die. Our return to normalcy is a fantasy perpetuated by Government and aided by media. As far as other countries, does anyone on the planet believe that any vaccine producing country will send vaccines out of country if they are being used or needed in that country ? What about the great and powerful CCP sinovac vaccine, isn't that 50% efficacy enough to save their friends ? ""people are fed up "" okay, so go out, get sick and possibly die, what else can be said ?
Here there are governments pleading and bribing people to get vaccinated while the rest of the world pleads for vaccines.
All the friends of China should look to the CCP for vaccines, while our friends will hopefully be getting some asap."
2021-06-15 15:08,"Why are so many Americans anti-vaxxers when vaccinations are safe and will help provide herd immunity to all of us? This isn't a 1st Amendment issue. We've already lost 600,000 citizens to Coronavirus, and this virus is still at large in America. Asia is reeling under the Covid pandemic spread. How will our ally, Japan, fare during their trimmed-down Olympics next month?  No word either on how India, with the world's largest population, will fare under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who bragged his 'mission accomplished' before recent viral surge in his country. As America reopens, will there be anything normal about our country after a year of the pandemic closing our country down?  The new normal isn't normal. We're facing a brave new world."
2021-06-15 15:33,"Everyone is pointing indirectly their fingers on India for today's handling of pandemic. Initially Indian government sent vaccines to other nations only with the intention of saving their people. Never thought that the virus problem would be so severe back in India. If India had not sent vaccines to other nations, the situation in those nations would have been disastrous. Instead of thanking India, now those nations which received Indian vaccines are criticizing India. It is so difficult for any leader to contain the spread of the virus with a population of over 130 crores.  Modi, Indian Prime Minister is working day and night, in saving the people."
2021-06-15 15:12,"Wow, the its all about me crowd in out is out in force here today.  The US is 21st on the list of deadliest corona virus countries. the UK, Poland, Italy, Belgium, Argentina, Peru all had higher death rates.  Spain, Portugal and France are  all in the same quartile at the US.  The only two countries larger than the US; China lied about the death rates and impact while India simply doesn't have a clue as the actual numbers dead.  The EU has had 729,000 Covid deaths vs 600,000 in the US."
2021-06-15 15:37,"We should be careful and not believe the press which usually has a political agenda.
Pandemic is not over, look at the UK, the undisputed champion of vaccinations, shutting down again in summer, supposedly the worst season for the virus.
Let's see how it goes next fall and winter in the US.
Obviously this ""flu"" is a different beast, normalcy may be a world of the past. 
Keep your masks, stay away from crowds, do not travel and enjoy this real Green Deal moment. Less consumption, pollution etc.."
2021-06-15 14:58,"Asian countries were slow in inking vaccine purchase agreements but even if they had, it's doubtful whether they would have received the doses with the US, India and EU blocking exports.  South Korea has at least shown that they are capable of administering doses quickly through their health system. When vaccine supplies increase, Asian countries will be in the same position as the US and the West.   I would think by end of Q3 or end of the year."
2021-06-15 16:45,"""Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga now says all adults will have access to a vaccine by November.""
This is mere political ambition of Japan's PM, basis is nowhere.

Japan's government is still obsessed with basis-less optimistism or overconfidence to Coronavirus since previous Abe regime.

Present PM Suga had proclaimed such as ""never cause pandemic""""defend the lives and health""""never declare emergency again""""improve situation at one month"", but could realize nothing.

They are distracted with vested interests such as economy or Olympics, dislike to spend tax to defend general citizen from Covid-19, and everything were delayed.

They waste opportunity that can learn from success or misstep of other countries, their insufficient response continue to spread domestic Covid-19 damage, number of infected people and victim in Japan are worst as advanced country of Asia-Oceania.

But they are dull that the lives are lost one after another, and don't yet even notice own responsibility.
Besides they still stick to hold Olympics due political or nationalistic reason despite serious health risk."
2021-06-15 16:56,"So, our current 100-400 CoVid DEATHS per day in the US no big deal? Really?"
2021-06-15 17:34,"I find it quite perplexing given that I read through Korean newspapers daily and their headlines boast of their superiority in taking care of their people during COVID. President Moon came to the US begging for vaccines.   We are now vaccinating their army for defense purposes. With all their wealth and advances, this condition tells me they still rely on Western medical research and leadership"
2021-06-15 17:36,"Doesn't take much to get a dog to bark! Last March we had the Western MSM almost cheering that covid was China's ""Afghanistan"" or ""Chernobyl"" - its rise was on the rocks! 

Didn't pan out like that - to put it mildly. 

Now those Asians are in trouble while the US and even the economically stagnant EU soar ahead.

But wait, if the Delta variant can close down Guangzhou...just imagine what it will do in America! The UK, the most vaccinated major country in the world is now heading for a whole new wave and ""re-opening"" has been postponed.  

It will be fun to review this article in, say, three months time!"
2021-06-15 16:43,"Why do people treat the defense/offense approach as an either/or proposition? The US chose an offense only approach (and then only for a portion of the population) while SE Asia and Oceania chose defense alone. Could we not have, say, followed sensible public health strategies while waiting for vaccine development and then rolled out a mass vaccination campaign once it was ready?!?

It’s like the false dichotomy between choosing public health or choosing the economy. We could have had both!"
2021-06-15 17:07,"I think Asia is still the champion. They have shown they can control a pandemic and reduce the death toll until a vaccine arrives. As time has gone on they have refined their approach and found ways to keep their economy running and the people safe. I have seen this first hand both in New Zealand and Guangzhou.
When the next epidemic arrives Europe and North America will repeat their dismal performance, having learned nothing from looking outside their borders.
 There is a need for Asia to become less dependent for vaccine from Western nations because the West will always put their own citizens first. The boost of confidence from doing far better then the nations that used to be looked up to will encourage them to trust their own suppliers."
2021-06-15 17:29,"Went to the gym today in California where almost all mask and social distancing rules are gone starting today. The pandemic feels eerily over in the US, which is bittersweet considering how many other countries are suffering."
2021-06-15 17:35,"When infections spread efficiently through aerosols, vaccines are the only practical solution. If the world had done a pre-covid pandemic immediate shutdown, perhaps we could have nipped this pandemic in the bud. But we didn't, so pretending you can control covid through lockdowns is  absurd. Yes, locking things down can stop localized infection, but in the real world, you can't keep a closed system without any visitors unless you're Australia or NZ. 

Much of Asia made the basic mistake of massively underinvesting in vaccines. In the US and Europe, we did not. It's really that simple. It's regrettable that so many people have died; that didn't need to happen. But we have to look forward and not backward, and the future is rosy only because of... vaccines."

2021-06-15 18:27,"If a country's citizens want their country reopened the they need to convince their neighbors to get vaccinated.  

And we all need to hope that more serious variants don't evolve within the bodies of the unvaccinated hoards of people who refuse or are unable to be vaccinated."
2021-06-15 19:02,"It seems that the obvious answer is that the United States and Europe owns the pharmaceutical and medical expertise as well as the money to buy them and political power to control them.  If you're a smaller nation it's not feasible to develop in house vaccines. Even if you have money, that country's government may not allow their business to sell that vaccine to you (case in point Italy blocking Australia's purchase.)  That's not going to change until the countries with the pharmaceutical companies feels comfortable with supplies vaccine doses to their own people.  You'd think something like this should be public domain shared science, but no it's also about profit."
2021-06-15 17:30,"Oh puhleezeee!!! The world has not forgotten what an absolute disaster the US and Europe were circa 2020. The world has also witnessed firsthand what absolute bullies the US and UK and Europe can be when it comes to safeguarding their own interests. Vaccine hoarding anyone? Patent waivers anyone? Actively scuttling vaccine manufacturing in developing countries so that the US big pharma cronies have an advantage… anyone? 

The duplicity and callousness of the so-called champions of human rights have been revealed to the world. And America for sure has fallen in the eyes of the world. 

The real gulf is between what the American media would like the world to believe about how the US is springing back to normalcy, and the real feeling on the ground amongst your own people."
2021-06-15 17:49,"13,000 deaths so far in Japan.  The population of Japan is 123 million.  600,000 deaths so far in the US."
2021-06-15 18:50,"I wouldn't call China a ""champion"" of pandemic management: their strategy was simply to lie about the numbers, as documented even in this paper."
2021-06-15 19:45,"We cannot afford to just forget about the 600,000 deaths and counting due to Covid-19. Last year when the death toll reached over 100,000 I openly wept. I didn't know of anyone in my family who died of Covid. But I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of souls gone. 

I am now angry at the former guy who shall stay nameless. If he had just followed the science and simple public health guidelines we could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Even now I still can't believe his followers shun the vaccine when he himself and his family took the vaccine...albeit in secret. What does it say about US when we let a mass murderer like the former guy get away with it???

I am old. I want to live long enough to see him held accountable for the incompetence and dereliction of duty that led to this catastrophe. He must be held accountable. He wasn't impaired. He said to Bob Woodward...""I always wanted to play it down""."
2021-06-15 18:52,"Who is addressing the principle causes of pandemics— how illness spreads at a massive scale and swift rate without viable treatment options? Who is architecting human society to truly address these causes? For instance, while vaccines were essential in addressing polio, as important or more important were radical changes in the hygienic capacity of our water supply. We can, yes, vastly improve our capacity to address pandemics when they arise. But even better is a truly global effort to address the actual causes in human behavior and human society that create pandemics. Most of these relate to our lack of respect and unsustainable, destructive— even idiotic (poisoning our own water and air and treating in a disgusting manner the animals we feed our selves with) or plain ignorant— relationship with our habitat, this earth. Who has the wisdom, power and vision to transform our ways en masse?"
2021-06-15 19:59,"According to Worldometer, China had 23 new cases of COVID 19 yesterday; the U.S. had 11,127.  Asian business publications like Asia World and Nikkei Review  reported yesterday that Guangzhou had reopened most of the districts that had been shut down (briefly) to counter a COVID flareup that totaled fewer than 200 cases.  Our World in Data reports that as of yesterday, China had administered 904,134,000 vaccine shots to its people, averaging slightly under 20,000,000 doses a day.

China, for the most part, has been back to normal for about a year now, with a few occasional localized flare ups every couple of months.  So Chinese are not really chafing about constrained lives.  Their lives haven't been constrained for a while now.

On the other hand, today  is the day California opens up.  People act like the pandemic is over and are going back into restaurants and bars unmasked.  Yet, only 46.8% of Californians are fully vaccinated, while the Delta variant makes up about 10% of the COVID infections.  

California may have to close back down again and soon, given the transmissability of the Delta variant and its virulence.   California like other states likely faces a backlash from people who had constrained lives that were opened up for a brief period only to be slammed back into constraint.  

What you get with a neo-liberal ideology that requires  government to be kept feeble enough that the rich can drown it in the bathtub if they so choose."
2021-06-15 20:04,"Any talk about the ""finish line"" for this pandemic remains premature and borders on wishful thinking. What we have learned so far are (1) nations without a robust public health system suffer needlessly grievous deaths plus economic costs and (2) even with effective and widely available vaccines their long-term effectiveness remain unknown. The long trenched warfare between humans and lethal viruses are clear reminders that there are no  finish lines for humans over viruses."
2021-06-15 19:13,"There is only one country in Asia which is holding the Olympics this year and that country is Japan. It is inexcusable for it to be so far behind the rest of the developed world in its vaccination program.

No other country in East Asia is expecting close to 100,000 foreign visitors from over 200 nations in just a little over a month like Japan is, so I can understand their lack of urgency. But, why Japan is such a vaccine laggard while hosting the world’s largest sporting event next month is simply beyond comprehension.

I live in Japan and I still have no clue as to when I can get vaccinated since I don’t fall in the over-65 age group. Many people here, myself included, are terrified of Japan hosting the Olympics with such a low rate of vaccinations.

While it is good that Japan has started to vaccinate those 65 and older, this does not significantly reduce the risk posed by the Olympics, since arguably this cohort will likely not have any contact with the 100,000 foreign visitors arriving in Japan for the Olympics. The people in Japan who will have the most contact with them are those below the age of 65 and they will be at the greatest risk since they will not have been vaccinated in time for the Olympics."
2021-06-15 20:52,"It is becoming abundantly clear that not all vaccines are created equal. When we discuss vaccine campaigns in different countries, it will become increasingly more relevant to know which vaccine is being used. For example, the widespread use of Chinese vaccines in Chile has not produced the anticipated benefit. We are extremely fortunate that in this country the dominant vaccine usage is with very effective products."
2021-06-15 10:57,"Here is an idea.  File wrongful death law suits against The People's Republic of China, with the Wuhan virology lab as the defendant.  File a class action for the 4M or so deceased.  Demand trillions in compensation.  As we have seen, unlike politics - the law is black and white.  And when the defendant does not appear in the District Court, fine, render a legally sound verdict and then seize the assets of the defendant.  Should be easy as The People's Republic and its vassal companies have trillions of dollars in assets in our country."

On the other hand, the United States and Europe have not handled the pandemic well at all. Therefore, their only way out of the pandemic is through vaccines. 

Asia and Oceania have a lot to be proud of. The United States and Europe—not so much. Vaccines are an easy solution. They don’t require any sacrifice. Public health measures like social distancing and mask-wearing require sacrificing for the common good.  

And about vaccine hesitancy. The Japanese people are some of the most vaccine-hesitant people on the planet."
2021-06-16 0:31,"As we’re having a small uptick in cases and hospitalizations in Utah this week, and hard to say whether that’s a blip or the start of another round, I think this notion the US—or anyone else—is anywhere near done with the virus ought to raise doubts. We may be going through booster shots and breakthrough infections and epidemics of the unvaccinated for years to come. Americans returning to life as usual is healthy, of course; people can’t be put into cans like sardines to wait all those years. But we need to get immunized and keep up to date as instructed. It’s a lot more important than it was for the flu."
2021-06-16 0:06,"Although, vaccination rate in Asia is definitely lower than the United States' and Europe's, I guess as an Japanese person that the finish line of outbreaks is not far for East Asia with cultural differences. For example, masks have been ubiquitous in Japan before the beggining of pandemic not to inhale pollen which raises intolerance, so that Japanese people do not mind for wearing mask. Also social distancing, the Japanese can keep it without restrictions. Japanese people do not have a custom of shaking hands as greeting, let alone hugging which is an appearance of a crush for the shy. What is more, the meticulous says that you should cover your mouth with hand not to sprew saliva when you laugh in front of others. In short, Japanese people have been under restrictions before outbreaks, so that lower vaccination rate would contribute to herd immunity in Japan, also in East Asian countries such as South Korea, Chaina and Taipei."
2021-06-16 1:05,"Yes, Asia was highly successful in controlling the pandemic & limiting the death tolls. As a European living in Asia, I  am highly grateful. We embraced the social restrictions, compulsory mask wearing, strict tracing apps, etc, We looked at what was happening in Europe & the US in dismay.
However 18 months later, the Covid-zero strategy of some governments is becoming a heavy social & economical burden. The economies remain stifled (hotel, F&B, etc) & the mental and social costs are high.
As a foreigner living in Singapore we are not able to travel (quarantine of 3 weeks is only for citizens or permanent residents- which many foreigners aren’t), leaving lots of families in very difficult situations (not able to travel to elderly parents or see university children in a different part of the globe). 
Covid zero is not attainable.

A highly interesting article on that subject was published by South China Morning Post.

2021-06-16 1:42,"Over a month ago the medical people I know said they had more jabs than arms to jab.
Our government made a vaccine deal on Astra Zeneca (at the time a gamble) which could, and now is being made in Australia. We don't have the capability yet to make vaccines like Pfizer.
The low jab rate was due mostly to the fact that while where I am there is zero community transmission there is about 5 in a million chance of dying from a blood clot after an AZ jab.
Minuscule obviously but zero risk is zero risk.
Then Victoria went into their fourth lock-down and now millions are booking in. The risks of a vaccine started looking better. I get my first this week, wish me luck I'm not one of the 5. 
Still mine is a first world problem compared to many. Hopefully the world gets over this soon."
2021-06-16 9:36,"We here in Thailand would love an opportunity to refuse a vaccine. Sadly, we are stuck in mud or glue, waiting for something, anything, to arrive to stop the third wave of a pandemic that never seems to end. A few are given vaccine, and then the pipelines runs empty. Appointments are cancelled not because of refusals, but because supply has run out. This goes back to the lack of urgency mentioned in the article. In a widely cited interview, the head of a group that developed an mRNA vaccine at Chula University last year said he had to wait six months for funding. Given that Thailand for several months last year had no new cases and no deaths from Covid 19, the lack of urgency is understandable. Now the poor reap consequences of the inaction."
2021-06-16 9:48,"The U.S. (and other 'reasonably' well-vaccinated countries) need to help the rest of the world(ROW), for purely selfish reasons: 1) block variants that can/will ultimately harm us  2) the U.S. economy can't thrive for any sustained period if ROW economy is struggling."
2021-06-16 9:52,"Honestly, Australia HAD managed well up until about December 2020, after that however is a different story. The nature of ANY virus is to mutate, which is why we still do not have a “cure” for the common cold and flu. Shutting down for 5 cases which every state has been doing is insane. A majority of people need to be vaccinated - to those arguing it doesn’t stop transmission let’s stay closed forever… here’s a thought the flu shot doesn’t stop transmission either so why don’t you apply the same logic. The govt should be largely responsible in communicating this message rather than sealing borders and saying there’s “no rush”. Vaccines reduce severe illness and hospitalisation. We are going to have to live with this disease, the genie is out of the bottle, there no putting it back in. As for supply, there’s just not enough space to type about that epic failure.

Imagine the person you love most in the world stays in another country, now imagine you haven’t seen them for 18 months, go one step further and imagine they need critical care or have passed away and you need GOVT permission just to leave. This is what the international border closure, vaccine complacency and shortage is doing to us folk who have immediate family abroad. It’s all well and good to say no skin off my nose, but, most people that want to travel now is to visit family. No one is talking about tourism. So if you get the vaccine, just take it, believe me you don’t want the shoe to be on the other foot!"
2021-06-16 13:51,I believe that this article shows that Dr. Fauci followed the general scientific community consensus regarding the origins of the virus. That they are learning more about it everyday.

2021-06-16 14:08,"The reason the lab leak theory was ignored is because, since Trump lies so much, people learned to assume anything he says is a lie. Secondly, if Trump actually had evidence that it leaked from a lab, he should have presented it to the public, and he should have used the power of the presidency to pursue the issue. He did neither."

2021-06-16 14:20,"Several unexplained answers:
- what evidence does he have that makes it unlikely that a naturally occurring virus was leaked from the lab (accidentally or not)?
- if it was of natural origin, why couldn’t the WHO team find the intermediate host?"
2021-06-16 14:22,"This interview is science communication at its best. I applaud Dr. Andersen's clear, matter-of-fact answers to the excellent interview questions. He is a model of professional comportment for laboratory scientists who find themselves in the news. We expect pseudo-skeptics who want the engineered virus claim to be true to attack him anyway. He's ready for them:

""It can be difficult at times for the public, I think, to observe the debate and discern the likelihood of the various hypotheses. That is particularly true where science becomes politicized, and the current vilification of scientists and subject matter experts sets a dangerous precedent. We saw that with the climate change debate and now we’re seeing it with the debate around various facets of the Covid-19 pandemic.""

Yep."
2021-06-16 13:40,"Scientists are only human, and it’s natural to double down on your own hypothesis— particularly when it’s been published in Nature. It’s unfortunate that the highly credible lab-leak hypothesis was so politically charged that it was verboten by the media and the academy. (Source: I am a scientist at an R1 university)"
2021-06-16 14:37,"Yes, science can be messy, particularly before the data starts rolling in.  Hypotheses are fragile animals and many die an early death.  I fear that the average person on the street won't grasp this.   Scientists often fall victim to their preconceptions, as does everyone else.  This is why the scientific method exists - you have to PROVE your ideas, and then someone other than you has to back up your proof.  Science is based on consensus for a reason."
2021-06-16 14:38,"I found this article and the accompanying interview via text Q & A to be very helpful and mind-settling.

It is tiresome in the extreme to have to be dealing with a constant barrage of opinions by non-scientists as to the origins of COVID-19. 

It is refreshing to see that, amongst the scientific community of virology experts, all minds are still open to any and all illuminating data, Past data and conclusions may have a high probability of being correct, and of remaining correct, but true scientists must allow for data and/or explanations that go against prevailing theory.

My compliments to Kristian Anderson, to Dr. Fauci (as always), to the Biden Administration for its persistence, and to NYT for putting all this out there for us the reading public."
2021-06-16 14:39,"Dr. Anderson makes a strong and convincing argument for a natural origin. But that does not negate an accidental or intentional lab leak. A naturally evolved virus in a lab can be released accidently or maliciously. Without transparency there is no way to investigate. China has a massive interest in suppressing evidence of malicious or negligent release. China is opaque. The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,"

2021-06-16 15:09,Great work by NYT! Clearly addressed the questions I had when Dr. Anderson’s email to Dr. Fauci postulating a potential lab leak and his subsequent reversal were first reported.
2021-06-16 16:22,"I think those last three paragraphs translate as, ""Twitter is a toxic social media swamp. An asylum run by the least charismatic inmates."""
2021-06-16 16:24,"In a lot of the coverage of the new lab-leak hypothesis I think this distinction is getting lost, so thank you for this.  There are two big questions about the origins of covid-19 and they simply aren't the same:

1) Is the virus man-made or natural in origin?

2) Did it spread into the human population due through the Wuhan lab, a ""wet market,"" or some other way?

It is possible for the virus to be natural in origin (i.e. collected from a bat) and then be accidentally released from the lab.  A lot of the new evidence (illness in the researchers, video evidence of sloppy practices) supports a lab leak but doesn't say anything about a man-made virus.

To me, personally, questions about the origin of the virus only matter if it is a man-made experiment or bio-weapon.  Then the nation of China would really be culpable.  Otherwise, I don't really see a big difference in where it came from.  I think ALL coverage of the lab-leak theory should make the distinction between these two very different questions."
2021-06-16 16:36,There is literally no way this virus has natural origins. I can’t believe people are so easily fooled by “experts”. The so-called “experts” have been wrong about almost everything concerning this virus and our catastrophic response to it. Has everyone lost their common sense?
2021-06-16 16:51,"We will probably never know for sure, and not holding my breath for the Chinese to be transparent. But early on it was politicized by our former president, demonizing China and souring the relationship even more. 

There's been a wave of anti-Asian violence in this country to the point Congress passed a special law. Just because a juicy conspiracy theory is floating around doesn't make it so, and thanks to NYT for publishing this."
2021-06-16 15:02,"We shouldn't expect the general public to understand the scientific process.  They have never been taught it, but they have been taught creationism.

2021-06-16 15:13,"The virologist is open to ""credible evidence of SARS-CoV-2 having been at the Wuhan Institute of Virology prior to the pandemic — whether in a freezer, in tissue culture or in animals, or epidemiological evidence of very early confirmed Covid-19 cases associated with the institute.""

Everyone knows that the Chinese Government would never allow such evidence to be made public. And even if it did, they would reject it as fake news and an anti-China conspiracy.

We will never know for sure. But it remains quite a coincidence that the virus emerged next door to their top virus lab and that no animal host has been found."
2021-06-16 15:48,"The “gain in function” scenario is mentioned in a question, but not addressed in an answer. Was such research being conducted at the Wuhan Lab? Was the US supporting it? Could it account for the creation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus? An acceleration of the evolutionary process?"
2021-06-16 15:49,"Andersen's most accurate statement is that Twitter is a complete waste of time to an serious person. There area couple of papers discussing that Covid-19 evolved naturally and that the lab leak theory is improbable, but ""improbable"" does not mean ""impossible."" The Chinese government should cooperate and release the medical records of the 3 or 4 lab workers who became ill and went to the hospital near or in Wuhan for treatment in November 2019."
2021-06-16 16:35,It’s an incredible (literally) coincidence that the a National lab in China conducted studies on coronaviruses in the same city where a natural crossover event occurred.

As he states, the lab incident theory is ""unlikely, based on current evidence.""  However, with the paucity of data from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and the stonewalling by the CCP, when asked for more data, it's premature to dismiss the lab theory.
The unfortunate aspect of this issue has been the assault on Dr. Fauci, by the right wing media (""kill the messenger""), which practically negates objective discussion of the topic."
2021-06-16 20:48,"Dr. Anderson speaks like a scientist. Admitting and allowing that possibility of newer data or evidence will change a conclusion or a hypothesis. 

During the process a lay person may get confused following the discussions or decided to get married to one of the tentative conclusion or hypothesis and will forever hold the scientific community responsible for any further changes, complaining that scientists often change their ""minds"" or they don't really know much. So we can easily see why the likes of the Donny Trumps would rather believe in whatever they can grab onto - like hydroxychloroquine or injecting Chlorox - instead of ""let the data speak truth"". To them the ""truth"" must be cast in concretes or stones and once cast could never change again. So we can easily see why it is so much easier to ""believe"" in water walking ability, UFO, virgin birth, etc. as they require no data, no factual basis, just blanket statements with absolute certainty. It is so much easier to buy into."

How comforting to know we were wrong, and the need to keep studying, and learning, a never-ending endeavor. Those 'in the know' do possess confident humbleness by admitting how little we really know. What a difference when dealing with the brutus ignoramuses, so full of themselves, yet so empty in knowledge yet bragging about their stupid stance. The same ones that, 'a la Trump and Tucker Carlson', spread disinformation (factoids known to be false, even dangerous) with such a vigorous contempt. Too bad that the Internet, such a marvel in providing information, may be abused at will."
2021-06-16 21:47,"As a scientist I am pleased to read what Dr Andersen had to say in this article. He provided an excellent example of what happens in science: Hypothesis Testing. 
We need to start somewhere, and so we form a hypothesis. This is not accepted as a fact, but as a starting point for research. Then, experiments are carried out, data analyzed, results are discussed with other scientists, and a new hypothesis is proposed. 
Unfortunately, most of the public cannot handle uncertainty and want to know a simple ""truth"". Then they do not need to think any more. They can move on with their lives. 
The natural world is complex. People like Dr Andersen and Dr Fauci understand this and deal with that complexity. Many people do not have an understanding of science and  so rather than learning more, they seem to prefer harassing scientists."

2021-06-16 21:44,"Here's an article that might help readers discern how and why  two contending theories (maybe, rather, hypotheses) can be aired by reputable scientists before ""all the facts"" are in (if ever it is) or ""all the evidence"" becomes available (if ever it will):

2021-06-16 23:10,"The takeaway from this is simple: based on all available evidence and analysis, the covid 19 virus most probably originated in nature. It was not engineered. The possibility that the natural virus leaked from the lab is there, but there is no evidence to support this and the most likely and easiest explanation is that it occurred in nature and began spreading naturally. Someone should give this article to Jon Stewart."
2021-06-16 22:12,"This was a nice interview, however there is no challenging of Kristian Andersen's premise of scientific rigour. 

If COVID-19 was indeed a freak accident, the easiest way to ascertain that is to disprove the hypothesis that it stemmed from a lab. This is pretty simple to do because there is a limited amount of material to go through from the WIV. 

In my own work I always look to test the most convenient hypothesis simply because it is faster and cheaper - whilst still being publishable with a null-result due to the counter-intuitiveness of such a finding. The fact that Kristian Andersen does not immediately advocate looking at the lab in Wuhan tells me his scientific reasoning is not as pure as he leads on. This could have been challenged by the journalists, but it isn't - and that's really weird"
2021-06-16 22:12,"I wonder what took the NYT a full year before consulting the expert in the field which is truly relevant for the topic (i.e. Virology), and by the way, to publish his response in full instead of taking bits and pieces to stitch into some journalistic stories, which others still do like Nick Wade.
And still in this article, NYT has not covered the data published by WHO in their Phase 1 report and I am sure Dr Andersen is well aware of and can help your readers to correctly interpret those findings."
2021-06-16 22:33,"Even if you could prove beyond doubt that the virus was accidentally released from a lab, unless that lab is in the U.S. there's nothing we can do about it anyway so this is just a political exercise.  If we can convince people around the world that it's China's fault then we've achieved a victory, I suppose.  Obviously a virus could be released from a lab in China or in the U.S. or Russia or somewhere else in the future as well as the past and virus naturally transfer to humans all the time.  If Republicans actually think this is a threat, then they'll support funds to counter the threat in the future.  But I don't think they do.  They just want to make noise, as usual.  A party of blowhards."
2021-06-16 22:42,The man floated the hypothesis that the virus was engineered.  This greatly satisfied the conspiracy theorists and xenophobes.  He then carefully examined the virus and compared it to other viruses and concluded that  there was nothing particularly novel about this virus after all and it could easily have evolved naturally.  He did this on the basis of hard evidence.  And now the conspiracy theorists and xenophobes are crying foul.  On the basis of nothing at all.
2021-06-16 22:56,"@sh ""...only those at academic institutions with a left winged political bias....willing to talk to the NYtimes"" - well that's news to me and a lot of people I surmise on this planet.
You provide a link to a 16,000 word essay from Yuri Deigin - he's is it seems an entrepreneur and is working on ""life enhancing strategies"". It seems he has no scientific publications (except 2 which are regurgitations of his essay). The entire basis of his premise is the question of the furin cleavage site - initially that focused the attention of many including one of our most eminent virologists, Nobel Laureate, David Baltimore. But as detailed here and in dozens of serious publications, this is no longer considered evidence of a lab-generated virus.
Like most scientists, I never excluded a possible lab leak and that the generator of 34,000 lies ('kung flu' 45th) was hawking this at his super-spreader rallies was neither here nor there. Then, there was reporting that several people at the Wuhan Institute became sick November 2019. But especially the conduct of the Beijing regime, delaying access then quarantining the WHO team for 14 days, failure to provide access to lab records, freezers, samples from the Huanan Market....other egregious conduct means that there will be forever suspicion of a lab leak."
2021-06-16 22:15,"I'm no scientist, but it is just too coincidental that a viral lab is in Wuhan. I don't know why we talk about an accidental leak  there. This could have been planned, by an individual or by the state. It's a biological weapon. The virus evolved, became a greater threat, and with 7 billion people who haven't been vaccinated, it's still evolving. There may be little evidence of active human engineering, but did this virus ever evolve quickly to cross over to humans. The Chinese have hidden its origins, also a bit too coincidental. There are a few people who are exceptionally bright, much more talented than me. I think the virus was engineered by some very bright individual in the Wuhan virology lab."

However, the dismissal of the lab leak hypothesis by mainstream news outlets last year as a crazy conspiracy theory actually happened. That dismissal was premature and dangerous. That was obvious to anyone critically following the reporting.

And this baseless dismissal by journalists hasn’t stopped. On Twitter, NYT reporter Apoorva Mandavilli dismissed the lab leak theory only one month ago and went on to say that it has has “racist roots.”

With Ms Mandavilki on staff, can I believe that the Times will give the lab leak theory (not to mention some other, admittedly less likely scenarios) serious consideration?

Not really.

So when the Times tells me there is little evidence to support the lab leak hypothesis, I take it with a massive grain of salt."
2021-06-16 20:31,"One of the first things Beijing did when they realized there was a problem in Wuhan with an out of control coronavirus pandemic, in the same city where, coincidentally (?) they had a lab working on coronaviruses, was to send a female *army general* down there to the lab.

2021-06-17 1:15,"Although we need to understand the origin of this virus, the hoopla surrounding it is political. Trump's first instinct, in any matter, is to either to take credit for a positive outcome, even if it is not his to take or, blame someone else for anything that puts what he perceives as a negative slant against him and once again, whether it is warranted or not. He is pathological. 
That being said, the right wing media went along, to cast blame.  Along with that, is somehow the Democrats are to blame. Blame for what isn't exactly clear, but it none the less it riles up the Republican base."
2021-06-17 1:10,"Kristian Andersen says that there is no real evidence showing the coronavirus was engineered. But that's not what people are concerned about. 

The concern is gain of function research. Kristian Andersen was asked about that. He did not answer. That's telling. 

Gain in function is when a virus is made to jump species, from animal to human. In natural evolution very, very, very few viruses ever make that jump. Helping a virus do that in a lab is very risky research, as Tony Fauci and others have pointed out. 

The SARS CoV-2 virus made that jump. How? Was it just natural, or did it happen with human assistance? We don't know for sure. But the pandemic started in the exact same area where a lab was performing those exact experiments on bat coronaviruses. (As comic Jon Stewart humorously pointed out last night on Stephen Colbert's show.) That's a big clue. 

It doesn't take a weatherman to tell which way the wind blows. And it doesn't take a virologist like Kristian Andersen to know that the jump of this virus from bat to human most likely took place in the Wuhan lab."
2021-06-17 1:19,Bravo Dr. Anderson.  I followed his Twitter feed where he calmly batted down conspiracies with facts.

Wow...this could've benefitted from a bit of clarification in way more lay terms."
2021-06-17 1:54,Funny how the conspiracists reliably claim that scientists who disagree with them must be left wing apoaratchiks ...does anyone ever question  the political motivation of scientists who lean towards the man made/lab leak hypothesis?
2021-06-17 1:54,"As we all know, changing your mind as new evidence emerges is a sure sign of weakness and incompetence. In such cases you're much better off following the opinion of someone who speaks with absolute certainty and has no scientific credentials."

2021-06-17 2:16,"Listen - any rational scientist knows 1. COVID virus most likely arose naturally, as did SARS1, and 2.  We’ll never know the truth unless someone fesses up. So…why do we continue to give oxygen to the conspiracy theorists and those that stand to gain from the continued discussion (including the media and scientist talking heads). Boring and just plays into the hands of the crazies."
2021-06-17 2:33,Mankind will remain stuck at this junction between the potential of achieving great things and teetering at the brink of self-destruction as some groups continue to be ignorant to reason because they either lack the capacity to think logical or want the world to be what they would like to see. Very depressing.
2021-06-17 2:54,"The question is did the lab at Wuhan have Covid 19 in the building, engineered or not? If the CCP says no, then how do you prove otherwise?"
2021-06-16 14:42,"Based on Kristian Andersen view expressed in this article his current position that Covid-19 was released as a result of ""natural causes"" is as speculative as the view he now challenges that it originated in a lab. He supports the natural cause view without any evidence to prove it. It is simply his speculation right now.."
2021-06-17 3:23,"I don't get sense Andersen is trying hard to spin this as anything but a politically motivated walk-back born of fiscal necessity.  ""Here's my original theory, here's rationale for walking it back.  Politics has nothing to do with it"".  Forgive me if I apply intuition and common sense, instead of scientific method, to my anylization.  I'll leave that to scientists at The Bulletin of Atomic Whatever.  Take a look at link and its front page."
2021-06-15 13:56,"This article notes that there’s no direct evidence for the lab leak theory, but fails to also point out that there’s no direct evidence of an intermediate host for a spillover event despite China having tested over 80,000 animals within the last 18 months. From the beginning, it was clear that China extensively destroyed evidence including virus samples and silenced witnesses who dared to speak out, yet this doesn’t appear in the article either. It’s in China’s best interest to show that a spillover event took place and it’s been unable to do so. It’s very much against China’s interests to provide evidence of a lab leak. With every passing month, a spillover event becomes less likely and there’s a mountain of circumstantial evidence in support of a leak that continues to grow."
2021-06-15 13:35,"Of course Mrs Shi Zhengli will not avow that they were live coronaviruses or bats in her lab. Of course she will not admit the virus could have escaped form one of her labs, or even that they performed dangerous experiments with these viruses. She will even deny that safety norms were not followed. That would be the end of her career. And even worse, it would mean China has to admit it made mistakes and then lied to cover the mistakes made. That's plain unacceptable for China's leadership.
We will probably never know for sure. But as more and more evidence emerges, more and more people abroad will doubt China's official version.
The same is happening in China's nuclear industry. We have now learned of radioactive leaks at a Chinese nuclear powerplant in Tianshan. But we learnt about it from a French company.: the Chinese are too busy changing emission limits to hide the issue and keep the plant running."
2021-06-15 13:37,"If she said there is a possibility that someone infected at the lab carried the virus out,she would be shot. If you believe this isn’t the China state policy, I have some river front land on the Swanee that’s always dry you can buy."
2021-06-15 14:03,"""Dr. Shi said that bat viruses in China could be studied in BSL-2 labs because there was no evidence that they directly infected humans, a view supported by some other scientists""
The above quote from this excellent NYT article tells me what I needed to know. Some of the most experienced, well educated and trusted medical experts can become overconfident that man can control nature. Did Covid start from open air wet market from infected animal to human? very likely. But should we be looking at all options for its source? Yes. Mess with nature too much and pay the consequences later. And, why on earth is a U.S. company helping to fund this lab in Wuhan to the tune of $600k per year? seems that China doesn't need our help any longer."
2021-06-15 14:15,"I'd read an article about Dr. Shi, and,  the ""bat hunter"" Tian Junhua from Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention.  What is important is not to set up public hatred for the researchers themselves, who have been doing, from all reports remarkable work.  We would be fortunate to have  Dr. Shi working for our NIH.

It does seem possible that in collection or transfer of the samples collected, it is possible that humans inadvertently brought the virus from  a bast cave to humans. 

The major problem is in the politics. China's leadership controls the flow of information, and gets ever more restrictive when it anticipates attacks. It did not encourage cooperation when a former President  essentially accused China of deliberately causing a new disease.

The issue is not just about this investigation, but about encouraging the exchange of research information in the world, to be able to respond to health threats, unimpeded by political divisions and grandstanding."
2021-06-15 14:04,"Distrust is as terrible as disinformation. We can't discern, in this case, if the virus somehow emerged from the lab, from the Wuhan market, or from some other locale entirely. Trump and his disinformation machine have exacerbated world wide distrust in all governments. But he is gone and questions remain. Can Dr. Shi Zhengli allow, accept, and delegate to someone else what will be on-going requests for information that won't be satisfied with one walk-around? Her research has helped the world create life-saving vaccines. She is not doing anything wrong, but she may be too defensive to fully answer questions that scientists across borders could answer together. Can China allow other scientists, not journalists, access without taking offense to their national honor when questions are asked? Dr. Shi Zhengli and her team have studied viruses and saved lives. As much as possible, we should remove ego, journalistic drama, black and white blame, racism, grandstanding, etc. This is the world's problem now."
2021-06-15 13:42,"Of course the entire world can trust China when it claims the virus was not man made. Look how honest and fulsome China has been about Tiananmen Square, the Uyghurs, currency manipulation, trade mark, copyright and technology theft and the odd use of social credit to further control people. When China talks, assume it’s a lie."
2021-06-15 15:18,"I've been inclined to believe the lab leak version right from the get-go, but kept my views to myself as I didn't fancy getting labelled as a conspiracy theorist. But the pendulum is swinging towards the leak theory. The Wall Street Journal published an Opinion piece on 6th June that states Covid-19 has a genetic ""fingerprint"" that is unknown in the natural world and thus is highly likely to be a gain of function, lab-made virus. How much more proof is needed?"
2021-06-15 15:33,"The USSR denied the anthrax leak back in the day. Was it a coincidence that the anthrax outbreak occurred in a city with a lab studying anthrax? ""There's no relationship between the lab and the anthrax outbreak,"" said the authorities. When the USSR fell, the anthrax outbreak was traced back to the lab and a maintenance mistake - by the same investigator, who now had better access.

It's likely that the same will happen with COVID; we just have to wait until the end of the CCP, or when a new regime wants to discredit the old regime in some way.

Nobody ever wants to believe it's their fault. Pride and arrogance play a role. But can anyone really control the actions (or inactions) of ever person in a facility? After all, US labs have plenty of accidents, and theoretically We Try Harder to imbue a culture of safety into the staff. In China, safety tends to take a backseat to other considerations."

Outliers, at diverse distances, and states of willful blindness; deafness; indifference and ignorance. And the myth of ""control,"" when total control is but an aspiration. For some. Notwithstanding one's timely efforts. Adequate, suitable or not.
Was there no room in this article to simply note how often dangerous... natural, as well as man-made, have ""escaped"" from labs throughout the world?  As well as, perhaps, how many countries support labs creating bio-chemical weapons of war?"

Of course it should be reported.  And, of course it should be ignored as unreliable, as unreliable as statements of prisoners of war.

China has already gone to extraordinary lengths to hamper any investigation of the orgins of covid.  That by itself makes it highly likely that they have something to hide, and that something is probably in Wuhan."
2021-06-15 15:25,"I wish to compliment NYT in presenting a fair reporting of Shi Zhengli side of the story.

It takes lot of journalistic courage to do so in a country awash with alternative facts. A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center towards the end of last year found that 64% of American adults said made-up news stories were causing confusion about the basic facts of current issues and events.

Working out who to trust and who not to believe has been a facet of human life in complex societies. Politics has always bred those who will mislead to get ahead.

Americans have decided China is a bad guy, don’t worry about the facts but the famous idiom “Give a dog a bad name and hang him”. American interests is guided by the belief that nothing will enhance it as effectively as the approach to foreign affairs as realism

Martin Jacques was absolutely right when he observed “China confronts Europe with an enormous problem: We insist on seeing the world through our Western prism. No other tradition or history or culture can compare. Ours is superior to all and others, in deviating from ours, are diminished as a consequence. This speaks not of our wisdom but our ignorance, an expression not of our cosmopolitanism but our insularity and provincialism.

This mind set threatens to become our greatest handicap as we enter an era in which America will experience irreversible decline, the emergent nations will become major actors and China will replace the United States as the dominant power."""
2021-06-15 16:00,"And yet when the pandemic started, she rushed home from a conference and stated she sighed in relief that they thought it was ""not one of hers"".

This indignation now does not match how she acted when the pandemic broke out.

Occam's razor still points to the lab as the most likely place for the COVID-19's pandemic's origin.  The fact they still have not found a species between bats and humans that has the ACE2 affinity says a lot.

Not to mention the Italian news video from 2015 that talks about the lab working on gain of function using SARS/coronavirus to cause ""acute bilateral pneumonia in humans"".

The circumstantial evidence is really against the WIV and the good Dr.

The Chinese government's credibility is also zero as far as transparency and honesty."
2021-06-15 16:06,"It seems to me that since we are all human beings, no matter how smart and educated we are, all of us, possibly wrong and make mistakes. 
Lab leaks are common in China and the US. So why crucify a Chinese scientist on the SPECULATION, that an error may have occurred? It could have happened here in the USA, and we can be sure that we would deny and act offended, just as Dr Shi does! We are just a secretive as the  Chinese are when it comes to our research in progress. So it sounds to me like the pot is calling the kettle black.
What we need in this increasingly interdependent world is cooperation and a moratorium on suspicion and entitlement as we can all benefit from each other’s expertise and knowledge , NOT COMPETITION!"
2021-06-15 16:15,"China must produce the medical records of the three or four workers from the lab who got sick in November 2019. It could be that they just had the seasonal flu. On no way can the World rely on the World Health Organization, they just don't have any credibility in this matter."
2021-06-15 15:47,"We are making accusations about something invisible, an (alleged) event 18 months ago, in a place 8000 miles away. And the burden of proof is on us. If there was anything intentional, the virus would have been carried away from China in a sealed container and let loose elsewhere. If it was an accident, that would have been unfortunate. 
   Ask the Central Park Five about making accusations based on the supposed reputation of the group the accused belonged to."
2021-06-15 14:41,"At the end of the day, this is not only a science-in-China issue. Dr. Shi Zhengli, while a Chinese national, also represents science in general and the uses of science in benefit of all of humanity.

In this regard, in order for Dr. Zhengli to be fully transparent, the world scientific establishment (if there's one?) should offer some form of protection for her as a world citizen-scientist--all while continuing to help with the Chinese population's well being. I hesitate to fantasize about what the China government is willing to do for all of humanity's well being.

In my view, full transparency for the sake of humanity should BEGIN by clarifying what actually happened to the actual human beings (Chinese nationals) being immediately impacted by Dr. Zhengli's research on bats: the three lab researchers in 2019 and the miners back in 2012.

The Chinese people and the rest of the world need to know what actually happened with and in Dr. Zhengli's lab-- human error and all.

Regardless of what complicity Dr. Shi, Peter Daszak and others who have not given good accountings of themselves may or may not have, we have certainly all learned something about how grants, funding,  political pressure and biased, tunnel-vision journalism can make it impossible to speak aloud questions everyone knows should be asked."
2021-06-15 16:41,"Before making an accusation, shouldn't there be concrete evidence first?  If Mike Pompeo says there's evidence of a lab leak, shouldn't he provide that evidence?  

There are plenty of examples throughout history of people being wrongly accused and subsequently punished for something they didn't do. 

And let's just be frank here, this is all political with a dash of racism.  If this thing originated from the UK or Israel, there would not be this much attention drawn to the lab leak theory."
2021-06-15 16:47,"What amuses me with this lab leak theory is how it is exactly similar to the ""debate"" around evolution and creationism. You have no evidence in claiming the latter, but it is impossible to prove nor refute, philosophically or politically.  Precisely because of this, it is perhaps most convenient to the US government, especially in view of their colossal failings in dealing with the virus. Just don't complain about too much QAnon conspiracies when your own government and media happily engage in one."
2021-06-15 16:48,"“ The idea that the virus may have escaped from a lab had long been widely dismissed by scientists as implausible and shunned by others for its connection with former President Donald J. Trump.”
Should read “dismissed quickly by some scientists.” A few of the scientists who wrote letters to Nature and Lancet had research ties to the WIV and so their quick dismissal of a lab origin was probably in order to save their own face and perhaps ultimately their funding. Why shouldn’t Dr (not Mrs) Shi do the same? The problem is this early detouring of an investigation into the real origin of SARsCoV2 was unscientific. It baselessly removed one legitimate hypothesis of the virus origin. We can focus on Dr Shi, but perhaps the scientists who quickly dismissed a broad open hypothesis to its origin need to be investigated as well."
2021-06-15 16:53,"“citing American intelligence”; with all of the evidence of misbehaviour by American Intelligence – from Iraq WMD; to nonexistent Russian involvement in President Trump’s victory in 2016 [no actual evidence presented] there is obviously no basis for quoting “American intelligence” to support any hypothesis.
Let the debate continue – but let discussion focus ONLY on actual evidence presented and dismiss all unfounded assertions by American or any other State driven sources."
2021-06-15 17:45,"My layman’s understanding is that zoonotic hosts have been found for MERS, SARS-2, hantavirus, Ebola, and various avian flus.  It seems reasonable to expect scientists to have identified the animal link in this case. 

Until the animal link is found, the lab leak theory remains plausible.  Chinese secrecy surrounding the Wuhan lab is not direct evidence of human error, but it does not instill confidence in their “nothing to see here” stance."
2021-06-15 18:35,"Shi Zhengli has a track record of LYING:

-   She implied the viruses closest match, RaTG13, was ""found"" in WIV's freezers in Feb 2020. We now know she'd been continuously working with it for many years under a different name: BTCoV/499.

- In an interview with THIS article's cowriter, Amy Qin, she claimed the miners fatally exposed to RaTG13 in 2013, died from a ""fungal pneumonia"".  Hospital records proved this false.

- In Feb 2020, she published a partial genome of the virus, but OMITTED it's most curious feature: the rare CGG sequence NEVER observed in a natural coronavirus but COMMONLY inserted in gain-of-function experiments. 

Her history of obfuscation, omission and selective information sharing are further proof of coverup."

Why?  Just can't give the data.  These are claims, not facts!  In the fall of 2019 there was a nasty flu outbreak in China with many people very sick and in the hospital.  Hundreds of people work at the WIV, so should we expect that a few got very sick with the flu at that time?  If we had the names of these three people, they could be interviewed, and their hospital records could be examined.  Yes, Dr. Shi is being slandered for political reasons."

Dr. Shi claims there is no evidence, yet there is.  It's the database that details the work she was doing before the pandemic began, and which the Chinese government refuses to disclose.  If they simply showed us what they working on, we would know one way or the other whether it leaked from a lab.  But instead, all they give us is emotional pushback."

Of the three researchers from her institute who sought treatment in November of 2019 she said: 

“The Wuhan Institute of Virology has not come across such cases,” she wrote. “If possible, can you provide the names of the three to help us check?”

Would not the Institute, if it were truly interested in being transparent, be able to identify these three persons?  

On another note, on Stephen Colbert's return to a live audience last night with THE Late Show, guest Jon Stewart was all in on the notion that the Lab was the source of the virus, whether created there or brought in by someone and then leaked out.

Methinks she protesteth too much.

The point is somewhat moot except insofar as assessing damages and opprobrium on the government of China.

However one hopes the scientific community will quietly abandon “gain of function” research as the risk/reward equation seems clearly unbalanced on the negative side of the ledger.

The US government may also want to begin deficit reduction by ceasing to fund offshored research by countries that can well afford to pay for it themselves. In this case, our return on investment may have been one corpse for each of our $600,000. We may perish from bio weapons or Jurassic Park like scenarios, but we should at least refrain from paying the henchmen for our execution."

The move was roundly criticized, including by a group of 77 Nobel laureates, who wrote NIH Director Francis Collins that they ""are gravely concerned""[20] by the decision and called the funding cut ""counterintuitive, given the urgent need to better understand the virus that causes COVID-19 and identify drugs that will save lives.""[21]"

The recent genome discussions about a potential man make insertion is troubling to say the least. Does their lab not want outsiders to see their bat research area?  We can make no formal statements either refuting nor accusing the lab of involvement in the release, either intentionally or accidentally, without transparency which we will never get."
2021-06-15 21:04,"Most compelling reported facts:

All previous zootic bat viruses were found extensively in bat populations, including ones remote from the original infection site.  Covid-19's appearance was confined to Wuhan.

The covid-19 virus contains a genetic sequence never seen in nature (it is inaccessible by mutation) which greatly enhances human respiratory transmission.

Either leads inescapably to the conclusion that the covid-19 virus came from a synthetic 'gain of function' created in a laboratory. 

Biological mutation in the vastness of nature is massively parallel, spanning both huge flocks of fauna and complex structures of DNA. The appearance of natural changes without such 'echoes' is wildly improbable, much less twice."

Shameful!  but your reporter reported what she said so now you have it down for posterity. Another big lie!  we still do not have a smoking gun to prove The SARS Covid2 virus leaked from the Wuhan Institute virology.  nor can we prove that it is a result of natural evolution. The real question is how did the furin cleavage site get located where it is  right smack dab in the middle of the spike protein? That is the crux of the matter to prove whether it is man manipulated man mutated versus a gift of mother nature, and not a good one for humanity."
2021-06-15 22:16,"Two scenarios are under consideration for the origin of the virus. Either an animal vector or a leak from the Wuhan lab. However, that ignores a far more nefarious origin. That is the possibility of germ warfare. 

The US worked with the Wuhan lab and was intimately aware of their work on viruses. If the COVID 19 virus was produced anywhere in the world, it would be possible to transport it and release it near the Wuhan lab thus raising logical suspicion. 

It has been reported that the US also had a secret program to create the worst viruses possible as part of our military germ warfare programs. Supposedly, that program was cancelled about 10 years ago. But we have no certainty that is the case.

Perhaps that is even why Trump spent so much time trying to label this as the Chinese virus to firmly link China and the pandemic. If there are to be investigations, our secret military labs need to be examined as well to determine if they had any part in the pandemic."
2021-06-15 21:15,"In the best of circumstances, a leak is possible, but I do not think this was the case in China.  It would be interesting to see if Covid appeared around other live markets at about the same time.  If it was isolated in a lab, it had to have come from outside, and we're back with the pangolins.  I'd call it Pangolins' Revenge."

But there has never been a hint, which animal this could be. Also by the way for SARS 1, never has an animal been found. Tracing back the origin, it stopped with a doctor, who perhaps got infected by a patient, who was not identified, But the doctor infected other humans in a hotel, where a guest travelled to Hanoi, and infected other patients. Why must the infection pass from animal to man, who also is an animal. There are mutants of the Virus, and all happen in the transmission from humans to humans, and perhaps from a BSL-2 Lab."
2021-06-15 22:42,The lab leak theory is probably bogus but it will remain an issue until China cooperates fully.
2021-06-15 21:29,"As a highly inteligent scientist, I am sure Dr. Shi can understand the trepidation felt by others trying to have faith in her government's statements. 
By not allowing a full and open examination of all the data, the CCP is just projecting an air of guilt.
If her lab had nothing to do with creating or leaking Covid, than an international team given full access to that data would be the thing to do. 
What is the CCP afraid of ?"
2021-06-15 23:44,"I just wish politicians, both in China and elsewhere, would stay the devil out of this debate and let scientists figure out the origins of this virus. They are the only ones who can, what everyone else has to say about it is mere babble."
2021-06-15 23:40,"Why is no science writer part of the byline?   Why is the whole article framed through the lab leak hypothesis.  why is the fact most scientists consider this unlikely only mentioned in passing.

Why is the article NOT GROUNDED in this view that most virologists consider the lab leak idea much more unlikely than the virus originated in nature and made a jump to humans just SARS did? or HIV did? or Ebola did? or MERS did?

This is not a coin flip.  One possibly is much, more likely than the other."
2021-06-16 0:01,Why should we believe her?  She and the military dictatorship she serves have done everything they could to thwart transparency and prevent a meaningful investigation.  She and the Chinese Communist Party have zero credibility.
2021-06-15 23:44,"How is this news? She obviously cannot speak truth with the fear of the Chinese government hanging over her. 

Why even publish this?"
2021-06-16 2:24,Without the important 20 years of work by Dr Shi to understand coronaviruses we would never have had the rapid development of vaccine. She has done internationally awarded work and has collaborated with scientists all around the world. Her research saved many lives. We did not have researchers protecting us from smallpox and influenza and entire civilizations collapsed.

Trump's wild accusations to cover his own incompetency have left to this day an air of distrust.  Instead of working to remove the politics and establish trust, Biden keeps pointing fingers.  When the world needs to calm down and cooperate, we show it how not to."
2021-06-15 18:24,"Thank you NYT for presenting a reasonable prospective from Dr. Shi’s angle. 
It is sad that so many people and quite a number of news outlets are jumping on the band wagon that the SAR-2 origin is likely due to a leak from the Wuhan lab, when there is no direct evidence to support it.  Quite ironic for a country proud of its justice system of innocent until proven guilty.
What is really troubling is that 19 prominent scientists signed the letter to demand more investigation of the Wuhan lab, including scientists who collaborated with and received samples from Dr. Shi, such as Dr. Ralph Baric, the prominent virologist from North Carolina, who actually carried out a gain of function study in creating a more lethal corona virus with supported by NIH. 
Do they have the rights to do so? Yes. Is it the right thing to do? No.  It is pouring salt in the wound. How could Dr. Shi, who devoured her 30 plus career study corona virus to prevent it from infecting human, and lauded by the US scientific community in 2019, be not be feeling angry and betrayed!"

CDC DIRECTOR - DR. GERBERDING: I'm here today to give you an update on the evolving investigation of SARS, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome..a problem over the last several weeks...Of the 39 cases in the US, it's important  that we are seeing a pattern that's been very consistent. 32 out of 39 of these individuals have traveled toparts of the world where cases are prominent. The others are either health care personnel or close family members who have been indirect contact with a suspect case... We have been able to culture Coronavirus from two of the patients that we've evaluated so far of the four that we have tissue from. In one patient, the tissue is culturing virus in our laboratories, but in addition we can see the virus, and you can see here pictures of what this virus looks like in tissue cultures. What you see is a circularvirus that looks like it has a corona or sort of a crown effect, and thatis basically little spikes and protein globules that surround the virus so that it gives it that very characteristic appearance.

There is NO NATURAL PATTERN OF TRANSMISSION which would explain an accidental lab-leak in Wuhan causing the tragic March 2020 impact in NY and Milan, but nowhere in California."
2021-06-15 19:26,The conspiracy theorists will never be satisfied. Even if China produced those records people will still choose to believe whatever they like. Trump made this political from the get-go and it is not like Trumpism is gone. It would be totally foolish for China to cooperate.
2021-06-15 20:16,"Can people please stop saying ""there is no evidence...""  There is no DIRECT evidence.  However, there is plenty of circumstantial, phylogenetic, genomic and epidemiological evidence, all of which supports the lab leak hypothesis stronger than the natural origin hypothesis."
2021-06-15 21:27,"Lets analyze the lab leak theory from intent. 1. covid is intentionally made by Chinese gov/military as bioweapon. This is impossible, why would Chinese gov/military make a weapon that is a global pandemic? A virus airborne respiratory virus that infects everyone indiscriminately? China's density and population is the most vulnerable to a virus like this. And a global pandemic could devastate China's economy the most. If China has the scientific knowledge to engineer a virus this perfect, we would use the tech to build revolutionary medicines, sell that the world and earn tons of money. You know Chinese people want to earn money right?  2. A unintentional leak happened as the lab people were studying coronavirus. COVID would not have mutated that much because the time frame and the amount of spread before wuhan was very small. COVID developed mutations after spreading hundred millions of people and after a year. Hence, a virus studied by the lab must near completely match the virus spread in wuhan. This is not the case. If three people in the virology lab were sick prior to the outbreak was true, the health system and government must have been on high alert about their illness. There would have been careful analysis what were they infected with. There could have been mass quarantine and sanitization just like the seafood market. All this is because the Chinese government care about stability the most. They don't want any thing bad happening. But none of that happened"
2021-06-15 21:54,"Dr. Shi Zhengli you are remarkable, brilliant scientist who has benefited our world with your knowledge about the COVID-19 virus and vaccines.  Thank you Dr. Zhengli. As an American I have deep respect for you and how you have helped humanity.

 While the suggestion that COVID-19 may have originated from your lab is a personal affront to you, please consider this perspective: Wouldn't you want and expect a thorough investigation of ANY viral research lab, regardless of country or city if it is only a short distance away from the origin point of a global pandemic? 

Shi Zhengli you are obviously impeccable in your skills and oversight.  I am sure your staff are exceptional people as well and followed protocols. 

Personally, I would think any scientist would and should call for such investigation no matter how talented the people are who are working in the lab. I would expect this  if this took place in a US site as well, and this would not be to scapegoat or caste aspersions on the lab head or staff. 

Standard scientific procedure should be to review and thoroughly investigate ANY labs nearby conducting research related viruses.

It is laudable to hold ourselves and our staff to standards of excellence and perfection. In science, we test everything, and then we need to also expect others test everything we did. This is not to hurt us or attack us, this is to verify and eliminate uncertainty."
2021-06-15 22:12,"It makes my blood boil (and I have hypertension) to read ""some scientists say"" in a story about science and politics. ""Some scientists say ..."" fill in the space: ""global warming is exaggrated"" or ""the association of guns and violence is weak."" Dr. Shi's lab is world-class. ""US intelligence"" refers to Trump memo that lacks credibility. There was an influenza outbreak in late 2019, so ""several employees"" reporting sick is hardly intel.

China has not blocked investigations in her lab, there is no authorization to run a complete audit of it, from the WHO or anywhere. Do you know what a complete facility audit means? It would be a fishing expedition, shut the lab down. Treating them like accused criminals. 

What's really happening is a cabal of scientists, led by Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch (who writes for the Times) are using the lab leak theory to push their attack on ""gain of function"" research. The Times should be analyzing this. GoF research on coronavirus showed that some vaccine strategies wouldn't work, back in 2014. This was mocked by Lipsitch as useless info at the time. Not anymore.

""Without direct proof of a natural spillover, more scientists and politicians have called for a full investigation into the lab leak theory."" It took 14 years to identify the source of SARS1. Oh, and by the way, that work was done at the Wuhan Institute. Now we're accusing them of causing Covid-19. Shoot the piano player."
2021-06-16 0:15,"Do you realize that Shi Zhengli has almost single handedly done 3/4 of the work done anywhere on the planet to pin SARS viruses to their sources in nature, not to mention develop the fact that they're a threat.    

Zhi Zhengli is a HIGHLY responsible scientist.   She herself investigated and eliminated the possibility covid escaped from her lab when it first broke out.

I do not know WHY our nation's leadership is suddenly so anxious to deny the threat posed by 3rd world eating animals noone has any business eating, and of hideously unsound handling of livestock in the live meat markets of China.   For some reason that made excellent sense when Trump was doing it but none when Biden does it, we seem to want to mount a racist attack on China rather than stop SARS viruses.    What is suddenly WRONG with everyone.

In any case, you'll not attack Shi Zhengli with those of us who know what we're talking about watching!"
2021-06-16 1:40,"Why the U.S. still refuses a through investigation of its various labs around the world? Why didn't it occur that the virus was actually leaked from a U.S. lab instead of a Chinese one? What is the U.S. government hiding from the rest of the world? Why did the U.S. labs cooperate with the notorious Japanese bioweapons division dating back to the Second World War? Why there were cases in EU, or most probably in the U.S, way before they showed up in a Wu Han wet market? Why the U.S. abruptly transported its athletes from the competition in Wu Han, did the U.S. actually know something beforehand?"

I am very aware of the state of Alzheimer's research and biomarkers.   I have taught and researched FDA regulation since the 1970s.  My field is science based safety regulation.  I know of no competent Neuroscientist who thinks this was a a good approval. 

Alzheimer's is already a fertile field for Quacks.  This lowers the bar substantially, at great cost and risk.  

New blood needed at the top."

A slow decline requiring lots of care.

This is a great way to lift the profits of big Pharma.

It is also a great way to bankrupt a dysfunctional health care system."
2021-06-15 17:43,"It is clear from this article that one agency--and understaffed at that--cannot do both food administration and drug administration.  Food administration, with its inclusion of food safety and nutrition, should have its own agency and staff.  Furthermore, if the Biden administration can ask for a major increase in staffing for the IRS, it can also do so for the FDA or any two agencies that might result from a split.  Janet Woodcock should, in any event, not be the permanent FDA Commissioner.  It is time for her to retire and find another job, perhaps in private industry.  With the revolving door of government officials, it may be difficult indeed to find a worthy leader not associated to some degree with the industry that is regulated.  But Janet Woodcock has, with the approval of aducanumab, lowered the bar for the requirements for the next commissioner.  Unlike Janet Woodcock, that commissioner should be influenced heavily by the opinions of the independent advisory panels when deciding to grant FDA approval."
2021-06-15 14:49,"My compliments on an excellent summary on the current FDA scope of challenges and the need for a permanent commissioner. Regarding the aducanumab approval for Alzheimer's I think the analytical basis for approval may not yet be publicly available, but might be similar to this one (<a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/143504/download"" target=""_blank"">https://www.fda.gov/media/143504/download</a>) where functional impairment(symptoms, memory) improved and there was dose-response for imaging results. So, there is an efficacy signal although there is not overall integration with safety risk. Unless we change our laws FDA does not regulate drug cost so it seems unfair to criticize them on this issue. Likewise, linking Dr. Woodcock's support for approving narcotic drugs for pain relief to the US addiction epidemic seems misguided. That responsibility is with prescribing MD's, dispensing pharmacists, wholesalers, state regulators and federal agencies like DEA....not Janet Woodcock. She has been an outstanding new drug approval head who could well lead FDA."

Until the mid '90's, the FDA required a clinical endpoint such as death to approve new HIV medications. Around that time, AIDS researchers noticed that a new PCR assay measuring viral quantity, or viral load, strongly correlated with clinical endpoint. That became the proposed surrogate marker, but only after a careful statistical review of multiple studies. The use of a surrogate marker for the new Alzheimer's drug has none of that math or science behind it. It is an untested hypothesis, and we the American people are now the financial victims of this fraud."

This drug is a joke and should never been prescribed to patients.  It is also quite unsafe. In addition, it will hamper future efforts to develop new drugs for Alzheimer as patients who trust FDA judgment may prefer to go on with aducanumab.

FDA got a lot of unwarranted and patently false accusations last year about ""their red tape""  during the worst of the pandemic.  ""Red tape"" is HHS's only research output.

While FDA has many areas detailed in the article that need serious review and substantial correction, much like any critical aspect of our infrastructure, Congress has failed to fund it adequately and give it anywhere near the resources that would be considered adequate for the vast mission that Congress and the American public make it responsible for."
2021-06-10 17:51,"I know she has knowledge and integrity, but sometimes she's been tone deaf or lacking in common sense. The sudden swing from over-caution to free-for-all was jarring, confusing, and possibly hazardous. And while the political influences may be less overt than in the Trump days, there is no doubt that for a while the teachers unions, not the science or the scientists, were calling the tune on school opening guidance. Her honor-system guidance for no masks needed for the vaccinated ignores the fact that many people who are vaccinated have underlying conditions that may make them wide open to infection."
2021-06-10 18:01,"I am convinced that she should have known that the people who avoid being vaccinated are the same who would stop wearing masks. That decision seemed clearly aimed at pacifying Trump supporters at the expense of those who are, for many SCIENTIFIC reasons, very cautious."
2021-06-10 18:11,"Huge respect for Dr Walensky, her command of facts and science, and her ability to convey empathy for those effected by the pandemic.

However, she doesn’t appear to have been schooled in the complexities of communications structured to move society from one stage on to the next.  It’s time to expand the CDC’s director role to be more than just a gatekeeper for health science.

Take a cue from the organizational change and communication departments of large global enterprises. All official communications can be viewed from the perspective of senders and receivers. Unfortunately senders and receivers often don't participate in a true dialogue at the onset of a change. They talk right past one another. 

Imagine a people manager who sits down with an employee to discuss a major organizational restructuring project. The manager shares the information in an enthusiastic and positive way. She covers all the key messages, including the risk of not changing and the urgency around changing the structure for competitive reasons. If a people manager spends too much time talking about the business and not enough time talking about the implications to the employee then much of the key business information communicated by the people manager to the impacted employee in this first conversation goes unheard. Why? The message is overshadowed by the employee's concerns about job security and fear of change.

Dr Walensky should create a public health change management department within the CDC."
2021-06-10 18:17,"I saw my doctor for a routine check up today.   We talked about the confusion over this.   She said she thinks we will know in a couple of months whether booster shots are needed for those among the first to receive the vaccines 6 months ago.   Until then we should continue to be careful since there is no way to know who is or isn’t vaccinated.
And I note that medical offices and even vets are still keeping covid precautions in place.   So that seems to be where we are after the mask off announcement."
2021-06-10 18:18,"Walensky’s decisions are so counter to the fundamental principles of public health that I am embarrassed to be a practitioner. Her reckless announcement about masks will likely be a case study in poor risk communication, decision making, and leadership for my public health students in the fall."
2021-06-10 18:21,"When I earned my MPH in Epidemiology in 1981, the CDC was respected as the source of national health data for all health/medical institutions and was taken as the model to copy by other nations. Top CDC officials (not necessarily the director) came on TV news during epidemics to update the public on the the status of the epidemic, the risks to persons and the plans for keeping us safe. These briefings told me we were in good hands. I don't recall D.C. being much involved in pontificating on public health matters in those days.

I knew it would take time to build back the CDC to its former glory, but I did expect the new director to resume communication to the public in this anxious time of our pandemic. I had read in JAMA that the daily briefings during Taiwan's first Covid 19 wave was highly effective in building trust. The briefings were given by a noted virologist who just happened to be Taiwan's VP.

Why Dr. Walensky, who certainly has the communication skills as well as the knowledge to take on this role, has not done so is a puzzlement. I'm guessing she's been caught up in the morass of the current CDC. 

But I wonder if Deputy Director Schuchat, who has shined in all her public announcements, could have shared the communications role with Dr. Walensky. I would have loved to hear her voice on the state of the pandemic. So I'm wondering, is this what the CDC has become, a storehouse of talent that doesn't get to surface?"
2021-06-10 18:22,"The CDC is actually not doing their due diligence in “following the science.” Other countries with access to the same data, like Germany, are not advocating for the emergency use authorization of MRNA vaccines in healthy children and teenagers. The British Medical Journal editorial board has spoken out against the use of these vaccines in children. The European vaccine passport system recognizes natural immunity as sufficient protection against covid infection, the CDC does not. The CDC vociferously defended the theater of outdoor masking when all the evidence pointed to the fact that there is virtually no outdoor spread of the virus. Their messaging is consistently inconsistent and more a reflection of current political attitudes and goals than actual empirical evidence."
2021-06-10 18:04,"The CDC’s inconsistent messaging has been especially damaging to children and working parents. It allowed teachers unions to meddle in its reopening announcement earlier this year, releasing guidance that was more cautious than the science indicates and that ultimately denied millions of children a swift return to school. 

Compare the CDC’s hamfisted messaging with that of the European CDC, which is simple, science-driven, and is not shy about weighing the significant harms of closed schools against the minimal harms of reopening. It also only recommends masks for kids older than 12. Where is our CDC on this?

Covid itself was a surprise to the world.
Dr. Walensky did not call Covid a hoax.  She did not recommend unproven therapies for its treatment.  She is not saying that Dr. Fauci caused the epidemic.  She is not minimizing the efficacy of masks.  
What she is saying is that those who are protected by vaccination for Covid may reconsider the necessity of mask wearing and have more freedom from that in their lives.  OK, some people were surprised at her opinion.  
Compared with our ignorance and the disinformation we had to cope with at the beginning of the pandemic, surprise would seem to me to be something we can manage. 
I hope we  can accept this Doctor's leadership, support it in the days to come in the face of our ignorance regarding the virus and our need to cope with the unknown course of the continuing pandemic.  
Friends, we are nowhere near the finish line with Covid.  I suspect there will be surprises to come."

But one thing puzzles me. If vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks, why do we need to continue wearing them in medical facilities and offices?  All of my doctors are vaccinated and I'm vaccinated, so why do they and I need to wear masks for routine appointments? Either it's safe to go maskless indoors or it's not. I have no problem wearing a mask and still wear one when I'm indoors with others when I don't know their vaccination status, but I think the CDC is sending mixed messages. If the vaccinated don't need masks in supermarkets, restaurants and movie theaters, why should medical facilities be any different?

If the CDC wants our trust, they need clear, detailed, consistent messaging."

How could you not know that the people who would immediately discard masks were the ones who had resisted them in the first place? And worse, now unvaccinated people have even less reason to get vaccinated as the numbers attest. I fear this was a cynical move made for economic reasons which will backfire."
2021-06-10 19:23,"Ed Yong in The Atlantic gives the non-PR-placement view of Walensky’s about-face(mask) here:  “Science doesn’t stand outside of society,” Cecília Tomori, an anthropologist and a public-health scholar at Johns Hopkins, told me. “You can’t just ‘focus on the science’ in the abstract,” and especially not when you’re a federal agency whose guidance has been heavily politicized from the get-go. In that context, it was evident that the new guidance “would send a cultural message that we don’t need masks anymore,” Tomori said. Anticipating those reactions “is squarely within the expertise of public health,” she added, and the CDC could have clarified how its guidelines should be implemented. It could have tied the lifting of mask mandates to specific levels of vaccination, or the arrival of worker protections. Absent that clarity, and with no way for businesses to even verify who is vaccinated, a mass demasking was inevitable. “If you’re blaming the public for not understanding the guidance—wow,” Duke’s Gavin Yamey said. “If people have misunderstood your guidance, your guidance was poor and confusing.”

2021-06-10 19:39,"When someone says that a person or institution “follows the science”, this is coded language that really means “uses science to pursue a political agenda”.   Case in point is her using school Union talking points to change CDC guidelines to satisfy school unions."
2021-06-10 19:56,"I think wearing a mask in public for over a year is enough, vaccine or not. There's a lot of stuff normal humans do that happens without a mask. I'm super happy she did that and gave the vaccine legitimacy. I can't imagine walking in everywhere wondering if I should wear a mask. The cases are going way down and vaccinated people have almost no risk."
2021-06-10 19:59,"So far, a mixed bag. And she certainly deserves more time to settle in and find her mojo. But, to answer the headline’s question, yes, the nation’s CDC leader must be more than a slave to science. For one, health is a dynamic not a single laboratory test. The director should prioritize and respect any particular source of “science” (which itself is imperfect) and avoid serious risks. But in any profession, especially those based on science and math, great leaders exercise greater vision and perspective. 

I recall Bloomberg’s failed presidential bid where he claimed the CDC was gutted by Trump.  The CDC has eleven thousand employees, most with advanced degrees, and large budgets.  She needs to build a better CDC. As a leader, she can’t coddle those who will wear masks alone in the bathtub, I agree that she should be guiding us back to normality as soon as reasonably possible. She relies a bit too much on the content cards just to her right, and the ease of which she evoked “systemic racism” in healthcare signaled that she just might be another political operative.  If blacks or any ethnic or poor (majority white) constituency isn’t getting access to health care, analyze and define the gaps and propose solutions. We need her to be above the political fray."
2021-06-10 20:06,"Dr. Walensky orients herself to pleasing powerful people. 

In Massachusetts she catered to the wishes of libertarian, business-first Gov. Baker (R). Now she caters to the goals of the Democratic Biden administration. 

If somewhere along the way, she discovered her own convictions, that would be very good for the country. Is it likely? We will see."
2021-06-10 19:55,"Thank You Dr. Walensky for restoring the CDC to a level of trustworthiness that it lost under DT!

Perhaps the CDC can create a panel of doctors to filter their messaging before releasing it to the public.  My guess is that the confusing messaging was meant as encouragement to get vaccinated, in other words a carrot: ""if you're vaccinated you can take of your mask in many settings"". The problem is that many people refused to wear masks until forced to and now they can take them off inside and nobody can say anything! Many of these are the same people who refuse to vaccinate. Consequently we can now have potential unvaccinated super-spreaders running around in indoor settings and not even a manager can intervene!

I think it would have been better to err on the side of caution by waiting till the vaccination rate was  much higher and daily  case numbers were lower before removing the mask mandates.

I think a carrot and stick policy would still be useful:

Carrots:
commercials that emphasize vaccine efficacy & safety; the patriotic, altruism of vaccinating: saving self, family, friends, community, healthcare workers, etc.; saving the economy; return to normal life

Sticks:
Vaccine passports with enforcement mechanism - no public travelling if you haven't been vaccinated; no public services; end of unemployment benefits; health insurance companies and Medicare no longer covering anything covid-19 related if you are capable but refuse to vaccinate; holding unvaccinated liable"
2021-06-10 20:08,I'm disappointed that the CDC did not maintain masking in indoor setting such as stores without a verification mechanism. It's meaningless otherwise.
2021-06-10 20:00,"Once you step out of the coastal, college educated, NYT-reading bubble, you realize that many people tuned out public health covid guidance a long time ago. This happened either because it was impractical (can't stay home when you have an in person service/labor job) or too complicated for folks who aren't science or news junkies already.

In this respect, I think Dr. Walensky understands the social engineering aspect of covid better than her critics. You need a crisp message to cut through the apathy and political noise. ""Get the shot, get your life back"" is both simple and scientifically accurate, in the sense that vaccines reduce your risk from covid to the level of other normal daily activities like driving a car or catching the flu.

Continuing to issue hair splitting, overly conservative recommendations that are ignored by the majority of citizens is no way to rebuild the CDC's credibility. Thank you to Dr. Walensky for realizing this and changing course."
2021-06-10 20:10,"Why would the CDC give the advice to stop wearing masks for vaccinated people when we have new variants cropping up around the World all the time that might outsmart the vaccines?
It seems it would have been prudent to keep them on.

Beijing, China has instituted strict measures again to fight a new outbreak.  Other areas around the world are having problems with more contagious and deadly variants.

Since this is a new disease it doesn't seem like now is the time to throw caution to the wind."
2021-06-10 20:09,"The headline “Is that enough?“ seems misplaced. And about “‘uncertainty and disappointment,’ from a senior C.D.C. scientist?  This is another institution slowly recovering from the previous administration’s damage, causing mistrust within and without. Cut them some slack, give them some time."
2021-06-10 20:12,"Does anybody expect other than such a heading from NYT about the new CDC head? But the fact is that this head is more political than the previous head? She reversed many positions to suit her political views regarding reopening of businesses, masks after getting vaccinated and school reopening. When TX governor opened his state I saw her shedding tears predicting disaster! But a month later she followed him!"

2021-06-10 20:31,"I’m confused by the comments of the honor system. The CDC recommendation for vaccinated people to shed their masks given isn’t based on an honor system. It’s based on a highly efficacious vaccine.

I’m vaccinated and still wear a mask indoors but no longer wear it outside and no longer have a panic attack every time I step outside."
2021-06-10 20:36,"Dr. Walensky, unfortunately, is still just an epidemiologist facing a new and unknown disease and having far too much faith in short studies that are unverified and unreplicated.  

Like Dr. Fauci trained and experienced with AIDS and Ebola, slow moving, easily traceable diseases, they applied what they knew -- test and trace -- without considering what covid-19 WAS.  It is an airborne disease that could spread long before the infected knew they were infected.

Looking across the world and the country that in spite of many varied and different responses to the virus the most striking thing to observe is that NOTHING MADE ANY DIFFERENCE except absolute lockdown.  And absolute lockdown simply delayed the inevitable surge when the lockdown had to end.  The virus moved geographically through the US and around the world, the surge in March was driven by Michigan, a state that at the time had one of the lowest rates of confirmed infections. A surge was predictable and not a sign of impending doom.  Dr. Walensky ignoring such a simple fact and crying on TV does not generate faith and confidence.  

A simple recognition that much of the pandemic was inevitable rather than this ""doctor as savior"" complex would have made a world of difference and secured a much higher level of trust in the CDC as an institution."
2021-06-10 20:58,"Despite her quavering voice and pleads warning of ""impending doom"", the Biden administration did what?  Shut down commercial air traffic?  Request governor's close all schools?  Shutter Post Office doors?  Follow the science?  NO!  Faces with IMPENDIND DOOOM, our political leaders choose to ignore her.  We need to ask why?  While we are doing this, we need an independent Commission (actually several) at the Federal and State level that examine Covid-19 and our responses.  We can do this without pointing fingers since no one has a perfect score here.

Of all the phrases that deserve to end in the graveyard of language along with ""roiled"" is ""follow the science"".  Even today, scientists looking the the genome sequencing cannot decide if the Covid-19 occurred in nature or in a laboratory.  Everyday we have new information and new conclusions, as it should be.  We do not have certainty in the implied by that phrase.  

The CDC did a poor job of commutating along with many many others.  Explaining risk and certainty in more detail would be a start.  A class in stats for all Americans, especially the Press, would be a start.

Let's learn now so that the next time we are warned of impending doom, we treat it with the seriousness that phrase contemplates.  And aske that we are humble and tolerant enough to understand that it is not certain."
2021-06-10 21:05,"It is ironic to characterize Dr. Walensky as someone who only follows the science.  Someone who views herself solely as a scientist would have confined herself to announcing the CDC's scientific conclusion that fully vaccinated people were unlikely to be infected by or to transmit the coronavirus and then let others decide the implications of that conclusion for public policy.  Walensky, however, decided to wade into the realm of making policy by decreeing that fully vaccinated people could stop wearing masks in most public places.  In doing so, she failed to consider how businesses were supposed to determine whether their maskless customers were in fact vaccinated or just lying about it, something that any competent policymaker would have done.  She also failed to give sufficient advance warning to important stakeholders, like state and local officials, who could have provided valuable input on the likely consequences of the CDC's announcement."
2021-06-10 21:08,"I completely respect Dr. Walensky's competence.  However, I have often found CDC messaging to be equivocal.  I would like to see the guidance made crisp and clear when it comes out of the conference room and into the public domain."
2021-06-10 20:45,"Dr. Walensky is terminally tone and tenor deaf on the deeply rooted divided American politics of masks, social distancing,  washing hands, contact tracing, isolation, treatment, testing, vaccines and vaccinations in the public sector."
2021-06-10 20:31,More PR blitz to try and restore the CDC's reputation.  The facts speak for themselves: they are inept and their priorities are political.
2021-06-10 21:18,"Dr Walensky, VP Harris, same old story of holding bold women to impossible standards, especially when they open their mouths."
2021-06-10 21:17,"Dr. Walensky has a problem. She's a highly intelligent, competent, accomplished professional. But her audience -- tens of millions of Americans -- is nothing like her. Following the science is the right thing to do, but the public message has to take into account how that message will be received and how the instructions will be carried out. She badly flubbed that with the announcement concerning indoor mask-wearing for fully vaccinated people.

Unfortunately, the same forces of ignorance, stupidity, and selfishness that have helped fuel an insurrection and an absurd, delusional belief in a stolen election have also helped kill hundreds of thousands of Americans. Many unnecessarily.

I have both hope and confidence that Dr. Walensky will do better in the future. We certainly need her to craft science-based messages that take into account the audience and the sad reality of how millions of Americans will choose to hear and interpret her advice. There are millions of Americans with compromised immune systems and it is likely that the CDC's mishandled messaging put most, if not all, of them at greater risk of both illness and death.

I wish her well; we need her at her best.

Note: However, if that is what Dr. Walensky eats for lunch, it is probably a good thing that she isn't a nutritionist."
2021-06-10 20:34,"I don't believe the CDC director always follows the science.

On its June 4th report, the CDC cherry picked the data on children and adolescents covid hospitalization numbers by cutting it at April 24, 2021 while the data was available thru end of May and told a different story.  They did so for political reasons.

It is true that the number of hospitalization for ages 5-17 increased in April 2021.  However, it also increased for all all age groups with the 5-17 years old having the lowest hospitalization numbers compare to older groups.

CDC also conveniently left out that hospitalization numbers for 5-17 years  old started to decrease in May and continue that down trajectory at the time they raised the alarm on June 4th.  

This down trajectory is to be expected since the number of cases are going down nationally.

<a href=""https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#covidnet-hospitalization-network"" target=""_blank"">https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#covidnet-hospitalization-network</a>

2021-06-10 21:37,"It's unfortunate that people don't use half their brain.  I do not rely on the CDC (or my doctors for that matter) to make my health decisions for me.  I started wearing a mask last Spring and stopped sterilizing surfaces based on research reported in this very paper.  People died in those West Coast choirs and studies showed how the virus spread by aerosol -- obviously more than ten feet!!! Studies also showed the virus did not spread on surfaces.  Ergo wear your triple-layer mask and don't hang out indoors with people you don't live with. I raced to get a vaccine in February and felt safer.  Yet I still wore a mask in large indoor groups.  I am not too concerned at this point, but slightly so because my vaccine is only 85% effective against the new variants.  But you are free to interpret this science to suit you.  I read the research, and then I make my decisions for me.  So far so good. 71, out and about, and did not get Covid."
2021-06-10 21:40,"Not adequately addressed by leadership at the CDC, both present and past, was the need for rapid, decisive reaction to looming pandemic. Hopefully a new Covid variant, one that does not care that someone has been vaccinated, will not emerge, likewise, we can hope that the world’s population will not  be exposed to a yet to be discovered pathogen lurking out there.  Should either occur, rapid health care advisory next time around would likely avoid overwhelming our health care system and help save thousands of lives lost needlessly during the current pandemic!"

I believe people like Dr. Walensky know well that all the expertise in the world with the best science adds up to optimal guidance but not to guarantees. She and the rest of us are confronting an incredible public health challenge."

2021-06-10 22:09,"Dr Walensky fixed what's fixable - she acknowledged that genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 strains in US was abysmally poor and within 2 weeks from her appointment the number of sequenced samples quadrupled. CDC primary function is to do surveillance of current and emerging pathogens, which is something that Redfield didn't want to focus on, and couldn't, due to his incompetence. All those advisories are superfluous bureaucratic emanations, always were and always will be political. 
I am glad she got on Gilead about remdesivir price tho. However, it's not CDC job, but FDA's, and these guys were mislead into giving remdesivir the EUA. Not only it's ineffective, this ATP analog doesn't really inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2. And as soon as scientists not on Gilead's payroll started looking at it, a lot of other problems emerged. Still half of the hospitalized patients remdesivir injections. Maybe she can talk to her sister at FDA about it?"
2021-06-10 22:17,"She's confusing and unconvincing, and changes her recommendations - which are often poorly stated in the first place.

2021-06-10 23:01,"When Dr. Walensky announced the no-mask policy, she said the CDC was basing the policy on science. I felt that she had failed to take into account the science of psychology.  It was obvious to me that many unvaccinated people who doubted the science of Covid would take off their masks, putting the rest of us in danger and causing us to feel we needed to keep wearing our masks."
2021-06-10 23:29,"I respect Dr. Walensky's experience and credentials, and had high expectations for her success.  But, the range of these comments really tell the story of how lost, demoralized and divided we are, even ardent NYT subscribers.   The CDC has made so many mistakes, and of course many of those mistakes preceded her.  Nevertheless, one of the top requirements of her position, which she should have considered before accepting the role, is to restore the public trust.  She could be the most technically capable person in the room, but if she is emotional, inconsistent, plaintive, and subject to influence-peddling (are you listening, teachers?) - as she has been, then she will fail.  In my opinion, she is failing.  It all started with the glistening eyes and the sense of ""impending doom"".  Really?  I am persuaded by well-researched data, agile and sincere handling of evolving guidance, and personal accountability for mis-steps. No one is interested in her moods.  I don't pay the least attention to her, and am disappointed she is doing more to set back women in STEM fields than anyone I can think of."
2021-06-10 23:32,"In a rapidly developing pandemic, the CDC needs to make timely educated guesses. It didn’t warn the virus spreads through aerosols endangering anyone in an enclosed space until May, when the devastating summer surge was well under way. Anecdotal but strong evidence from super-spreader events at funerals, business meetings, parties, E.R.s, and from South Korea indicated aerosol spread in early March. Shutting down indoor spaces and making masks compulsory then, before Trump inspired the anti-mask reaction, might have slowed the pandemic enough for the health system to keep pace.

Many unvaccinated people are now entering stores and other closed spaces in New Jersey, imperiling front line workers by exposing them to the coronavirus they might be carrying. 
That early blunder occurred when Dr Walensky said that science indicated students could return to schools, but the White House immediately disowned her position, indicating she was speaking in her personal capacity. That no doubt undermined Dr Walensky’s confidence and led to some later missteps. That first event also raised doubts about the proclaimed priority science would now have at the CDC.

What was most telling to me in the “ take off your masks” debacle was that few of any local public health or government officials were consulted or even given advance notice. This speaks to a real arrogance and politically tin ear.  What world are they living in?   In my world,  people who are vaccinated don’t trust the ones who aren’t to wear their masks.  It just made a tense situation even worse, as people slowly began to transition out of pandemic mode. 

Basically,  maybe good science, but awful public policy."
2021-06-10 23:56,"Oh please.

Scientists are speaking directly to the CDC?  Nancy Messonier, who was the head of the CDC task force on Covid and reported to the White House, just happened to be removed from her position at the exact time that Walensky supposedly received the “science” that led to the new maskless indoors guidance?  And Anne Schucat, the number 2 who had only been in the position for 6 months and is the person who actually ran the CDC, announced her resignation within days of the new maskless indoors guidance?  These are coincidences?

There is no logic to why masks are required indoors in certain situations but not others.  How is that science?

Walensky tells the public that the vaccinated can’t get the virus, let alone transmit it, when that’s absolutely untrue.  Is she lying if just that incompetent?

The CDC specifically discouraged vaccinated people who gave been exposed to the virus from getting tested.  Why is that?

None of this is science.  All of this are lies and manipulation which is just another way of saying it’s politics.

I have absolutely no trust in Walensky and the CDC.

We’re on our own."

She did not speak in a reassuring, scientific manner...her style was too emotional (Yes, I'm calling another woman too emotional for this job!). Springing the mask news on us with no warning was irresponsible: it was not just a blip but major public health policy error with serious consequences.  I don't think you should get time to clean up your act at this level. I hope she'll go back to MGH to continue her good work there and leave this job to someone else."
2021-06-11 0:10,Her empathy is limited: she ignored the plight and risks to under-12 unvaccinated children and their families. And fails to champion vaccine access and delivery to our poorest citizens and residents. Also hope someone will teach her the basics of change management and dynamics.
2021-06-11 0:11,For scientific knowledge to translate into effective policy it must take into account the sometimes irrational aspects of human behavior.  When the CDC issued its latest masking guidance for the effectively vaccinated it failed to account for the politicization of the populace regarding masks and of the hesitancy of stores to act as police as to who is vaccinated.  Suddenly it was okay to go into stores without a mask and the unvaccinated have incurred much higher rates of infection while the immune compromised are forced to return to extreme isolation to avoid contact with maskless people who are known vectors of infection.
2021-06-11 0:12,"Sorry but the abrupt, irresponsible, clueless in light of the vast disparity of the vaccinated and never vaxxers, announcement by Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the New C.D.C. director was anything but a ""small misstep"".

To Dr. Fauci:  I disagree reading your quoted excuse for Dr.Walensky whom you suggested for the job. 

The article noted:

""Dr. Walensky and the C.D.C. declined to comment on how the mask recommendations were handled. 

But Dr. Fauci said that he believed some small missteps were inevitable, and that Dr. Walensky was a quick study.""

With a potential  large number of more at risk due to rampant and more contagious dangerous Covid variants expanding beyond the UK  (already here) ...I wonder ""What was she thinking?""

At this point, anyone over 12 who wants a vaccine can get one. Those under 12 are at extremely low risk of getting Covid and even lower risk of serious illness.

I’m all for giving Dr Walensky another chance, but I’m very concerned. She went from impending doom (which was right based on how all the other countries are now responding to the Delta (from India) variant) to basically announcing a free for all. 

Maybe she doesn’t know that what she did meant the unvaccinated are the ones who don’t wear masks, that plenty of states would still only have roughly ONE THIRD fully-vaccinated their state, that those of us who got vaccinated felt that yet again we’re forced to bear the weight of everyone else, that schools would say no masks for kids who are under 12 and currently cannot be vaccinated in fall, that clubs and concerts and throngs of unmasked people would start gathering with no way to know who is vaccinated or not (except in a few places like NY w/ the excelsior pass), and that the confidence of many of us in the CDC that was beginning to be regained was lost again. 

My quiet opinion is that Dr Walensky is fantastic but that she is listening to everyone else instead of what SHE knows is right. Hopefully, she’ll be able to openly admit what has gone wrong and do better in the future."

It seems she got it right on the most important announcement she has made: “Data since the announcement [that fully vaccinated people do not need to wear mask] seem to have proved Dr. Walensky correct: Infections are still declining, even as much of the country reopens at a vigorous pace.”

Some people freaked out because they did not trust the science. They were wrong."
2021-06-11 1:14,We will find out in a month whether or not take off masks decision was correct
2021-06-11 1:18,Isn't science 'real world'?
2021-06-11 1:19,"At  the end of March, Walensky's view of the pandemic was ""a sense of impending doom.""  She exhorted citizens to use all prescribed mitigation measures to tamp down infections.

But by mid-May Walensky had essentially flipped the US to a maskless-free-for-all.

Her sudden swings from morbid to victorious are not the mark of a wise, temperate leader.  

When she threw the full weight of the CDC behind the 3 ft = 6ft study, she was kowtowing to the politics of liberal newspapers, as well as the expressed wishes of Trump, Biden and the larger business community, who desperately urged school districts to return to in-person learning.

The study ""proving"" 3 ft distance btw students is as safe (or unsafe) as 6 ft is riddled with caveats.  It is supported entirely by a blizzard of statistical geek-speak guaranteed to snow even the better mathematicians among us.

Tellingly, the authors admit ""our methods were only able to capture official policy, not real-world implementation of the policy."" We can infer that the authors never did in-person measurements. In plain English: the authors relied totally on second hand paperwork. 

They did no contact tracing, did not test for asymptomatic cases or consider varying degrees of ventilation. No differentiation between grade levels, failing to account for older kids's greater propensity for infection.

Walensky's support of this highly flawed study is perfectly consistent with her other unhelpful missteps."

How about the “real “ world is not attuned to science! Because of that, there will be bigger prices to pay than we are already paying. 

Science is what is real, in spite of the alternate believers who think if they dismiss science it doesn’t exist. 

They are the ones who are and will be responsible for the consequences. Nature, unfortunately, sees only the gross offenses, wherefore humanity in general receives her counter offenses. 

I, for one, do not accept alignment with science bashing. I firmly oppose that unwise and dangerous position for the sake of democracy and for my grandchildren."
2021-06-11 2:13,Please.....no dumbing down.  No lowest common denominator.  Plenty of smart folks who care and will listen.
2021-06-11 2:22,"I wish Dr. Walensky well in ""finding her way.""  But really, it is just common sense to see that it matters from a public health standpoint what influence people not wearing masks will have on whether the unvaccinated wear masks.  One got the impression that the C.D.C. hadn't actually thought that through, or at any rate that's how it seemed to me."
2021-06-11 2:54,"This is mostly a puff piece, probably trying to build an emotional connection between the readers and the director of the CDC. Many have lost faith in the organization, and they’re certainly on a campaign to rebuild trust. That will be better done by watching the CDC consistently make data-driven guidelines and communicate them effectively, rather than appeal to our emotional sympathies for a working mother. I’m sure that Dr. Walensky is a wonderful wife and mother, and is a well-respected physician in her community. But telling me about her zoom dinner sessions with her family does not change my opinion on her disastrous leaderships in her short tenure as CDC director."
2021-06-11 3:22,"Many of my most respected and beloved colleagues in academic medicine are far removed from the perceptions, fears, and yes, illogic of “regular “ folks. I seldom hear an in-depth long form interview with them in which they do not lapse into esoteric terminology. Many of them have spent their entire lives among people as elite as themselves, and  the Institutes and the heights of academia may not foster the common touch. Ongoing community practice would help, but is often seen as a distraction from grants and publications. They need to remember that the “regular” folks are great in number and get to make their own choices, and that respect and communication are as important for IRL success as is evidence. Sort of a counterpoint to peer review."
2021-06-11 3:30,"CDC has long been full of dedicated scientists. However their chronic glaring weakness has long been, in addition to inability to manage medium to large scale outbreaks and lab breaches, poor communication to the lay public.  Huge blind spot. 

Was strange to watch Wallensky withdraw some mask orders only weeks after tearfully pleading for full precautions, but I am hopeful that she can change these past weaknesses. Good luck to her."
2021-06-11 3:50,"I interpreted Walensky's mask advice very differently. To me it was the sign of an agency that was becoming more considerate of how its advice was interpreted by the wider public. It was a recognition that the message of 'once you get vaccinated, nothing will substantially change in your life, except you can now dine outdoors' was not particularly persuasive. 

In order to encourage more Americans to get vaccinated, the CDC needed to broadcast the fact that these vaccines are the key to normality and are incredibly effective. Walensky's mask advice was not shocking. What was shocking was the fact that the CDC had been so conservative about the benefits of vaccines in the months prior. Of course, this is not surprising - the CDC is a very conservative agency when it comes to health. Its guidelines tend towards favouring zero risk (as Aaron Carroll noted in his op-ed). It puts forwards dozens of guidelines that the vast majority of Americans simply ignore. I think it's a good thing that we have a CDC director who is more attuned to how the American public will react to their guidelines so that they can maximise overall benefit."
2021-06-11 3:55,"I appreciate The NY Times addressing this. I have been extraordinarily disappointed for this reason - the head of any government agency is responsible for the forward facing, public policy messaging that reflects the best information for which that agency is responsible. 

The first giant public policy statement coming from the CDC should have been one that encompassed the majority of the population. An easy one - masks are no longer needed Outdoors for anyone loosely gathered and not in medical need, such as in immunosuppressive therapy. This is a great first step at getting everyone to move forward together. It is simple enough to understand that being outside not all crowded together means the risk is minuscule. The NY Times did an article on this, and this could have - and likely should have - been the mid-Spring declaration to the 300  million citizens of this country. 

Public policy is for the majority, not a tactical objective aimed at a minority or partiality of a population. Most businesses, governments, and churches were left scrambling by the new directive to go maskless indoors if vaccinated. 

Imagine the alternative - everyone maskless outdoors would have meant no masks during school recess, no masks for outdoor dining, no masks walking the sidewalk, and no confusion in facilities still requiring masks like hospitals and airports. 

That is public policy, policy for all."
2021-06-11 3:59,"Science doesn’t keep pace with climate change. This is plain to see. We need to be more honest as a society about how the pace and workflow of disease science actually keeps pace with human decision making. We don’t just need to ‘understand the science,’ although literacy is important. We need to understand what science can tell us about what we need to know, and what it cannot. In this respect, both reporters and scientists need to up their game, no matter who’s in charge."
2021-06-11 4:09,"Many of us who are unfortunate members of the Lyme community have a lingering and legitimate distrust of the CDC from its mishandling of what should have been (and still should be) an acknowledgment of a serious infectious disease epidemic.  The agency's handling of Lyme appeared to have been governed by politics rather than science, and it set diagnosis and treatment back for decades.  Among other things, grants appeared to have been awarded based on politics, and some CDC officials had alleged conflicts of interest because of their investments in an ineffective vaccine.  The agency's public pronouncements on Lyme continue to be based on seriously outdated, and in too many instances, inaccurate information.  The agency has not served us well.  They missed lessons from Lyme that could and should have been applied to Covid-19, for example, the long-term impact of pathogens on the immune system. As one of my physicians remarked when I first went to him for treatment of Lyme, ""welcome to the confluence of politics and medicine."" Dr. Fauci's tenure at the CDC has also been marked by some political miscalculations and missteps (for example, discouraging us from wearing masks at the outbreak of the pandemic, for political rather than scientific reasons).  Dr. Walensky seems like a potential breath of fresh air.   But how she handles the Lyme epidemic, in addition to Covid, will be an important part of how I and many others ultimately view her."
2021-06-11 4:30,"Wishing Dr. Walensky and the CDC the very best. Going forward, our risk from COVID will be far less than other risks, including the collateral damage mentioned here. We have to note, for the sake of history, that the collateral damage mentioned is almost universally caused not by the virus shutting down medical services but by our own policies.

Those policies made sense for a virus that many expected to kill 4 million by now, not 600,000. It’s also unclear that the policies have done anything to substantially reduce the death toll for herd immunity, which we likely reached in many places in the US back in November/December 2020 prior to the arrival of vaccines (for an ongoing pandemic, the herd immunity threshold is the cumulative incidence at the peak, not the unreachable “end” of the pandemic).

The CDC as a non-regulatory agency has had little to do with these policies, and their reputation deserves to be top-notch, I’ve seen the CDC working intensely, and very early, with tribes in Montana to prepare them for vaccinations, ultimately helping them have the highest rates of vaccinations of all ethnic groups in the state. While vaccines may not have stopped the pandemic, this stakeholder engagement addressing health inequities is good for long-term relationships and trust, and I’m excited to see more engagement like that. The pandemic is super complicated, but the CDC remains awesome in my eyes."
2021-06-11 4:54,"I’m sure she’s a competent administrator. I just wish the CDC understood how powerful its advice is even in the late-stage pandemic, when the true risk of hospital overwhelm and mass suffering are receding further each day, and when we really don’t beed to be fine-tuning the restriction dials any more. One example: The CDC’s summer camp guidance was too tepid and too late, so us compliant blue state dwellers  are still sending our kids to outdoor camps in totally unnecessary and wildly uncomfortable masks. I fear what will happen in the fall for schools in districts where the mantra of “follow the science” means “follow the provisional data and shifting recommendations that the CDC announced before the last school board meeting.” I’ve been a good soldier for 15 months, masking and distancing and educating my kids at home; but now that the pandemic threat is visibly dissipating, I wish the CDC would give us all permission to not hang on its every word."
2021-06-11 5:05,"For a medical expert and head of the CDC, she has rather poor sleeping habitats, as does Dr. Fauci. Both of them should be well aware that such a lack of sufficient sleep is not only a direct cause of impaired cognitive capacity and poor decision making, but is also directly linked to an increased risk of, among others, high blood pressure, coronary disease, dementia, and thus death in general. It would be about time that our leaders, particularly those in health, provide better examples for healthy sleeping habits instead of publicly advertising terrible sleep behavior as some sort of batch of honor."

I believe the premature relaxing of restrictions is going to lead to more deaths, and just when we were actually getting somewhere."

One day they might learn to read eua fillings, but I am still waiting for that day."

2021-06-11 3:44,"It was  June 4th 2021 that Dr Walensky manipulated the data on children and adolescents covid hospitalization to push hesitant parents to vaccinate their 12 to 15 years old.

Fast forward June 11th, 2021(7 days later), the CDC is conveying an emergency meeting on 'rare' inflammation of the heart muscle that is predominantly observed in male adolescents and young men between the age of 16 to 30 after administering the covid mRNA vaccines.

Given that the CDC was informed about this adverse reaction back in April by the Israelis and this information was all over the news, why didn't Dr Walensky follow the science by taking a sensible approach and only recommending the vaccine for  adolescents who are at high risks of developing a severe case of covid?  

I don't expect much to come out of this meeting as this situation could have been avoided."
2021-06-11 4:53,"Dr Walensky is certainly an excellent communicator at the personal level. But the 'masks off if vaccinated' was a faux pas.

While scientifically sound ( a person can't infect or be infected if vaccinated) the broad swath of American are health illiterate and who wants to wear a mask anyway?

No one can proved they are fully vaccinated and there are plenty of dolts who will pretend they have been inoculated  when in fact they are fully capable of transmitting infection and have no intention of being vaccinated.

At every step of this pandemic, the impatience of Americans has only prolonged the agony. Walensky should know this basic communication issue."
2021-06-11 5:17,"Dr. Walensky never worked in a health department. If you look at her publications in PubMed, you will see that in 2020, in the middle of the pandemic, she led her large group on how to model nicotine effects on individuals. As an infectious disease doctor. That’s right.

She’s also worked on reducing the costs for penicillin and related antibiotic desensitization for allergic people. 

She also somehow got her MPH at Harvard at the same time she was doing her infectious disease fellowship. Those of us who spent 10 1/2 months, seven hours a day in classrooms, and had homework every night, and had to pass exams, long after doing our subspecialty fellowships, well, we must be slow learners.

It is interesting that Dr. Fauci was her initial proposer and proponent. Covid is not AIDS. After poor Bob Redfield, America has no idea what the CDC director should even look like. The focus on re-opening schools is being led by a 20 year expert in birth defects. The focus on making air safe in restaurants and bars is being led by two violence prevention people and an injury prevention person, non-physicians, none with training in pneumonia. But they publish CDC‘s official position in JAMA. 

FDA just approved a useless very expensive drug for Alzheimer’s disease. Americans should understand that our country’s medical leadership, with few exceptions, is frankly awful. Mini very fine people doing the work will never be permitted to lead by medicine’s current rulers."
2021-06-11 5:22,I was embarrassed for the previous administrator who bowed to political pressure. It will take years to correct.
2021-06-11 5:23,"When the pandemic started it seemed many people in less urban locales, where I work, were really resistant to wearing masks. Now you can't get people to remove masks even though they have been vaccinated. No taking off masks until until ""everyone's been vaccinated."" A day which will never come. Has everyone been vaccinated against measles, DPT, meningitis, pneumococcus, the flu, etc.? Shall we wear masks forever? It started with hand-wringing on the right and ends with hand-wringing on the left. I say bravo to Dr. Walensky for talking like a scientist instead of a beltway social influencer."
2021-06-11 5:21,"Well, it could have been worse.  Imagine if Dr Lena Wen was CDC director!

The plan by the right now is to put enough conspiracy theory out there so the MSM picks it up and Biden crumbles and fires Fauci.  Then the GOP will blame Fauci for the pandemic and claim Trump is off the hook.   And 76% of Republicans and 41% of Independents will agree it was all Fauci's fault.

The parallel attack with this will be to continue to claim the vaccines are dangerous (today one scientist said it magnetized the body!), Murdoch publications will run with this and vaccine rates will grind to a halt allowing the pandemic to lurk in the background throughout the Biden administration.

The GOP will characterize this as government run amok forcing unsafe vaccines on the public just like they do in China.

And, of course the grand daddy conspiracy hypothesis of them all, the rebirth of the right wing created Wuhan lab leak story, with ZERO new evidence offered today to justify the MSM walking back what they said 18 months ago and only Republican outrage as their source.

Now, when can I get my covid booster shot?  Shouldn't be hard to get with all the extra doses nobody wants to take."
2021-06-11 5:39,"I've had a terribly difficult time trying to convince my children of this because candor often leaves us feeling awkward, but even well-intended lies erode trust. Once eroded, it takes a lifetime to restore. Not my opinion; just a law of the universe."
2021-06-11 6:14,"Has Dr. Walensky ever worked at all or for an extended period outside of academic medicine? I've been in academia on and off for years but I intentionally chose early on and during periods of my career to work OUTSIDE of academia. That's because medicine's culture and the people you encounter really vary a lot depending on whether you are at a private boutique practice, in a university clinic, at the VA, in a rural/ single-MD clinic, or at a community health center. I'm constantly surprised how different they are. 

A lot of intelligent, influential physicians work in academia their whole lives and don't see how other places work yet most patients don't receive their care at Johns Hopkins and Mass Gen. That was a driving reason why I chose to mix up where I worked. My interest is improving quality of care and I realized that any suggestions I came up with had to be applicable/ acceptable/ adjusted to non-academic/ non-urban  locations. 

This may not explain what happened with Dr. Walensky and the CDC's communication issues but I do wonder. I've collaborated with the CDC on various public communication projects, albeit not with COVID-19. We discuss not just content but format and tone."
2021-06-11 6:14,"It usually takes years for science to give us definitive conclusions.  In the meantime, false notions frequently prevail.  The earth at the center of the universe.  The universe expanding and contracting. The flat earth. False explanations for the Permian extinction.  Inconsistent theories of quantum mechanics and relativity.  And on and on.

It can take millennia to correct false scientific beliefs.  But when it comes to COVID, the need for quick solutions has condensed the process drastically.  Everything we know about COVID we have learned in a year, which is decidedly not enough time.  

Those who claim that anyone who doesn't believe in science is an ignoramus overlooks the fact that most COVID science is terribly rushed.  So much of what is taken as proven may be as bad the flat earth theory.  Scientists too often commit to speculative notions.  And when politicians call for quick solutions, scientists are too ready to give them what they want.

 Masks have divided the nation.  And there are paper masks and cloth masks, kerchiefs and shirt collars drawn up.  They can't be equally effective.  And whether one is better than the rest is a matter of great importance.  But so much attention has been given to rebutting  those who don't wear masks, that the CDC  and the public doesn't bother much with what is the best type of mask.  Opposition to  anti-maskers is politics prevailing over science. And it's all because science was never meant to be rushed."
2021-06-11 6:37,"She seems to be a clinician, but CDC is a public health agency and needs to be fully cognizant of how its pronouncements affect the general public, public health departments, other government agencies at state and federal levels and, sometimes, the administration.  She needs to learn how to tread carefully and consider her messaging and give people a heads-up in advance so advice can be appropriately coordinated."
2021-06-11 6:44,"The early months saw a lot of confusion everywhere in the world.  
Covid was a new virus and there were a lot of unknowns; naturally there were mistakes. 

One issue that could have had faster understanding was airborne transmission. There was a lot of debate about droplets vs. aerosols.   There was (and still is) political and economic pressure to not acknowledge that covid is airborne. 

The acknowledgment of an airborne virus means that indoor ventilation must be better addressed- in workplaces and building codes for homes etc. 
There are many workplace environments that are simply not suitable in a pandemic like covid19. 
Places with many unvaccinated people in close quarters- with no nearby windows and no fresh air circulation. 
Paper or cloth masks don’t help much if there isn’t fresh air circulation.  
They are only a crude filter in an environment where air stagnates. 

From the beginning, there was business pressure on politicians to direct health authorities to minimize talk of airborne transmission when it was clear that people spending long hours in unventilated environments were getting sick and dying."
2021-06-11 7:14,"I am surprised about the sheer number of negative comments here. I was very excited about Dr. Walensky taking the helm at the CDC and I continue to be enthusiastic about her. Dr. Walensky has intellectual heft, expertise, commitment to science, empathy, integrity, courage, and is widely viewed as a great leader.

I think that she and her staff need to balance some social science along with the natural sciences going forward. Taking into account both the scientific research and the sociocultural context will be key to being effective in her role, especially given even the domains of medicine and public health now have been ""infected"" by political ideology.

Nonetheless, Dr. Walensky's judgment has proven to be correct. Therefore, I think that we all should give her more benefit of the doubt. And, be grateful that we have someone of her caliber - as an intellectual, as a leader, and as someone who genuinely cares about the American people (instead of power and self-preservation) - heading up the CDC."
2021-06-11 7:22,"I think Walensky's been finding her feet and that her recent decision simply to announce that most folks who are vacinated are protected againt Covid was brilliant. The nanny approach simply does not work with this country, even more so after Mr. Trump had so politicized the pandemic. What she did thereby was give out welcome information for those who have been vaccinated, and left society to work out how to make use of it. The endless whining and carping of those who will never be satisfied anyway certainly resonates with those who preferred Mr. Trump's approach."
2021-06-11 8:01,"The CDC’s job is first and foremost clear and implementable guidelines for keeping diseases at bay. Rochelle Walensky has failed there. 

How will the youth and kids who cannot yet vaccinated be protected if we say masks need not be worn by vaccinated people in most settings? How can someone distinguish the vaccinated from the charlatans? The country does not have vaccine passports and the vaccination rates are abysmal in quite a few states. We really should have waited until 90% of the population is vaccinated before removing mask mandates. 

Also, all outlets should start publishing COVID deaths among the vaccinated and unvaccinated. This will push the vaccine deniers to get vaccinated."
2021-06-11 8:13,"Walensky's masking flipflop got the Republicans off her back, threw responsibility completely into the public's lap, naively or cynically dismissed antivaxxers'/maskers' likelihood to lie and unmask, and caused millions of cases of whiplash.  While the vaccines have excellent results, masking and social distance remain critical in covid hotspots.  Local and state health leaders in some of these areas have urged caution, and many citizens wisely continue to get vaxxed and mask up until case numbers are safe."
2021-06-11 9:11,"I think the CDC needs to decide what it is. Is it an organization that just reports the science and the best advice to stay safe. Or are they an organization that balances science with social aspects like any politician in a leadership position (e.g., governor, mayor, etc)
My preference would be the former so we have one place where we get the best advice possible and have individuals and the political structure decide what to do with it."
2021-06-11 9:35,Really? Follow the science is her mantra. 10 weeks ago she felt a sense of impending doom. 6 weeks later the CDC lifted the mask mandate. No discussion of immunity from infection (yep see the new Cleveland Clinic study). It is hard to take ANYTHING she or the CDC says seriously. She is either unprepared for the job or a windmill blowing in the wind of political opinion.
2021-06-11 9:59,Dr. Walensky is a Scientist and not a Politician. That is what the C.D.C. needs. Has she seemingly contradicted herself at times? Yes she has. That's Science. As more facts are uncovered a true Scientist factors in those facts and at times finds that the original premise was incorrect.
2021-06-11 10:50,"""'There are two things happening at the same time,' she said. 'It’s my responsibility to tell both of those stories.'""

FANTASTIC observation - a sign of authentic leadership."
2021-06-11 11:41,"This is a PR piece: her sudden mask guidance was a huge misstep--done without informing most if not all of other members of the CDC, no input from behavioral scientists and her compelling ""science"" was a study of masked health care workers. The result was to abruptly change policy and result in more risk to the unvaccinated and immunocompromised. At the time of her sudden epiphany, many eligible people weren't fully vaccinated.
Why didn't Dr. Walensky speak for this piece? Dr. Fauci is being utilized to rehabilitate her image.
As a physician, a person who has some increased risk, I have no trust in her--it wasn't a small misstep, it was a debacle of a bombshell and not tied to true science--vaccination/case numbers.
Cases are rampant amongst the unvaccinated and essential workers are at high risk and I find that well meaning private businesses misinterpret policy and cite HIPAA to explain why they can't ask for proof of vaccination.
Any scientist knows that scientific studies are often not replicable and have inherent bias. There is nuance and then there's Dr. Walensky.
I mask and am sick and tired of being shamed for it.
But then, I also read the literature and to the best of my ability, understand it and realize that risk to individual isn't always the policy for populations.
She might be a smart person, but her mask guidance was exceptionally poorly done and I do wonder why the lack of coordination with her agency and other stakeholders."
2021-06-11 12:33,"There are plenty of intelligent and inquisitive people in the country who would understand and appreciate the science behind the decision made by the CDC to unmask the fully vaccinated (even though Covid vaccines do not seem to prevent transmission). Unfortunately we do not receive scientific explanations from the CDC, just blanket statements, presumably made for political reasons or to manipulate the general public. I will be making my own decisions about my health as the CDC has lost all credibility."
2021-06-11 14:29,"I don't whether Dr. Walensky, despite her impeccable credentials, was following the science or the politics when she issued the guidance to allow mask removal if vaccinated inside as well as outside in public spaces.  For some strange reason, the Biden administration thought that this would be an inducement to the reluctant to get vaccinated.  Of course, all the latter had to do was lie about their vaccination status if asked.  Now we have the Wild West even in the little streets of Provincetown, where store owners who want to maintain a mask mandate have to confront irascible tourists who refuse to wear a mask.  This has left people with the least power, sometimes very young adults, trying to enforce the mask rule for the shop.  But, when politics trump science, the lowest on the totem pole often pay the most."
2021-06-11 15:01,"The CDC’s revised guidance for vaccinated people was a major blunder because it made it difficult to maintain mask mandates and empowered the anti-maskers. The effect was immediate, with states and most major chain stores dropping their mask mandates.  It also made it more difficult for small businesses to hold out with mask requirements.   The outcome will be increased levels of infections, especially among the unmasked and unvaccinated.

The vaccinated can also get infected, and I am not entirely reassured by the fact that they are less likely to be hospitalized or die.  How many become “long-haulers” with evidence of brain damage such as brain fog, loss of smell, and even strokes?  Also, quoting from a New York Times article: “Now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stopped investigating breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated people unless they become so sick that they are hospitalized or die.”   So we may never know how safe the vaccinated truly are.

I am certainly happy that the CDC is being led by someone who will be guided by science.  But part of public health is public relations and supporting those who have taken action to slow the spread of the disease.   Failure to take that into account in the mask guidance was a major failure in public health."

You can’t get people (the nitwit contingent) to do what they need to — to optimize results for the country, in particular for the vulnerable, not yet vaccinated, not yet eligible folks. 

Wearing masks and social distancing (initially) was too much of an imposition on some to save lives ……. (And get the economy back into gear!).

So now, the carrot approach is apparently being utilized, as much as is possible, the carrot being getting rid of the masks. CDC and the Biden admin seem to have reached this conclusion on the risk to benefit ratio.

Nothing in these equations is ABSOLUTE. Zero. The black/white trend here is frustrating.

Democracy doesn’t work when the citizens can’t reach some consensus on common themes (basics even, like what is truth) — and work together.

And for all professional  w o m e n , yeah, we negotiate this equation all the time. It looks like the higher women rise, the more vicious the transference or just misogyny.

Scientific theories, whether gravitation or how covid is spread, are based on evidence, not proof.  Science is not mathematics.  Evidence accumulates, and there are different degrees of evidence.  Some theories have such a large body of evidence that essentially no one who understands science questions them.  Others have much less evidence.  And there are plenty of theories where there is evidence, but the evidence is mistaken.

Right now, ""the science"" is nothing more than a political cudgel used to persuade those who are ignorant of science.  ""The science"" is a essentially a theology the way it is being used in the public sphere."

Sadly the originator of that plan never got the benefit of it themselves.

It being that health care delivery in America is in  the control of the private health insurance industry. Where health care, a quality of life issue, is a product offered up for sale in a consumer marketplace. As this operational system impacts emergency room use, what in essence insurance companies would require people to do is diagnose their own symptoms to determine if they should head to a hospital emergency room. This entire issue reflects an underlying core element that has come to signify how America functions. As an operationally elitist society."

The answer is to expand night service at major hospitals to separate the parents into emergency room, urgent care and walk-in office visit cases. The problem is that regular hours end before parents get home from work.  In Seattle, patients at the university hospital can for months for an appointment for non-urgent care, and then there are not enough appointments for urgent care. Public and university medical centers need to be greatly expanded with respect to services, locations and hours.  It is not reasonable for an insurance company to punish patients for the health care system's lack of evening and weekend service and the failure of the US to have enough medical schools to train the number of doctors our cities actually need in public facilities."

If UnitedHealthcare feels its membership is overutilizing ERs, I wonder if it has bothered expanding the set of urgent care clinics and doctors (especially those who offer care outside of standard office hours) available to its members? Or, if it notices certain PCPs have a lot of patients who end up in the ER for ""unworthy"" reasons, maybe stop contracting with those PCPs? Punishing people for going to the ER is absurd."

2021-06-10 16:36,"This is very scary.

Let’s look at a very common scenario:  

Symptoms of a heart attack can be indistinguishable from symptoms of severe indigestion. When a patient arrives at an emergency room with chest pain, he/she does not know if his/her chest pain indicates the presence of a heart attack, indigestion, or something else, like an irritated esophagus or a torn aorta.

In the ER, tests show no evidence of a heart or aorta problem, and a “GI cocktail,” which includes an antacid and something to numb the esophagus, gives relief of the symptoms. The patient is discharged from the ER, with a prescription for a stomach acid blocker, and a recommendation to follow up with his/her regular medical provider.

The patient goes home, relieved and reassured, takes the medication as prescribed and follows up with his/her regular provider, who performs the appropriate outpatient evaluation. The patient believes the problem has been taken care of.

Then UnitedHealthcare’s chart reviewer pulls out the “retrospectoscope,” determines that the patient went to the ER because of indigestion, which is listed as the discharge diagnosis, and denies the ER’s claim for payment.

The patient is then hit with a bill from the ER for thousands of dollars.

Private insurers exist to make money, not provide health care.

Unless UnitedHealthcare is willing to provide medical training for all its customers, so they can diagnose themselves at home, this review policy should never be instituted."

They quote an extreme example and tie it to a $32 billion price tag. As many have said on here, it seems they want patients to self diagnose or force the emergency rooms to triage and turn away non emergencies. All of which will drive up costs."

That means we’re fat, we eat bad, we don’t exercise, we smoke, we stress. We don’t control our BP and our diabetes. A lot. Oh, and right now, a lot of us won’t go get vaccinated. That’s pricey too. 

And we like our fancy pills and our fancy surgeries, and we trundle into the ER for stuff that isn’t remotely an emergency. Then we demand instant hangnail treatment, and shout because there aren’t nine docs and eighteen nurses attending to our every whim. Mind you, we’ve no intention of paying the taxes for that. 

So sorry and all, and not a big United fan, but the only thing I can see that they did wrong was not to be crystal clear about what you do and don’t go to the ER for.

Someone has severe stomach pain in the middle of the night. Got to the ER, got an x-ray. X-ray shows acute appendicitis, needed surgery right away. OK that's an emergency. But if the x-ray showed nothing, and the doctors determined that to be a stomach bug, that was not an emergency -- so now insurance is not going to pay? How would one know without that x-ray?

Any money saved is forfeit to these same executives in the form of exorbitant salaries and millions in bonuses. Non medical trained persons should have no place in deciding who gets care and who doesn’t. A similar outcome occurred with nursing. The average nurse spends an average registered nurse will spend four to five years in pre-nursing and college based learning before getting registered nursing status. In earlier times hospitals recruited their own candidates for nurse training. They paid for the tuition as well as reimbursing them for time spent with patients. Now nurses leave college with huge education debts are paid less t their qualifications entitle them These former nurses are replaced by nurses aids who only spend weeks in training, are paid much less than the nurses and actually do most of the real nursing. The qualified nurses spend most of their time on computers satisfying the requirements of some beurocrat’s responsibility to save money. In saying this I am in no way discounting the great service these aids provide. What I am saying is we need the foundation of the traditional hospital and emergency departments provide.

2021-06-10 18:05,"I spent 8 weeks arguing with United about a hospital bill we incurred for getting a Covid test for my son (the ONLY reason for our visit).  It was the only setting our provider offered children the test at the time, and of course United declined the facility/provider fee.   Eventually, an in-writing complaint referencing federal law fixed the ""oversight.""  Initial reasons for denying the charge, per United included that ""your employer has chosen not to cover the visits for Covid testing"" and that my son tested negative, so therefore a covid test  was not Covid-related, all outrageous and false.  8 weeks over one $140 bill.  Fast forward to a week after our J&J vaccines, and my husband develops leg pain.  The only place he could get a clot ruled out was the E.R. because our physician and urgent care don't have the ultrasound technology.  Understanding these situations, the E.R. actually lets you make an appointment for this specific sort of care.  Now we have the pleasure of paying about $2000 of the $4 grand plus bill for a one-hour, scheduled appointment for one specific purpose.  Based on my previous experience, I have zero confidence that ANY of that bill would have been covered if this new rule passes, as he was clot-free.  What kind of insurance penalizes you so steeply for following physician advice, and seeking care in sometimes the only model available?"

Nevermind that insurance companies drive up cost of care...simply be existing.

Tying employment to health insurance is arguably the worst public policy enacted the past century. Employers will simply continue to buy policies from UHC because it is ""cheaper"" and provides the ""most options"". That is all misguided, but as long as the regulations continue as they are, payers will continue to encroach and push policies to essentially own the entire spectrum of care."

(I don't think you can get an immediate appointment for a CT scan outside of  the ER.) It turned out I have diverticulitis and was admitted. But what if it had just been, say, gas?

The bill was over $3,000, including nearly $2,000 for a doctor who ""reviewed"" my case but never actually saw me. 

Anthem, my insurer, initially refused to pay, at first because they said the doctor was out of network, then later because the charges were excessive. After a month of arguing, Anthem paid about 40% and the hospital ate the rest.

I was billed over two hundred thousand dollars for nine days in the hospital for life-saving care. I had been with my insurance company for 17 years with nothing more than annual screening appointments in that time. I now have excellent insurance and Health Net had to pay my bills and good riddance! I am sure the CEO is raking in the dough.

2021-06-10 18:25,"I have an idea. The insurers are only allowed access to the information that led to the visit. They do not get to see the ER assessment or know the outcome. If the insurer says that it should not have been an ER case, they can deny the claim or pay it at a lower non-ER outpatient rate. If the patient turns out to have a life threatening diagnosis or dies, the insurance company reviewer is put on trial for manslaughter. 
That might change their approach."
2021-06-10 18:26,"As a physician I have no love for UHC and it’s interests. The missing piece to balance the tone deaf decision is the daily barrage of unnecessary care provided in our emergency rooms. If one goes to the emergency room for a headache, it’s almost certain a CT scan will be done. If it shows nothing abnormal and you return the next day because your doctor can’t see you for a month, you will likely have another scan. Multiply this by the thousands and the costs of these fee for service procedures are unsustainable, mostly because they are driven by a need to increase revenue. It’s a zero sum game, what hospitals don’t get, insurance companies keep and what insurance companies don’t pay, patients make up for the shortfall.

One problem I see is the financial incentives do not exist.  The ER at my current hospital is run by a for profit company contracted with the hospital.   They want people to come into the ER!!  

They have at least 65 beds in the ER now and when I was a resident it was like 20 at most!

If I can change providers, I'm going to.

This is unconscionable.

I remember when I was in summer school in England and needed to go to a clinic, and then the ER.  Because I was enrolled in a U.K. university, I was completely covered by National Health Care and owed zero $$$ for my care in both the clinic and the hospital.

Everyone in this country who keeps opposing National Health Care here or some program that would guarantee reasonable coverage to all of us, instead of leaving us to get picked dry by the for-profit vulture healthcare system in this country, has rocks in their head.

Remember how in 2008 all those bright boys were facing catastrophe due to lousy financial schemes and how the taxpayer had to bail them out? How about you go to a network hospital and there are non-network doctors working there and you are billed separately. The insurance company doesn’t care about those ‘unnecessary charges’. Under this scheme some twerp with no medical training will follow an unnecessary care tree diagram to decide wether or not your visit was necessary. UH will implement this scheme more quietly and low key sometime in the future as will other insurance companies. A single payer system is the only way to bring sanity to healthcare.

Under the proposed policy UnitedWealthCare wins either way. It will look at the record and deny coverage if the pain is diagnosed as indigestion; but if you die at home of a heart attack, well, there is one more quadruple bypass they don’t have to pay for."

I deferred on an ambulance because most health insurers don't pay for that. I was treated there for a possible inner ear infection. When I sent the bill to Kaiser, they refused to pay it. This was an emergency, I was incapacitated with my medical situation, and needed immediate medical care and diagnosis. I want medicare for all for this and so many other reasons."

Several hours after admission she had a dangerously low blood pressure and had to be tilted in bed and receive a large amount of IV fluid over a short period of time. The following day she underwent a colonoscopy which revealed Crohn’s disease of the entire colon and then had several days of intravenous drug therapy. 2 days after admission (she was still hospitalized) she received a letter from the insurer that stating that they would not pay the hospitals or the physicians because they deemed that she could have sought a lower level of care. She wrote a letter of appeal to the insurer who stated that they reviewed her case and that they still would not cover the hospitalization whose bill was over $70,000. The hospital and physicians to their credit reduced the fees so that she would not have to declare bankruptcy. But I have to ask, for what exactly are she and her employer paying premiums?

It is my opinion that United Healthcare should be put out of business. As a patient, I never received worse payment for care than from this company—and it was a high-end policy. As a referral coordinator I can tell you we no longer have access to speak with anyone at the company directly. All communication is through encrypted e-mail and extremely slow. It’s not about what they pay for—it’s about their often hard to access payment schedules. For instance, they paid only $20 some dollars per session for my daughter’s physical therapy. Leaving me with a $700 balance in a heartbeat.  In my experience they seem to find ways to delay contracts with major healthcare providers and hospitals leaving gaps in coverage and forcing patients to find providers elsewhere.

Equally as distressing is as a person aged 65+, when my spouse retires and we go on full Medicare, we have been considering the AARP supplemental coverage, which is exclusively underwritten by United HealthCare, having been told by an insurance billing specialist at the only full service hospital in our area that ""they provide the best coverage.""  I hope AARP is listening and puts some pressure on UHC.

2021-06-10 20:14,"When big medical insurers announce big changes in coverage, your anxiety becomes healthy. The idea that a patient denied coverage they thought their policy provided can protest a denial of coverage—after care has been delivered—is a joke. That pits an individual against a monster corporation. Guess who is likely to win such a dispute? A dying friend said to me: “It’s not the cancer that will kill me—it’s the paperwork.” But it’s more complex than paperwork. Not to pick on United Healthcare Group Inc but it’s the parent company of 2 divisions: United Healthcare is the insurer. Optum provides consulting services to medical practices—sometimes by buying & merging them w/other practices and then “advising” the actual medical care providers how they will practice. Sometimes this is good, but there is also a serious risk to patients in pitting profit vs care when a parent corp influences both. One way to deal with conflicts of interest or insurers’ pronouncements of sweeping coverage changes is to require the insurer to go through a 3rd-party review process before changes are put in place. This is how Medicare offers some protection to people buying add-on coverage from companies like UHC, Aetna, Cigna, Blue Cross, etc. But, to get that protection, you may have to go to the Inspector General of Health & Human Services. Huh? How many people know to call an IG? It can work: Cigna was subsequently banned a year from selling Medicare drug coverage, which kicked them in their profits."

If the powers that be - our legislatures, insurance and other healthcare organizations executives had to face the same hurdles that the average citizen had to face changes would come quickly.

2021-06-10 20:50,"I get it. Every other country has a health care system designed to serve the needs of patients. The US has a wealth care system designed to serve the greed of its executives and shareholders. When our wealth care system must provide health care for a patient, it's called ""medical loss"" because the patient steals money from shareholders' pockets. To minimize that theft, insurers erect a complex and protean labyrinth of barriers to care. So UnitedHealthcare's executives should be hailed as heroes for this latest effort to deter from a particularly costly kind of theft.

What I don't get is how those heroes did not consider the outrage this would generate. We're already outraged at how our medical-industrial complex fails too many of us, and too often drives even those with ""good"" insurance into bankruptcy. The lack of access for people without employer-provided insurance is at the root of the inappropriate use of ERs the heroes were trying to prevent. But now they want people with serious symptoms to fear that some bean-counter, probably with financial incentives to deny claims, will second-guess their ER visit and bankrupt them with hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills.

Although the heroes felt compelled to abandon this policy (for now), it's just the latest argument for repealing our unique medical-industrial complex and replacing it with a real health care system. I guess the heroes believe they've paid our elected officials enough to prevent that."

That aside, too many people use the ER for non emergencies.  Your child's strep throat isn't an emergency, a minor cut is generally not an emergency.  Part of why healthcare costs are out of control is because there's a segment of the population that thinks nothing of heading to the ER when something like a MinuteClinic, Urgent Care, or pediatrician/internist would be the more appropriate provider."

In order to keep my current level of coverage, I also have to keep raising my deductible every year. It started at $1,000 and is now $10,000.  This is how much I have to pay out of pocket before my coverage kicks in. 

In real terms, this means nothing beyond my annual exam is covered. If I need bloodwork or an ultrasound, it comes out of my pocket.

If that lower level of care is available, the ER triage can easily divert patients. The problem is, often no other care is available elsewhere. So the insurer is not just encouraging people to seek lower level of care, they are actively discouraging insureds from obtaining health care at all.  It's always about the profits, which is why we need a public, non-profit option."

Nothing is further from the truth. They are quite simply a bank, and are adept at keeping their premiums high, overpaying their CEOs and paying as little as possible for your care. UHC was the worst by far of all insurance companies. They have made a science out of claim denials. Their high paid executives are morally bankrupt. Their ads portraying themselves as if they are providing care themselves are repugnant."

The Hospitals pass the cost on to everyone else.  It's like schools, food stamps and subsidized housing -- there's a huge number of people who work off the books and just take -- which destablizes all the systems.  That said, we need single payer yesterday.  But it's harder to get it when we're paying for illegal immigrants."
2021-06-10 21:51,"Once again, this returns to the fact that our healthcare system in this country is deeply flawed. They're right, of course, that we as a country overuse the ER - but that's because visits to a family doctor, if you even manage to have one, can take weeks, if not months to schedule, and most acute health issues, even nonemergencies, need treating considerably sooner than that. Urgent care offices have emerged in many places to pick up the slack, but their availability is limited and many patients still don't know how to differentiate between an urgent care visit and an ER visit. 

The incentive structure we have in place for doctors, hospitals, health insurance companies, and even medical schools has led to a perverse system. I'm not sure what the solution really is. I know it *starts* with universal health care. But it certainly doesn't end there."

I you had a real health care system, instead of a for-profit business system, where people could access to health care when they needed it without fear of bankruptcy, you would dramatically reduce the number of ER visits. 

As it stands, people don't seek diagnosis or treatment for problems out of fear of the exorbitant costs.  When they do go for treatment, it may be too late, or much more complicated. 

So a good place to start would be to wipe out the business model of United and every other for-profit health insurer in the US.  

( I say this as someone who lived and worked in the US for a decade and saw the best and worst of the US health industry.  I will take the Canadian system any day of the week, thanks very much.)"
2021-06-10 21:15,"This is a shameful and outrageous policy.  The impact will be to exacerbate the already high level of healthcare inequality that exists in the USA.  As stated in the article, self-insured plans administered by United would be excluded.  The costs and charges of health care are only weakly correlated to each other and United is seeking to push the cost of delayed or avoided care onto lay people who are being required to judge the importance of a problem on their own.  This would impose the greatest burdens on those with the fewest resources.  I am a recently retired US academic physician and spent my career in medical centers whose emergency departments were perennially full of the kinds of patients this measure targets."

The FTC should never have approved so many horizontal and vertical mergers under the Bush and Obama administrations.   UnitedHealthcare knows that it can simply not pay bills and a certain percentage of people and providers will fail to appeal and they can deny valid claims and bankrupt people.  Such practices are nothing more than theft on a grand scale.  This is nothing more than a cynical effort on the part of UnitedHealthcare to boost profits to make their Wall Street numbers.  The criminal conspiratorial anticompetitive behaviors of PBMs/Insurers need to be addressed by the FTC and the DOJ.

That way, the guy who thinks he is having a stomach ache who turns out to be having a heart attack can quickly be sent back to the ER.
And, you could build the 24 hour walk in clinic above the ER parking lot, thereby providing both a clinic and covered parking.  Where I live, we visit many of our specialists right in their offices at the hospital, and we don't get billed any differently."

United Healthcare has long been a bad player in this arena.  While all of us would love to see the best use of the ED, and as emergency physicians we have concerns similar to United Healthcare’s about low-acuity patients clogging up ED’s, we need evidence based approaches that keep patients safe while better managing cost and resources.

Scaring patients away from seeking medical care is about the worst way to do this.

2021-06-10 23:43,"By all means, United Healthcare should be able to refuse to pay for non-urgent care in an emergency setting. 

First, they will need to supply UHC triage agents at every ER, to assure that only real emergencies are admitted. They may need to do exams to assure that the case is emergent or not, but those exams, done by quality UHC staff will be cheaper. Maybe they can move some of the super helpful people who manage payments, or prior authorizations, into those positions.

Anyone who slips through and receives care should be billed directly by UHC, after UHC  reimburses the hospital for the care. Because legally the ER can't tell a patient that nothing is wrong and refuse admission until nothing is demonstrated to be wrong. UHC can carry the risk that the patient does not pay the bill, rather than the provider.

There! All solved UHC! You pay the provider and bill your members yourself."

This is a sick nation; physically, morally, and, most importantly, spiritually. It’s the kind of country that Republicans and their evangelical Christian base are desperate to preserve and enshrine. Evangelicals, especially, are the most morally culpable for their ardent opposition to public health care.

As Tennessee state senator and white evangelical Mark Green said, “Sickness is one of the main avenues that bring people to religion. In the Gospels every person who came to Christ came to Christ with a physical need. When the government created the ACA it did a great injustice because by helping people regain their health, it had limited the Christian church’s role and robbed sick individuals of the opportunity to come to a saving knowledge of who God is. People who fell ill would now look to the government instead of to God.”

Of course many conditions cannot be elucidated without examining a patient, getting a history, perhaps doing some imaging and lab tests, certainly unlikely over the phone.  It is often an impossible burden on anyone with or without medical training to distinguish apriori among several possibilities, some of which will self-resolve and some of which are true life threatening emergencies.

How would he handle those symptoms if they occurred in the middle of the night? Or, if they occurred during the day, but his doctor's office couldn't give him an appointment for another 3 weeks?

(rightfully so)   I was asked by our regional CEO (reports to above) to ""handle it"".  I did.  His only comment was that now he did not have to worry about his boss yelling at him.  No care about the inappropriate denial.

So ya.  That's UHC.  That said even that company I know would not be stupid enough to deny payment for ""chest pain"".  I think a lot of the comments in the article by physicians, AMA etc are unfair.  We all have skin in the game I guess.  Doctors want more payment.  Insurance not so much.

Though I had no copay for this charge I complained to Oxford. They said can’t do anything - contact the doc or write to state insurance regulators.  I had no contact info for ER doc so wrote to regulators with supporting documents. 3 months later I get a letter from regulators saying nothing we can do here. FYI, salaries of resident docs in training are financed by Medicare - the US taxpayers. So I saw a resident doc paid by taxpayers and the ER attending who likely spent a moment reviewing my uncomplicated case gets 2500. And UHC wants to dump this problem on patients? For a previous surgery in 2012  the surgeon told me he wouldn’t take Oxford cause he wouldn’t deal with UHC but told me after I paid the out of network copay he’d take whatever Oxford would pay. He was worth it. His office also advised me to call the anesthesiologist department to tell them only anesthesiologists who take Oxford could be assigned to my case.

When is Urgent Care appropriate to use?
When is the ED appropriate to go to?

If you read the notification from UHG, it clearly states that a letter will be sent to your PCP and if they sign off on your ED visit as being ""emergent"", then UHG will accept the visit as emergent regardless of any internal eligibility measures.

2021-06-11 7:23,"I have no idea what motivates a UHC executive earning $18 million to show respect or regard for other humans. I do know that corporate executives are taught they serve only the interests of their stockholders. Moreover, if the UHC execs don’t keep the stockholders happy, the executives get fired. Hence UHC executives can hand down a threat that it will be denying claims for misuse or overuse of ER services and believe they are fulfilling their responsibilities properly. Based on comments here, however, UHC is universally viewed with hostility. The only way these comments matter to UHC & its ilk is if its policyholders moved beyond the NYT’s Comments and spoke to a wider audience. That means filing relevant complaints with federal & state consumer protection agencies, state insurance boards, and major stockholders. Corporations can run amuck when they are mammoth in size and their consumer base is made up of individuals. The case of Exxon is instructive here. Exxon’s self-satisfied board of directors was recently brought to attention by activist stockholders demanding real attention and productive, timely responses to global warming. Going on the record w/UHC Group (UHC and Optum) stockholders & regulatory agencies may get UHC execs to rethink how they view bankrupting or denying care to policy holders. Maybe they’ll even consider what would happen to their $ millions if their contempt for their customers prompted adoption of a single payer health insurance system."
2021-06-11 7:56,"No one deserves this bad publicity more than UHC, the worst health insurer I’ve encountered yet (which is saying a lot).

Their inhumane, greed-based decisions and decision-making process are designed to train patients and their families that resistance is futile.

2021-06-11 8:54,"You hear all the time that patients who can't afford to pay for their health care go to emergency rooms to get free care.

It is my understanding that the federal government will reimburse emergency rooms when they provide emergency care to these patients who can't pay for their care.

However, from what I understand from the media, it is often the case that emergency rooms are getting reimbursed by the federal government when they treat poor patients in the ER when it is NOT an emergency.

Perhaps, if an ER gets reimbursed for treating any poor patients, the clinic that the ER is In should be required to have a walk-in (or similar) clinic for non-emergency care where they can refer patients too poor to pay. They could then treat those patients for free or arrange for some payment plan. I wonder if taxpayers realize how much they are paying to provide care in a highly specialized ER when similar care in a regular clinic might be a small fraction of the cost. ERs are highly specialized, the personnel are highly specialized, the equipment is very expensive there and very sophisticated. 

Let's say, you need a few stitches or have a broken wrist. The care in your regular doctor's office might be one-third the cost in an ER (or similar). I can see the value in reimbursing ERs to treat emergencies, but what about all the other reimbursements?

I think United Health Care is thinking the same way."
2021-06-11 8:55,"Sorry, but these health insurers who arbitrarily “allow” payment for necessary services are one more nail in the coffin of a dying America. They, along with hospitals, charge enormously for their services. Yet, when it comes time for actual care, it may be denied. I know. I was a health care provider. I worked in the pharma industry for more than 25 years, and became a user of such services a lot in the last ten years. 

I bought a house and moved to France nearly three years ago and have discovered radical differences. Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. Co-pays are almost non-existent and certainly not for pharmaceutical products. 

If countries like France and most of Europe can do this efficiently and effectively, why can’t the US? Because Republicans don’t want it. Out with them all!

2021-06-11 12:17,"2 points:

This policy could have cost me my life.

One evening, I had indigestion. I suffer from it once every blue moon. No red flags. I awoke early the next morning feeling worse. I went to the 24 hour pharmacy and bought something to settle my stomach. As the indigestion worsened, I considered going to the ER, but if I weren't admitted, it would cost me $750 out of pocket, plus copay and coinsurance. Money I really, really didn't want to spend. 

By 9:00, it was worse and I called a G.I. office for a consult. By now, I suspected I had appendicitis, but wasn't sure. The nurse told me i ought to go to the ER. Still thinking of that whipping bill, I said I'd hold off a while, to see what happened. She urged me to get to the ER right away. She was sure I had rapid onset of appendicitis. 

She was right - 90 minutes later, in the ER, my appendix burst just after receiving a CT scan. With the additional scrutiny, there are undoubtedly people who would have died. I might have been one of them.

Second point - a good friend is a Psychologist. The bane of his practice is United Healthcare. Based on his experience, the name is incorrect. It ought to be United Wealthcare. They care much more about their wealth, than the health of their insured. 

They are the perfect example as to why profit oriented health insurance is counter to quality, accessible healthcare."

Single payer, you pay your taxes, government pays for essential healthcare, complete pricing transparency, equal reimbursement to all hospitals/clinics/doc/HCWs for same treatment/procedure.  Abolish insurance companies...one of the few industries that profited billions from COVID, and continues to do so."
2021-06-11 12:28,"When we had UnitedHealthcare, they wanted to deny a re-root canal because the original root canal was done 40 years prior and I could not recall the exact date.  They are actively looking for ways to deny coverage.  This SHOULD be illegal for an insurance company to do.  But, hey, I bet they are willing to pay for Aducanumab treatment (which clearly is a waste).
The day my husband's company switched to Blue Cross I was so happy."
2021-06-11 12:50,"UnitedHealthcare is wrong.  Patients cannot be expected to discern the difference between severe chest pain and a panic attack in order to save the company money on a trip to the ER in case it's a heart attack.  

Our for profit system of wealth care is hurting all but the richest or savviest Americans.  The narrow networks, high deductibles, high monthly premiums, consistent denials, retrospective denials, the upcoding by health care providers, all of this makes needing or going for medical care far more stressful than it should be or is in other countries.  

Using myself as an example I can tell more than a few stories about how I've not gone for care when needed because of the cost.  One involved falling off a bicycle and cracking my helmet.  I had a concussion and a few other assorted injuries.  I didn't dare go to the ER or any doctor because I was unemployed.  Then there was the time, this winter, when I fell off a chair and severely sprained my left ankle and badly bruised the same foot.  I have job now and I still didn't go.  

I don't go because of all the unexpected costs, the overcharging for simple care (like if I have a bad sinus infection).  It seems as if our wealth care industry cannot adequately care for our health and its own wealth at the same time.  UnitedHealthcare's actions are an excellent demonstration of that.  If our health is important stop changing the rules midyear and eliminate all the other nonsense."
2021-06-11 12:52,"Par for the course for United Health Care! Spend some time working in addiction treatment & the hours it can take to squeeze even a few more days coverage for a patient out of these sharks & you'll have a very different view of the insurance industry, which has done its best to put addiction treatment out of business. Indeed, United Health Care has a leader in gutting inpatient treatment, even in the midst of the opioid epidemic. They wouldn't get one penny of my money."
2021-06-11 13:00,"As a PCP, I would add, on top of all this, that UHC does not even seem to be interested in paying a fair price for primary care. I had to say no to a contact that amounted to 30% of Medicare reimbursement. It was insulting. My attempt to negotiate so that I could serve their members was met with, “we don’t negotiate contracts”. I even suggested that my ready availability, access, and focus on prevention would benefit all involved. No dice. They pay peanuts to PCPs and expect patients to pursue appeals from their sick beds. The *only* way I have any dealings with them now is through capitation on their Medicaid plans or out of network for commercial plans. And even that is dicey because their tool to determine OON benefits is broken and misleading and they will not pay claims that clearly misled a patient to believe they were in network. So, I actually do think people need to have a pcp and not run to the ED for everything, but scaring people with bankruptcy is not the correct approach. Fairly reimbursing primary care and recruiting to their network to do this difficult work is. UHC seems to have it wrong on both counts."
2021-06-11 13:25,"This has been done for decades, just quietly. The reason we're hearing about this in the news is simply that the numbers of payment declines are skyrocketing. 

If I, working in primary care, cannot always determine the cause of symptoms, how can any layperson determine how to distinguish between an MI and a pulled muscle or heartburn? Should people invest in an ECG? This is absurdity! I can run an ECG, for example, but unless it shows Q waves you can jump through, it's not always clear. And in today's medicine, you're expected to meet all possible liability and ""client wishes"" which means a lot of the time, unless you're absolutely sure you've cleared the patient, you're shipping them out to the ER. I've personally sent patients to the ER, had them released by a derelict attending, only to have the patient return later that day with active MI. So will the insurance not cover the first visit, because it was diagnosed and coded incorrectly? 

Every other developed nation has universal care! And better outcomes! Even  our own professional organizations are on board with universal health care. Our taxes, for the average American, are now on par with many countries with universal care, so it's not about raising taxes. It's about the amount of profit someone not providing health care can make on your suffering and my work. THAT is why we don't have a universal health care. We need it now. Healthcare should not be about profit."
2021-06-11 13:29,"Among health insurers, United Healthcare is the Devil Incarnate. Always has been. Always will be. The answer to reducing unnecessary ER visits is off-hours primary care, which the bloated hospital chains (also Devils Incarnate) could easily afford to establish and insurers should be required to reimburse at office rates, not loaded up with questionable hospital overhead. Heck, in my first healthcare job over 40 years ago my county owned hospital established a “primary care ER” adjacent to the regular ER in order to provide evening and weekend urgent care type services to Medicaid and charity care patients whose care the county underwrote. The “indigestion” patient was first seen in primary care. If it turned out to be appendicitis or a heart attack, the real ER was right there through the door. This is not rocket science, nor is it particularly expensive to establish. It only requires the will."
2021-06-11 14:01,"Many people are forced to use the emergency department for medical issues that are not emergencies, and in my opinion, United Healthcare has greatly contributed to that situation for many years by leading the pack in putting profits and mean-spiritedness over its purported mission of providing coverage. As someone who has occasionally and unfortunately had United Healthcare coverage in years past, I found having UH coverage to be horrible in every way, from customer service to plan structure and everything in between. They were the worst insurance company I was ever covered by, and I was always glad to switch (or be switched) to another insurer. It's not that the other insurers were so great. It's not that the US health care system is a model of anything. But UH leads the pack for sheer greed and meanness. It may have retreated on this issue for now. But it will advance again, on this issue or another, unless there are systemic changes to our healthcare system."
2021-06-11 14:08,"As a physician who has had a first-hand look at the inside of for-profit insurance organizations, I can confirm that any statements or policy decisions made by UnitedHealthcare or similar for-profit insurance organizations are done so purely in the service of their bottom line without concern or consideration of patient care needs. These for-profit dictators of American healthcare add excessive cost to our system to boost their profits while their entire business model is built upon the denial of access to quality and appropriate healthcare. Until Congress or our state legislatures decide that they will mandate scientifically driven medical necessity criteria that are supported by clinical consensus rather than the internally developed profit driven criteria currently used by insurance companies, all of us will be forced to live under insurance systems that have responsibility for our healthcare but no accountability or interest in our patients’ actual health."
2021-06-11 14:14,"This egregious temporarily delayed action by UnitedHealthcare is tip of the iceberg when it comes to the public track record of this insurer.  This is the very same company that is kept by the supposedly consumer advocacy organization AARP.  Together, they peddle health care policies to members with questionable benefits, particularly their so called Medicare Advantage Plans, which claim to cover everything but the kitchen sink but are, in fact, riddled with limitations and exclusions that come at a hefty price.  AARP should be ashamed of themselves for being in business with this or any other company that markets insurance and other financial products."
2021-06-11 14:47,"Another excellent example of how the Healthcare Industrial Complex is really not interested in assuring quality healthcare.

A comparison may be made to the unregulated electrical grid in Texas: Profit over accountability; and surcharges for services.

This is another example of why a government regulated healthcare system is required. Price controls and guarantees of service levels is not too much to ask."
2021-06-11 15:08,"The people have some substantial power here. All health plans sold in a state are regulated by a state's department of insurance (they go by different names around the country.) Send letters, call and email your state's insurance regulator telling then not to approve major medical insurance plans with policies like these. Regulators can usually find ways based on current statutes and regulations to not allow insurers to sell plans with these kinds of policies, even if they get added after the initial approval. Get your state legislatures to pass statutes that specifically prohibit insurance companies from offering plans with these types of policies. UnitedHealthcare and its ilk can't rule the world. Regulators have a lot of power and if your Insurance Commissioner is an elected office and the Commissioner won't protect the state's citizens, well, vote that commissioner out!"

2021-06-11 14:46,"This is why we need Medicare for all, or at the very least a public option. Why the Democrats in Congress and Biden refuse to tackle this issue is baffling and tone deaf. If anything shows that our for profit healthcare is a disaster it’s insurance company refusing to pay medical bills that their “insured” clients incurred. I’m sure those people would sit out the election, wondering why the Democrats did nothing while in power from preventing this from happen. No other country has such a disfunctional system. We always criticize Cuba, yet everyone in that country has healthcare. The US is a disgrace."
2021-06-11 11:58,We do not need insurance companies. They serve no useful purpose for American people. Medicare for All.
2021-06-11 13:43,"So patients now have to be doctors now to properly triage themselves and bare the entire medical bill if they are wrong- - while paying outrageous insurance premiums for ‘full coverage’? The GREED in healthcare is out.of.control! Illness is now the leading cause of bankruptcy. We place 27th for outcomes- - in the world— at the highest costs; far from being world class healthcare, people think they are getting and is increasingly only available to the wealthy! It’s beyond time to reign in this bloated, inefficient and costly system. A single pay or system, like other first world countries, billed at appropriate levels (reasonable profit over outrageous greed), would cost far, far less and deliver much higher results! Especially when the cost of drugs are included. Go online to Canada and check the price of any drug you take and get a clue of what a reasonable profit actually looks like. Beyond time for a change and I was an inside analyst with the world’s largest insurance company; It’s even worse than you know."
2021-06-11 12:41,"There are those who harangue, pontificate, argue and obfuscate that the last thing society needs is government involvement in their health care.  Why do they say this?  The argument goes something like this.  They say Government is highly invasive, that it controls and dictates too much.  Also, Government eliminates personal choice.  

But then they turn around and allow the business and corporate world to do exactly the same thing; with one highly egregious aspect associated with it that does not drive most government.  Profit.  

Profit defined by reduced choice allowances that benefit mainly the managers, executives and shareholders of that health-care business entity and not their ""customer,"" the patient enduring a personal heath emergency.  For some reason those arguing against government don't have an issue with corporations doing this.

I ask this.  Is this proper?  Is the ethical?  Is it right?  Is it a responsible solution by society to practice health-care for its citizenry in such a highly for-profit manner?  I have to ask. 
 Explain to me how the greater good is truly honored by any such system?  Ever?

2021-06-11 16:34,"It's also concerning for those who have insurance but not access to after hours care through their insurance other than an emergency room, whether it's life threatening or not.  Some health situations become concerning after 5pm and require attention before an appointment might be made the next day.  And patients shouldn't be expected to self-diagnosis about whether to seek care or not after 5pm."
2021-06-11 16:55,"United Health's policy change strikes me as being ""penny-wise and pound foolish.""

It should readily apparent that for the vast majority of patients, what is necessary care vs. an unnecessary use of emergency room services can only be determined after the fact. It should also be fairly obvious that patients are not always the best judge of what constitutes an emergency, warranting a visit to the emergency room.

There are no doubt a number of patients who abuse the use emergency rooms, either as their primary care provider or for other reasons. However, a blanket approach to restricting access to and determining who pays for emergency room services seems misguided. Forcing patients to consider costs before seeking emergency room services could have serious personal consequences. And, while insurance companies may gain a cost savings in emergency room services, it is also possible that the long term cost of deferred or delayed treatment may equal or exceed their short term cost savings.

The opportunism of United Health to reduce their costs at the expense of their insureds has rightly been objected to by health care professionals, and is yet another reason why ""Medicare for all"" should be an option for everyone."

I was disappointed when I clicked the link to the Carnegie website when I couldn't find an easily accessible chronological list of the season's offerings, and when all the events name the principal performers but say nothing about the repertory.  It's hard to make subscription decisions with limited information.  I usually subscribe to several Carnegie series.  I hope the surface mail material I will be receiving is more information.

Meanwhile, on the issue of attending in person, anybody who is fully vaccinated can probably do so with relative safety next seasons.  It's those who have not been vaccinated who are most at risk.  If the hall has taken steps to improve ventilation and air filtration, things should be reasonably safe.

To see - in recent years, certainly - names like Geffen and Koch on 2 of Lincoln Center's buildings [Carnegie sports another prestige name, but I don't pretend to know whether they COULD auction off ""naming rights"" at this point] is a reminder that the Met Opera and the Ballet and a great deal of the non-Broadway theater scene join museums as depending on wealthy (mostly old) patrons. How - IF? - this will continue to work toward 2050 is beyond me, but some of these inst'ns are running on empty at this point.

Yes, most of NYC's ""upper crust"" will be back in town after Labor Day, but I'm thinking that 15-30% of them will NOT re-up for, say, their 2019 commitments. A portion of them will ""just say no,"" something that reflects NYC's terrible decline in the last 2 years of de Blasio's tenure.

Some science reports state that the vaccine protection  diminishes  by a considerable % in about 6 months.
If one got fully vaccinated in March, that would mean that by September or October, the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine in our bodies would be way less effective than the ideal 94%. Would it be by then 50% or what exactly? In other words by the start of the classical music season, people who got vaccinated by March would not be so well protected. 

I already bought tickets for 6 concerts at the Carnegie, but I do hope that there is a booster by October. I also teach in college, and I have the same worry for the Fall semester.

Government should establish a NATIONAL digital passport, with good security protection against digital theft. Vaccination should be legally required for certain events and for colleges."

Having spent a lot of time at Carnegie Hall for 70 years now (starting with attendance at Telephone Hour radio broadcasts, which emanated from there, in 1951), I would love for someone to explain to me why Carnegie Hall needs 350 employees, and further to that, 190 during a time when they were completely closed?  I'm not looking for general information on the Usher Brigade or the back-office accountants, but reasonably full details on what all of these people do to keep the Hall running. 350 of them under normal circumstances, and 190 when they are closed!

I'm not necessarily complaining here, but am ill-informed on the subject. About a decade back, a magazine (Vanity Fair, I think) ran an article on Carnegie's stagehands, and the head man in that group was the highest-paid employee in the entire organization except for the head of the Corporation, yet when I think of stagehands at Carnegie Hall, I don't visualize moving tons of scenery as at the Met, but basically setting up chairs for orchestral musicians.

2021-06-07 17:08,"Thanks so much, Carl Zimmer, for your daily, or almost daily updates, on the coronavirus / pandemic.

A couple questions:  

1) Is the Alpha variant also uniquely capable of disabling the first line of immunity in children as well as adults?  I would think that a virus that sneaks past a child's immune system would be even more dangerous for adults.  

2) If an infected child sheds copious amounts of virus through the nose, then would viral transmissibility among peers happen more effectively b/c of proximity and would transmissibility to adults be even more likely to happen once proximity has been established, as in households?

3) Could children be serving as viral ""boot camps""?  That is, if the population having most effective immune system in terms of this particular virus were to be the host of a variant, would not this variant be especially powerful because it would have had to prove its mettle against a highly superior foe?  Is it possible that unvaccinated children -- asymptomatic or not -- have been the overlooked incubators of especially powerful variants?

Thanks for considering."

2021-06-07 17:58,This is interesting but perhaps already obsolete. The Alpha variant discussed in this article has lost in direct to head competition to the newer Delta variant. Delta is now the dominant strain spreading in the UK and petri dish studies show the Pfizer vaccine to be dramatically less responsive (in terms of antibody production) to Delta than to Alpha or other variants.
2021-06-07 18:12,"We are watching the evolution of a novel virus in real time. This informs us that the virus was not deliberately made in a laboratory to infect humans because repeated growth in cultured cells to create such a pathogen would have led to many  of these improvements in infectivity (assuming nefarious intent). However, understanding how the virus evolves could be used in the future to create a better pathogen, which means we need better international cooperation to prevent such an outcome.  And we still need to know how the virus started in the first place. That’s on the Chinese government to allow a full investigation."

2021-06-07 17:15,"This is why anti-vax and other conspiratorial people are harming us all big time not only by killing those vulnerable but also, by giving the virus a chance to continue mutating till it can evade the immune system completely. Then, we will be back to January 2020 all over again. These people should be left to themselves to pay for their own healthcare or require them to pay a triple premium for their healthcare insurance. Why should we be responsible for their nonsense behavior?"
2021-06-07 17:32,"So this Alpha coronavirus variant developed in the UK.

Can WHO, Biden's investigative team prove Alpha virus didn't escape from any of the multiple virology labs in the UK?

If we can accept the corona virus can develop high affinity for humans in the UK, why can we not accept this for China?"
2021-06-07 18:03,Good thing the vaccines are effective against all of the variants.
2021-06-07 16:55,"COVID-19 aka novel coronavirus-19 aka SARS-2 aka COV-SARS-2 is neither benign nor malign in it's evolutionary fit RNA quest to be fruitful and multiply.

COVID-19 is merely acting according to it's nature.  And so are people.

America didn't become first in COVID-19 infections and deaths by accident nor chance nor luck.  The United Kingdom, Brazil and India suffered from the same diva narcissist hubris."
2021-06-07 17:37,Actually the real reason the Virus is so tricky is because it was designed that way - as a bioweapon.
2021-06-07 17:10,"""Its stealth may be part of its success.""

Success?  Why is a deadly virus being called ""successful""?  

How about ""It's stealth may be part of it's deadliness or ability to kill""?

Words matter."
2021-06-07 18:10,I think Delta is becoming more of a concern at this point.
2021-06-07 18:04,"I’m almost certain that Covid variants will continue unabated, to the point where it will essentially be a new virus and we will be back to square one with a new pandemic."
2021-06-07 18:15,Key unanswered questions in this article:  are our current vaccines protective against this variant?  This isn’t clear in the article.  Is it as deadly as other variants?
2021-06-07 18:41,"Interesting research, clearly explained. One of the few good things about this pandemic is that we get to see science in action. Genetic sequencing, in particular, has never given us a window to watch viral evolution in action like we have now. 

But we need to not get ahead of skis. Science requires skepticism. New findings should be judged on the basis of proof provided. ""Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts."" ""In God we trust -- all others must bring data."" Until a theory has hard evidence to support it, we should be cautious.

(It works the other way too. We should be careful not to hold on too long to established theory in the face of new evidence. Science should advance not one funeral at a time, but faster.)

How does that apply to this research? The British variant has caught a lot of attention. But is it more effective at invading cells than the original virus? Is, even, the variant more contagious than than its parent? 

My skepticism gets its antennae up at these claims. One of the powerful tools of science is prediction of the future, based on observations of the past. That can test a theory. 

Rochelle Walensky and Michael Osterholm both predicted that the variants would cause a surge in cases in the United States. ""Impending doom"", said she. ""The darkest days of the pandemic are ahead"", said he. 

Didn't happen. The variants didn't have that power. Theory of their increased contagiousness not proven. Let's be skeptical until we have more proof."
2021-06-07 18:55,"Although COVID now seems to be under control in the US, that is a dangerous illusion.
COVID remains rampant across much of the world.  Unless the vaccination rate is very high across the entire US, COVID will come back next winter.
Specifically, the vaccination rate is quite low in Trump country, where vaccine skepticism is strong.  Only 34% have received at least one dose in Mississippi, in contrast to 71% in Vermont.
What is needed is a national program to vaccinate children.  For admission in September, all schools should require COVID vaccination for all students age 12 and above.  That includes Junior High Schools, High Schools, and Colleges.
If this is done uniformly across the country, we will have herd immunity, and we can defeat COVID.
This is a national emergency, and everyone needs to do their part."
2021-06-07 18:41,"Excellent article! The researchers are rock stars as far as I’m concerned. The science is thrilling, and I’m grateful to all COVID researchers. 

Unfortunately, a third to one half of the U.S. is spreading vaccine misinformation, conspiracy theories, and still in a sick state of COVID denialism. Vaccination sites have all closed where I am, and the Guv will no longer publish case counts. Even the newspaper of record here has decided to move on from COVID.

I’m sorry, I just logged out of a particularly insane and dangerous discussion post on Next Door that left me feeling hopeless about ending this pandemic. What vaccine can be developed to conquer stupidity and meanness? COVID is coming for those dupes."
2021-06-07 19:37,"The CDC has said those of us that are fully vaxxed can act like we normally would. Sorry but even President Biden is still donning the mask in certain circumstances. Obviously he knows something. 

Here’s what I think. There are “breakthrough” cases: i.e. the vaccine fails to protect us against the virus (probably a variant) and we get infected. Can the CDC assure us we’ll be “ok” and not be hospitalized, have long term effects to our lungs/hearts, or die if we get sick after vaccination? No. They can’t. There is still too much unknown.

So, I’ll keep my mask on (inside), trust my instincts, and watch the still-evolving science very carefully."
2021-06-07 19:58,"All that is being learned now might help to create an effective UNIVERSAL coronavirus vaccine. Research has been ongoing in this effort but, incredibly, funding continues to be withheld. A universal coronavirus vaccine would not only work across mutations of COVID-19, it would prevent many varieties of the common cold. Meanwhile, Big Pharma makes its money from treating rather than eliminating illness. Much of their profit comes from over-the-counter seasonal cold remedies. And now they have a brand new revenue stream (Pfizer alone estimates $70B thus far) on these vaccines that will need seasonal boosters. 

Are we being milked when we could be made immune instead? One thing we know quite clearly since the opioid crisis is that Big Pharma does not follow a moral compass."
2021-06-07 20:20,"Well, sounds like good news for Merck, Pfizer, et al.  

Presumably, the more the variants the more the need for more vaccines as something tells me that, in this battle between man and nature, man is not likely to deliver a knock-out blow to a virus which has the unfortunate advantage of being able to constantly mutate right in the midst of the world-wide attempt to eradicate it.  That's an advantage no virus has ever had before."
2021-06-07 20:13,"""suggests""??? really, that's what stands in for reporting on this issue? 
So people ""wondered"" how Alpha got around the world? yeah it called an airplane. 
How about we get some reporting on how easy or hard it would be to manipulate covid and it's structure to make it more contagious? I mean who has the capacity to do such things. I remember back in the 80's when they were changing the way we printed money. It was because there were certain countries who were no longer our friends with the same printing presses our government used to print our money. I mean what would it take for a country on the not so nice list to cook up a worse version of this thing? Or you're going to tell me that it is naturally mutating. Let's see the reporting. Yeah I know it's kind of chicken little and all but that doesn't make me wrong..."
2021-06-07 20:14,"Here's my question: if recovery from covid19 offers broader immunity than vaccination, and vaccination limits severe covid 19 infection, is being vaccinated and contracting covid the more perfect protection?"
2021-06-07 20:31,"Darwinian survival of the fittest in fast time.
That is happening in the virus to survive and it may happen in reverse to those who choose not to be vaccinated.
Fortunately the existing vaccines still provide very significant protection.
A ""universal"" vaccine for Covid-19 would have to contain a viral antigen that never mutates.
That science will take a long time.
Wearing a mask provides the most protection for those around you if you are shedding the virus. 
Unless you have the most sophisticated masks and change them frequently do not count on the masks to protect you."
2021-06-07 20:36,"In viral systematics, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus are agreed upon technical terms; they are genus names. SARS-CoV (2002), SARS-CoV2 (2019), and MERS-CoV are Betacoronaviruses.

Although the variant designations alpha, beta, and delta in meaning are other, the terms could nonetheless be confusing given the technical classification terms above. I am surprised that the scientific community is using them"
2021-06-07 20:43,"Very well written article! 

One thing common across variants seems the ability to INTENSELY develop tools (host acquisition in various ways, reproduction, etc) to evade the full body immune response in order to take down the same. It seems similar to the hyper-intensity with which oxygen deficiency, iron poisoning, etc set in.  

Can they be stopped from reproducing particularly at such INTENSE rates? Other than being marked ""isolated"" by vaccines so they die without a host, what else could work?"
2021-06-07 20:51,"More confusion - just what the country needs.  Until, and ONLY until, I have DEFINITIVE guidance about what I have to worry about and specifically how to deal with it, I am being irrationally over-cautious.  I've been vaccinated AND wear a mask indoors always (except at home.) I have read no stories about COVID-related deaths from being too wary. Feel free to contact me when it's all over."
2021-06-07 20:48,Virus constantly mutate ! Who knew ? Everyone except Dido Harding who was head of Track'n'Trace but now things she can lead the NHS. Strange world.
2021-06-07 20:57,"I don't think people really understand the danger of virus. Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta Variants are still prevalent in many countries.

The problem is that no vaccine pharmaceutical company has publicly states their vaccine effectiveness against any one of them. Or at least, news media haven't broadcasted that information. 

I am still reluctant to go out because I have no idea how long my vaccine defense will last."
2021-06-07 21:15,"""A lot of researchers focused their attention on the nine mutations that alter the so-called spike protein that covers the coronavirus and allows it to invade cells. ""

""A lot""?  Really?
Many researchers might be clearer."
2021-06-07 21:23,What's missing from the article is the origin of the virus. This is still the biggest factor in knowing how to respond to Covid. Given that the virus is both increasingly transmissible and increasingly virulent--never seen before in history from what I've read--this increasingly points to the lab origin. We need the truth about the virus. Denial and political decision making will harm us all more in the long run.
2021-06-07 21:02,Orf9b sounds almost like Joe Manchin in the Senate. A McConnell variant destroying the body politic. Just a thought.
2021-06-07 21:07,"There is no such thing as the ""alpha"" virus."
2021-06-07 21:33,"Me and three people I know personally all developed a mild case of shingles with the exact same, but odd, presentation. And all around the same two month period. Rash on the upper chest that went up the neck and to one ear. Reports of this are now showing up in the medical literature (peer reviewed journals). Some people who developed shingles tested positive for coronavirus while others did not. It seems clear that coronavirus can suppress immune response. Please post a reply if you had the same symptoms and were treated for shingles. I’m curious how many others are out there."
2021-06-07 21:36,Love learning about the science behind Covid 19 vaccines and the war between researchers and the random mutations a virus goes through in the replication process. I wish I was more optimistic but it’s only a matter of time before one of them makes it more deadly and vaccines less effective. Sadly the initial success of those vaccines are sending the wrong message to too many people that there is no need to get a vaccination. As long as the vaccines stay effective against the mutations the unvaccinated are only putting themselves at risk but not really since they are providing the virus a home to create that mutation that creates Covid 19 round two.
2021-06-07 21:33,"In coronaviruses, the non-structural protein nsp1 is the principal inhibitor of host cell type I interferon signaling and, unlike ORF 9b, it is present in almost all coronavirus species. But it acts in a general way, merely binding to host cell mRNA’s to keep them from being translated. This shuts down all the host protein-making so the virus can hog the cell’s ribosomes for its own use, to make viral proteins using the viral subgenomic mRNA’s as templates. Since the interferons are of course proteins, their signaling function is therefore shut down. Nsp1 is required for mouse hepatitis virus to replicate in the mouse liver.

ORF 9b is an accessory protein whose properties I wasn’t aware of until now. Kim et. al. omit it altogether in their description of the subgenomic mRNA’s for SARS CoV-2, having an ORF 10 with a question mark that becomes ORF 9b plus ORF 14 in some other papers; it seems information gets out of date quickly as more is learnt. The virus creates about ten kinds of subgenomic mRNA shortly after entering the cell; each is a transcript of part of the virus’s genome.

2021-06-07 22:11,"The good news appears to be that the variants are not resistant to the antibodies eventually produced by the immune system. That may, in part, be why the existing vaccines are still effective against these covid-19 variants."
2021-06-07 22:20,"@Richard Hannay  It doesn't appear to be true that increasing virulence of a virus disease was ""never seen before in history"".  The official WHO account (1988) of ""Smallpox and its eradication"" notes that although smallpox had become endemic in Europe in the 15th century ""it does not appear to have been quite as severe as it became in the 17th and 18th centuries"".  

In those early times there were no virology laboratories (and no knowledge, yet, of microbiology or viruses). 

There is no reasonable basis to argue from an increase in virulence  of covid-19 to any inference that  a laboratory origin is likely.  Viruses have managed to evolve just fine without human help over millions of years."
2021-06-07 22:28,"The ""alpha"" coronavirus variant is the B.1.1.7 variant that is widespread in Britain and now in the United States.

2021-06-07 23:21,I read this article quickly because I was eager to find out one thing:  Does the vaccine protect against this variant?   Maybe I read too quickly but I found no answer and that's all I wanted.
2021-06-07 23:26,"“How” – from this articles title

My concern is that scientists are so busy watching the (What) of these variants that an important question is being largely overlooked. 

The question I would like to see addressed is the probability of this virus mutating in a continually more effective pattern that always seems to focus on the spike proteins rather than any other protein or portion of the virus. And why are all the spike protein mutations in the direction of a more contagious virus?

““It’s very impressive,”- from this article

There should be a way for scientists to calculate some given odds of any protein shuffling of the virus deck, and whether these rapid and effective (for increased transmission and illness) changes are within mathematical probabilities. Some scientists have shown surprise in a few articles. 

We were told when all of this began that pandemic viruses historically have diminished in form to much less serious contagions and yet this virus continually makes all the right moves in its favor, and so why is there not more suspicion of the (How).

Couldn’t the (How) be an important part of considering whether this virus is Lab constructed or not? Is the protein shuffling act by this virus beating the odds by a thousand to one- a million to one? The scientists must have some idea regarding the odds, and that is what we need to know rather than not asking deeper questions."
2021-06-07 23:55,"Thanks, Mr. Zimmer, for this article. You have a great ability for conveying complex material in a clear and concise manner. 
You have made the important note toward the end of the article that infection with the virus confers a more complex and possibly more thorough immune response."
2021-06-08 1:34,"I'm not a medical person but it's been known for some time that COVID sabotages the roll-out of the innate immune system by disrupting the production of interferon (which, as I understand it, is produced by cells that are in the process of being taken over by the virus and among, other things, ""warns"" neighboring cells to take protective measures.)

So the issue is not that this new variant inhibits the production of interferon, but it does so more effectively.

What I'm still trying to understand is how this produces a catastrophic failure in the ability of the adaptive system (Lymphocytes, especially T-cells) to respond appropriately. You see this in the patient characteristics tables where the overall number of Lymphocytes is below minimum, and the CD4 T-cells (the real brains of the immune system) and CD8 T-cells (""killer T-cells"") are way below minimum.

The big problem with COVID is that people with serious cases have steadily diminishing Lymphocyte numbers which means that the ""killer T-cells"" that would normally clear a virus are themselves killed or their production is being down-regulated. 

The result is that the virus essentially multiplies unimpeded and proceeds to infect every organ in sight and you end up with a vast range of problems in the heart, lungs, other major organs.

Anyway, good research.  Hopefully, we'll see something about the Interferon/T-cell connection."
2021-06-08 1:37,"Evolution is wonderful. In antagonistic interactions like parasitism and pathogenic disease there is an arms race between a new pathogen and a host immune system. Vertebrates like humans have evolved a sophisticated adaptive immune system to counter the onslaught of new and old pathogens. 

This immune system acts by intensifying natural selection on pathogens, just like antibiotics creates a new selective environment that bacteria cannot escape. Of course, bacteria generate millions of new random mutations, most of which don’t provide bacteria with resistance to the antibiotic. But it only takes 1 mutation out of millions that permits the bacteria with the mutation to survive and reproduce a resistant strain that forms all new bacterial populations.

Our adaptive immune system acts like the antibiotic, making life difficult for a new virus. But, all it takes is 1 new mutation out of billions to create a new mutant virus that allows it to escape part of the immune response. Viruses with the mutation dominate future viral populations. This, in turn, creates a new source of natural selection on our adaptive immune system to respond with a mutation of its own. Hence, after a week, the immune system can overcome the new virus interferon suppressing mutation. Unfortunately, that extra week gives the virus an advantage to reproduce and harm us. This back and forth is an evolutionary arms race."
2021-06-08 6:14,"If a virus can do what this article says it can, then viruses are smarter than we are, in their own unique way.

No, I am not saying that viruses can compose a symphony or write a Shakespearean play, I am saying that its wiliness transcends and exceeds that of the human brain, and as such, within its own realm of specialty, it is a lot smarter than us.

And when you think about it, it should not come as a surprise, because from an evolutionary point of view, viruses have been around a lot longer than we human beings.

Is there a lesson here for us to learn? Yes there is, and that lesson is that we all need each other to take care of each other, and the way humanity has been heading for centuries, war after endless war, including civil and domestic wars, unless we learn from viruses, we are doomed.

That is what they are teaching us."
2021-06-08 9:18,Where and when does it end.  I am already vaccinated with Moderna but do i want to get jabbed every time a new variant is discovered.  These new discoveries just give more ammunition to the anti-vaxxers or the vaccine hesitant to forego any vaccination.
2021-06-08 7:03,"For most they are starting to get back to normal, in six months they won’t give Covid 19 and all it’s mutations a second thought. They don’t read articles like this, scientific journals, studies of any kind. It’s tragic. This was just a glitch, yes millions have died and it’s absolutely heartbreaking. Thankfully our brilliant scientists and medical professionals have been exceptional in their expediency and we have several vaccinations that appear to be working, currently. We have all lived through now and witnessed the utterly devastating impact economically, socially and physically this has had on society and now our lives. It brought us to our knees and the recovery is ongoing. Perhaps the next “virus” won’t be as kind, 10x more virulent, 20x deadlier and it’s mutations and ability to adapt beyond our understanding. It could potentially finish us as a species. Hubris and Arrogance and a Covid x 10 will be our faith unless we change and come to our senses. I’m not sure or confident we can."
2021-06-08 3:56,"so, how effective is the lower-efficacy J&J vaccine against this and other variants that will result from the failure of certain groups to get vaccinated or wear a mask indoors? [By ""certain groups"", I'm of course referring to Donald ""Tantrum"" Trump supporters.]

2021-06-03 16:39,"Thank you Dr. Pereira and ALL the professionals, like nurses,  at your hospital for saving Dr. Kato. Saving him will save so many others. My son is a transplant recipient so I really appreciate skilled professionals. Dr. Kato, as you meet others, be sure to pass on your ""aha moment"" that you must train others to take your place. Time catches up with everyone eventually, it doesn't have to be Covid."
2021-06-03 16:39,Really shifts the urgency to share Kato's undeniable talents but also in how we approach patients in the medical field. Sometimes textbooks cannot teach everything. Thank you.
2021-06-03 16:39,"Thank you for sharing this story of COVID-19 and recovery. He sounds like an incredible doctor.  I was moved, toward the end, that he realized that he has to recruit others to do the work in Latin America so that it will continue. What a devoted, thoughtful man. And what a thoughtful writer to include that detail."
2021-06-03 16:40,"This truly was a great read, about a remarkable person. And a friendly reminder: despite his superb physical condition, age and expertise, he very nearly died. Death comes for us all, and often it’s a matter of luck.  Good and bad. The best that we can do is to ameliorate the Risks, for everyone.
   Best Wishes, Doctor."
2021-06-03 16:51,"I am glad Dr Kato’s hospital reasonably 
accommodated him while he recovered (using a stool, ramping up to more complex cases etc) Not all hospitals are that generous."
2021-06-03 16:58,What a wonderful triumph for an exceptional person.
2021-06-03 16:59,Thanks for a terrific story. And congratulations to Dr. Kato and his colleagues on his recovery. Long may his empathy for patients resonate.
2021-06-03 17:01,Dr Kato performed a 12 hour operation on my husband in 2015 that added many years to my husband's life.  No other doctor would attempt the surgery.  He was a compassionate man then and now has the added knowledge of what it is like to be in the hospital and the ICU for weeks on end.  I hope that surgeons line up by the dozens to learn from him so that many more people can benefit from these life saving surgeries.  Welcome back Dr Kato!  And please get vaccinated everyone.
2021-06-03 17:04,"This story reminds me of the movie The Doctor, from 1991 starring William Hurt.  Although doctors must remain detached from their patients in order to not become overly emotional, it is valuable for them to experience the hospital system as a patient.  Not to mention the staggering cost of such a visit, in both pain and suffering but also the monetary cost."
2021-06-03 17:04,An inspiring and emotional article! This doctor was already a superhero but the empathy that grew from this ordeal was an additional gift to his future patients and the doctors he will continue to train.                                                                                          The inserted videos were touching. Thank you NYT.
2021-06-03 17:09,What a touching and inspiring story! I love the video too. Go Dr. Kato and team that cared for him. How wonderful it is that he will be able to train the next generation of surgeons and continue the work of his foundation. Go Dr. Kato!
2021-06-03 17:10,Great story of the severity of covid and a miraculous recovery. People who think it’s no worse than the flu should read this.
2021-06-03 17:10,"Truly heartwarming to hear that Dr. Kato has recovered - he has so much more to give.  The efforts of the staff to save him are commendable - saving his life will save many others.  As a physician, I faced a series of serious illnesses and surgeries when I was in my early 50's.  I learned so much about being a better doctor by being a patient.  There is a vulnerability as a patient that you do not feel on the other end as physician.  We all know about empathy, but it is magnified when it happens to you.  And I'll never voluntarily eat Jello again."
2021-06-03 17:14,"It really is eye-opening to see medical care from the other side of the table. I'm so glad this doctor survived, for a whole host of reasons. I wrote a book called, ""What Patients Want: Anecdotes and Advice."" I wrote that ""doctors"" and ""patients"" are not  mutually exclusive terms, as this article verifies. Best of luck to this doctor and his patients."
2021-06-03 17:15,"A truly inspiring, brilliant surgeon and it's so wonderful that he has been able to go back to operating and helping others.  

Godspeed Dr. Kato on your 2nd chance at life."
2021-06-03 17:15,"Today I asked a medical provider in a PT office in Connecticut if they were vaccinated and the answer was no. Reading this article, I simply cannot fathom why vaccination is not mandatory, like with measles or polio, or how anyone could refuse vaccination. For my part, I’m choosing another healthcare provider."
2021-06-03 17:20,"What a wonderful & relevant human interest story.  Great writing by Denise Grady. It brought tears to my eyes as I followed along, and I happy to hear this great surgeon is able to share his innovations and training."
2021-06-03 17:21,"My cousin survived Covid last month, via an ECMO machine. It was a horrible experience, and she has a long road to recovery. She, like this doctor and many others, have new-found empathy for people who go through horrible medical situations. I'm glad the doctor is on the mend and sharing this message.

My cousin did an interview with the CBC encouraging people to get vaccinated and of course, there were haters who commented. Lucky for her, being in Canada, she doesn't have to worry about insurance bills pouring in over the next year. She can focus on her recovery."
2021-06-03 17:28,"As someone who had the fortune of working with Dr. Kato many years ago, I can attest to the level of respect and awe that he deservedly experienced at NYP.  A gentle, compassionate man who was also a rock star! I’m so sorry for what he went through and so grateful that he was so expertly and carefully treated at one of the best hospitals in the country, so that he could return back to his gifts and talents. Thank you for being brave enough to share your story, Dr. Kato and thank you for all that you have contributed to the lives of your patients and colleagues."
2021-06-03 17:31,"Dr. Kato seems like one of the rare ""superstar"" surgeons who actually has sympathy and a sense of understanding of how difficult being a patient is.

Now, he has empathy and more data points to guide him and his team in being an even better doctor (though he sounds pretty fantastic).

I also admire his desire to make the most of the time on earth he has been gifted by his colleagues.

Also, as others note:  PLEASE everyone get your vaccines (especially those bizarre few reluctant nurses and doctors ou there)."
2021-06-03 17:35,"This reading reminded me of a poem read years ago and committed to memory.  I don't recall the author.

""RESILIENCY is a key factor in living. The winds of life may bend us. But, with resilience of spirit, those winds cannot break us. 
To courageously straighten again, after our heads have been bowed by defeat, disappointment and suffering, is the true test of character."""
2021-06-03 18:04,"As a physician myself I would hope that it wouldn't take their suffering a serious illness to appreciate what patients have to go through.

As to Dr. Kato, you might have mentioned a couple of advantages he had over other most patients.  He is paid a very high salary so didn't have to worry about being out of work for an extended period nor did he have to worry about medical bills as no doubt anything his insurance company didn't cover his hospital forgave.

Maybe in addition to advocating for better tasting food he might also consider advocating for everyone to be able to receive quality medical care without have to worry about being bankrupted by it.  That would show he really has an understanding about what many patients have to endure."
2021-06-03 18:07,"Wow.  Well done, Dr. Kato and the army of supportive colleagues.
I had my own experience, very much like Dr. Kato's a few years ago.   Definitely changed my perspective in many positive ways.

He will never be the same doctor again; he will be better."
2021-06-03 18:10,"May Dr. Kato continue to thrive and, as part of that, may his experience be used  to teach other doctors what it means to be the patient. An electrophysiologist observed in one visit that I'd used what to him seemed like a lot of office time.

His comment was humiliating. I moved to an excellent Boston practice, with an electrophysioligist who immediately revised (and restructured) my care plan and, gosh, I seldom see him. That's because he listened and responded.

But, returning to this article, I'm truly happy to hear that Dr. Kato survived Covid. I hope there's another marathon ahead, this one with running shoes.😊"
2021-06-03 18:14,"Patient/doctors like the amazing Dr. Kato, should, as he seems to want to, be using their experiences and knowledge to help optimize health care, incorporating both the patient experience and the expert medical/surgical knowhow.

Dr. Kato will of course touch individuals he directly teaches and treats.

Hopefully also, there are other platforms that enable his multi-directional perspective and expertise to be very widely shared and used for education of doctors, nurses and hospitals (including the many not in direct contact with him).   Certainly there must be other exceptionally competent medical professionals like him, who have deeply experienced both the patient and medical delivery side.  All of them should be continually searched for and helped to engage with platforms that maximize the distribution of their invaluable experiences and knowledge."
2021-06-03 18:15,This is one of the most inspiring stories i have read so far from the NYT this year. I don't think you'll find another surgeon like Dr Kato who is so magnanimous and yet possesses so much leadership and fortitude. Kudos to Dr Emond for recruiting such once in a lifetime talent!
2021-06-03 18:15,"Dr. Kato performed an ex-vivo operation on my colleague’s wife, when no other doctor would touch her. He gave her many more years of high-quality life before she finally succumbed to her disease. 
We are so lucky to have him well and back to doing what he does best."
2021-06-03 18:19,"Fantastic story! Inspiring for all of us. He must be such a great person. Thank you, NYT, for carrying the story."
2021-06-03 18:22,"Dr. Kato is welcomed to the society of the people who got near the precipice but did not fall. As a child I was very sick for a time and almost died. The last memory I have before a life saving surgery is that of falling down a precipice. 
I think there is a common feeling that people who have been in that situation share. It is gratitude for the opportunity you have to go ahead with a life. But there is also the fear you experienced and that will never be erased from your mind. Reading of Dr. Kato's experience brought tears to my eyes. May he live a long and very happy life. May he have peace. May the terrible experience be erased from his mind, except for that solidarity he now has with his suffering patients."
2021-06-03 16:26,So happy to hear Dr Kato has recovered and is back at it!
2021-06-03 16:58,"Click on the link ""he went home"" and view the video on the hospital's page of his release. Very moving."
2021-06-03 17:34,His humility is what touched me the most.
2021-06-03 18:05,"With all of the mayhem, polarization and abject stupidity in the news, this was simply brilliant. Thank you for a touch of humanity.

I'm hopeful that most of the people reading this piece are aware of the value of vaccination.

For the others, get a vax, see the world, be nice to people and they might even be nice to you back.

Lovely article.  Thank you."
2021-06-03 16:34,"Dear Dr Kato,
This is the first time I’ve heard of you!  What an inspiration you are and I am so glad you’re back to your usual self, and even better!  I hope you will teach as many doctors as possible your skills.  Please teach doctors in Asia as well.  Have you thought about online classes to get a wider audience?  Just an idea."
2021-06-03 17:37,Thank you for printing this article and for recognizing Doctors and all medical workers.  Dr. Kato is the embodiment of a saint.
2021-06-03 17:41,"Moving story. Not all of us can be so exceptional but all of us matter. Bless him and his team. Bless us all, five hundred people died of COVID yesterday in the USA and so many more globally. It's NOT over. Get vaccinated and don't make careless choices!"
2021-06-03 17:44,"This riveting narrative offers insight into Dr. Kato's experience, the response of the hospital staff, the virulent course of this disease, and the depth of suffering experienced by millions of other people. Kudos all around, first to Dr. Kato, then to the hospital staff, the writer and The Times."
2021-06-03 17:55,Around the time this surgeon was on a ventilator last year fighting for his life in NYC I had an open air debate from across the street of a closed public parking lot to a popular park in Seattle. A well poised woman stood with a sign reading 'honk if you doubt Covid'. She thought of the closures as an imposition on her liberty and also questioned the very validity of the epidemic itself. I told her what she was advocating was dangerous. A passerby who defended her position suggested I was the deluded party who had been conned. But I expect she and those others probably remain convinced of their crazy beliefs to this day. How is it that so many can still consider it all to be some sort of hoax as if some payback had been possible? And so many people are refusing the vaccine. I really cannot understand these types.
2021-06-03 16:35,"Please, this is so important not just for patients but for those who live with disability.

Disabled people are virtually ignored (I live in the US and live in the NYC metropolitan area) and what they go through on a daily basis is virtually ignored.  

The fact that Dr. Kato got through this difficult chapter in his life is a testament to modern medicine, but also the fact that he still suffers a significant shoulder disabiltiy should be encouragement to all disabled people, and especially disabled medical professionals.

I have had the choice to quit and take full disability for over 25 years.  Instead, I have worked, mostly at a job I didn't like, but I am looking for a new job now.  Even though my health is not very good.  The fact that I can contribute, that my illness and my disabiltiy do not define me, that is important.

And guess what?  There are people in the world who don't ""look disabled"" but need accommodations.  Do you wonder if Dr. Kato meets a new colleague who doesn't know about his battle, they wonder if he is a malingerer if his shoulder bothers him or he has to write something down instead of just remember it?"
2021-06-03 16:39,"Thank you NYTimes for this poignant and uplifting story.   

With the 172,000,000 cases and 3,700,000 deaths reported worldwide, it is just inconceivable that anyone is ""protesting"" the vaccine.

The Covid vaccine will go down in history as the absolute miracle drug of this 21st century."
2021-06-03 17:24,"Only a few surgeons in the world can perform ex vivo surgeries.  They are lengthy and very delicate. This man is true healer.  It is great that they saved his life.  In great health to begin with, not obese, no comorbidities and still got very sick with COVID. 
People should get this vaccine."
2021-06-03 16:52,Dr. Kato go spread that renewed energy and understanding with Patients in the World.
2021-06-03 18:26,I don’t know why but this article made me cry so much. Thank you to Dr. Kato and all the doctors and healthcare and hospital workers.
2021-06-03 16:16,should be a book in this for Dr. Kato.
2021-06-03 16:21,Heroic.
2021-06-03 16:42,What a hero!
2021-06-03 16:48,"“You don’t really want to waste your time, because you never know — one day all of a sudden you are in this situation,” he said.
    Incredible! I am happy that he is fully recovered. Covid is a horrible disease. No one has been spared from Covid-19. Covid has taken a heavy toll on health care workers. I feel sorry for them.
  The lesson we learn from this story is that nobody has a guaranteed tomorrow.
. Therefore make time for the ones that really matter in your life!"
2021-06-03 16:58,"I first learned about Dr Kato’s work after watching a show called NY Med, maybe 10 years ago? I highly recommend watching that episode to see him in action as he successfully removed a giant tumor from a patient that other doctors had said was impossible to remove. He’s truly a remarkable man, I’m so grateful he made it through Covid!!"
2021-06-03 17:10,"thanks NYT ... should be required reading in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Montana, Idaho, and those other states with low vaccinated  rates."
2021-06-03 17:17,"Thank you, Dr. Kato."
2021-06-03 17:25,"Oh Dr. Pereira, I hate Covid too. So much death. So many wonderful people gone. I am so grateful you helped to save such a special One. Thank you."
2021-06-03 17:18,"Great store, Denise Grady…may the NYTimes never allow folks to forget how deadly Covid-19 is and continues to be in it's 'clever' mutations. 

I believe it was Nicholas Kristof who first ventured into a NY ER; I was shocked. But, Ms. Grady's article is not only testament but an emphasis into why we need to vaccinate and not be so cavalier in how we think we can combat this virus. Dr. Kato, in his professionalism has found education through his empirical experience. May he always be 'on call'."
2021-06-03 17:50,I hope more doctors read this article — too many are indignant and pompous and have little empathy. Some don’t care to know the name of their patients —- they are more interested in what kind of insurance you have.
2021-06-03 18:29,"As someone who is a caregiver for two family members who have been through medical dramas on this level, I found this article infuriating. It boggles my mind how little doctors know about the patient's experience. Comments like “I learned that when you cannot talk, it does not mean you are not thinking,” he said. “The mind is so clear.” Yeah, no kidding. That should be obvious. There are hospitals full of people going through dramas like this on a regular basis (why do you think ICU exists?) whether there is Covid or not. How do the doctors (the nurses are a bit less clueless) have so little insight into what it is like to be a patient in that situation?

The comments from his colleagues, about how they couldn't believe it could happen to him and how shocking it was, are also unbelievable. Meanwhile the hospital is full of people having strokes, comas, burns, etc., and the list goes on. Are they some kind of other people? Fundamentally different beings from doctors?

The comments from the medical staff in this article are ableism and need to be called out as such. This needs to be understood as discrimination and an unacceptable othering of patients and sick and disabled people."
2021-06-03 18:30,"I was a medical student at Columbia, and Dr. Kato was legendary. What a great article. I'm so glad he has come through this and was able to go back to his epic work. He has always given hope to people who have been turned away elsewhere."
2021-06-03 18:31,"What a powerful story.  Somehow these mans gifts helped him throughout life and recovery, could not help him for four months.  He was at the mercy of strangers. 

Those strangers - to hand your life to them.  Thanks to those strangers and only hope that if you find yourself in a similarly situation you have smiilar people there."
2021-06-03 18:32,"So happy to hear the Doctor has recovered, a very powerful story that I hope many find inspiring."
2021-06-03 18:34,"It's unethical and will never happen, but I think doctors would be better practitioners if they had to experience a serious illness themselves, for real.
It wouldn't have to be a potentially fatal illness but it should be a life altering condition. They should experience the anxiety of such awful uncertainty. And they really should experience doctors talking down to them.
In my early 40s  after vigorous gardening I developed weird symptoms. Two doctors scoffed at my suggestion that it was my achy back, again. A year later I was diagnosed with MS by a third doctor. It was a very popular diagnosis in those days. Even though my symptoms were atypical. There was no treatment for the level of symptoms I had, but those symptoms seriously limited my life.  After 4 years of arguing with my PCM my life was salvaged by a rheumatologist. It was in fact muscle spasms which responded perfectly to medication and swimming.
A year or so later my PCM told me he'd developed pain in his elbow so severe it had threatened his ability to continue working. Although he was an associate professor at the medical school in DC seven doctors -colleagues!- had disregarded his thoughts about what was going on and talked down to him. After all, he was only an internist. The eighth doctor listened and performed surgery, and he was cured. He was decent to tell me the experience had made him a better doctor. I was too reserved to tell him, ""Good! I'm glad you suffered and learned."""
2021-06-03 18:37,Doctors usually have never been patients. When they do they are horrified. I think part of medical school should be you have to go to a doctors office and give symptoms and not tell them you’re a patient.
2021-06-03 18:39,"The world is a far better and safer place now that Dr. Kato is well again. I, too, am a physician and became ill with Covid in March 2020. I had high fevers, chills, the worst cough ever, weight loss, and profound weakness. It took many months before I could stand and walk normally. My greatest fear through the acute illness was that I would require a ventilator, knowing the low survival rate associated with it. So, I understand Dr.Kato’s desire to get on with his work and to have others continue it as time goes on. I also understand his desire for normalcy and a return to his routine. A year or so later, we finally understand the virus and know how to treat it. We also know how to prevent it, but there are so many people who either don’t understand the need for vaccination or who just don’t care to put themselves out in order to become vaccinated. The vaccine is not poison, it will not harm or kill the recipient, but it will go a long way to preventing severe illness and death in its recipients. Dr. Kato and I survived, but millions of others have not. I urge everyone to read this article, look at themselves and their families squarely in the eye, and then get vaccinated. Let’s all get back to normal. There’s enough to worry about in life without having Covid staring at us every day."
2021-06-03 18:59,So happy to hear the Doctor Kato has recovered. What a powerful story!
2021-06-03 19:02,"Great story.  As a physician, I did find it valuable to be a patient, albeit briefly.  The thing I most remember is how much time I spend looking at the ceiling, and how ugly it was.  The nice art work on the walls is clearly not for patients.  My dream hospital would move it to the ceiling, or at lest paint it nice colors. 

This article might have been a bit better if they mentioned the bill. He probably has good coverage and obviously a good income, but for most Americans, even with good coverage, this kind of stay would result in a 5 figure bill."
2021-06-03 19:05,A happy end. An inspiring and uplifting story.  Thank you. Best wishes to Dr. Kato. who is so deserving of admiration as well as Dr. Marcus Pereira and  all who sustained him in every way and saved his life.
2021-06-03 19:08,"This story has touched me in so many levels: I am so happy Dr. Kato not only survived this awful virus, but he thanks God before he sings in this video, and now has the urgency to pass his knowledge to new generations of physicians. I am also deeply touch by the care and concern of everyone at the hospital taking care of him, a reflection of who have been the real heroes throughout this pandemic: doctors and nurses caring for so many infected people around the world. It also brought me to tears, humbly thanking God myself for protecting me and my family from this virus. My husband and I just got our first dose of the Moderna vaccine and our 12 year old daughter will get hers as well, so I’m also thankful for science and the ability to get vaccinated. I cannot think of a better way to celebrate the recovery of wonderful people like Dr. Kato, and to thank our doctors and nurses, than getting vaccinated!! Thank you Dr. Kato for sharing your story with us and to The New York Times for publishing it!"
2021-06-03 19:08,"Dr. Kato performed surgery on my fiancé. He took a big intestine from an 11 year old boy and implanted in 53 year old man.   The transplant allowed him to live five wonderful years. 
Transplant technology is a miraculous thing.  
I started crying reading this article.  I went on to live a more purposeful life after my fiancé death.  
The transplant team was wonderful and those nurses became my family. 
I have a daughter who has many nurse friends. I told her to make sure she takes them to dinner/lunch, celebrate birthdays, check on them regularly.  They are angels here on earth. The helped me get through many a dark day.  
Thanks Dr. Kato for your expertise and continuing the work. It definitely is a ministry. God bless you and ur team.  God bless all nurses. If you know a nurse, surprise them and buy them a gift."
2021-06-03 19:08,"Heroic efforts by health care workers during crisis ironically conceal the basic desires of the professions in the first place:  intrinsic, sacred value of promoting decent quality of life. 

That’s the ultimate point of being: gaining, sharing, and multiplying good quality of life.

It motivates under-appreciated teachers, social workers, mental health professionals.

It’s all no path to monetary wealth, but to so many ways to wealth that matters: Meaningfulness for the sake of more flourishing.

Why do so many persons seem to lack this ultimate motive for their views of political life? 

Why do so many feel that a little higher taxation on extreme wealth is theft? 

Greatest of all is the selfless devotion that works to leave a legacy, as Dr. Kato did BEFORE his deathly illness, as well as even more afterward.

The Point of It All: make all lives matter."
2021-06-03 19:09,"Thank you to Dr. Kato and every single hospital staff and worker who have continued to show up, mask up, and care for patients during the last 15 months. 
I feel truly indebted to you all, as I never got sick nor did any of my friends or family and that is in large part because of the work that each of you did. 
‘Thank you’ does not adequately express my depth of gratitude."
2021-06-03 19:17,"""My hero."" What an amazing man. Thank heavens he was saved to continue his work. Dr. Kato is truly an inspiration in these dark times. Thank you for this inspiring story."
2021-06-03 19:19,Moved me to tears. Bless him and bless the mindset that says service to others matters.
2021-06-03 19:22,"I applaud Dr. Kato's full recovery, and I hope he has many, many more years of good health.
But I hope he also realizes that not every Covid-19 patient will be able to make a complete recovery, no matter how physically fit they were before getting sick. And I hope he feels sympathy for them as well."
2021-06-03 19:22,"I think we need a National Health Care Workers Day. Where would we all be without those who perform the surgeries, give the shots, take the temperatures, administer the medicines and tell us they'll do everything they can to help us and make us better. On behalf of every American, I thank you Dr. Kato. May your life be long and full."
2021-06-03 19:26,Great story.  I'm so glad he will go on to teach.
2021-06-03 19:27,I was fortunate to work with Tom Kato for a decade in Miami under the direction of Dr Andreas Tzakis. It was a period of tremendous innovation in transplant surgery. We worked very hard. And helped many people. Halcyon days.
2021-06-03 19:28,I’m incredibly thankful for physicians like this transplant surgeon. He’s rightfully respected and revered. The doctor had big talent on his care team. The best of all personnel were in on this case 24/7 and help was situated in a solid academic medical center. This Covid patient had the best possible care available and it surely saved his life. I don’t want better protein shakes. I want competent care and no traumatic billing.
2021-06-03 19:31,"Wonderful person 
and a Fantastic Doctor.

I think every Medical Student should 
have to go and wait in the Emergency Room 
for 6 hours, then be hooked up to various devices
for three days to they can sense what patients have to go through."
2021-06-03 19:35,"I wonder if Dr. Kato would have gotten as sick now as he did in March 2020, with everything we have learned from the millions of people who have now gone through this process.

Also even with vaccines, chances are very good this is going to happen again; I hope folks are well trained and prepared."
2021-06-03 19:42,"Truly an amazing soul. I wonder what motivated him to leave Japan to live in the United States besides opportunity?

Trump advocated merit based immigration vs the family immigration used today. Clearly Dr Kato would've qualified. But I wonder if he would've chosen to come to the US if it was like the one envisioned by Donald Trump.

I doubt it because even immigrants with ""merit"" saw what Trump was doing and were dissuaded or even appalled at his treatment of immigrants, legal or undocumented. Words like ""kung flu"" and ""Asia virus"" might have kept him away. 

Immigration renews our country. They bring in new ideas and energy when some natural citizens are jaded about the US. We need to appreciate the gifts they bring to our nation. Not just the obvious ones of Dr Kato, but for their simple willingness to work hard and love the country."
2021-06-03 19:43,"Thank you for shining a light on a true hero living amongst us. Everyone should know Dr. Kato’s name and what he contributes every day to improving the lives of others.  May he live a long, happy, and fulfilling life. A role model if there ever was one."
2021-06-03 19:44,"I didn't realize how fortunate I was when I was referred to a certain specialist over 35 years ago.  Throughout the years since then, I have continued to see him on and off until he moved to another state. The doctor is not only excellent in his field, but he is the most compassionate doctor I have ever known.  Throughout the past ten years, he has agreed to meet with me and doesn't charge me a dime.  Now that he's living in another state, I can still call him for if I'm having a problem.   This combination of compassion and skills is hard to find in almost any field, but especially in Medicine."
2021-06-03 19:52,Looks like a sad story developing into a happy ending.
2021-06-03 19:53,"Thank you, Dr. Kato, for sharing your very challenging experience, and, thank you, Denise Grady for writing about it."
2021-06-03 19:55,"Pandemic, illness, hospitalization, death, here and around the world.  

Political discord, geopolitical instability, the growing threat of war.  

The story of Dr. Kato’s determination, his resilience and path back to recovery is a parable. I look to better days ahead by his example."
2021-06-03 20:08,"What a wonderful story of a journey that not only is inspirational, courageous & uplifting, but shows the true tenacity of the human spirit. 
This is ONE for the CHICKEN SOUP FOR THE SURGEONS SOUL.  When the medical professional is on the ""receiving end"" of medical care, it can be a wake up call. 
The thickener described in this story is a powder added to fluids making them safer for patients to drink (EAT), while suffering from swallowing difficulties. You can literally stand a spoon up in the mixture, it is that thick. And it is not palatable.
Dr. Kato displays a genuinely giving soul & a kind measure of empathy for others. May God bless him in his achievements."
2021-06-03 20:29,"My sister had a much needed liver transplant 15 years ago. She was barely alive and today is at the peak of health today. She lectures first year medical students about the ""patient experience"" speaking about her first hand experience as a transplant recipient. 
For years I have followed Richard Selzer, Jerome Groopman and Atul Gawande because of their to see patients as beyond an algorithm. As my sister said to one of her doctors, ""I'm not a liver with ears"". Why must a physician experience the ailment before they can treat a patient with some degree of empathy?"
2021-06-03 20:36,"Qualified surgeons such as Dr. Kato are gods who perform small miracles. I'm so happy to learn that this story ends well. The doc. deserved to live and resume a normal life as he will continue performing these amazing surgeries. Let's also hope, he leads a happy life with his loved ones.  I can only wish him well and thank him for advancing the medical science in ways few people on earth are gifted with such talent and expertise."
2021-06-03 20:38,"It is so touching and I cried after I read and watch healing concert !  Hope and wish him well and continues to teach us ! Thank you for your service Dr. Kato, you are amazing !"
2021-06-03 20:43,"I don’t cry often—hardly at all.   But this type of situation makes me cry.

As a survivor of 2 almost-fatal illnesses which required 2 surgeries each and several months convalescence.    I feel about the 3 doctors who saved my life exactly the  same way that about my own family.

As a 20-year old resident of Madrid, a doctor saved my life—seeing the results of my blood tests—he came over around midnight to our house and made arrangements to have me operated at 2 am.  I imagine I was close or in sepsis. 

I imagine Dr. Herrera’s long hours was a factor along with his heavy set that contributed to his ultimely demise in his 50’s—I remember my mother crying on the news.    I still cry when I pass over his house in Madrid when I am there.

Again, in 2003 I almost died---I had been told it could be cancer.  I had refused my surgery  to this point because I had an employer PPO health plan—     I also had made my last will.
My doctor based in Sacramento forgave me the $4,000 deductible.  
These are for me the “real heroes” in our lives.  

  I am so proud to have 3 MD’s in my family.   One female cousin became an oncologist because his 31-year old father had died  of Leukemia when she was a todler.

After  facing edath—there is a determination to use  life with a purpose, be a better person,  to be compassionate to others.   This is the sunny side of the darkness of facing death.

I am just so happy and thankful  Dr. Kato survived.    I hope he has a very long and healthy life."
2021-06-03 20:51,"I'm so glad you surprised, Dr. Kato.  Thank you for sharing your story."
2021-06-03 20:55,"I remember the commercial for New York-Presbyterian Hospital approximately 10 years ago in which the young girl who was a patient mentioned Dr. Kato.  He had operated and according to her “took the bad organs out and put the good organs back in” and she was all better.  And she said nonchalantly that’s pretty much her story.

As the article noted, Dr. Kato’s life-or-death experience with COVID-19 has made him an even better doctor because he’s lived it - and made it through."
2021-06-03 21:07,"Dr. Kato, thank you for being the uplifting story that we all need in these tough times.  Watching you and the other health workers sing ""A Whole New World"" made me cry.   So beautiful."
2021-06-03 21:10,"What does Dr. Kato recommend we all do to avoid SARS CoV-2 and, if necessary, recover from full blown Covid 19? Did he get monoclonal antibodies? How might his physicians prevented him from having to undergo ECMO?"
2021-06-03 21:12,"As someone who has had a 40 year history of cardiac issues that culminated with a transplant it is truly wonderful to hear 'I didn't know that side'. I have so often heard from Doctors 'I know what you're going through' when generally from my perspective most have no idea and are using it as a calming phrase.

It is genuinely refreshing to hear his thoughts on living through a life threatening situation, to recover, to be able to utilize and most of all teach his valuable skill set for others."
2021-06-03 21:14,Dr. Kato's story hit completely home with me as a Japanese man only two years older than him and in fine health that I never take for granted. He is my new hero. I hope that the Tokyo Olympics committee reads it and takes it to heart.   I stand with the 80 percent of the Japanese people who oppose the games happening this summer.
2021-06-03 21:14,"There are many talented doctors, but so many of them are talented but not great. Dr. Kato learned this the hard way. Empathy makes talented doctors great. He will be a better doctor for it, and I hope that the trauma his body and mind went through to learn this lesson don't take him away too soon. At least he is planning to share his talent by training others. Hopefully, he'll teach the importance of empathy, so that his mentees can be great, too."
2021-06-03 21:16,"I am certainly glad that Dr. Kato received the best care possible , shared his recovery story and lessons learned, a big Bravo for that!.
We should also remember the many who do not have the resources and fortitude that have been afforded Dr. Kato
Many lost, many impaired, many jobs lost, many in financial ruin because of the hospital system he thrives in.
I hope he will use his knowledge, expertise, and moral values to further reform our health care system and hospital practices."
2021-06-03 21:21,"Thank for bringing this terrifying experience to life. For too many, this is a price too high to pay. For them and their families, I truly grieve.

Many physicians - so comfortable in the work environment of a hospital - have never been a patient for more than a day or two. They have never experienced such terror.

Thankfully many physicians have a very strong sense of empathy. But many well-meaning, incredibly talented doctors have not had to endure anything close to what their patients live day to day.

A wonderful physician, who has appreciated both sides of the hospital gown, is a treasure indeed.

I wish Dr. Kato many more marathons to run. I am grateful he can teach both others about his astounding surgical techniques and his humbling, arduous journey back to health."
2021-06-03 21:24,Bravo to Dr. Kato and to the team that cared for him!
2021-06-03 21:33,"Truly a wonderful story of the recovery of a hero. Certainly enduring illness is enlightening but not, I believe, essential to either being or becoming an empathetic physician. Every profession is made up of the entire spectrum of humanity. Dr. Kato may have a new perspective on being a patient but from his history I doubt that he had been robotic in caring for his patients. 

When viewing the staff concert celebrating his survival, I wonder if all of those other frontline heroes are still with us and pray that they are.  Covid was raging and not enough could be done to keep them healthy and safe to continue their good fight.  God bless them all."
2021-06-03 21:34,"Bravo Dr Kato. It also make you think, maybe other doctors will learn to be more understanding to patients without going through a horrifying experience"
2021-06-03 21:34,I have worked with Dr Kato at NYP. He’s not only a brilliant surgeon but he’s also a very calm and patient person. I am very happy to hear that you are back to work. It’s an honor to have worked with you.
2021-06-03 21:44,"What an incredible story! Best wishes, dear Dr. Kato."
2021-06-03 21:45,"My father was an internist and cardiologist who had a heart attack in his mid fifties and very sadly died of colon cancer which turned into lung cancer in his sixties.

They always say doctors make the worse patients I think that is because they are so focused on caring for others they dont remember to care for themselves."
2021-06-03 21:55,"Bravo to Dr Kato’s entire intensive care team, rehabilitation team and his amazing determination to return to cherished medical arena. A medical profession who has experienced major medical events most always provides the empathetic care. My childhood polio experiences made me a really good nurse."
2021-06-03 22:18,"In the early seventies, my sister worked with Dr. Robert Bartlett the developer of the the ECMO machine.  The first patient to be treated with the machine was a baby who was suffering severe lung damage.  The treatment was a success and the baby lived.  I didn't realize ECMO was used to treat severe COVID cases.  Dr. Kato's experience sounds horrific and I'm glad to read that he recovered.  Best Wishes to him."
2021-06-03 22:20,Proud of Dr. Kato and his colleagues.  A great read.
2021-06-03 22:27,"Wow, what a fascinating story.  I’d be interested to know the outcome of the heroic surgeries performed by Dr. Kato, such as the one referenced in the article on the 7 year old child where multiple abdominal organs were removed, scraped of tumor, and then reinserted..... I was a medical student at Columbia P&S in the early 2000s and saw similar procedures performed by other surgeons.  They were quite amazing, but life span of the patient wasn’t extended much. The cancer inevitably returned, and the patient died anyway, perhaps 4-6 months or so later than they would have if heroics had not been undertaken. I particularly recall a young teen with diffuse abdominal mesothelioma; I felt so sorry for her; her parents were eager to eek out every additional day, though the poor child seemed to understand and be at peace with her situation.  Breaks my heart whenever I recall it."
2021-06-03 22:30,What an amazing human. So glad he survived and that his colleagues did everything for him.
2021-06-03 22:33,"As soon as I saw Dr. Kato's name mentioned in this story, I remembered it from the very effective NY Presbyterian commercial that featured Heather telling her story.  It gave me pause once again to think about the sheer brilliance and dedication of doctors like Tomoaki Kato.  I so appreciate what they know and are able to do.  It really is amazing.  I am beyond happy that he beat covid and got better. He is a gift to humanity."
2021-06-03 22:34,"What an immensely human story. Thank you for sharing such bravery and tenacious willpower. I am a RN and see people experiencing unplanned detours in their life journey, like Dr. Kato, and am consistently amazed by the sense of dispatch survivors develop. 

Thank God, Healthcare, Dr. Kato and the NYTimes for reminding me how special we all are."
2021-06-03 22:41,"Viewing the healing concert with a still-recovering Dr. Kato and the ""healing chorus"" of nurses and medical students/residents, most likely, brings Dr. Kato's story and struggle full circle. This is a testament to humanity, hope and love that never wavered even in the face of Dr. Kato's darkest days. 

I am certain that Dr.Kato has also come to appreciate on a deeply personal level the power that a team of dedicated healers holds in the lives of critically ill patients. 

As a former pediatric nurse in Neurology/Neurosurgery and Oncology at what was formerly known as Babies Hospital, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, I saw and worked first hand with nurses, physicians, and other medical professionals to give everything that we had to the sickest children and families. They deserved nothing less and we could expect nothing less from ourselves. In addition to our clinical care, there were the moments of shared humanity, getting to know the families and the stories that accompanied their journey to the hospital that lifted us all and healed us all, regardless of the outcome. 

I am also certain that Dr. Kato will experience even more clearly and deeply as a result of his illness, the power that a caring healer and a team of healers speaks to the fears and hopes of patients and their families/loved ones."
2021-06-03 22:49,"There is one reason why nobody who works in a hospital intensive care setting ever wants to be a patient in any hospital ICU. What goes on there are desperate measures to save the patient. The staff knows too well the thinness of the line separating life and death and the chance is always a question of the level of success or in more layman terms 'Who will I be if I survive?'

The teams in intensive care units are the hardest fighters, the most courageous, and the most intensely focused individuals. In comparison, they are astronauts compared to taxi drivers. I don't mean to infer that taxi drivers are not capable. Taxi drivers put their lives on the line daily. (Thank you! I depend on you, taxi drivers!). The knowledge depth is different. The profile of most ICU staff and doctors is just off of the clock. 

I'm 71 and never been in ICU as a patient. I still hope I never find myself in one but if I do I understand in am in the hands of the finest."
2021-06-03 22:53,"In this era of a failing and bankrupting US medical ""system"", every story featuring a patient history should always include, if only in passing, a synopsis of the medical bills and the insurance coverage.  As with standard requests for comment, simply report when such information was not provided when requested."
2021-06-03 22:55,"Great story of a great man, surgeon, hospital and exemplary spirit. I wish we had more people like Dr. Kato instead of the crazy ones that grab headlines.

More stories like this please!"
2021-06-03 23:02,"Inspiring amazing story of Dr. Kato and his journey. So glad you are back operating and pushing forward.  As a 31 year survivor of metastatic cancer diagnosed in my  first year of med school I can relate to relating to patients in some days much more than relating to physicians because of my experience as a patient.  As a human being straddling the two worlds I can say that my patients appreciate my empathy and I appreciate their trust.  And as someone with a second chance in life I have tried to make the most of it for myself, my family , my friends and my patients.  Death is breathing on all our necks and after this pandemic I think we all get it now more than ever and are ready to live our lives to the fullest."
2021-06-03 23:02,"What a story! So well written. Glad for the happy ending! As a retired ICU director who spent almost forty years in the field, I admire all the doctors, nurses and aids who took care of Dr. Kato. He seems to be a genuine gift to humanity! That the extraordinary efforts and expense proved successful is a reason to support intensive care. Hope that Dr. Kato continues to do his great work. Bonus is that he understands his patients a little better!"
2021-06-03 23:03,"A very gratifying tale. For significantly less serious reasons, I have been a patient at both Columbia Presbyterian and University of Wisconsin hospital (Madison). It is never a bad idea to live in the neighborhood of a great teaching hospital."
2021-06-03 18:30,"Oh my god bless you doctor, we had a friend out here in Oregon at OHSU that had an operation to remove thousands of tumors from her tummy thank you for teaching others"
2021-06-03 18:31,Dr Pereira ... I hate COVID too ! It is horrible watching what this is doing to the rich and the poor and devastating mankind in so many ways!
2021-06-03 20:09,Early days of Covid really did feel like the very worst was happening to the planet. ... like something out of a horrible sci-fi movie. This account is difficult to imagine and yet some people went right to the edge and came through. Dr Kato now knows life. The world needs him more than ever.
2021-06-03 21:20,A miracle
2021-06-03 21:28,"Wow, if this were a tv movie only Hallmark would show it. He , his accomplishments, and survival are inspirational.  I read the obit of F. Lee, and if you juxtaposed the two Kato KO's Bailey in one round."
2021-06-03 22:42,. . .Saving Dr. Kato . . .!!!  thank you Dr. Pereira et al
2021-06-03 18:51,"When I was working at Columbia last year, I heard of the famous surgeon who got really sick of COVID. I’m glad he’s doing so well right now!"
2021-06-03 19:31,What an article. Wow.... So glad that the Doc recovered. To bad he had to almost die to see what its like to be a patient hanging on by a thread. I think all covid vaccine  deniers should read this article and be thankful that this never happens to them. Apparently the good Lord wants you to continue the lifesaving  medicine you give to your patients.
2021-06-03 19:35,"Want to see visually how much Dr. Kato’s recovery means to his hospital coworkers ?  Check out on YouTube: “Dr. Kato, Discharge Day”
Thank you to Laura Swalm for posting it !"
2021-06-03 19:52,Is Dr Kato referring to the surgical procedure known as The Whipple? Is his technique different from the more commonly used procedure?
2021-06-03 20:21,Real life Doctor Strange
2021-06-03 20:31,"NYC got hit especially hard in March 2020 as people continued to drive together, attend Religious services together, work together early in the month, eat together and close hand to mouth and attend basketball and other grouped events. This as our Dear Leader in America, allowed people on planes to come to the USA from China, 40 thousand people brought the seeds of a rapidly spreading virus with them on planes from China. There is no doubt about this. Our Dear Leader did not close down travel fast enough despite his saying otherwise and bringing this disease to JFK and then to Flushing and all parts of NYC caused the rapid spread of the deadliest form of this virus which rapidly spread and killed quickly as it was little understood. China sequenced the DNA of the Virus very quickly and shared that information with the World which was a great help but the USA got no help from its own Country early on which did not take it seriously at all. It was a shame to hear them continue to blame the great Dr. Fauci for saying we did not need masks briefly before it was understood how masks benefit the wearer and those they come in contact with. Overall, I blame the horror on our Dear  Fired Leader. We could have done better and NYers would not have gotten so sick for so long. Glad Dr. Kato recovered to do the surgeries he does and for the lives he saves. The best thing he learned was that teaching others his technique is of the utmost importance and his ego has been put aside. Bravo!"
2021-06-03 19:33,Why did he get so sick? There is still so little we understand about this virus. Please get vaccinated.
2021-06-03 19:40,"There is so much we still don't know about Covid. 
Did we make progress in the treatment of Covid since Dr Kato got sick?
Why does a fit 56 year old Marathon Runner went thru such an ordeal while Governor Chris Christie and Donald Trump had it easier
Are Covid Survivors immune from the disease?
How many children without co-morbidity died from Covid?
Why are there cases when only one  spouse get infected with Covid?"
2021-06-03 21:06,"Compared to Dr. Cato, I am a physical and mental wimp! I am also 20 years older. And yet, l cruised through Covid, comparatively speaking. My case, March to May, 2020, was incredibly light compared to his. I just stayed at home and slept it off.￼
Now I ask, how could this happen? Why was I spared, while he was not? I just don’t get it!￼￼￼"
2021-06-03 21:07,"So glad you recovered Doctor Kato!!! Such an inspiring, up-lifting story to read."
2021-06-03 19:04,"Great piece. I was astounded by his boss-- or colleague-- not sure, who is quoted saying ""Covid, why couldn't you give ME a win."" This is what's wrong with narcissistic doctors. They are concerned with their wins and losses, not the human inside the patient."
2021-06-03 19:15,Real empathy is so much harder than it appears.
2021-06-03 21:37,Brought me to tears.  Every COVID denier should read this story.  Thank goodness he was so fit.
2021-06-03 18:58,"three cheers...that's a win...and truth be told, in the long run, it is only all of us...mankind...that can win."
2021-06-03 22:22,"As an RN, this made cry. I dunno...it really does feel like “a whole new world”...that involves PTSD for a lot of us."
2021-06-03 22:33,It's likely if he wasn't so fit...the good Doctor might not have made it through....incredible story ...no question !!
2021-06-03 22:35,"How can a transplant surgeon say he's never faced the reality of death? 
I congratulate him on his recovery. Without the devoted care of his colleagues I assume he wouldn't have made it. Makes you think."
2021-06-03 22:48,"Happy to see him survive this horrendous disease.
New York medical board must ask him to provide fitness to practice by going to the PACE program before he is declared fit. WA state medical board has such a policy to retest before one is allowed to practice fully."
2021-06-03 18:23,This man is my hero. Will someone nominate him for the Nobel Prize? Godspeed Mr. Kato.
2021-06-03 20:41,"A surgeon who never contemplated death? Or his own? Sounds like he's overdosed on hubris. Or he's as vacuous as we expect a beauty pageant contestant. Come to think of it...in my experience, that might not be a stretch.

What full grown man, who deals with life and death situations and has peoples lives under their purview, has not contemplated his death? I dont care how many marathons he's run...only a ridiculously stout wall of denial, topped with  the concertina wire of arrogance would prevent such obvious mental wandering.

I can only imagine what being a patient and/or working with Dr. Kato must have been like. Lets hope he got knocked down multiple pegs. And hasn't now turned his survival into unearned virtue, and self aggrandizement."
2021-06-03 22:27,Incredible story. Dr. Kato sounds like a really fine person. The world is a better place with him in it.
2021-06-03 20:49,Wow! I’ve got a new hero.
2021-06-03 19:54,Bless you Dr. Katowice and for all the wonderful work that you do.
2021-06-03 20:54,All who refuse the vaccine should be made to sign a form stating that they refuse healthcare should they get infected by the virus covid 19. If they are so sure that the virus is a hoax and it is all a gov't plot etc... then they should have no problem signing the waiver.
2021-06-03 21:35,"Insightful article, as well as a good reminder of the importance of getting the Covid-19 vaccination."
2021-06-03 20:47,"Dr. Kato reminds me of Dr. Ferraro here: case in point, a friend of mine had been diagnoses with terminal lung cancer and Ferraro, a reputed oncologist, opened him in 2000. Chances of survival for such a cancer are one to one hundred thousand. 
Today, some 20 years after, my friend hopped on his bicycle and went for a 20 km jaunt."
2021-06-03 18:44,"Dr. Kato sounds like he was a wonderful human being and excellent surgeon before this frightening attack on his life.  

Now he is even better.  He says, “I really never understood well enough how patients feel,”.

Some years ago I read Warren Buffett's approved biography, ""Snowball"".  He is, of course, one of the wealthiest people on the planet and when his wife got cancer he had no more sway than any of us to get quick, positive care and results.

One primary failing of our medical complex is the lack of understanding and empathy for the patients - those of us who pay for and keep them running.  It boggles the mind.

Medical and corporate training at every organizaiotn should be customer/consumer centered.  They have no business - or money - without US.  Time they realized it."
2021-06-03 23:23,"I am in awe of Dr. Marcus Pereira. At a time when no one had any clear idea on how to battle covid, he managed to rescue the brilliant Dr. Kato. What a fantastic team they have there. Truly this article brings out the brilliance in the field of medicine in America. So glad Dr. Kato has recovered and is able to continue to help desperate patients, this time armed with experience from the other side. Wonderful story."
2021-06-03 23:28,"Many readers can't believe a surgeon never faced the reality of death. It's just nonsense. How many here have had teachers or professors who don't understand what it's like to be a student even though they WERE once students?

A soldier might kill many people but decades later (such as with WWII or Vietnam) meet the family of those they killed and only then the reality hits them. 

My father was in an accident when a motorcyclist, taking a turn too fast slid out and right under my father's car. He watched the life go out of the guys eyes when he opened the driver's side door. I asked him how he felt about it and my father said: ""It was a plastic manikin, nothing more"". My father explained that he's getting old, he's not crazy, but he doesn't want PTSD or even to deal with it, so he just tells himself -- ""it was a store manikin"" and my father went on living happily until he died sound of mind 30 years later at 102.

Denial is a strong cognitive function and often allows us to get our jobs done w/o being paralyzed. It can often be quite effective and useful."
2021-06-03 23:23,"First thought:  What an exceptional human being.  How fortunate the world is to have him.

Second:  Covid deniers and anti-vaxers are unbelievably ignorant and arrogant.  Likely none will read this article of immense suffering from covid but they should."
2021-06-03 23:55,"'Facing death has also brought his career and his goals into a sharper focus, he said.

“You don’t really want to waste your time, because you never know — one day all of a sudden you are in this situation,” he said.'

I needed to hear this today. I'm taking it to heart. Thank you and bless you, Dr. Kato."
2021-06-03 23:58,Amazed at the letters doubting Dr. Kato never faced/contemplated the reality of death. Really? Is that all they can say about this survivor? They are probably not physicians.

2021-06-04 0:12,"Dr. Kato, was given the greatest gift ever, a life changing experience that makes you even more appreciative of your life. 
 With that type of experience you gain incredible wisdom and a new sense of what is important and the ability to let go of the minor things in life to focus on the major things that make your life richer.  I speak from experience."
2021-06-04 0:17,Absolutely extraordinary.  Congratulations to the doctor for being able to go back to work.
2021-06-04 0:14,Don't understand the haters or humbug comments here.   We need more people like Dr. Kato in the world.   The world is a better place with him in it.
2021-06-04 0:15,">“I really never understood well enough how patients feel,” he said. “Even though I’m convincing patients to take a feeding tube, and encouraging them, saying, ‘Even though it looks like hell now, it will get better and you’ll get through it,’ I really never understood what that hell means.”

This has been my experience with doctors — their inability to truly empathize.

Tell them that you’re in excruciating pain and they’ll tell you to meditate or, worse, completely dismiss your issue.  Maybe tell you perfunctorily “I’m sorry, gee, that’s too bad”

A doctor that I was seeing told me that surgeons are the worst when it comes to empathy.

I bookmarked this article and copied the salient portions to my Notes app."
2021-06-04 0:16,I’m glad Dr Kato recovered. But there were a total of a few dozen HCPs who were infected and got sick as a result of exposure to the patient who sickened Dr Kato. Let’s hear their stories as well and recognize the heroics of ALL the HCPs who got sick at the beginning of the pandemic. Many were not as lucky as Dr Kato.

2021-06-04 0:34,"Reading some of the comments about how Dr. Kato had never faced the reality of death, how many of us do, until it's close or upon us? Dr. Kato and many other surgeons may or may not have a feeling of omnipotence that doesn't really change until they too feel the ""Shadow of Death"". Myself, Dr. Kato and all of the other brilliant surgeons of the world that are doing unbelievable, innovative things to save people's lives, well, my hat goes off to them. I'm glad that you survived and that you're OK Dr.Kato  and thank you."
2021-06-04 0:42,"Alas, these stories of very expensive medical costs are not rare. I just received my Medicare statement and Medicare was billed $102 for a Covid-19 swab test. I was flabbergasted. It was billed as a consult with a nurse practitioner although I was in one of the drive- through testing facilities here in Arizona. The claim was for a 30-44 minute new patient consult. In fact with the paperwork completed online, the appointment set up on line, all I did was remain in my car while the San was done. Medicare paid just over $98 for this test. No wonder the Medicare funds are depleted. This is disgraceful. No wonder millions of Americans, especially seniors were advised to take the test- these providers are taking in the wealth. Disgraceful. Oh by the way, the Medicare agent’s response was-“Well, it didn’t cost you anything.” It sure did because the money in the Medicare fund is no longer there in the event  I or you need might it in future."

2021-06-04 1:11,"My friend is not famous. She doesn't do transplants for children in South America. She is a pastor in a small American city where she does marriage and other counseling to survivors of trauma. She is well loved. People rely upon her.  When she became ill she kept getting sent home because they didn't get a positive test (no reference to their own reliability charts!). Finally, a friend stopped by to see her, and she smelled like death. Another friend, a veterinarian accompanied her to the ER where they tried to turn her away again. He listed all the reasons she should be admitted w/o disclosing he was a vet. They admitted her. 24 days in the hospital, lost her hair, her kidneys, her hearing and the nerves in her feet. This illness has shown the best and the worst of the American medical system. You shouldn't have to be a world famous doc to have everyone in a hospital pulling for you! I am glad Dr. Kato and my friend lived. May they both go on to help the souls entrusted to them."
2021-06-04 1:13,That was a beautifully written article. Very powerful to read and a wake up for many us.
2021-06-04 1:20,"I take my hat off to Dr. Kato, what a beautiful story."
2021-06-04 1:10,Wow what a hero!
2021-06-04 1:17,Sensitive story. This doctor’s near death experience with Covid has definitely made him a better human being.
2021-06-04 1:26,What an inspiring story you shared! Hope the new eyes of Dr Kato are much more human than before..Life lessons are arrange..
2021-06-04 1:30,"Amazing.  Thanks to the staff that enabled his recovery, - their work has become the benefit to many, - a success of the ""trickle down"" theory that we can all endorse....

One has to wonder, how much better would health care be, if the healer had experience of the patient...

Can we try to forego blaming the patient of misrepresentation??

Fabrication of a personal health problem must be in the main a very rare event.  14,000 diseases, - could it be doctoral ego that prevents patients being heard and tended to?  

The article should be required reading for doctors everywhere."
2021-06-04 1:30,"Dr. Kato for President. I think he understands - empathy, intelligence, hard work, dedication."
2021-06-04 1:32,"As a cancer patient who just had his feeding tube removed yesterday, I appreciated this story so much. What Dr. Kato endured (and patients endure routinely) is a life lesson for everyone how life can suddenly become not one of joy but of struggle. I appreciate that Dr. Kato is more empathetic now toward his patients and I too recommend the strawberry flavor for feeding tube patients. #cancersurvivor"
2021-06-04 1:42,"Dr. Kato is indeed amazing.  I also think about all of his healthcare providers who nursed him down a long painful terrifying road.  Hats off to: the Patient Care Attendants who like loving mothers, fathers and grannies tended to his every and most personal needs and made him comfortable in his bed, to the Housekeepers who practiced Infection Control in his room, to the Nurses who encouraged him, kept ever vigilant over him and gave him touch and love, to the Physical Therapists who lifted him and believed in their hearts that he must continue onward, to the Respiratory Therapists whose every breath was made in sync with his as a spirit of life, to the Physicians...Interns, Residents and Attendings ... who applied their best medicine, who consulted and communicated well with each other, who prayed for him, who went home at night with Dr. Kato close to their hearts, ... and to his family who passed sleepless nights, prayed, bargained with God, believed, held each other for strength.  And of course to the patient himself whose will to live won over the equally strong force of the virus. He was lucky.  He had superb care.  Despite our shortcomings, US healthcare is quite remarkable.  Let’s make sure all patients receive same.  Godspeed Dr.Kato!"
2021-06-04 1:43,Dr. Kato performed surgery on my brother-in-law in 2009 when no other surgeon would do it and when they gave my brother in law weeks to live. Because of Dr Kato my brother-in-law lived for another seven years and saw his new born grow up. Dr. Kato is a remarkable surgeon and human being and the world needs his services and expertise. Glad to hear he’s made a full recovery and here’s hoping he continues his remarkable work for many more years.
2021-06-04 1:32,"Thank goodness the life of this brilliant surgeon was spared...

For obviously, his remarkable contributions to medicine and the saving of many lives is not past but present tense!!! His important work lives on!"
2021-06-04 1:54,"Fully granting that a transplant surgeon with empathy is better than that same transplant surgeon without empathy, surely it's enough that they can do transplant surgeries, per se. Thank you to all transplant surgeons, all surgeons, all MDs, all RNs, all NAs, all people who are working in hospitals with or without fancy degrees.

Is there no story about health care workers that will shame the trolls into silence? And must Dr. Kato actually serve as a witness to the claim that ""God works in mysterious ways,"" with or without his consent? Thank you, Dr. Kato."
2021-06-04 1:58,"Thank you, Dr. Kato, for allowing your story to be shared. It takes courage to open yourself up to the criticism you know you'll get from those wanting to discredit any good that can come from your transformative experience. And yet, we need these stories and conversations around health care (like posted by Peggy Carey, Colorado below) to help us all connect with the fragility and preciousness of life. Your story supports my personal life statement that ""change can happen, hope does exist.""  I appreciate you, your courage, and the passion you now have for sharing your surgical gifts to help others. This was a lovely story."
2021-06-04 1:58,"I can relate to Dr. Kato's sense of disorientation after ventilator treatment, having had kidney stones that sent me into sepsis.  It is like your brain and your body are at odds, the pain can be managed but the thoughts and weird imagry cannot.  

I would suggest that any patient coming off a vent or other measure that renders it hard to speak be offered a means to communicate, it was almost impossible for me to convey my thoughts until a family member who works with disabled kids finally realized I was asking for writing items.  If some one cant summon the energy to write an image board can be helpful, blink when I touch the image sort of thing.  

Patients also often think we are ready to go before we really ARE, altho I could do what PT asked,  when I got home I found myself clinging by my nails to a light switch, unable to manage the few feet back to the bed from the bathroom.  Fortunately I had help and a walker handy, otherwise I would have passed out and been on the floor.  Exhausted doesn't begin to cover it.  

Please support teaching these life saving techniques to others, you never know who may need them."
2021-06-04 2:15,"This is an amazing story and one which both inspires and causes great anger. 
Dr Kato and his phenomenal healing colleagues inspire us to delve further into  the expertise needed to heal and literally “fix” broken bodies. Also the importance of listening to patients and the benefits of empathy. 
The anger is directed at the lowest of the low- the former, so called, president and his criminally negligent cohorts who downplayed this virus - knowing full well it was a major tsunami heading right through our country and the world. 
But I’ll take an amazing story of healing like this one any day. So happy for Dr. Kato, his family and many great colleagues to have him back."
2021-06-04 2:26,"Dr Kato’s remarkable recovery is a gift for him, his family, his colleagues, students and the world. His ideas, skills and dedication have changed his field. This would not be possible without the courage, resilience and hard work of amazing nurses who spend endless hours with critically ill patients helping them to make the incremental steps needed for recovery. We should all recognize this very important care that they provide."
2021-06-04 2:27,"One can criticize and attack so many aspects of health care, but for the most part, our physicians and nurses are simply some of the purest humans in existence.

Let us not undermine their work and realize that the real evil rests in the politicians and businessmen that poison their waters and prevent us from reaching our full healing potential."
2021-06-04 2:32,"Everyone who believes that we didn’t need to lock down, distance or wear masks because this disease only affects the frail and elderly should read this article.

2021-06-04 2:36,"Thank you for your beautiful work, Dr. Kato and colleagues. Thank you SO much."
2021-06-04 2:59,"Heart wrenching, and oh, so human.
Not that I wish MDs would always be patients to understand  how it feels to be one, but somehow mds in training ought to be able yo be exposed/taught/experience being a patient. In less dire circumstances as Dr Kato endured, for sure.

That said, I am in awe of Dr Kato's drive, sheer determination, and compassion. Kudos dr."
2021-06-04 3:01,"ER RN here and fellow ventilator survivor. This time last year I ended up on a ventilator after a bowel perforation. The whiplash of role reversal from nurse to patient was the most disorienting experience of my life. I remember seeing the hospital as if it was brand new. Thinking how stiff and uncomfortable the stretcher was in the ER. How cold it was in the room. How loud the employees were outside my room. The bright lights. Mostly, I remember the fear and panic. All things that never registered for me during 12 hour shifts, because I wasn't the one experiencing them. In the days after being extubated, while still in the ICU, my nurse made a careless, cruel comment that I should be doing ""more for myself"" after 2 weeks in the ICU,I should be more independent. Mind you, I hadn't gotten out of bed in 2 weeks and my muscles were totally wasted. That comment broke my heart and made me feel so small. Part of my identity is being a nurse, being strong and active. To have to ask for help using the bathroom humbled me immensely. The whole experience has made me more empathetic to and patient with my patients. Like Dr Kato, it changed my life."
2021-06-04 3:09,Wonderful and gives hope for those recovering or have recovered from the Corona pandemic how to get along in life.  Great article and congratulate Nytimes for publishing it. Many many cheers for Dr. Kato.
2021-06-04 3:11,Thank you so much for writing this highly inspiring story about both Dr. Kato and Covid-19. I am so glad that Dr. Kato survived and that he can now continue to save the lives of many others.
2021-06-04 3:13,"This is a great story and a great victory. It is so wonderful that Dr. Kato survived to continue his important work. 
It was Dr. Robert Bartlett who invented the ECMO machine. It has saved many lives. Dr. Bartlett is still at the University of Michigan, heading up his lab on heart-lung research. 
This country is so fortunate to have great doctors, who dedicate their lives to the health of mankind."
2021-06-04 3:30,"This made me cry. The human ability for heroism - and to continue to push the boundaries of our humanity - is pure beauty sometimes.

2021-06-04 3:42,Stories like this one and reporters like Denise Grady have been keeping me appreciating NYT’s breath and depth of coverage.  Thank you for featuring dr Kate’s career and his life as a patient. Another human story beautifully told.
2021-06-04 3:56,"I came (coming out of?) this disease as a ""long-hauler."" This story provides so much inspiration to keep faith in the positive. I  so appreciate his courage and your publication for sharing it."
2021-06-04 3:58,"Dr. Kato is generativity and blessing personified. Not only does he almost literally ""rise from the dead,"" but returns to his dedicated service as surgeon now even more inspired - having come face to face within his own being with the reality of death - to altruistically teach others to save lives as well. Dr. Kato's stature as doctor and man gives me hope."
2021-06-04 4:17,A phenomenal story. So thankful Dr. Sato and his colleagues fought relentlessly. An inspiration to everyone in a long 18 months.
2021-06-04 4:18,"As with others who went through this ordeal and survived, I am overjoyed that Dr. Kato made it through and has gotten back to doing his wonderful and life changing work.

That said, I honestly don't know how to read this and not think of people who insist that this virus is not serious or that it is a hoax or that it is part of some plot to somehow enslave people."

2021-06-04 2:26,"So very glad Dr. Kato, and his colleagues, survived and  are back to thriving!

Still, this is shocking to hear from a fully-trained and highly-experienced medical doctor:

“I learned that when you cannot talk, it does not mean you are not thinking,” he said. “The mind is so clear.”

Had the good doctor never learned about locked-in syndrome or less serious forms of speech/movement impairments?  

The need for medical education, for students and seasoned professionals alike, to include much more about the vibrant lives of real people with disabilities, including those unable to speak in the conventional manner, is starkly highlighted by Dr. Kato’s  acknowledgement of ignorance prior to his own personal experience of disability (albeit temporary).

It’s high-time — past time! — for medical and other healthcare education programs to require courses in the psychosocial and sociopolitical models of disability to go hand in hand with the science and technical education they receive via the medical model.  Unlearning old, poorly-informed assumptions about disability and the people experiencing them will do much to foster not only a more equitable and productive society for all, but also significantly enhance the accuracy of assessment/diagnosis, the efficacy of treatments, and the attainment of outcomes that not only “cure” but heal"
2021-06-04 4:12,This was a fantastic article. Thank you for publishing it.
2021-06-04 5:53,"Thank you NYT for this excellent article on a brilliant, dedicated genius doctor. I’m so glad and grateful that he recovered even though I may never know him as I live on the west coast. Now, can we name a plaza, a street, a park or an airport in his honor,  as well as  name such venues after great scientists who uplift humanity with their discoveries and inventions? This will be one way to motivate students to enter STEM fields"
2021-06-04 6:19,"This story about Dr. Kato is so inspiring, thank you Dr. Kato for sharing your experience. Your talents with surgery sound so profound and life-saving. I am so proud of you, your recovery, your doctors and nurses, and the continuation of excellent surgery. Thank you Denise Grady for writing this story in such an empathic and understanding way."
2021-06-04 10:39,Dr Kati is a wonderful human being whom I hope they film his operations in order to advance the profession - but lots of other unsung heroes out there also - some without much education or money that may never garner the spotlight but make the world a much better place.
2021-06-04 10:44,Thank you Dr. Kato for allowing your remarkable and inspiring story to be told. Thank you New York Times for telling it.
2021-06-04 10:54,"This is such an understated story at so many levels.

First and foremost, Dr Kato seems to be an exceptional healer and his colleagues - and patients - were all pulling for him. Some may say he has the best care - albeit in the first wave of COVID at which point no one had an inkling how to battle it - not avail to others. But to me, saving him is far more important than to go at length to save them politicians - some of them anyway! Dr Kato saves lives days in and days out. Some politicians saved continue to destroy lives. But enough said!

The inserted photo of a hospital scene in Billings MT demonstrating the ECMO machine may look tangential but it actually tells a complex picture why HCWs are so vulnerable. Even though those on the machine might have passed the first phase of COVID, in which the virus did the most damage, to the second phase, to the second phase, when cytokine storm, the patient's own immune system wrecked havoc, there is no telling if the aerosolized virus filled the room. The HCW with one mask may not be enough not to get it

In conclusion, COVID may kill one patient; but in Dr Kato's case, the ripple effects are significant, mentally to his colleagues and existentially to his potential transplant patients"
2021-06-04 12:08,"I'm grateful to read these types of stories, especially as someone who works in healthcare... we need more uplifting news."
2021-06-04 12:30,No doubt that Dr. Kato is a great doctor who is loved by so many! Thanks NYT for sharing this uplifting story! Excellent read
2021-06-04 12:42,"Like the comments before have stated, Kr. Kato is a remarkable human being who changes the lives of his patients and their families, but to make no mention of the nurses who cared for him throughout his ordeal is really missing an exceptionally important part of the story. Yes, the doctors who cared for him and medical technology allowed him to survive but what about the nurses who cared for him 24/7? I understand that Dr. Kato has a new appreciation for being a patient on the verge of death and can offer this new relatedness to his patients, but to make no mention of an awareness of the care that the nurses provided him, that without he most certainly would have perished, is really leaving something  vital out of the story. Yes, he can now tell his patients which hospital meals are less awful, but I hope he also has a new appreciation of the role of nursing and understands that it is they who work tirelessly to ensure that the patient can one day return to health and resume the lives they once lived."
2021-06-04 13:26,"What a beautiful story and such a wonderful person who has brought life to so many.  Have a long life, Dr. Kato!"
2021-06-04 13:28,"Physicians like Dr. Kato are the heroes in the battle against Covid, because they persist in their mission in spite of risk to themselves. One of the first friends that I lost to Covid was an ophthalmologist.

This is not the first story I have seen about health care workers' sacrifices to fight the pandemic. The facts told by these stories are well known. And yet large numbers of people refuse to be vaccinated.

Don't they realize that even Donald Trump was pro vaccination. at least during Operation Warp Speed?

Lack of knowledge is no excuse. The knowledge is there to be learned."
2021-06-04 13:30,The song unleashed a torrent of tears. What a story. What a survivor.
2021-06-04 13:45,"I was struck in a very personal way with the story of Dr. Kato’s  severe illness, hospitalization and survival from Covid.  Although I did not experience Covid, most aspects of his hospitalization mirror my experience after a heart transplant.  After being admitted to the University of Penn Medical Center in late February of 2020 my condition rapidly deteriorated from heart failure.    In early March I was transplanted, but my new heart would not start for days.  I too was placed on ECMO for several days and a ventilator for weeks.  After what seemed like months of wild illusions and nightmares, I began to come out of the fog.  But like Dr. Kato, I had lost close to fifty pounds, couldn’t speak or scratch my nose, let alone attempt pressing a call button for help.  
I was moved directly from the hospital after a six week admission to an in-patient rehab facility for another eight weeks.  The de-conditioning of the body during these lengthy stretches on a ventilator and ongoing hospitalization is the unseen terror of those who experience it.  The physical and mental recovery continues.  I fear the downstream impact Covid will have on our health care and mental health systems as tens of thousands of Covid patients struggle to recover and find their “normal” lives again."
2021-06-04 13:51,"What a moving story about a beautiful man who has given and will give so much to the world. Dr. Kato, I applaud and am inspired by you, your perseverance, skill, and empathy. May you be well and happy all the rest of your days."
2021-06-04 13:52,"Dr. Kato's story of illness and recovery is incredible, but Dr. Pereira, the nurses and other caregivers deserve the kudos. They were remarkable in their diligent care of him."
2021-06-04 14:01,"Touching story of a great guy,  Dr. Kato: Hard work, and True Values are drives to become a Hero."
2021-06-04 14:16,Thank you for this inspiring story.
2021-06-04 14:17,Dr. Kato’s story is most touching and inspiring on so many levels. He is truly a gift as is the staff who pulled him through.
2021-06-04 14:54,"There was a time that I would have not read this article. Until I was vaccinated, I lived with a great deal of fear that I would get Covid. As someone with a highly suggestible personality and perhaps too much empathy, I would avoid descriptions of people's initial Covid symptoms (especially those beyond the highly publicized cough, shortness of breath, etc.) because I would inevitably start to feel the same symptoms. It is a testament to the power of the vaccines and my faith in them (and God) that I felt confident enough to read this article. While I did go down the rabbit hole a bit with the description of just how ill Dr. Kato was, I mostly feel thankful that he made it through - that we all made it through. Scary stuff - but we made it."
2021-06-04 14:56,"My brother, also a wonderful physician, died a year ago of COVID with nearly identical symptoms and nearly identical treatment. Like Dr Kato, the whole hospital rallied for him, but in this case,to no avail. He was 72 but used to run several miles a day.So in good condition with no negative conditions. I'm glad someone else could make it."
2021-06-04 15:18,"In these difficult times, both due to the pandemic and also the Trump's non-leadership term, Dr. Kato represents the unselfish, ultimate good person that we need in our lives. I wish him the very best and that his recovery is total.

I won't bother you with my wishes for Trump."
2021-06-04 15:57,"Inspirational.  Good  happy ending, kudos to him and the staff that saved him."
2021-06-04 16:31,"I met Tom in 2004, he helped us to initiate a Pediatric Live Donor Liver Transplant in Venezuela that has now helped and saved hundreds of lives, without him it would have been impossible, we later co-founded fundahigadoamerica.org with the mission to help countries in Latin America to start Pediatric Liver transplant in areas where is not available. It has been a unique and wonderful journal together, we have become dear friends over the years. When I learned about his disease last year I feared he would die, all in my family and our team prayed for his recovery and kept close contact with several people from his team at Columbia. We are now so happy he has recovered, and we all feel inspired by the story in this article. Our work will continue. We will be doing liver transplant in Venezuela, Dominican Republic , Guatemala and El Salvador in the upcoming future. We want to thank all the people at Columbia that helped in his recovery. When Tom finally started recovering he shared with me a sentence he knew I would immediately understand, from On Kawara ¨I am still alive¨"
2021-06-04 17:01,"Many thanks, Ms. Grady for this riveting article. I’ve been grieving for the loss of so many health care workers during this cruel pandemic. It’s terrifying.

I’m so thankful for Dr. Kato’s life—his brilliance and innovation—it’s overwhelming to think of how we almost lost someone who’s saved so many lives! Thank you, Dr. Pareira and team, for saving his life."
2021-06-04 17:23,"Incredible story! Thank you for writing this, Ms. Grady. 

And Dr. Kato, congratulations and best wishes to you."
2021-06-04 17:27,"It is clear this skilled and talented man has helped many people, and I am grateful he survived and remains on this earth to continue his remarkable healing.

However, what struck me in reading the story, is the reminder that while our physicians may be knowledgeable about diseases, they are human beings who very likely have not personally experienced the pain, fear and frustration of the very conditions they are treating. Dr. Kato admitted as much.  Physicians often downplay and dismiss the fear and reluctance their patients express about painful or uncomfortable procedures or life alterations.

While of course we should all listen carefully to the advice of the experts, patients (and family members) should also advocate for pain relief during procedures, improved treatment methods, and alternative ways to handle difficult medical problems.  It's our life, our pain, our experience."
2021-06-04 17:48,"As a former OR nurse at the NIH this wonderful piece reconnected me with the pioneering Cancer and Heart surgeons I worked with in the 1960s. But more, the brave patients willing to endure new and often radical surgeries. Those few years changed me and deepened my compassion. In that position the OR nurse was part of the care team. We knew our patients as people before and after their procedures.

With all good wishes to Dr. Kato, and some empathy because of later times as a surgical patient myself."
2021-06-04 12:20,Thank you for such an inspirational article
2021-06-04 12:58,I wish that huge billboards about what he went through could be put up in the red states where there is vaccine resistance. People need to know how terrible Covid can be.
2021-06-04 10:33,What a man! What a story! Wow this story is great - he cannot be the only one to perform these surgeries... his selfless attitude is beautiful
2021-06-04 15:39,"Yes, as a cancer patient, I have often thought that many doctors--even those with the best ""bedside manners"" and with the highest levels of empathy (and such doctors are rare)--can't truly understand the emotional gut-punch of serious illnesses unless they've experienced them personally.

Unfortunately, this is a kind of understanding that cannot be easily taught in medical school, and the ""realistic life experience"" education process is grueling indeed.

There are simply too many doctors, in my experience, who think a good professional demeanor consists of talking with the voice tone of a digital assistant, speaking to the patient as if he/she were an unintelligent child, and minimizing or ignoring patients' pain and suffering.  Unfortunately, doctors are often among those professionals who are technically smart, but emotionally dumb and numb."

2021-06-04 11:42,"NYT and Denise Grady, thank you for telling Dr. Kato’s harrowing, yet so inspiring experience with Covid. We definitely need another Kato Institute specializing in this surgery!

Slightly off topic, but not quite, I would like to see a far-reaching pro-vaccination, PSA-like, campaign featuring former anti-Vaxxers whose lives have been turned around and their opinion changed by their own experience with Covid, or the death of someone they love by Covid. Maybe if we can bring this and the symptoms experienced by longhaulers home, we can change some minds and raise the percentage of vaccinated."
2021-06-04 13:48,I was fully-vaccinated in Feb. 2021. When I hear doubts about vaccination it makes me wonder. Then I read a powerful story like this one. I hope they will study Dr. Kato's physiology and genetics. Why did he get Covid? And how did he ever recover after being on ECMO for a week when the survival rates are in the single digits? There is so much about this disease that we must learn. Thank NY Times for this important story.
2021-06-04 11:07,W.O.W.

2021-06-04 14:17,This is such an amazing story. God definitely has a purpose for you.  I’m glad you are better.  I hate covid too.
2021-06-04 18:36,"Great article, wonderful human being. Thanks for both."
2021-06-04 18:39,"denial is such a strong thing.  my spouse was a physician who died because of denial - shortly before covid.  i'm grateful it was before covid so i could be nearby instead of separated by the covid protocols.  while this doctor's compassion for his patients is increased because of what he's been through, he was a caring provider before.  in working side by side with other physicians for many years, i have found that to be the case in more than 90% of them.  it's great this one survived to continue his life-giving care."
2021-06-04 22:42,"So glad Dr. Kato survived. It’s easy to see what a rock star surgeon and human being he is. Reading this piece reminded me of how many surgical advancements have been made by physicians trying to save the lives of soldiers with horrendous battlefield injuries. So much is learned by the profession from both the successes and the failures of these medical goal line stands.

It takes courage to pick up a scalpel to wage war against death. And it takes courage to be the patient willing to submit to the kind of innovative work that Dr. Kato so bravely does. Even those who are facing imminent death from “inoperable” conditions still do humankind an incalculable favor by being willing to take the risk that these procedures bring. 

I did a quick search of the “marathon procedures” mentioned in this article and read the NYT 2009 report of a 30  hour procedure done by Dr. Kato for Robert Collision. It was a stupendous undertaking and one which Mr. Collision survived, although he died 4 months later. 

So, there are many heroes in this story to whom we owe our thanks."
2021-06-04 23:10,"I know many doctors, personally and professionally, that didn't find their true callings within the professions until after they had become patients as well. The fear of fighting for your health (or life) isn't something you learn in med school."
2021-06-04 23:51,"Thank you to Dr Kato, the professionals who cared for him and saved his life, and the folks at the nyt who recognized the importance of telling his story and who told it so well. Thank you."
2021-06-05 1:39,"What a powerful story about a tenacious and brilliant doctor. His survival will now save many others. 
You are an extraordinary person and surgeon Dr Kato.  I am so glad that your innovative surgeries will continue to save lives through the hands of others who learned your techniques."
2021-06-05 2:13,"Dr. Kato survived due to the diligent care of his medical team including all members who remained dedicated despite their fears and anxieties in the face of potentially contracting COVID themselves. The theme that comes across here is to pay it forward in teaching and caring for other medical staff as they are coming up. While the unique surgical skills that Dr. Kato is so uniquely trained in desperately needs to be passed on to others in training, let’s not loose sight for one minute of how, equal to that, compassion and empathy for other humans going through health crises, likely the most vulnerable time in their lives, has to be passed on to the next generation of nurses and doctors alike."
2021-06-05 3:29,"Dr. Kato had the power of Columbia University behind him and the passion of his colleagues with him each day he was in the ICU.  I wish every patient had the same level of care! 
I'm glad Dr. Kato pulled through.  That is good for him and very good for us!"
2021-06-05 3:38,thank you for an inspiring and wonderful article. this amazing doctor clearly had much to give to humanity and was saved for a greater purpose. God bless you and keep you safe Dr. Kato so you may continue your work.
2021-06-05 11:17,I’m so happy Dr. Kato recovered. Please do a follow up on him to tell us if he has any long lasting changes from his experience. My OBGYN in Philadelphia went through a similar experience but is no longer practicing. I’m hoping he too will have a Cinderella ending.
2021-06-05 13:48,"A  terrific story about an exceptional doctor.  However, it left out a key element:  what did the patient get to cure the disease so quickly?  Was he given IL-6? Regeneron? Remdesevir? Some other experimental drug?  Did Denise Grady ask or did the doctor prefer not to have these aspects of his care made public?

I am particularly curious since my husband, twenty years older than Dr T, was not given any of those drugs because of his age.  He spent five months on the ventilator and a total of six months in hospital.
Fortunately, he received excellent medical care and survived."
2021-06-05 16:27,"Fantastic portrait of heroes!  Bravo to all of the doctors mentioned and to the ICU nurses, the various therapists, and other health care and hospital workers who kept both Dr. Kato and the hospital going!

A shocking point however: that a surgeon, and especially one working with people so close to the cusp of death that they need an organ transplant, had never before contemplated death and dying.  Furthermore, that he appears, from his comments, not to know that  because one isn’t physically able to speak doesn’t mean one isn’t able to hear and think and understand and likely want to communicate.  For one thing, has the good doctor not heard of Professor Stephen Hawking or of Helen Keller? Kato’s experience and comments, like those of other doctors-come-patients, present powerful evidence that medical school and residency programs must do more to teach healthcare trainees about the actual lived experiences of people with disabilities generally, and of the specific patient population they intend to serve, and not just from the medical model of disability.  Borrowing from the curricula of contemporary Disability Studies, Social Work, and Occupational Therapy would be a good start."
2021-06-05 22:00,"So fantastic to hear about such a turn-around! There are two things I wish this story had included though. First, occupational therapy was obviously a necessary part of the recovery process - why not include OT, especially given its holistic nature which includes cognition and social-emotional/spiritual health as well? Additionally, it’s important to note that while physical fitness likely contributed to this individual’s positive outcome, a full recovery isn’t guaranteed to those who without - so it’s essential for everyone who is eligible (even athletes) to be fully vaccinated."
2021-06-06 0:18,"Dr Kato is the ultimate Unicorn, goodness and intelligent competency in the same human. It is exceptionally rare in American culture that either, let alone both, are recognized as well as actively supported by colleagues and mentors in surgical medicine and organ transplantation. 

Our children need to be taught in pre-school to view Dr Kato’s heroism as the highest possible glory and goal. This teaching may more directly steer children toward the rewards earned with decisions made through empathy, compassion, intelligence and knowledge. All of these virtues are in heated competition with the brain eating trash developed by marketers. The internet compounds this to the 100th power. Go US!

The story of Dr, K’s COVID experience is harrowing to read. It must have been literally a nightmare. There is no mention of his family but their hearts must have broken a million times before they exhaled when he awoke clear minded.

Thank you, Denise, for this article. It is more than a sentimental recounting of a COVID patient. Your writing and perspective broadened the subject exponentially."
2021-06-05 4:29,"Think Globally, Act Locally: After reading about Dr. Kato, I called my daughter, who has been on the front lines in a hospital and told her ‘you are my daughter fo’sures (HawaiiNei), but mostly you are my hero’. Banging pots is good, but we really need to Aloha these front line heroes."
2021-06-05 7:26,"It's too bad the anti-vaxxers can't read more stories like this.  This doctor is lucky to be alive.  

Both the Pfizer, and Moderna vaccines are now available free of charge to prevent such catastrophic experiences such as this. 

Since the vaccine has been used the infection, hospitalizations and death rates from Covid have now started to drop like a brick. 

I'm glad this surgeon survived.  But, he went through hell and high water to do so.  

The New York Times wrote a great article about this great surgeon and his grit and his survival.  They need to publish more of these stories so people can see what they are up against if they don't their shots."
2021-06-05 18:21,"Wow! It is disappointing realize the facts of anti-VAX or‘s and those that don’t believe Covid is real and then they get it or a family member gets it and nearly dies.

Now being an idiot can actually kill you."
2021-06-10 11:43,"The charts ""Share of Covid-19 deaths by race and age"" have a maximum scales of 50%, which seems to be incorrect. This implies the 50% of the population is something other than White, Hispanic, Black, or Asian."
2021-06-10 11:49,"Re: ""... it’s the remaining unvaccinated population that is driving the lingering deaths ...""

This reconfirms for the umpteenth time the following ancient cliche:

2021-06-10 11:55,"Interesting analysis, but it is missing the data on vaccination by age group.  That is available here:
<a href=""https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states"" target=""_blank"">https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states</a>/ 
This confirms that the reason that deaths are going down in older people is because they are getting vaccinated.  
Vaccines work, and everyone should get them!"
2021-06-10 11:59,"I really wish this paper were more careful in how scientific data are displayed. I am a scientist, but it took me a while to completely interpret the data shown.  For example, in the COVID Deaths by Race figure, it is not clearly stated that the percentages are for the total sum of all subgroups in the two panels (I assume). This is an unusual way to show such data. The lack of a labeled y axis contributes to the confusion.

Also, I know there is a message to push, but I sincerely doubt the “increase” in Black deaths is any more meaningful than the “decrease” in Asian deaths. I expect any descriptive statistics that accompanied the original data would have shown this. These data largely show that the deaths have primarily shifted from 75+ to <75  in Whites. The rest is over interpretation of data."
2021-06-10 12:02,"We will continue to have deaths because of international travel. It spread the virus at the beginning and is behind the continued spread of  variants. Hair salons and gyms are shut down  with  strict enforcement.  Yet certain connected  groups , including the rich, can find  the right people to bribe or loopholes to do whatever they want. Including spreading variants around the world. 

Thailand is reeling  from the virus because of graft and the ""Delta"" variant is spreading around the world because of continued international  flights and open borders. Even in NJ there are people from India getting visa  exemptions to fly into the United States due to political connections and yet the Star Ledger  then writes articles lamenting how the scary variant got into NJ. 

Idiots not getting vaccinated are a major problem but the lack of transparency , equal treatment, clear policies  and honesty from politicians from both administrations has led to mistrust and disarray. Money talks and the powers that be feel some  of us can just drop dead or get long term illnesses to keep it talking."
2021-06-10 12:06,"The vaccines are miracles that have saved countless lives. Sadly the misinformation has scared many deluded people to avoid the life saving help that is available. So foolish and tragic.

  - all federal/state/local employees including K12 teachers and students (when vax is approved)
   - all federal contractors and orgs that receive federal aid - e.g. higher ed, military, public sector contractors

2021-06-10 12:10,"So now we are at the point where we can see clearly that those who refuse to get vaccinated are perpetuating the public health crisis. 

You can't drive drunk or without a license, because you might kill someone. You can't send your children to school unless they are vaccinated, because they pose a risk to others. 

Getting vaccinated for COVID has nothing to do with a curb on your freedom: it's about freeing you, and everyone else too, to return to social life. 

Republicans are not only responsible for the Big Lie; they are also responsible for encouraging crazy stories about the vaccine that lead to hesitancy. 

This is a public health issue, not a matter of personal freedom."

We've got the vaccine - let's take it right to the people who need it so at least they are faced with the reality of making a choice to get vaccinated or not!"
2021-06-10 12:31,"The crime is its own punishment for those who refuse vaccination. Prejudice, ignorance, and stupidity are the only reasons not to get vaccinated today, and people with these traits deserve no compassion as far as I am concerned. Access is universal; vaccines cost nothing; and even people with underlying conditions suffer no adverse consequences. And even if they do, would you rather die gasping for air? I hope businesses will require proof of vaccination, so the rest of us can go about our daily life, while the anti-vaxxers get sick. I don’t care."

2021-06-10 12:32,"I really wish these demographic analyses could somehow figure out how to include socio-economic class as a factor.

We get age groups. We get ""race."" 

Age groups, yes: there are direct, causal links that lead older people to Covid sickness and death. 

But from everything I've heard, nothing genetic or otherwise inherent predisposes certain ""racial"" groups to Covid sickness and death, only indirect correlations caused by racism (without any attempt to understand, say, how affluent Black or Latino/a people are doing compared to working-class members of these groups). 

Racism's effect should be tracked and studied: it is without doubt a factor.

But isn't class at least as direct? Since working-class people of all ""races"" have poorer access to health care, often live in more crowded, less healthy spaces, and have had to be on the front lines—to feed their families, pay rent, deliver goods to the rest of us—don't we want to know how they're being affected as a group?

What is the problem? Why is class always left out? It almost seems like a conspiracy of the affluent, served by this newspaper, to avert their eyes."

This problem doesn’t just impact vaccine-resistant people; covid cases negatively impact health care resources needed for other types of patients and burden the ICU."
2021-06-10 13:07,Perhaps those that choose to remain unvaccinated (for no medical reasons) should have NO insurance or any costs covered IF they present themselves to be treated for Covid. When faced with high medical bills versus a free vaccine they may choose the later.
2021-06-10 13:09,"Other than the death rates by states, this is hardly news.  We knew the most vulnerable populations were older Americans, and particularly those in nursing homes who were indoors in close proximity.  We prioritized vaccination by age.

Close ranks America we're almost at the goal line!"
2021-06-10 12:53,"Now that we have adequate supplies of vaccine and the infrastructure and personnel to administer it the only reason for increasing deaths in the younger age groups is intentional failure of those getting ill to take the vaccine.

For otherwise healthy citizens who have refused vaccination they must pay a price.  Some with their lives, some with their health but all should be responsible for the first $100,000 of medical costs involved in their care, should they need care.

Throughout it all, it has been comforting to know that my family members, from us older folks to adult children , teenagers, and the younger grandchildren , have all been on the same page with regard to Covid precautions and vaccinations. We have been fortunate in that my adult children were able to work from home, and have their children  learn remotely.

That’s the root cause of all problems including health. Eating canned food regularly is another major health problem that causes havoc.

Body immunity is another major factor that decides, who succumbs easily. As a person ages, he or she is bound to have less body immunity. Add this factor to junk food, cigarettes, alcoholic drinks and other common diseases like diabetes and high B.P, then it becomes easy to make it a deadly combination. The more mess it will be if one has had heart attack etc.

Another important factor one needs to consider is mental strength. Fear kills a person instantly.

Now comes vaccination. Vaccination definitely reduces the impact if a vaccinated person gets affected by COVID 19 since it won’t be that severe and the chances of survival are fairly high.

All these experts are supposed to take these factors into consideration before arriving at any conclusion. Sadly they don’t."
2021-06-10 13:32,"The trends for age groups 74 and younger are obscured by the large drop in deaths of age 75 and older.

In other words, the graphs may show upward trends in share of deaths in age groups 74 and younger, but the number of deaths within each age group is probably trending downward significantly given how much the total number of death has dropped.

It would be much more meaningful to contrast trends in vaccinated vs. un-vaccinated populations."
2021-06-10 13:32,"Objectively speaking, if one has been following The New York Times, relentless, and take no prisoners coverage of the pandemic, the one group that has been affected most by the malady is Overweight People! That is essentially across the age divide, with the only caveat being a spike with the elderly, and those with ongoing health issues! By the way, who could deny that The New York Times isn't worthy of a Pulitzer, for its reporting?!"
2021-06-10 13:31,"There is a very large portion of America that still gets lots of it's information from pseudoscience sources. People who aren't at all political but for whatever reason are into alternative medicines, foods, cures, whatever. Both the educated and less so. If only our media would speak with one voice on important issues instead of opting for the sensational that guarantees a minimum number of clicks from those who react to outrage or anger."
2021-06-10 13:32,Some people who are fully vaccinated can get COVID and die if they have compromised immune systems.
2021-06-10 13:27,And here I thought the group in question was somehow tied to the anti-vax crowd currently awaiting the second coming of King Cyrus and holding up any expectations of herd immunity from being successful?

2021-06-10 13:36,"My second comment. Would anyone bitten by a bat or other mammal suspected of carrying rabies decline vaccination? Only if they are very stupid. OK -  I know that Covid-19 does not have the the same probability of death that rabies does but it is vastly more contagious and can have have serious long lasting consequences for some people. So, please, get vaccinated; you will feel a lot more comfortable about being out and about afterwards. As an aside, I was bat bitten a few years ago and had the five shot vaccination routine for post exposure to rabies and it was simply not a big deal. I would also like to close by thanking all who were involved last year in fast tracking the development and approval of the vaccines; your work is keeping a lot of people healthy and safe."
2021-06-10 13:37,"COVID is essentially over for those vaccinated. The pharmaceutical companies deserve a lot of credit for quickly developing effective, safe vaccines. The Biden administration and the State governments have done a very good job of administration. Herd immunity would be good, but anyone who gets COVID now is dumb and will stew in their made up nonsense no matter what anyone does. The unvaccinated need to be banned from employment where they routinely interact in any way with people."
2021-06-10 13:48,"If you look at rates of daily deaths vs. 100K cohorts, state-by-state, some of the poorer performing states are predictable, others not so much.

According to data on Worldometers, the deaths per 100k population has high numbers for WV, ID and AL. I guess if we accept the premise that these states have lower rates of vaccination uptake, being ""re"" that makes sense - sadly. But, the rates of deaths per 100K are also relatively high in bluer (or newly blue) states like OR, NJ, CO, PA, GA and IL.

Perhaps that reflects hold-outs in rural, redder parts of each of those states. The heat map seems to support that explanation. But, perhaps something else is also going on."

2021-06-10 13:40,"It is very misleading to use % distribution of the death/infection/hospitalization when the total infections and death rate has fallen so drastically. 

3500 people died per day at the peak. 350 people die a day now. The distribution across races and ages should change dramatically when the death rate is an order of magnitude different. 

Use statistics like death/100,000 or death/1,000,000 in each demographic and plot it from the peak to now and see if there is a trend. 

Death due to covid is a conditional event. Sampling the  population that met the condition for percentage distribution could be very misleading."
2021-06-10 14:00,"Too bad the data never includes co-morbidity - obesity, T2 diabetes, heart disease, pulmonary issues, smokers, cancer survivors, etc.

I would take an educated guess that Covid patients under 65 with no co-morbidity have a death rate that approaches zero, irrespective of race."
2021-06-10 14:19,"Additional analysis is needed on why death rates are dropping or not dropping, sorted by category such as race, geography, urban vs rural, education, political party affiliation, and other categories. This will inform policy makers on where to focus future efforts to reduce these numbers."

2021-06-10 14:02,"90 per cent drop in death rates. 2,500 weekly deaths which is actually very low compared to India, where the daily death rates itself is around the same. More than half of US population has received at least one dose. Many say life in the US back to pre-covid days.

 ALL these sounds good. But, the government should not stop its fight against covid giving all these data and statistics. Till the last US citizen gets the jab, till the death rate becomes nil, they should continue to take care of those who were affected by the virus.

 Once after winning over the virus, the rehabilitation process for those surviving members who have lost their breadwinners, children who have lost all family members should begun."
2021-06-10 14:00,"It is puzzling to me how we have gotten to so few deaths in my area of the country (Long Island, NY) when the vaccination rate is generally around 50%. Even when adding those who we know were infected, and recovered, there is still a sizable group who is not getting infected. Why? Perhaps not everyone is equally susceptible to being infected. Perhaps many of those who have not been vaccinated are just not going to be infected anyway. Other explanations welcome."
2021-06-10 14:39,The share of totals deaths graphics are kind of misleading. It would be more appropriate to use deaths per 100k so people can use a benchmark to compare between groups. The share of younger groups is obviously increasing because the vaccination rate is the highest for elderly people (which is preventing many deaths). If the death rate is declining more slowly for other groups this will make the proportion increase even though the per capita rate is decreasing. I would put the % change in Covid-19 deaths chart earlier in the article to reduce the chance that people misinterpret this information.
2021-06-10 14:48,"Looking at the counties, I think we know exactly who is dying from this still and why."

Because, like a poor driver or crummy credit risk, those who refuse to get vaccinated should have to pay more for health/life coverage -- assuming they can get it at all. (There should be exceptions, or at least better attempts to get the virus to those who want it but have trouble accessing it.)"
2021-06-10 14:55,It would be more interesting to see COVID deaths by political party.
2021-06-10 15:05,"Frankly, I look at the daily reported numbers in the NYT with somewhat of a ""Spockian"" eyebrow if only for the reason, although we have seen cases and deaths listed, for several months now, we have not seen any total testing numbers listed.   Add to that, with many red states whom only have a minority that have been vaccinated(and it will probably remain that way), how much testing and reporting are they actually conducting and is it at all accurate?

The Indian and very contagious variant has now moved into N/A  in which the makers report their vaccines are slightly less effective, it looks like in those states where the majority choose to not get the vaccine,  at least for some areas anyway, if this variant happens to take hold, we still could not be out of the woods yet."

2021-06-10 15:21,"It's not enough to give percentages. We need absolute numbers to get a more complete picture.

That dramatic graph of increasing percentages of deaths in the 50-74 age group with decreasing percentages of deaths in the 75+ age group begs the question: are the absolute numbers changing or is it that the decrease in deaths among the 75+ ages only means the first place goes to some other age group. You would think the author would have asked this question before taking to writing.

But this blind spot happens repeatedly when reporters write about ""disproportionate"" measurements on Black vs White statistics. Blacks almost always have higher percentages of adversities as deaths from Covid or poverty levels. But numbericaly, it's Whites who outnumber Blacks in Covid deaths and poverty simply because Whites are still in the majority. Would it give comfort for Blacks and Whites to be equal in percentages of Covid deaths or poverty if both groups are equally in poverty and still die in large numbers."

2021-06-10 15:32,"‘ it’s the remaining unvaccinated population that is driving the lingering deaths…’

Pretty much everyone now being  hospitalized or dying from Covid falls in this group. And remember, while death is final, more will survive than die, but many will have permanent disabilities or prolonged recovery after discharge. It also costs at least 5-10 thousand dollars a day for ICU care, and whether you’re insured or not, someone is still paying a lot of money for what is now a preventable disease."
2021-06-10 15:33,"I recently saw a U.K statistic about the total number of Covid deaths of vaccinated versus unvaccinated people. Everyone wants to know whether vaccines in fact make a significant difference in actual deaths. When  the unvaccinated see that the great majority of deaths are among the unvaccinated population, they might change their minds."

2021-06-10 16:00,"An excellent review, and good solid data presentation, thank you.

My takeaways are:

1. Generally, covid deaths are way down. Given the hasty reopenings, the only good explanation is some combo of good vaccines and some cohort of “natural immunity,” people.

2. That the vaccines are working seems especially clear because deaths are way down in the most-vaccinated, most at risk pop.

3. In other pops, deaths are rising. It figures 50-74 would get hit worst, since they’re likeliest to be both unprotected and unvaccinated.

4. The maps say other death-pockets are among the unvaccinated.

Gee whiz, get your shots."
2021-06-10 16:23,"I would have like to have seen spelled out clearly the percentage of deaths of those unvaccinated vs those that have been vaccinated, independent of all other factors. The article hints at a relation between various populations getting vaccinated and the drop in deaths in those populations but that's as far as it goes. 
The hospital in my town has been reporting for weeks that the only people in the hospital due to COVID-19 have been unvaccinated. 
Surely the data on vaccine status of those who have died is being collected. I'd love to see it reported in news!"
2021-06-10 16:32,"Rather than percentages, it would be helpful to see rates--how does the rate of deaths compare across different groups. Rates do not depend on each other and can be more easily compared. That is, as the share of total deaths among older people decline with vaccinations, the share of total deaths will automatically go up in the other age groups. But that doesn't mean that there was an absolute change."
2021-06-10 16:23,"For the past several weeks, nearly every death from Covid has been a preventable death.  And if a person could trace the ""chain of custody"" of the virus that killed these people, they would see that healthy persons at low risk of death helped spread the virus to those who died.  That is why a public health perspective and collective action is needed.  That is why the ""rugged individualist"" society we live in is going to fuel many future deaths. Unnecessary deaths, fueled in large part by people who cannot see beyond their own narrow perspectives."
2021-06-10 16:25,"Why do you present these data as shares of total deaths?  As total deaths fall and as the elderly become largely vaccinated, younger folks will comprise a larger percentage of this share just due to the math. It tells us nothing."

2021-06-10 17:26,"Amazing that they don't break this out by gender. Men are 1.5X as likely to die of COVID as women.

I haven't seen a single public health campaign message aimed at saving men's lives. I guess gender disparities only matter when it's women who suffer, right?"
2021-06-10 17:01,Isn't this Darwinian? If you are intelligent you get a vaccine. If you believe conspiracy theories you don't and are more likely to be killed by Covid. I feel very sorry for the people who have no choice... minors who need parent consent or people who have disorders that prevent them from getting the vaccine. Every person who doesn't get a vaccine is endangering the lives of others.
2021-06-10 17:11,I can’t imagine what our situation would be if “the other guy” and his circus if clowns was re-elected.  But in the current situation there probably is little that can prevent the new infections and deaths.  I read a separate survey yesterday that the the majority of remaining unvaccinated people seem steadfast in their rejection. Nature has a time-tested way of strengthening species … or eliminating them.

Let the states that don't follow the best science drop their guard and go back to life as they remember with a low vaccination rate. Let's watch the death rate and case load and see which response works best for its citizens. We all get the government we deserve.  But, we might want to quarantine those who chose wrong and ignore the science. I don't want them to visit my state and spread the risks."
2021-06-10 18:14,"I find it interesting that Asians under 30, as a group suffered  weekly Covid deaths in the single digits even at the height of the pandemic.  Why is this?  Is it because Asian people tend to eat better diets, have low body mass indexes and probably exercise on a regular basis.  At the height of the pandemic they weren't vaccinated.  When will the statistic regarding the correlation between unhealthy life styles and adverse outcomes be provided to the public.  Is this number hidden purposely?  Is it because if you live a healthy life style and know predominately the unhealthy suffer serious consequences that you might decide not to be vaccinated."

2021-06-10 19:18,"Well, what we will soon see is something Darwin called natural selection.

Honestly, my compassion for such people has run dry.  I do feel terribly sorry for their kids though, who shouldn't have to be victims of their parents' stupidity.

Many of my high school students are vaccinated; one who wasn't asked me why I was not worried about the vaccine.  I replied:  ""You were all vaccinated as children.  Otherwise, some of you would struggle to walk because of polio.  Some of you would contract tuberculosis and die an excruciating death.  Some of you would be blind due to exposure as babies to measles.  When you have strep throat, or an ear infection or break your wrist playing a sport, you don't ask some guy on the internet for help.  You go to a doctor or a hospital.  There they stitch you up and give you medicine.  If you have a parent who is diabetic, they take insulin.  If a parent needs a heart operation, or their appendix out, you trust medicine and doctors.  But now you don't?  Come on--you are better than that.""  He nodded and and said, ""You're right Ms. L. Now I get it.""  The internet--a great tool--both for knowledge and for misinformation.

You see the rising numbers in Britain and it is clear that the delta variant is causing problems even when the percentage of vaccinated people is better than ours. Over the longer run, as long as the world remains largely unvaccinated, some deadly mutation, far more dangerous than the delta, will emerge for which the current vaccines will not be efficacious.  There is dire need for ramping up world wide vaccination fast as otherwise all of us are in trouble in a multi-year nightmare."

Why everyone wouldn't want that, why they'd deny themselves that comfort and happiness is beyond me. If they are willing to risk  their health, yay their lives, to make a political point or to follow a charlatan, it's lunacy of a kind for which I fear there is no hope.

Lottery tickets, beer, food and various other incentives have been offered to  all to just get vaccinated.  You can't help those who don't wish to be helped.  The risk is that they keep us from truly ridding the U.S. of this crippling pandemic that has taken over 600,000 lives and ground our economy to a halt.  Hard to understand."

That's what SCIENCE is say is going to happen.
I don't think we're going to be done with this no matter how much you want to blame the unvaccinated. We're going to get to get a LOT more covid and need a lot more vaccines - possibly one ever 3 months or more. And, wear masks."

As a senior physician I am stunned. If true, then the COVID experience is the best thing that could have happened to them. I jumped from medical school to the neonatal intensive care unit...in the era of AIDS. I had 2 weeks to get married and move to start residency. No celebration beyond graduation and no months of ""emotional preparation"" beyond intensive clinical rotations; it was nobody's idea of a vacation. I do not know where these statements come from. But if true, then these young physicians should be on track to be among the best, having gained experiences and perspective beyond the apparent new standard ""vacation"" approach of preparing for advanced medical careers. But boy do I hope the statement is just poor reporting and hyperbole.

We have come a long way as the city is now heading back to normal thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of everyone. These doctors first worked to save as many lives as possible under impossible conditions then worked to convince us to ware a mask and stay apart and now to get us all vaccinated. They will always remember this past year as will I as I put them on my list of people that put the good of all ahead of their own. The best way to thank them is to get vaccinated.
2021-06-04 11:01,"I work at Montefiore and all of us were and remain so in awe of the selflessness of these young heroes. Grateful isn’t a sufficient a word to express how we all feel about the service these young doctors provided. Their exceptional resilience is evident and it’s such a good thing for society we have these folks who seem to willingly slide back into a more more normal-ish role as first year doctor, but now are armed with knowledge and compassion. That cannot be stressed enough. But second, their contribution as VOLUNTEERS should never fade off into the sunset. While reading this article I kept thinking with all the billionaires out there, couldn’t they step up and establish some fund to pay off the 6 figure loans these students many most likely carry?  Particularly there is a movement afoot for medical schools to waive its students tuition.  So tuition free medical school is not an unheard of concept. We owe these heroes. I saw it first hand."
2021-06-04 11:08,My daughter graduated from nursing school in 2019 and began working in late fall. For the first few months one of the older nurses would regale her and the other “baby nurses” ( meaning new...not that they were in the neo-natal unit)  with stories about working during the height of the AIDS crisis. They’d sometime secretly roll their eyes when she started another “ you can’t imagine how hard and scary  it was” tale. Several months later my daughter and her friends could indeed imagine and they realize that someday they’d be telling the new crop of  “babies” that they didn’t know how good they had it not to begin their jobs during a pandemic.
2021-06-04 11:14,"I agree with another commenter - this is what doctors do. As a just-graduated physician back in the mid-1980s we were thrown into the HIV epidemic knowing essentially nothing about the disease. Young men were coming in, deathly ill, with nothing to point to the etiology of this scourge. We, with no idea about where this disease came from, gowned, gloved, masked, goggled, bootied and took care of them. 

What these new physicians did during the COVID-19 emergency is not exceptional. It's the norm. It's what we expect to do. And what we train to do."

2021-06-04 11:36,"There are quite a few comments about how these experiences mirror those of physicians from the early days of the AIDS epidemic.

2021-06-04 12:27,"I see that I’m not the only one that this reminds me of the AIDS days. That was as nightmarish as this must have been. Young people, sometimes coworkers, on ventilators struggling to breath were our patients and parents trying to figure out what had happened. At least I was an experienced ICU nurse and comfortable with my skill but these young people will go home wondering if they did everything correctly and maybe have dreams about it all their lives. Is it right to put them in that position?"
2021-06-04 12:31,"A story that needs telling, even if its central theme of resilience comes perilously close to sugarcoating the mental health toll of frontline medical care during the pandemic. I’m also not too fond of the “heroic doctor” theme, versus the much more important reality of medical TEAMS. In fact, physicians are the frontline medical professionals who spend the LEAST amount of time with a patient. Let’s see a follow up story on medical technicians, FNPs, RNs."
2021-06-04 12:35,"Resplendent and glorious writing. Wow. Thank you to the brave young students who stepped onto the precarious COVID ledge and to the deft storyteller who captured their journey.

2021-06-04 12:36,"Perhaps she is more accurate in her book but in this essay Ms. Goldberg shows an amazing lack of knowledge about medical history.

She tells us that they were expected to sign up for battle but were unlike soldiers who enlist and expect to do battle.

I've got news for her.  Into the 1970s there was a doctors draft which, with rare exception for a severe health problem, forced all physicians except for the lucky few who got positions at NIH into the military.

And during World War II, medical schools shortened the time spent in school by eliminating summer vacations and having students go year round.  The only choice students were given was whether they wanted to be in the army or the navy.  One of my uncles was one of these students.

And if treating Covid patients put their lives at risk, imagine the risk doctors faced in war time.  Those serving in the south Pacific during WWII not only faced a wide range of tropical diseases but also risked getting killed by the enemy.  And even in the Vietnam War there were a few doctors who were killed.

Students today also don't face jail time if they are required to do something that goes against their medical ethics unlike Dr. Howard Levy who during the Vietnam War went to jail because he felt it unethical to train Green Berets.

Finally, the idea that doctors today are more compassionate and closer to their patients than those of previous generations is ludicrous."
2021-06-04 12:42,"Brings back memories of my internship then residency in surgery at St Vincent’s in Greenwich Village, 1980-85. Working on mysteries without any clues or cures as patients were ravaged by pneumocystis pneumonia, Kaposi’s sarcoma, cryptosporidium enteritis and cytomegalovirus retinitis and other opportunistic infections and collapse of their immune system. Agree with the Hoosier comment who emphasizes team. Without a doubt, nurses who spend the most time are heroes along everyone on the team but it is not a contest."

Internship ( the year after graduation, with or without electives in the final 4th year of med school) is a supervised education + service role. It can be grueling- often in public hospitals that are understaffed, underfunded and serving the most sick. 
Volunteering to work in the front lines of the pandemic - these young doctors deserve recognition for valor, volunteering early on. But internship is often an experience of immense sacrifice."

2021-06-04 13:19,"I loved reading this. Daunting. These doctors are people who care, want to alleviate suffering and connect with their patients while they tend to them in the midst of a pandemic fraught with anxiety, and protocols which limit the opportunities for accomplishing those very  things.  They are truly healers and compassionate providers of care and comfort. They showed up when they were needed and did the best they could, with the training they had just finished. It was, for some, a trial by fire: physically, emotionally and spiritually. I will never will never forget their bravery and courage."
2021-06-04 13:23,"I sincerely hope that the NYT follows this up with a detailed account and recognition for the nurses ... many who were under appreciated prior to Covid.

Let’s “bang the pots” for them too."
2021-06-04 13:38,"I must echo the sentiments of some of the other physicians commenting on here. 
I feel for the graduates in what they went through, because the sheer volume of the pandemic cases at their peak compressed their experiences into a tsunami of heartache. Medical school does little to educate you on the difference between being a student and being responsible. 
But the author’s apparent beliefs of what it was like to be a doctor in the “before times” is ridiculously inaccurate.  And sad, and a bit offensive, that this is how my decades of caring for patients might have been viewed. 
And, yes, I also agree the MANY other health professionals experienced this pandemic worse than doctors did. 
In all, a wonderful portrayal of these particular individuals, but kind of a slap in the face to everyone else."
2021-06-04 13:45,"As I read the words so delicately written, I was drawn into the rooms of each patient. Walking through each moment of contemplation and realization of how helpless one feels when searching for an answer, a reason, something to hold onto...

I appreciated the reflection back to earlier days of doctor patient relationships. (we can not help but to be relieved to have the advancement of choice). The explanation and research given sufficed to say, how change lead to trust, and then the pandemic extinguished the opportunity to build that trust. How empty the feeling for those caring for others. When their desire was to comfort and heal, and swiftly they were lead to the only source of emotion, looking into ones eyes compassionately as to say, I'm sorry, I'm here, you will not be forgotten. 

Thank you for taking your reader inside, to understand the complexity that faced so many who made a sound choice to care. 

I am one, who took note."
2021-06-04 13:48,"a sincere thank you to all these young doctors who volunteered to take on one of the most difficult jobs of their career. i hope this experience doesn't diminish the altruism and humanity that got them into medicine in the first place. too much of medicine toady has become too cold, clinical and impersonal, a race to meet the bottom line expectations of the large corporations they work for. i have 6 ""profit centers"" in the waiting room and i'm already 30 min late. feel better."

Further, the absence of exercise and the diminished respiratory excursion consequent on bed rest prevent the re-expansion of collapsed or diseased lung."""
2021-06-04 13:53,"I graduated in 1964 from a not so good medical school where we were put in positions of patient care where we had to learn on the job without adequate supervision.
  After medical school I trained as a resident and fellow at a large upper midwest university hospital that drew patients form other states and Canada.
Almost all of the children with malignancies, severe congenital heart disease, kidney failure etc died.
I did a rotation as a pediatric pathologist and did enough autopsies in three months to be board qualified in anatomoic pathology.
In my first month as a staff person in a large urban children's hospital I was thrust into doing peritoneal dialysis on children with Reye Syndrome. 
The mortality rate was 50% no matter what we did or did not do.
But, and it is a very big but, no matter how stressful any of those experiences were I was never at risk of becoming ill or dying or putting my family at risk from what the patients had.
Over three thousand healthcare workers died, many more become very sick from caring for patients with the Covid 19 virus and the rest were marked for life by their experiences.
I was never so proud of being a physician as I was during the last terrible year.
I would suggest to President Biden that his 4th of July event celebrating our freedom from masks and isolation should pay tribute to the health care workers who died in the line of duty and to all of them who put their lives at risk caring for the patients with the virus."

When you consider the overwhelming scholastic and financial pressures to achieve the goal, it’s even more remarkable.

I have to add, though, that I was a cardiac patient at Montefiore Hospital in 2019. I’ve had several heart surgeries over the years, but the care at Montefiore was the worst I’ve ever experienced.

The doctors were wonderful. The nurses tried their best, although they were obviously way understaffed. The maintenance and other services were like being in the third world.

I used to volunteer at Montefiore when I was in high school. I thought the memories would make me feel more comfortable. By the end of my stay, I was grateful to get out alive."
2021-06-04 14:11,"The human interest angle in this article obscures the fact that the main function of a doctor is to deliver care. In Spring of 2020 NYU Langone, like any hospital in the City, had to deal with a huge influx of critical patients affected by a novel respiratory disease. Every MD, from the freshly graduated to the veterans, were exactly in the same position - 0(zero) experience of treating Covid-19 which quickly progressed from respiratory infection to multiple organ failure, or a morass of other problems. The standard of care has to be developed as patients were coming in. And in this situation both experienced doctors with somewhat rusty knowledge base AND recent graduates exposed to more state-of-the-art information but lacking in practice complement each other. Data from NYU Langone shows a dramatic drop in risk-adjusted mortality from 25.6% in March to 7.6% in August. The bulk of improvement came not from miracle cures (there isn't any), but from many improvements in clinical care. As for being thrown into the fray, it's unfortunate, but response to health catastrophe is   what separates doctors from people treating ingrown nails. My respect to those who rose to the challenge.

As a retired hospitalist, I applaud their efforts, and hope that the experience ultimately shows them the importance of doctor patient relationships.

The ICU nurses knew of my incompetence but agreed that our overnight plan was to do whatever it took to keep the patient alive until the family was able to come from another state. I have never forgotten this patient. This was in the midst of the AIDS pandemic but I never felt particularly at risk unless I was doing a procedure.

 Anyone with an ounce of common sense and who knows that life ends in death, lnows that MDs are going to face death with frequency.  Well people do not land in hospitals  except on rare occasions  -- birth, joint replacements, plastic surgery.  

I met the new MD when a critically ill frend was in the ICU with Legionnaires and a low red blood cell count. She recovered finally after  a coma. 

Given the nature of the disease and whom the virus strikes the world was lucky that this was not the 1918  flu that mostly affected young uns.  

But talking about moments,  this would have been the moment to train thousands of young people as PNs to handle patient care-- Nurses do the comforting and the bed pan changing and the catheterizing, IVs etc. 

I expect competency from my MDs not compassion.   

I want to know is how many of the long term - vented patients made it?  I'd like that info -  initially to day 10, daily, and after that at five day intervals.   I object to persons with zero chance of life ( long term comas, no brain function) having their bodies kept alive- altho this might be done so their organs can be donated/harvested!!)

2021-06-04 12:28,"My life was saved in 2019 by my wife ( CPR), EMT's, ER team and a cadre of doctors and nurses who believe that life is precious. 

I thanked almost all of them, one at a time. They told me exactly what I said to people myself nearly 50 years ago: ""It's my job."" They said it with the kind of devotion that a movie director could never replicate.

My 23 nights ( 15 in ICU; 10 on a vent: kidney failure. ICD) among the dedication that surrounded me, reminded me how grateful one should be at how much human beings are capable of caring for one another. Every doctor, nurse and medical personnel deserves the description of ""hero.""

Beyond the gratitude we all should express as we mourn those who have perished from this pandemic, I would humbly remind everyone, however you embark on this journey we call life, that you can make a difference. 

""Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.

And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy."" Desiderata- Max Ehrmann 1927"
2021-06-04 15:25,"What a story. And we live to hear more of them. And re-awaken our feelings. That we, as physicians, must do more than just remain 100% objective, and treat a medical condition...while abandoning the human being carrying it, is shown here to be the case. 'Bedside manners', a quasi forgotten attribute any good doctor and nurse ought to possess, do fall by the wayside when time is of the essence to treat other patients in need. Covid-19 was such a crisis that pushed healthcare givers to the brink. Hats off to them, where responsible knowledge and experienced hands must be accompanied, hand in hand, by compassion. We must be there not only to try to save somebody from disease or trauma...but to be there in the dying, when a patient is 'ready', and the family as well."
2021-06-04 15:31,"These rookie doctors saw something very unexpected. In their classes they were told a rigorous public health response to a pandemic must have four components.

First, recognition, second containment, third treatment and fourth, prevention of future harm.

What they witnessed was how the first three elements of good health policy were largely neglected to accommodate the fourth element, mass vaccination.

By April of last year it was clear that in some medical facilities were being overly stressed. But as the data came in it was also clear that the majority of cases (76%) did not require hospitalization. They simply needed treatment.

But by May the pharmaceutical industry was at full speed to produce a vaccine. At that point most efforts for treatment simply stopped.

Some doctors couldn't believe that there was no official protocol for their sick patients. So they did what physicians are trained to do and experimented with likely medicines that had the potential to ease suffering.

They discovered Ivermectin as an effective treatment that could have saved many more thousands of lives, if it had been pursued with the same effort as vaccination was.

But it wasn't. So they did the best to treat their patients while the medical establishment focused exclusively on vaccination.

The data reveals that these doctors were right. Ivermectin could have reduced case fatalities by between 60-70%.

But that's the art of healing, not the business of medicine."
2021-06-04 15:40,"You know, now that I think about it, this group was exposed exceptionally harshly and abruptly to the difference between textbook medicine and real life medicine.

Of course you need to understand the textbooks. They unfortunately don’t come close to what really happens."
2021-06-04 15:51,"To be honest. it has happened to all of us in training. medical training needs to go back to it's roots. We can't be the grand poobah's of martyrdom and suffering. it's not about our sufferings and we shouldn't measure sufferings by comparing these experiences. let's keep the spotlight on the patients and those coming to us. it's their suffering that needs to be on stage, not us. 
I'm reminded of the first push to reduce resident hours because of fatigue that would cause errors. this hasn't proven out. even then, i remember that the same doctors who made mistakes in the 30th hour made the same mistake in their 6th hour."
2021-06-04 15:55,"I’m a psychiatry resident and spent 3 months of my intern year of residency treating patients in our Covid unit. I obviously approached the medical care of these patients with a mental health focus. It was immediately apparent to me how mentally destructive it was for my patients to lay in isolation, afflicted with a novel and deadly virus, with no human contact other than fully gowned providers and staff entering their rooms for minutes at a time. It’s a devastating situation."
2021-06-04 16:00,"Sorry but some of this makes me smile- specifically ""the old school images of doctors as cold figures of authority. . . They wanted to relate to the people they cared for"". Yeah, when I graduated from medical school we felt the same way (surprise, surprise) but years of dealing with death teaches a doctor doing a certain kind of medicine that for self preservation they had better put some barriers up- either that or retrain as a Dermatologist or Radiologist."
2021-06-04 16:07,"""Today, medical students have access to a wealth of new research on what it takes for doctors to cultivate their patients’ trust.""  Too bad they don't have the time to do it.  Even worse, the health insurance companies don't care about the relationships patients and doctors have.  They drop doctors from the network which forces patients to seek care with other doctors they don't know and may not trust.  Our current wealth care system makes trusting any health care professional next to impossible.  

It doesn't matter to the health insurance companies, the hospitals, or even most practices how patients are treated.  Our system is geared towards making money, limiting the money spent on actual care, and keeping patients away from the system.  It's done with high deductibles, high co-pays, losing claims, denying claims (even retroactively reclassifying certain necessary procedures as cosmetic when they weren't), etc.

That said, these young doctors were on the front lines.  They saw more than most doctors see in a lifetime.  I hope the experience didn't burn them out and that it taught them valuable lessons."
2021-06-04 16:08,I started my medical training at the peak of the HIV epidemic in the South Bronx. This was the time when we did not have highly effective therapy for HIV. Many young people died and it was  a horrifying experience. But even that did not prepare me for what I witnessed in April last year. I am amazed at what these young doctors have accomplished. May they continue to grow and save many more lives.

2021-06-04 16:21,"Jumping into the fire was both brave and a tremendous opportunity to gain experience and skills that may have otherwise taken years to acquire. I think if I was young with no co-morbidities I would have done the same. I don’t think many will regret having made this decision.
I do find it odd though that Iris doesn’t want her last name used but photos are fine? Kudos to all healthcare professionals who stepped up in this epidemic."

Try being a medic...arrive in Vietnam on a Monday & in the grass on Tuesday. 

Try you first fire fight develops into a pitched battle on a muddy hillside...you treat your first casualty...a sucking chest wound & you have to use a dressing with Vaseline & cellophane wrapper from a cigarette pack to seal off the air.

Later you have to cut the neck off of a plastic canteen to insert in the mouth of a fragmented jaw to drain the blood away so the casualty can breath & not swallow his own blood.

All of the day you & your patients are sliding around in mud & blood & mortar shells are landing around you.

This author wrote an interesting story...but these doctors have lots of staff to call on, the latest in medical equipment....vents, fresh blood. Yes...they work hard & deserve praise. Just remember a medic in the field had 8 weeks at Fort Sam Houston before being shipped over, loaded onto a slick with a aid bag filled with limited supplies."

They went to medical school to receive a Medical Doctorate, not to ""provider school"". Don't denigrate their hard work and selfless dedication by using corporate, meaningless, degrading terminology"
2021-06-04 15:58,"I think it's a shame that every time someone writes a story about the sacrifices, commitment and resilience one group has shown over this past terrible year, commenters come out of the woodwork to complain that their specific group wasn't highlighted as well. I'd suggest that not every group needs to be endlessly represented in every single article - the pot banging in New York was meant for EVERONE who was exposing themselves to incredible risk by trying to save as many lives as possible. (I dare not list them for fear of a dozen replies ""How dare you not mention {my chosen group]!!"")

And while I was around for the AIDS epidemic (still with us), the comparison between that and this pandemic fails in terms of the contagiousness and the speed at which the scale of the COVID-19 problem grew. And the number of healthcare workers who contracted AIDS from treating patients was a tiny, tiny fraction of those who caught COVID-19 from their work and died.

Please don't get so offended or jealous when someone else is lauded for their role in helping during this tragedy. There are literally millions of people who deserve credit for their work, their compassion, and the help they gave others less fortunate than them. There's plenty of credit to go around."
2021-06-04 9:37,"“But when soldiers enlist, they are prepared for offensive strikes, to…put themselves in harm’s way. That’s not meant to be a doctor’s role.”

As a doctor and serviceman,  I’d say you’re partially correct. We are meant for such a role, but we more often than not delegate it, shamefully, to nurses. 

Write about them next please—no disrespect intended to my junior colleagues, but nurses and nurse assistants  should be afforded an entire section of the NYT to acknowledge their work and stories amidst this pandemic."
2021-06-04 10:51,"Nice Story, but the premise is just wrong. Medicine, as a calling, has always required one to do what is necessary. This has historically been true in both war and peace. Freshly graduated from Columbia, I went to San Francisco for my internship in Internal Medicine. My first several months were spent at San Francisco General, aka the County, where I was assigned to Ward 5B, the first AIDS ward in the country. At that time we had no idea what the cause of the disease was, only that everyone died. Interns were required to workup every fever spike, so we had to draw blood, obtain sputum, and do spinal taps all night long. We were not sure how HIV spread, but it soon became clear that needle sticks were a vector. Adding to our stress were some of the nurses who would file disciplinary reports on the interns who wore PPE (masks and gowns) because we were ""socially isolating the patients"". Forty years ago, there was no emotional support for the medical staff aside from camaraderie among the house staff.  I am still performing clinical care during COVID and from my perspective, this is not really different from many other episodes in history.
I suppose every generation has its challenges, but training for a medical career has always been extremely demanding."
2021-06-04 16:40,"Seems like everybody is a ""hero"" these days. Is that a byproduct of  the ""everybody gets a trophy / nobody is a loser"" mentality in our schools?

Don't get me wrong, I very much appreciate all that the medical care industry has done. But for crying out loud - that's their job! That's what they got into their fields to do. Enough of the congratulating - it's embarrassing! (And I have two children in the medical field.)

My uncle was a doctor in World War II. He was stationed on a hospital ship that brought hundreds of badly and mortally wounded soldiers from battle to hospitals on the ground. They worked non-stop on the worst of the worst. He never talked about it. He didn't want pats on the back. He didn't want recognition. That's just what he did - and he did it. 

Different times, I guess. Or maybe Emma Goldberg is just trying to sell her book."
2021-06-04 16:53,"As many others have commented, I spent my first months out of medical school caring for AIDs patients in the early 80s, before we knew how the disease was transmitted, and with very little in the way of personal protection. Plus, I was thrown into the ICU to care for other critically ill patients, some of whom did not survive.

This is nothing new. And as doctors, it's our job from day one."
2021-06-04 17:11,Foreign medical graduates constitute one third of the physician force in the United States. Particularly in dense boroughs such as Bronx which were worst hit by covid foreign medical graduates played a vital role as resident physicians in these hospitals with training programs. They are seldom acknowledged and overlooked by all. This piece affirms that.
2021-06-04 17:32,"In my opinion, the more exposure the doctors in training have, the better they roll out as doctors, just like a good tempering from iron to steel. Look at the doctors in India, given the mass of people they treat, their doctors are very hands on with expertise. They dont run through a checklist to diagnose your problem, most ailments are diagnosed by just looking at your condition."
2021-06-04 17:44,"“They also know about the growing evidence that some patients have better health outcomes when treated by doctors who look like them”. 
Every time I read a quote like this I fear we are destined for a future when white patients see only white MDs, black patients are only cared for by African American MDs etc. Is this the destiny of American medicine in the 21st century?"
2021-06-04 15:28,"I only wish that the courage, honor, hard work, and sacrifice of these current and future clinicians was recognized and shared more by the segments of America who attacked our country by intentionally spreading this disease.  Especially rural America.

These are people that have worked hard their whole lives to reach a pinnacle profession.  It's one of the most American stories I can think of.  

We must never forget their sacrifices during this dark year.  We must also never forget the perfidy of some of the other people who live here.

I think the infrastructure bill is a good time to remember that latter piece.  Let's invest in the parts of America that actually protect America."
2021-06-04 11:59,"As always, a tale about MDs. NYT, I have news for you: the NURSES were there, at the bedside, in the COVID units and COVID ICUs, many times with far too many patients, little support, and NO or inadequate PPE, desperately trying to give patients the excellent high tech care they needed. These nurses included new grads too, like my son, whose first steps into his new profession were tortured, uncertain and risky."
2021-06-04 15:51,"As a medical student I don't know whether to laugh, cry or scream when I read the claim that today's medicine and its practitioners are more compassionate, or that their training has radically improved in that respect. Empty, performative are words that come to mind. Even worse, the facade of compassion we are taught leaves us totally wrung out when we ""miss"" the narrow opportunities afforded us to exercise our crash-course emotional skills.

Compassion heals. Every patient, no matter how badly they are suffering and how little we can do for them, is an opportunity. To imagine taking their suffering into your heart, and using it voluntarily to break the dam of ego that holds back our vulnerability and love. More pain is more opportunity to grow. I cry, I write, I diagnose, I treat, I come away more feeling whole than before. I am not ashamed of my failures, because they are also my strengths.

Do not tell me in the face of the overwhelming evidence of the crumbling mental health of our pandemic docs that medical school, our seniors or our attendings teach us anything like how to transform emotional pain into healing. I know that they don't. All credit for my knowledge of these ideas and the methods goes to my parents, as well as the spiritual masters of the gelugpa lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. 

I pray that schools and medical practitioners will realize these deficits and correct them. I pray that I can figure out the right way to ask that they do."
2021-06-04 16:52,"I started my internship at UCLA in July 1986.  My first patient death was that day.  The patient had AIDS and died right after morning rounds.

Of course I had already had a lot of patients die as a medical student.

Having your patients die is kind of a common thing in medicine.  You get used to it pretty quickly or you're in the wrong profession. 

The key things are diagnosing bad stuff early so as to prevent unnecessary suffering and death and also not doing something stupid and killing the patient yourself."
2021-06-04 16:50,"Doctors should and do train in stressful situations. What type of nonsensical thinking should warrant something different? Remember those field medics that carried the Allies through WW2 or those in Iraq and Afghanistan. The millennial nonsense of non confrontation and ""look at me I am special"" is a thorn in the side of the medical industry. My wife, an ER physician, could write a novel on the ineptitude and entitlement of new medical providers both pre pandemic and now."

I'd like to welcome all these volunteers to the often terrifying world of emergency medicine...
In '74, I was homeless.
In spring, '75, my 1st. ever ambulance patient was a 15 y/o girl in trauma-arrest, followed, 1 hr., later, by a 9 y/o  boy with a leg, almost amputated, (avulsed / femoral neck fx), via 'minibike';
In '82, my 1st. ever 'A.C.L.S.' job was a false alarm...
alleging an MTA Subway, fallen on an MTA Bus from the 'Elevated'...
NOT Funny!

Early, in the pandemic, a new M.D. (in Queens), killed herself after being C.19.overwhelmed;
Like many '1st. Responders', I've only, recently resigned from the Rev. Jack Daniel's 'flock'; (of lost 1st. responders, x's 3 yrs).

2021-06-04 16:54,"The harsh truth is that in a pandemic, some of these considerations become secondary. Saving the savable is what you must do. Look up the term triage - it is as brutal as it is necessary. 
And another thing - if something is valuable it should be financially supported. Check your insurer's reimbursement policy for time spent on compassion or really getting to know the patient. As far as they are concerned it has no value."
2021-06-04 16:39,"""Doctors aren’t supposed to

Says who? We did it with the HIV epidemic in NYC and everywhere else in the mid 1980s and it was scary, demoralizing, helpless and sometimes hopeless to be a new Intern in NYC. The deaths then were mainly young people and in the beginning we had no rapid testing and had to rely on clinical detection of unusual infections to make the diagnosis. I commend these young doctors courage and perseverance. It annoys me to no end that some many people believe doctors are part of some conspiracy trying to control and manipulate them when all we are doing is the job we signed up for. We would not be recommending vaccines against this virus for our selves, our families and our patients-- unless we believed it was safe and in everybody's best interest to do so."
2021-06-04 18:18,"""Instead of tending to full humans, doctors were treating distinct organs like a car mechanic examining malfunctioning parts.""
This reminds me of my father's view: ""Doctors are just glorified mechanics."" He taught me to take responsibility for my own health and my health choices, to question my doctors and nurses, not just to accept their advice.
I admire these young people who are treating the whole patient, not just the disease, and I hope they will continue to practice medicine with empathy and compassion. They are providing care in a very difficult time."
2021-06-04 18:39,"On tv in Canada a few months i saw young graduating healthcare workers saying they couldn't wait to get on the front lines to fight against covid ( I'm sure it was the same in the US ) they were all female , smiling and looked like children , smiling and putting on a brave face . They were to start the next day and i don't think they understood the gravity of what they would be facing . My heart went out to these young people putting their lives on the line and risking it all to help us . So if you have not already done so go out and get vaccinated so we can lesson the burden on these young people who are giving everything for us ."
2021-06-04 18:00,"Please! You simply cannot describe in eloquent detail the soul-crushing responsibilities and sacred intimacies that crisis grants these young physicians while simultaneously calling them ""providers""! 
At the moments of their patients' greatest mortal threat, ""providers"" depersonalizes, distances and even violently devalues the very efforts at healing in the midst of medical futility that your article ostensibly seeks to portray. 
Wordsmiths whom you professionally consider yourselves to be, surely you must acknowledge the travesty of your choice of this unfortunate term just because it has been heedlessly adopted in place of something less sterile and more vital. Like ""clinician"", ""clinical caregiver"", and on the many best of days, ""healer"".
What are you afraid of? Using language meaningfully rather than reflexively and without heart?"
2021-06-04 19:00,"Yes, the pandemic was a difficult lesson for young physicians to learn. It's good they learned it early in their careers. Every generation has had to deal with experiences it was not prepared for. Makes me think of the young men I went to school with who did not go to college and began their adult lives on the killing fields in Viet Nam. They weren't ready for that experience either. Unfortunately, it's the way the world works."

I imagine that their creator is very proud of them and I'll admit that there have been one or two times that I have observed articles where they had actually helped to make something clear.  But mostly they are just an annoyance to me and I wish they could be reserved for the few cases where they really do contribute.
2021-06-04 19:43,Some of us just aren't going to make it: if we are very old; if we have co-morbidities; if we live in a place that has less than top notch medical care; if the breaks don't go our way with intubation or ECMO or antibodies; if we are so obese that even proning can't help; if our genetic makeup predisposes us to weakness; if we are very poor. What caretakers must do is put their own health first so they can remain able to help the rest of us.

There was no Hospice. In 1976. My first document signed was a death certificate.

2021-06-04 19:39,"That was good. I've always wondered what the doctors are actually thinking. They don't want to get too close to somebody who will eventually die, as we all will. But you can't divorce yourself from empathy or feeling either. You don't want to lose your humanity. It's a tough high wire act. Sure they want to save your life but not get sucked into the vortex of human pain and tragedy, even though it waits for all of us."
2021-06-04 22:35,"This seems to be another in what's becoming a running series of NYT's Covid sob stories.

Consider this.  What if this had been wartime and shortly after arriving at a MASH camp the first casualties had come in?

That kind of stuff really happens.  This doctor was facing a similar situation. 

And it's what she was trained to do and should be expected to confront."
2021-06-04 23:07,at least these guys are not getting shot at.
2021-06-04 22:14,"Kudos to these med students jumping into the front lines!   

However, some of what the author describes has been considered normal in medical training. Patients will die on your watch, starting with your first clinical rotations which in my day started in the third year.    My first rotation as an intern in 1985 was in a teaching hospital medical ICU where the attending physician told us on the first day that 70% of the patients admitted to that medical ICU were going to die and you had to be able to accept that.   My next rotation was “White Team”, the cancer ward, where a lot of patients died.

As for the uniqueness of medical training during a pandemic:   I was in medical school from 1981-1985 in Washington DC, one of the ground zero locations for the AIDS pandemic.   My thinking progressed very quickly from “wow, an entirely new illness, what a fascinating time to be a medical student!” to “Oh. My. God.   This ward is full of patients who are all going to die, and if I get an unlucky needle stick injury, I’m going to die, too.”   There was no treatment, AIDS mortality was nearly 100% at that time, while medical students and house staff were responsible for most of the IV starts and blood draws.

Retired now, and thankful that it’s a lot easier to volunteer at the fairgrounds drive through vaccination clinic and give immunizations than to work in the hospital."
2021-06-04 22:39,"Let me understand. So “facing the patient’s death “ is not included in medical relationship, or signing a death certificate is a “ futile” act. “Medicine is an evolving science”. It is the preamble of most of our resident books. For a long period ,last year,we faced a “ war medicine”,with dermatologists intubating suffering patients. What’s wrong with this too early “call to the arms”?  We sill don’t know what’s next."
2021-06-04 22:57,"Oh! No. I mourn for why I have been reading the article by Emma Goldberg? A true picture of reality is so tragic? Yet 'our sweetest songs are those which tell the saddest thought'.

I agree, a bigwig-doctor, I've never seen to weep or cry in lament! Patients mostly with terminal disease come to see a bigwig to stay afloat for a few more years; but alas! So many to sink in to the whirl of death, the doctor continuing to examine array of patients unfailing! I say, Iris! You're a  green horn, a troubled breast, feel enough, say enough with moans,  stay moved seeing a lonely  patient to die gabbling her last lore of pathos! Heard you not? ""doctors should have no empathy""! Oh! Ah! Significantly once I sobbed my heart out when a mighty man, no less than the former two-term President, George W. Bush burst in to tears while he had been eulogizing his father, the President Bush Sr. lying in state before burial, ""I said dad I love you, and you've been a wonderful father.""

I did well in school, skipping two grades before attending an elite high school which I graduated from with honors, but I was never the equal of many of my college classmates who excelled in math and the sciences.

You make up for this by excelling at something else. In my case, it turned out to be running homeless shelters and senior centers and paying close attention to the vagaries of the stock market. For others it could be teaching or dentistry or music or cooking or playing basketball.

You do what you like to do and are able to do, work as hard as you can and hope for the best.

Looking back now, I think sometimes about what a fine brain surgeon I might have been, while congratulating myself for sparing and lengthening the lives of many good and decent people by choosing not to become a doctor."
2021-06-05 2:02,"Having started real-world medical practice with the onset of the AIDS epidemic -- and I want to assure every reader that COVID is probably a magnitude worse in every aspect -- I can only echo the sentiments of the author that for a young physician, these experiences will affect the whole of their subsequent career.

This is not to take away from the valiant work of nurses, pharmacists, aids, and all the staff caring for COVID patients.

For physicians it is different.  It is the chain of command.  It is the legal responsibility.  It is a different moral responsibility.  It is the responsibility to bring science to the bedside.  The worst is when it is not ""we could not save this patient"" but ""I -- emphasis here -- I could not save this patient.  

I have seen young doctors totally burn out a career trajectory over a catastrophic experience.  Other healthcare professionals burn out, too, but it is different when a doctor is lost to society."

2021-06-10 14:10,"Just who has said people who have had Covid may be more likely to experience side effects from the vaccine? 
I , personally , know several people who have had Covid , and some are medical doctors, and they have gotten the vaccine as soon as it was available to them. None experienced symptoms at a higher rate or more severe than those I know who were vaccinated without having Covid. I’d like to see that assertion substantiated."
2021-06-10 14:33,"Dear Rabbi Reicher,
First, thank you for this very difficult work. Your effort is important to those who have lost loved ones. You also created an interesting database of historical information about COVID and it's impact on your world wide community. You should consider linking this up online with a site such as Findagrave (it would be public) or creating a website (if you would prefer to keep it private) so years from now family members or researchers will be able to access it. In any case make sure you make copies so it isn't inadvertently lost."
2021-06-10 14:05,"I would rather Mr. Reicher not focus on just Jewish victims of Covid

There was way too much focus on 'hyphenated-Americans' these days. 

We're all Americans. We're all in this together."

You have seen the devastation caused by this disease.  Please, do not be afraid of side effects.  You and your new bride can handle it.  You are better protected with a vaccine.  People need you both."

Not exactly a charge, however, totally not acceptable!  Names/address database for COVID-19 injections should have been private, off limits to the hospital and/or anyone else ...  My complaint was followed up by the foundation director providing a link whereby anyone could have their name/address removed from the mailing list ... Still not acceptable, totally reprehensible!"

You are correct that grandfathered plans aren't required to cover ACA-mandated preventive care and immunizations ."
2021-06-10 11:25,"It is depressing to see just how many Congressional Acts and laws and safeguards one needs in America to avoid the generation of a bill going out to patients for this little piece of essential medical care.  This experience should be a lesson to us all; we need to rethink the economic basis, in a universal way, for how health care is delivered in our country."
2021-06-10 17:20,It truly is an indictment of our health-care system that people's expectation from the get-go is that they will get scr**ed.
2021-06-10 15:31,Why doesn't the NYT publish the names of doctors and organizations that have charge for the vaccine?
2021-06-11 13:09,"""Given a warning"" is about the most useless thing we can do. Did you know in most states you are not allowed to sue for malpractice? Or file a formal complaint against a doctor? No wonder our health care is the 3rd leading cause of death."
2021-06-11 16:27,"Doctors now ask us to sign documents saying we'll pay for anything the insurance company doesn't cover.  In those documents are specific penalties for not paying within a certain time frame.  Our accounts can be turned over to a collection agency, we can be charged interest, etc.  In other words, despite what this article is saying, most of us have no real way of fighting this sort of balance billing. 

Hospitals do the same thing.  Patients are on the hook for whatever the insurance company decides not to pay or if the insurance company takes too long to pay.  

It's a wild country when it comes to medical care and paying for it.  So far most of the burden is on the patients rather than the insurers or the medical providers to prove that things were a) charged and coded appropriately, and b) covered and paid.  

This idiocy, along with a few other reasons, is why I despise our wealth care system and avoid it as much as I can."

Let's not even start talking about the costs of asking my grocer which peaches were in season."
2021-06-11 18:14,"This leaves me wondering who reimburses medical offices for the cost of vaccinations for those without Medicare, Medicaid, or insurance that can be billed. Does following the letter of the law mean they’re not able to receive any payment for their services? Are the costs passed along to other patients in the form of higher charges for non vaccine visits? Are they allowed to deny vaccines to those without coverage, directing them to public distribution sites instead? 

Another concern for the uninsured is potential reactions. Since vaccine manufacturers are immune from liability for their products if someone has a reaction that requires medical care and/or hospitalization who pays? Will the patient get a bill that results in bankruptcy? If their employer required the vaccine can they sue them for their medical bills and suffering?"

In the meantime there were two people who needed Spanish interpreters and did not present any documents whatsoever. They got vaccinated right along with the rest of us and  will never have to worry about mistakenly being billed. Once again two systems."
2021-06-11 17:43,"I don't quite understand this...When I went and got my vaccine, all they asked for was my name. And It was one of those mass clinics where they vaccinate 1000 people at a time. I was not asked about my insurance, just my name and address- nothing more."
2021-06-11 19:52,"Some medical providers will still bill Medicare and Medicaid for vaccines and costs related to COVID 19.

We never received a bill directly for the full amount.  Evidently it was charged directly to our insurance company.  We found out when we were billed the copay.  All the bill said was “inoculation” so we don’t have any documentation to prove that this was for covid (other than the vaccination certificate with date).  What a mess!"

2021-06-11 18:30,"What they usually do is bill for the “other” stuff beyond getting the actual treatment or service. So they create like a charge for the registration etc so that they’re not specifically billing for the shot itself. I’ve not seen it with the vaccines themselves, but I saw it with my test. They said the test was free, and then sent me a bill for some extra services needed for the test, they say. It’s an absolute game!"

2021-07-07 3:02,I just want to start off by saying that I can relate to this article in my community because I agree that everyone should be or get vaccinated because we can slow down the spread of the covid-19 and since now its not mandatory to wear masks in stores I feel unsafe because not everyone wants to get vaccinated and that can put the rest of us in danger because we are taking care of each other by wearing masks and getting a vaccine while other people are still not vaccinated which can be bad because they can have a chance to get covid and while the other half of people are vaccinated and are at a low rate of getting covid because they are vaccinated and I just feel like it's unfair that there's those people who take care of themselves and just so people walk in stores and act like everything is back to normal well at least everybody should get the vaccine or  still wear a masks because I am 15 and I got my first dose at the beginning of June and I felt completely fine and I didn't die like other people say that it kills you and just making up lies and I am blessed to be fully vaccinated and I courage all you people to get vaccinated.

It was clear from the beginning of the Pandemic that the lack of a 'Plan' on the part of the Trump Administration was going to lead to a wide swath of suffering and death. In fact but for the lack of a coherent 'Plan' we would be looking at 4 more years of Trump's incompetence. Sadly, so many people perished and yet no one will be held to account. This is just the first 'Plague' we will encounter and I fear that we will not have the political will or courage to prepare for the next one. Covid-19 was just a 'dress rehearsal.'"
