From the latter, we get a perspective that is not possible in these hot reports appearing regularly now in the daily press.  This report is well done, balanced and clear.  But because it is largely anecdotal, peer review and discussion are not yet available.

One good model of how trials should be done is the RECOVERY trial, run in Oxford UK for the NHS. Instead of comparing drugs one at a time, they tested several drugs against the same control group, thereby limiting the number of patients who had to get a placebo. (Fauci wanted to run US  trials like that, but he was overruled.) RECOVERY found that the cheap drug dexamethasone saved lives, but hydroxychloroquine and other drugs touted by Trump and Fox News did not. <a href=""https://www.recoverytrial.net/results"" target=""_blank"">https://www.recoverytrial.net/results</a>

They gave him plasma along with a 5 day treatment of remdisivir then after that didn’t work the doctor decided to administer baricitinib for 14 days.  I read everywhere online that this drug is supposed to be administered a 10 day treatment of remdisivir but that is not how they gave him the treatment. I asked his doctor about this and he said that he didn’t have to give him anymore remdisivir because it was already in his system. This baricitinib drug weakened my fathers immune system and his viral pneumonia then also became a bacterial pneumonia. Along with this medication they have him many more that caused his kidneys to be over worked resulting in him needing dialysis. My father died 1/19/2021. He was the second patient to be given this medication that did not work and made him worse resulting in his death. Please do not let doctors administer this drug.

2020-12-18 01:12:02,"The article asks the wrong question -- of course it's far safer to get immunity from controlled doses of the vaccine spaced a month apart than to just put yourself out there to get infected. 

The far more important and practical question is that if you've already HAD Covid, should you still get vaccinated? This is a question that is likely to confront more than 100 million Americans (17.5 million confirmed and likely another 6 to 8 times as many without confirmed diagnosis -- a very detailed study in October showed that the multiple at that time was 10 times). 

The answer to this more important question is that we don't know, for sure, but it is highly unlikely that those who've had Covid need a vaccine. Sure there are cases of people getting reinfected, but so is the case with the vaccines -- 6% of those who got the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine still got infected. Just like with the vaccines, those who get reinfected are likely to have much milder symptoms compared to the first time. 

Long term immunity comes from T-cells, not antibodies. Measuring antibodies five or six months after someone has had Covid and somehow equating that to some level of immunity is meaningless. The body doesn't have armies of antibodies of every disease you've had, but retains ""memory"" in B cells to rapidly mount defense when re-infected. 

If we test for antibodies prior to administering vaccines, we could also save lives by giving vaccines to those not previously infected and save more lives."
2020-12-18 03:19:51,"The logical error in the question “is it better to get immunity from the vaccine or the disease” is far more fundamental than the one the quoted doctor states. Simply put, the goal of these vaccines is to prevent COVID-19 disease. The effectiveness of the Moderna/Pfizer vaccines is about 95%, meaning about 5% of patients who get the vaccine will get the disease anyway (if they’re exposed). The article implies the corresponding number for ‘natural immunity’ is less than 1% will be reinfected. But that’s not the apples to apples comparison. The apples to apples comparison is the percentage is the percentage who will get COVID-19 if infected with the virus, which is...100% by definition. In other words, catching COVID-19 in order to not get COVID-19 is...0% effective."
2020-12-11 21:13:49,"The Pfizer vaccine may be akin to an allergy shot given it has already caused anaphylaxis in two individuals. This contraindication should be extended from those having anaphylactic reactions to those who take beta blockers, ACE/ARB Inhibitors or with uncontrolled asthma. Beta blockers make epipens useless and require treatment with not readily available second line agents like glucagon. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and Angiotensin receptor blocking medication have a known and not infrequent side effect of life threatening angioedema that can lead to tracheotomy and death. This is the first of hopefully many other vaccines that will not have this side effect. The goal should be the complete 2 dose administration to all who can safely receive it. The Moderna, AstraZeneca and others will likely have slightly different safety profiles. Given the emergency indication one must err on the side of caution but the goal must be universal access and administration  of a safe effective vaccine for all. Prudently it may mean excluding certain at risk populations in this first few months of administration. These provisos may ultimately increase trust in the process."
2020-12-11 21:33:43,"I was a bit surprised to learn that people with allergies couldn't participate in the trial, but thinking about it for five minutes make it clear that there is no other way.

Imagine trying to do a crash-test on a car, but sawing through the A-pillars (where the windshield is) beforehand. That's not a realistic test! If you allowed allergic people to participate in these trials every vaccine would get a ""fail"".

So, what to do?

Well, administer the vaccine under controlled conditions for those who have allergies. Have intubators ready, adrenaline, a defibrillator, whatever it takes. The people with the allergies will have a strong reaction, yes, but the vaccine will (probably...) still work.

BTW: I personally am allergic to the vaccine against small pocks. It's required in Germany, you get it as a toddler. One side of my body turned completely purple and I was howling at the top of my lungs my mother said (she even showed my a photo that went into a scientific publication, nobody had ever seen anything like this before). 

They tried it a week later on the other arm, same result. The third shot went into the right thigh, and that suddenly worked without any problems?!? Strange how these things sometimes end up..."

2020-12-11 22:28:59,"I had a strong allergic reaction to a drug that stopped short of anaphylaxis so when it's my turn for a vaccine I would want to have it in a facility with the ability to reverse an anaphylactic reaction--most pharmacies are not equipped.

Yet the speed and politicizing of the development of this one makes me pause. It didn’t have to be this way."
2020-12-11 22:55:08,"We must expect official rules as soon as possible.  Personally, I have faith in public Institutions and the advice signed by the British Regulators already seems appropriate to me.

What is concerning is the 2-3 cases within the first few days (presumably out of a relatively small number of injections).  It should be followed closely, but no need to panic.  

Of much greater concern is the Trump administrations bullying of CDC to approve within 24 hours of the panel recommendation.  That could further erode peoples trust in the process and reduce the participation rate."

They are understood to have had an anaphylactoid reaction, which tends to involve a skin rash, breathlessness and sometimes a drop in blood pressure. This is not the same as anaphylaxis which can be fatal.”

I think this is important. I had several anaphylactOID reactions when doing allergy shots--only two required treatment beyond antihistamine. I am going to get the vaccine but will do at a location that can treat just in case. (I will talk to doctor, of course and take advice.)"

Can he be vaccinated against this at all?"
2020-12-12 00:40:35,"No vaccine will ever be perfect. However, if the vaccine distribution has endless delay, we will never start, and that is worse. Many state that if this administration is for something, they will automatically oppose. However, even a one hour delay by the FDA is costly when 2 Americans die every minute.  Vaccine distribution in the US could have begun in November. The advisory committee was not required by statute or by the Code of Federal Regulations. So, regardless of what you think of the current administration, they are correct that the FDA has caused only harm by not having the EUA prepared weeks ago. The death of one more American is a tragedy. FDA DOES need to move."
2020-12-12 01:15:00,"It might’ve been nice to include an allergy expert in this report. 

So as an allergist, I can say that true vaccine allergy is relatively rare. Patients, and regrettably healthcare providers, too, frequently mistake side effects for “allergic reactions”. 

While the new coronavirus vaccines must be monitored carefully, we should not assume that they will induce allergic responses, or adopt reactionary approaches.￼

The net result could mean unnecessary fear or avoidance of new vaccines."
2020-12-11 23:30:48,"We don't know if this was reported because it's actually unusual or simply because its for COVID, given that anything about the virus seems to get more publicity. Before anyone starts worrying disproportionately, let's find out if these events are the norm for other vaccines."

As far as the vaccine, she will get it when it’s available but we will stick around the doctors office for a while afterward and have a couple of EpiPen‘s with us just in case. Also we’re not both going to get it at the same time. That way if one of us feels rotten for a couple of days the other one can help out.

Another reader suggested taking Benadryl ahead of time just in case. Will probably have some with us.

Anyone can have a reaction from a bee sting or a vaccine. Even if you’ve never had an allergic reaction before.

Looking forward to getting the vaccine!"
2020-12-12 01:26:30,"I really appreciate when medical professionals weigh in with their education and experience, but, especially now, it’s really not appropriate for anyone else to use their anecdotes and ingredient-list alarmism to dissuade others from getting this vaccine. Please let the scientists do their jobs."
2020-12-12 01:41:47,"What is expected very shortly is an EMERGENCY USE authorization for the vaccine, not general authorization. This is because based on present evidence, benefits outweigh the negatives. 

There is still a lot more data being collected by the Pfizer and Moderna, including safety in children, and over time we will also learn about safety and efficacy with others with underlying conditions like autoimmune diseases. 

Clearly, it is not ideal to permit a drug to be used where it's not been thoroughly tested, but we these will save lives while we learn  more. If you are concerned about allergic reactions, wait a couple of months. Just given the millions who will get the vaccine, we will quickly learn more."

I was concerned but took the Miralax with no ill effects, but her story came to mind when reading about the anaphylactic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine in Britain.  Maybe taking a look at the ingredients in the vaccine and seeing if there are components that people may have allergies to would be helpful.

Yet Moderna says it will produce between 500million and 1 billion doses by end 2021 and Biontech will produce 1.3 billion doses by end 2021. This is surely enough to vaccinate the US. You need to either clarify timeframes or correct the article."
2020-12-11 20:18:25,"The question is whether a regulatory agency would accept such a correlate.  The other question is the safety aspect, which would still require a fairly large study.  Additionally, once could design an 'equivalence' study against an existing vaccine. The important aspect of an 'equivalence' study is how equivalent do they have to be. A study provides an estimate of the effect plus a variance. Current FDA requirement is that this estimate has to be at least 50% with the lower estimate of the 95% confidence interval greater than 30%. An equivalence study with a comparison against a vaccine with 95% efficacy allows for how close do you have to be and how precise is that measure. Not as insurmountable as implied."
2020-12-11 22:24:47,"What effect would combinations of different vaccines produce? Would it be worthwhile, or dangerous, or unknown? Has this been tried with any other vaccines?"
2020-12-11 19:02:10,Curious.  Can a vegan use a vaccine developed using animals in cages?  I don't know but I have seen Republicans use antibody treatments developed from fetal kidneys.
2020-12-12 10:42:21,Covid-19 id virulent and deadly. Science (not Trump) has been spurred on to fight it. As has happened many times in the past with other diseases Covid-19 Scientific research has created positive Medical advances.
2020-12-15 14:47:26,"""Minimal side effects"" should read ""minimal side effects in a population similar to that used in the trial."" We believe in science? Then let's be scientific.

There are millions of people, from those with autoimmune diseases to those taking medications that alter the immune system, that - understandably - were not represented in the population of the trials. 

For these people nobody knows whether the vaccine is dangerous, effective, ineffective, or else. 

So, let's proceed with vaccinations, by all means. But also let's not play reverse-ideology like the no-vaxers do by glossing over the many things we do not know about these vaccines."

Hoping to get lucky and make it into the third group in line, maybe one of Biden’s 100m in 100 days. Will welcome a few side effects for a chance to rejoin the planet. Thank you, scientists!"
2020-12-15 15:21:03,"Having two vaccines with close to equal effectiveness in such record time is the best news in this terrible Covid saga - we should all commend the scientists and celebrate their achievement. 

Wondering - would there be any downstream benefit through blood donations after donors complete the two doses of vaccines?  If some measure of protection could be created this way, could this be a stop gap means to expand coverage while more vaccines are being produced?"
2020-12-15 15:21:27,"Grade 3 adverse events were more than double Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine.  Also, grade 4 adverse events in Moderna's trial don't look so promising.  It will be interesting to see if Modern'a vaccine will elicit CD8 T cells, and specifically, memory CD8 T cells.  CD8 T cells are the cells responsible for killing infected cells, and studies done with common cold coronavirus suggest CD8 and CD4 memory cells are important for long term immunity.  Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine elicit CD8 and CD4 T cell responses.  There isn't any evidence I am aware of that Moderna's vaccine does the same."
2020-12-15 15:23:06,"I have to wonder what these regulators are doing while we wait for the vaccine's approval and why this isn't dealt with more swiftly. Are they taking long lunches or weekends off? 

It seems to me that the regulators need to prioritize and work around the clock in shifts to get this done."
2020-12-15 15:25:14,"People who use 3 cases of Bell's palsy in vaccinated cohort to claim that ""vaccine causes Bell's palsy"" have to stipulate that both Pfizer-BioNTech and NIAID/Moderna vaccines prevent spontaneous abortions. There were 0 cases of spontaneous abortions in vaccinated groups, and 1 in each non-vaccinated cohort. And since placebo group in NIAID/Moderna trial recorded 1 elective abortion vs 0 in vaccinated cohort, this vaccine also ""prevents"" elective abortions. Same logic, y'all."
2020-12-15 15:31:51,"Great news !

Kudos to the scientists who undoubtedly worked tirelessly to get this vaccine developed. And thanks to those people who are working to produce and distribute it. Thank goodness we will have Biden in charge while the roll out of the vaccine really kicks into full gear."
2020-12-15 15:32:53,"To make this modern scientific miracle a social miracle as well, The Federal Government should pay every vaccine recipient whose family income is less that $100,000/year, $1,000.  This program should begin after a public campaign showing the vaccination of celebrities with risk factors.   And the Federal Government should provide access to state provide health insurance for one year for all vaccinees who earn less than $100,000/year.  If we did this, not only would we be celebrating the astounding scientific achievement, but we would also create an astounding social achievement.  We would stimulate our economy a little bit, we would ensure a rapid path to herd immunity."
2020-12-15 15:39:15,"My concern is with “severe allergic reactions” those that have brought up anaphylaxis. Physicians are cautioning those to bring an epipen. Sadly epipens cost $300.-$600 per dose. My grown children who suffer from anaphylaxis from medications and food, cannot afford to purchase two doses, one for the vaccination and another to keep with them again for emergency situations. And I’ve still yet to hear how much the vaccine is going to cost each person. I don’t qualify for help with medication, for me it’s out of pocket."
2020-12-15 15:40:26,I think the efficacy data and the less-restrictive distribution protocol make the Moderna vaccine a better choice.
2020-12-15 15:42:14,"Best of all possible outcomes. By not just protecting against severe illness but actually stopping infection this type of vaccine can wipeout the virus by denying it hosts rather than just render harmless for the vaccinated. 

Based on this new MRNA tech we may never have another pandemic again. It only took a couple of days to make this vaccine. Everything else was about making sure it was safe. 

Once we have established MRNA works and is safe you can have a new virus appear and make effective vaccine almost immeadiately."
2020-12-15 15:25:28,"During the forthcoming FDA hearing for the Moderna vaccine, I hope they disclose how much profit Moderna’s recent board member, Moncef Slaoui, the warp speed czar, made by virtue of his stock and options holdings on the company, and whether he unduly influenced the initial selection process on Moderna.

Should we ignore this conflict as just another garden variety Trump cronyism among so many others?  Or will we finally address the epidemic of trumpian corruption as well?"
2020-12-15 15:19:31,"With Maine, CT, PA and NY having a 10-fold plus increase in COVID cases since the fall I hope the vaccine works better than masks."
2020-12-15 15:50:18,"Now that two vaccines have proven to be effective, why is it that these other companies must continue in their fatally slow testing efforts for different concoctions? 

Are they all just wanting that payday/recognition? 

Could the resources of these companies not be put towards creating more or the proven vaccines more quickly?

Although we should be overjoyed by the data around the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna tests, it’s distressing that the value of a patent for one of these as yet unproven projects would prompt the efforts to continue modifying and testing in lieu of a concerted effort behind production of the proven ones to immunize the world as quickly as possible."
2020-12-15 15:56:17,Wonder if the body's response to the vaccines will be more long term than having the virus.  I believe there have been people re-infected after only 2 months.  If you have to get an anti-virus shot every 2 months than it does not appear to be that useful.  Though I suppose even a 2 month reprieve would help the situation and slow the spread.
2020-12-15 15:59:17,"When one asks  the question, as philosophers often do, ""Do Human Societies show progress"" the answer is often ""NO.""
But having studied and taught genetics and the history of science, and watched the development of these vaccines, I will say that science is the major area where human make progress. The vaccine of course  contains nucleic acid in the form of Ribonucleic Acid, which is a part of the virus genome. Years and years of curious scientists, from Gregor Mendel down to those who isolated DNA to those who determined its structure. And on and on into how it functioned. And learning the detail of the human genes. Many Noble Prizes; many talented women and men working hard, with lots of education and ingenuity. Don't forget them.
And let'sall try to make more progress in our politics, government structure and function and our arts and engineering. Please help."
2020-12-15 15:59:34,Since there’s not enough vaccine right now to vaccinate everyone let’s not worry too much about the vaccine hesitant. The rest of  us can go ahead and we can worry about the rest after those who want it get it.
2020-12-15 16:06:49,"A minor note: articles about vaccine supply consistently reference the need to vaccinate ~330 million people in America (ie, the entire population of the US).  We will eventually need to vaccinate everyone, but for now people under the age of 16 are ineligible, which takes somewhere in the vicinity of 70 million people out of the queue.

Make no mistake, an immense amount of the vaccine is needed in the coming months, but considerably less than what is often stated in these articles.￼"
2020-12-15 16:07:00,"Bell’s palsy refers to facial paralysis of idiopathic origin after ruling out other causes. Facial paralysis is a more precise term, as it is likely the finding may be a herpetic reactivation know as Ramsey Hunt Syndrome."
2020-12-15 16:13:52,I'm still scratching my head as to why the government didn't order enough vaccine for 300 million of us.   If children are taken out (I don't think they should) then 225 million x 2 is not unreasonable to be shipping out now.  Maybe an oversimplification but 500 million doses could theoretically be distributed by end of January.
2020-12-15 16:28:56,"So we have two excellent vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna), one maybe not so good, maybe we aren't sure yet vaccine (Astra-Zeneca), and two other companies who aren't that close to being ready for prime time yet (Sanofi and GSK).  This leads to a dumb question  -- is there some economically sensible basis under which we could have GSK, Sanofi and Astra-Zeneca start manufacturing the Moderna/Pfizer type vaccine under a licensing agreement?  Wouldn't that get vaccines into a lot more arms a lot faster?

From a regulatory standpoint, what additional FDA action, if any, would be needed to put those companies' manufacturing capacity to use now, rather than later?  

From a business standpoint, is there a set of terms that would be fair to Moderna and Pfizer while giving the licensees a reasonable revenue stream?

From a public health standpoint, is there any advantage to having a couple different kinds of vaccines in circulation?  Or, conversely, if the Moderna/Pfizer mRNA type is most effective, shouldn't we focus on it rather than forcing people, a few months from now, to decide between taking a less effective type of vaccine when it is released versus waiting for more mRNA vaccine to become available?"
2020-12-15 16:33:03,"""The review by the F.D.A. confirms Moderna’s earlier assessment that its vaccine had an efficacy rate of 94.1 percent..."" 
The ""94.1"" shows these company, and the FDA, (at least their PR division) are at high-school level in understanding significant digits and statistics, especially for something as important as this vaccine.  Do they only sort to impress the public with the three digits?"
2020-12-15 16:34:19,"I wish someone would answer some basic questions like:

1.  Does either of the approved vaccines PREVENT infection with COVID --or-- do they just minimize likelihood of severe symptoms and reduce likelihood of needing to be hospitalized?

2.  Has anyone taken one dose of Pfizer and then one dose of Moderna?  Would that provide better protection?

3.  Why does the Pfizer vaccine need to be stored at -94F?  What happens if it is stored at room temp?  Does its potency disappear?"
2020-12-15 16:39:00,This vaccine will be approved this Friday. Moderna's manufacturing facilities should already be shipping this vaccine to facilities that will administer it. This will allow for it to be immediately administered Friday instead of next week.
2020-12-15 16:41:32,"Questions that havn’t been completely answered for me:  how much vaccine each company can produce within a given time frame.  And, can companies farm out vaccine production to other laboratories that have the same type of equipment?  And, if the U.S. paid monies to these companies, do we own part of the patent rights?  If so, how does that influence how the vaccine is produced?  What rights should we be exercising?  What is the rest of the world doing?  Are there laboratories in other countries capable of producing the vaccine if they had proper formulas?  Are supplies needed to produce a vaccine readily available throughout the world?"
2020-12-15 16:42:50,"Is there a reason why the Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline vaccines can't be rolled out to people under 50?  Perhaps there is still some analysis or verification of their effectiveness to be done, but this could be accelerated.  Using these vaccines for people under 50 would speed the immunization of millions of health care workers and high school and college students.  It would preserve the Pfizer and Moderna doses for the older people on which they are most effective.  The Sanofi and Glaxo vaccines are not ineffective and I can't find any reason to write them off as such.  It's simply that they (seem to) work on a limited bit still very large segment of the population.  Why not use them that way?"
2020-12-15 16:47:11,One question I have not seen an answer to yet is whether a vaccinated individual could carry & transmit the virus to others who have not yet been vaccinated - ? Does anyone have an informed answer to that question?
2020-12-15 16:50:47,"And this one doesn’t seem to have the potential allergy issues. I hope choice of vaccine will be an option, particularly for those (like myself) who have a history of anaphylactic responses to medicines."
2020-12-15 16:55:35,"I'm against the lockdowns and stay-at-home orders and etc., and I won't take a vaccine, but Biopharma should be Time's person of the year, and get a lot of credit for this. It looks like a job well done, and may even revitalize the standing of drug companies in the eyes of the public. Incredible work."
2020-12-15 16:57:07,"Great to see the vaccination program kick off. Important to note that we've currently contracted for 300m doses, enough to treat 150m people. The US population is something around 330m. However, they won't be vaccinating children at this point, so let's say 270m eligible for the vaccine. That gets us to greater than 50% vaccinated. As more people get vaccinated the virus won't be able to spread as quickly through populations. If we say 10% of the population has already had the virus and become immune, then we get greater than 60% immunity with the vaccination program, which should get us in the ballpark of herd immunity in the Spring of 2021."
2020-12-15 17:02:59,"It's hard to square the good news about the effectiveness and safety of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines with another report that health care workers are more hesitant to be vaccinated against Covid-19 than the general population. I can only conclude that their real fears have more to do with our country's executive political leadership than with the data about the vaccines' safety.

This is one more example of how distrust and misinformation has thwarted scientific progress, even among those who should have the education to process the amazing clinical trial data which has been made public."
2020-12-15 17:10:28,"Why is this a 30,000 people trial while the Pfizer one had 44,000? It would be helpful to know how one can draw similar statistical inferences as to safety and efficacy with a much smaller sample size. Did they observe subjects for a longer period of time, for instance? Or did they omit certain segments of the population?"
2020-12-15 14:56:06,Just my luck to get the first shot from Pfizer and the follow up second from Moderna and I die in the turf war cross fire.  The coronavirus “ask your doctor” TV commercials are now going to get relentless.
2020-12-15 16:42:52,I believe all the politicians should be the first priority. Beginning with President elect Biden then all the members of the senate and then all the house members. Then the governors of each state and then the mayors of the largest 100 cities. Only then should we distribute to others. We need our leaders to guide us with their infinite wisdom and tell us what to do now more than ever.

Movies, restaurants, art galleries, shopping and more!  OMG, we're a brilliant species.  Good to remember.  Merci."
2020-12-15 17:11:06,It is an article almost perfect. Thanks a lot!
2020-12-15 14:51:07,"OK, let me get this straight: The US gave billions of dollars to Astra Zeneca, Sanofi and GSK yet none of their candidates are showing sufficient efficacy and nothing is expected of them for FY 2021. These are global pharmaceutical giants with enormous balance sheets, not a 15-person biotech operating on venture capital funding. When will we be getting our money back?"
2020-12-15 16:25:42,"It's unfortunate that these vaccines won't stop transmission so the point of the vaccine stopping the pandemic..... It won't. Your still recommended to wear your mask after your shots still. Investigational drug that ethically can't be tested on pregnant women but will probably still be pushed on them . Everyone 
are the walking safety studies. Why should we trust fauci and DSHS when DSHS lost their lawsuit of testing a single vaccine in the last 32+ years to ICANN."
2020-12-15 14:50:58,"One advantage of the Moderna vaccine not mentioned in this article: it can be stored at -4 deg. F. for up to 6 months, unlike the Pfizer vaccine which requires -94 deg. F.  And the Moderna vaccine might be stable for 30 days at refrigerator temperatures.  This should make distribution much easier.

They have already approved the Pfizer vaccine and will do so for Moderna soon. 

If approved by them, I have no problem taking either one. We may not have a choice either. 

I am more concerned about the Anti-vaxxers who may cause delay for being able to vaccinate enough people to reach Herd immunity."
2020-12-15 16:14:49,The Moderna vaccine lis less effective than Pfizer’s in people over 65. I hope the government takes that into account when they are vaccinating health care workers and other people receiving early vaccination and that they reserve the Pfizer vaccine for seniors.
2020-12-15 15:58:07,"We need to demand that Biden get the vaccine NOW.  Yes, I get that everyone should wait their turn and this has to be a fair process.  But our incoming president must be an exception.  We NEED him too much.  It is in the same category as the President having Secret Service protection.

Give Biden the vaccine today."
2020-12-15 16:30:11,"You have to wonder why the government did not order enough vaccines for everyone. Why vaccinate only a small portion of the population, when we need at least seventy percent of us to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity? Who did not have the foresight to order more doses, and what was the reasoning behind that decision?"
2020-12-15 15:17:33,"Here’s to all the people unwilling to come forward and get vaccinated (and those that want others to get it first, then see): on D-Day 1944 did the soldiers who rushed ashore on Normandy say, “No, you go first”?"

2020-12-15 17:11:59,"Just to be a jerk, here are some things that cheese me off about public responses to these vaccines.

1. Demands for info on this, that or the other thing, when all you gots to do is search Times articles or look at the CDC website. Lift a finger, huh? I mean, you’re online—literally, lift a finger. 

2. Demands to speed everything up, because apparently cranking out vaccines on a brand new virus in under a year and speeding through “emergency use,” authorization but actually looking at the data somehow proves that them bureaucrats either don’t care, or want to undermine Trump. (Good for them, but kinda too late to bother at this point.) In any case, tired of the “Gimme bikkit! Gimme bikkit NOW!”

3. Proud annoncements that, “I ain’t wore no mask and I ain’t taking no newfangled VACcine,” but you go right on ahead. Thanks for endangering everybody and mooching, guys. Because you’re depending on US to act like adults and take a very small risk to fix this, while you freeload.

4. The Vitamin D/remdesivir/cholro/worming meds/Big Pharma is evil crowd. Because Quackwatch. Because the first two vaccines are paid for, and cost $15-$30 a pop. Because BP is actually doing something right for a change. 

I get the awkward questions that boil down to, “Please tell me it’s gonna be okay, that I’ll survive this, that my family will, that the risks are over.” Me too. However, this is an excellent example of the real life we generally try to ignore."
2020-12-15 17:34:08,"The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine seem to have won the race to be first to develop a vaccine that can prevent COVID.  Both of these companies use a new vaccine technology, based upon messenger RNA.  The efficacy rates of 95% and 94% are higher than the efficacy rate for Sinopharm, the Chinese company with a new vaccine, presumably with the older technology.

There is a third company, CureVac, that is developing an mRNA vaccine.  Like BioNTech, it is located in Germany.

It may be that mRNA is a superior technology for vaccines, precisely because it is simpler, based upon a small piece of mRNA in a lipid coat, rather than say a whole virus particle which has been modified to not cause disease.

A better vaccine technology would further the goals mentioned on Moderna's website, of developing vaccines to treat cancer and a host of other diseases.

Will the mRNA vaccines be so much more effective that people will prefer to take them instead of the vaccines produced by the old technologies?

If so, there might be a need to increase production of the mRNA vaccines going forward.

This raises the question:  What are the options for increasing production of mRNA vaccines?"
2020-12-15 17:34:29,"Moderna appears, per their website,  to be focused on bringing mRNA technology to bear on a wide range of chronic illnesses in a public health setting. BioNtech, using the same technology,  appears to be addressed, per their website, to providing individualized development of cancer treatment meaning that if, for example, you have the means you can get a personalized cancer treatment for your particular cancer.

This is not new, it has been under development for some time and is only now becoming commercially available. The NY Times has reported on this customized development of  treatments in the past for a range of conditions but I don't believe BioNTech has been included in that discussion. If not, it should be as should a discussion of the morality of custom medicine for the rich vs. everybody else."
2020-12-15 17:44:14,"I find it amazing that two vaccines will be available before the end of the year, that a distribution plan has been set up and  within 48 hours of FDA approval people were getting vaccinated. 
 While there has been unrelenting  criticism of Trump in regard to COVID this is the  first time any action taken by any politician  during this pandemic  will have any real effect on stopping the spread of COVID.  
 As far as shutdowns, mandated restrictions and everything else the reality of those failures to accomplish any thing can be seen in South Dakota. Despite the recent article claiming that the state response was a disaster only 316 new positive cases were reported yesterday."
2020-12-15 17:29:58,"Moderna’s past and recent successes in terms of the covid19 vaccines is premised upon the dynamism of a gifted Israeli leading a covid19 research team in Massachusetts, Tal Zaks. 
        More recently, however, the media went too far, politicizing the effective work output but giving a different researcher the credit. Intellectual property rights and validation should go hand-in-hand with ethical standards premised of journalistic integrity, reliability, confirmability, and dependability.   
       Biomedical engineering research results should not be used to promote the “Great Man Theory”, i.e., in this case, being American, white, superior, and Christian.  Our global village should not have to reexperience these free-for- all-media-frenzies lacking veracity while propping up elitist agendas by a select few with their own racialized worldview.  
       Perhaps, American journalists are under pressure from their bosses to contrive an American spin during this difficult time, especially near the holidays. Instead of sad commentaries on  ""feel good"" stories lacking veracity,  we  can find comfort in the simplicity of  truth which should nurture trust,  comfort, and transformational change."

It's never been mentioned and any groups talking about the issue of the Pfizer vaccine as it relates to immunocompromised clearly state that it is their opinion only as no testing has been done on that 3,000,000 member group of people.

    Also , what do they mean it reduces your risk of SEVERE illness ? I don’t see where it says it completely eradicates the possibility of getting the virus and getting sick . 40,000 participants doesn’t sound like that much to me if none of them were intentionally exposed to the virus . That’s the only way to really tell I would think . 
     And three cases of Bell’s Palsy is a COINCIDENCE? Come on .

2020-12-15 18:14:26,"A recent article by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford Medical School discusses a study he conducted back in April that determined there were 50 times more infections than reported cases of Covid-19. This led him to conclude the mortality rate of the virus is about .2%. With over 300,000 reported deaths in the United States, this would mean approximately 150 million people have already had Covid-19. If this is true, then an aggressive vaccination campaign during the first quarter of 2021 could get us to some level of herd immunity by early second quarter. I'm very curious given that there are very few worldwide reported cases of repeat infections thus far, if people who have already had a known infection will be given the vaccine before those who have yet to have been infected."
2020-12-15 18:33:49,"Great. This works in a controlled setting with willing participants, but there's an important question that no one is asking about both vaccines.

I've not seen this information in any of the gushing, awestruck ""reporting"" so far, but after the initial wave of inoculations on high-compliance individuals like medical professionals and nursing home residents, it will be very important to know what's going to happen with what could be a very large portion of the public, especially if the logistical rollout gets flubbed and people aren't able or willing to get the second shot. I judge it highly likely that this will comprise a good percentage of the populace given the general lack of federal planning or guidance throughout this crisis."
2020-12-15 18:40:56,"People are excited about phase1, the first shot of the vaccine. But I am more focused on phase 2- when people receive the second dose in about three weeks.  That is when, in many cases,  the very intense side effects kick in. And these reactogenetic effects may create even more uncertainty in an already hesitant public- 40% or so-  when it comes to getting the vaccine.  It will be interesting how the reportage of fevers of 103 or more, severe fatigue, chills, malaise (all temporary) will be addressed in the media and processed by a rather skeptical public. These experiences must be reported, but addressed honestly, intelligently, and w/o obfuscation."
2020-12-15 18:42:12,"""Because both vaccines require two doses, those contracts guaranteed enough doses for 100 million people.""...in the first quarter of 2021. 

My understanding is that Trump administration had the opportunity to access over 100 million more doses in this early period, but our President was cleverly bargaining for a better ""deal"" Has anyone estimated how many more American will have died as a result of our President's shrewd negotiation skills?"
2020-12-15 18:57:18,"To piggy back on a point before- on side effects and the need to prepare the public for a difficult second dose. With the Moderna (MRNA) vaccine, almost 1 in 5 people under 65 had  grade 3 or 4 adverse event after vaccine.  Fevers stand out- 1.6% of people under 65 had fevers over 102 after the second dose, and about 1 in 1000 had fevers over 104. We will need to prepare the public for this event, because once the media starts reporting these issues, many citizens who are 'on the fence' presently will refuse the vaccine."
2020-12-15 19:13:13,"Even Fauci said today that the antibodies Trump has from being naturally infected with COVID-19 may not last- so how long will the antibodies, and the memory sub-system of our immune systems, protect us against infection after they’ve been mobilized by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines? That’s the $64,000 question!"
2020-12-15 19:33:56,"Perhaps an important point for all of us is at what point of the vaccination did the severe cases develop? If the volunteers developed covid before the body could start producing antibodies after the first shot, then obviously it hardly reflects badly on the vaccine. Everyone getting the shot, needs to be clearly told to protect themselves zealously from covid after receiving the first dose for at least two weeks. You need to give your body a chance to produce antibodies. Also does this jump starting the immune system by the vaccine result in a shortage of cofactors in the body? If so maybe everyone taking extra doses of vitamin C, D and Bcomplex throughout the vaccination period at least, might help the whole operation succeed even better."
2020-12-15 19:43:53,"I would so much prefer that the Pfizer version be given to the rural populations. The Moderna version, while easier to store, is the one that causes headaches and fever. The rural, Black and Indigenous populations are already hesitant to take the vaccine, because history. If these communities see their neighbors experiencing unpleasant side effects post injection, we will have a much harder time vaccinating everyone. Even with the cold storage logistics Pfizer would be a better option."
2020-12-15 18:32:48,"And this will all be ruined by the planned public inauguration. Some group of people have convinced Biden and his team that the nation needs the traditional inauguration spectacle.  They are flat out WRONG!  For God's sake, we need responsible leadership and example.  Recommending against crowding and encouraging mask wearing are grossly inadequate.  
Please, who ever can get their attention, lobby Biden for a private broadcast inauguration and NO parade.  Remind him of FDR's inauguration during WWII.  
For all who are still ignorant, ANY transmission endangers us all. No, it will not be limited to those opting out, or to Trump supporters. There are now videos available online where you can experience how horrible it is to die from this virus. Even one life is not worth ANY public gathering. No, it can not be controlled.  Please stop it."

And fast-tracked to licensure in only 7-months!  (Whereas non-experimental vaccines require 10 - 15 years, due to safety testing).

Efficacy and safety data was ""approved""/i.e. rubber-stamped by the FDA (a private-public partnership 45% funded by Pharma - aka ""captured"").   

Additionally, the FDA is staffed by Pharma via the revolving door.

The vaccine industry is booming with profit the driving factor.  Pharma will make $14,000,000,000 from the pandemic vaccine.  This is because vaccine patents do not expire like drugs do.  Also - no risk! - vaccine makers  enjoy absolute immunity against lawsuits.

What could possibly happen?

Merck’s HPV vaccine Gardasil, promoted by Dr. Julie Gerberding (former CDC Director from 2002 to 2009), was fast-tracked to licensure in 2006.  The U.K. recently reported a 54% rise in cervical cancer among 24- to 29-year-olds, the first generation to receive Gardasil. (Merck jiggered the safety data like you would not believe).

Dr. Julie left the CDC to become president of Merck’s vaccine division.  In January, 2020 she sold half her Merck stock options for $9.11 million.  

94.1% effective!  And developed in 7-months!  Isn't it strange that no one questions anything?  Excuse me for mentioning it but often if it sounds too good  to be true - it is not true.

Why did Pfizer and Moderna execs cash their stock out the day after their big announcement?  And not hold on to really make a killing?"
2020-12-15 18:41:23,"Thank you, Dolly Parton, for your one million dollar seed money to Vanderbilt medical researchers developing this vaccine."
2020-12-15 17:54:58,"Trump's deserves no ""extra credit"" for providing the financial support for Covid-19 vaccine development. Any  normal hiuman being, elected POTUS, would have done so, in a heart beat. Not for credit...but to save American lives.

Now let's forget Trump and let Biden run the show. I'm sure he'll use his executive powers to expedite manufacturing and distribution of the vaccines beyond what we've seen in the last few days. Trump's movtivation is purely selfish. Biden? Empathetic, humanitarian, and selfless.  It's time to get back to business and make America safe again."

This is HUGE, and the scientists behind the vaccine need to be congratulated. America remains at the forefront of technology! 

It is possible that the dosages of the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines tested are on the high side, and over time we can test smaller booster (second) shots. 

In the meantime, we need to make concerted efforts to increase production and ensure that the US has adequate dibs on the doses. Trump needs to ensure that Pfizer and Moderna have adequate supply of ingredients, which is coming across as an issue."

But I had a reaction that J&J cautions - general malaise, body ache and a sore arm - in my case, it lasted 48 hours.

I will know for sure when they do a blood check in 3 weeks - for antibodies.

If yes, I may pass up on Pfizer or Moderna.  If not, for sure.

2020-12-15 19:55:02,In December 3rd I read the extraordinary article about Elmhurst Hospital published by The New York Times. I would love a follow-up article that explains how Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Nassau County was able to secure the first doses ahead of a public hospital that (by all accounts) was The Epicenter of the pandemic in The United States.
2020-12-15 21:29:50,"I spent my entire work-life in healthcare and am now retired. The first three years were in public health. The inefficiencies were staggering in the public relative to the private sector. Our first President to spend his entire life in the private sector, first schooled at Wharton, with no experience as a political or military leader was well prepared for Operation Warp Speed. His  leadership (advance payment with Pfizer and full interplay with Moderna) are bringing us two revolutionary vaccines in record time. I don't think I say that with a bias, as, I did not vote for him in November."
2020-12-15 21:30:47,"It’s very important that famous people get the vaccine first. In a very real way they will act as examples that everyone else can follow in social media, other Americans can monitor them , they will see that nothing adverse has happened to them. Like anything else in life we need to be reassured, especially with anything new. I remember when the first iPhone came out, I asked a girlfriend if she was going to get one, “not yet,” she said ,” I will wait about 6 months just to be sure , you never know with brand new things, maybe they will, find out it makes you sick in some way.” ,That was with an iPhone, and there are lots of people, out there just like that, suspicious and fearfull of anything new, and there are some people who never take a flu shot because they are afraid it will do something to them. At the least the president and the incoming president and their staffs should take it, followed by people with lots of followers on social media, people like Lebron James or Oprah Winfrey. Believe me it would make a big difference going forward."
2020-12-15 21:43:24,"I'm not giving up on the Astra Zeneca-Oxford vaccine. Yes, it's had its testing stumbles, but the results showed three promising features: just one dose provided 90% protection; there is promising data indicating that it actually prevents virus spread, and last, that it can be transported and stored at regular refrigerator temperatures, meaning it will be less costly to manufacture and distribute globally.

Kudos for Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna for their tremendous achievements. There is and will be room for more vaccines."
2020-12-15 21:48:06,"What scares me most is not any side effects of a vaccine, but rather that people won't take them. RNA viruses mutate quickly, and if we don't achieve heard immunity, will SARS-COV-2 have a chance to mutate so it spreads with a different spike protein, or without one? And in that case, will future vaccines be as effective as the ones we have right now? The thing that really scares me is that people credulously accept things they hear on social media, while applying excessive skepticism to the work of scientists, doctors, and other experts."
2020-12-15 21:54:56,"I have one trick I use when I read the comments section after some bit of good news about the coronavirus vaccine is printed, maybe these tricks  will help you. I enjoy reading the comments from happy , hopeful people , it’s kind of uplifting, but at the same time  I realize , that 60 percent of the comments will be negative , and ten percent will assure you nothing will ever work against the coronavirus, I learned all this the hard way, through hard won experience. Here is what I do: I read the first sentence, it will not take you long to see which way the comment is going, sometimes the persons name will clue you in, a real name has a good chance of being positive, some made up thing will just about always be negative , an example would be King Duck, or something like that it could even be a foreign agent trying to undermine morale. The only time I will  read something negative is it is from an accredited doctor, professor or scientist with a real name. If I read the first sentence and it’s hopeful ,or grateful, stuff like that I continue reading, if it’s negative I stop reading and move on. I have learned that a lot of people on social media are negative and want to make other people just as negative, those people need a therapist more than they need a message board. They are the same exact people who seriously believe we never actually landed on the moon and Elvis is still alive."

For starters, we need to clean up the food chain of animals we eat and stop building these mega meat-farming factories as incubators of novel viruses.   Everyone knows these places are viral breeding grounds, but as a rule, humanity has not done much in the way of sanitation and protection of safe living environment for these animals.  Instead, we've injected our food supply with chemicals and vaccinations to ward off the worst diseases and hoped for the best.  Well, you can now see that the result of this is going to be 500,000 people dead in the United States.

In particular, that there is no claim that they protect against coronavirus infection, only against any infection that might occur developing into actual disease.

I had been advised by Pardee Hospital UNC System CEO administrator 7 days ago it was going to health department. 

I couldn’t get in the door of the health department so waited for someone to roll out. 

Nice receptionist stated,”nope, not here.” I queried her: “ is there a list?” “Nope. There’s no names on it.”

With so much knowledge about immunology and vaccine history knowledge, why aren’t these companies talking about longevity of vaccine effectiveness. It’s been more than 6 months since these companies carried out their phase 1 inoculations. Why is there no data on how these folks are doing in terms of their antibodies and other cells that remember antigens ?

Why I’m stressing this point is that, say if these vaccines are 3-4 months effective, it only makes sense only if the whole country is vaccinated at once."
2020-12-15 15:26:10,I hope Biden buys those extra does of the Pfizer vaccine that Trump would not buy. The Moderna vaccine has a notable advantage over Pfizer. The Pfizer vaccine needs minus 70 degrees Celsius while the Moderna vaccine needs only minus 20 degrees Celsius. The Sacramento metropolitan area has 2.5 million people. We have two facilities that can provide the temperatures that the Pfizer vaccines needs. One is a University teaching hospital and the other had to be built. Most US healthcare providers already have what they need to support the Moderna vaccine. That is a huge advantage.
2020-12-15 15:14:10,While I applaud the work that has gone into this effort and will get vaccinated as soon as may be possible I remain concerned about two things. One is the effect that the portion of the population that will refuse to get the vaccine will have on the rest of us in the short term and the other is the possibility that we can become infected and shed viruses regardless of the effects on those of us that have been vaccinated. Oh and the likelihood of viral mutation on the effectiveness of the vaccine. I had my flue shot recently because for one the flue virus mutates. Will this vaccine have to be part of our yearly heath care and if so how will it be paid for going forward? The current success are something to be grateful for but complacency has undone success before. This isn't our first pandemic after all.
2020-12-15 14:46:50,"Two companies using similar vaccine types have come up with an effective vaccine within a year.  This is a herculean effort and an incredible achievement.  Those hard working scientists deserve a break, though they probably won't rest until this is over.  We owe them a great debt.

On the political side, one used money from Trump's Operation Warp Speed and the other did not.  So I wonder if the people who are anti-science will go for one, while those that are anti-Trump go for the other.  It will be interesting to see."

2020-12-15 19:45:12,"I was 8 years old when the good news of the polio vaccine was announced over the radio. My mother, a nurse, and I were standing in our family's tiny kitchen in Berkeley, California. Suddenly, she started jumping up and down, laughing and crying at the same time and thanking God. Her reaction startled me. Then, tears streaming down her face, she explained that we didn't have to worry about polio anymore. Children wouldn't have to die or suffer in ""iron lung"" machines, and we could go to the community swimming pool again. I no longer am able to jump up and down now, but as a retired nurse practitioner myself, as I watched the vaccinations going out to our brave health care providers, I truly understood how my mother felt on that rainy day back in the 50's."

2020-12-15 18:32:52,"As the first COVID vaccines were administered yesterday I felt a mix of joy, hope, and profound grief. I never thought I would cry watching someone receive a vaccine.

2020-12-15 22:18:58,"Sorry, this comment is not directly related to the article, but I'd like to express my displeasure at Dr. Fauci's suggestion that Biden, Harris, Trump, and Pence receive the vaccine before others waiting in line. Our leaders should be setting an example, and jumping the line is NOT a good example to be setting right now. Further, Trump has already had covid so his vaccination should not be a priority on medical grounds.

Dr. Fauci has said many times that he is qualified to give only medical and public health opinions, and not qualified to comments on matters of policy. Yet, his suggestion is based on 'national security' concerns. Dr. Fauci is not an expert in national security. Biden has done an excellent job communicating with people via Zoom, and this sets a good example how people should behave during the pandemic.

I have nothing against Dr. Fauci but his opinions carry weight. The doctor earned my mistrust when he intentionally mislead the nation on the use of face masks. He has admitted that he lied in the belief that he had a moral obligation to protect the supply of face masks for medical workers. I really don't want government workers lying to me for my own good, no matter how well-intentioned."
2020-12-16 06:11:59,"We are being given much more information about these vaccines than we ever were about flu vaccines—we were simply told we should get a flu shot every year. For those who find the data and descriptions of side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine scary and are afraid to be vaccinated, they would do well to keep in mind that if they had paid attention to statistics about flu vaccines, they might not have wanted to get those either.

Flu vaccines are targeted at a broad range of flu strains and unable to focus specifically on whatever strain might emerge in any given flu season; typically, flu shots were expected to be only about 45 to 57 percent effective.

The corona virus vaccines have one mission: to immunize those who have the shots against Covid-19. The efficacy range is 86.4 to 94.1, which is spectacularly better than a flu shot.

We are incredibly lucky to have an opportunity to stem the tide of sickness and death that is threatening to overwhelm the entire country, but the coronavirus vaccines will have no chance to stop the pandemic unless everyone gets the shots as soon as they are eligible to get them."
2020-12-16 06:28:00,"Thank you president trump. If you recall the liberal networks with their medical experts including this publication dismissed Trump’s claim a vaccine by the end of this year. They need to apologize to him and congratulate him for a great job in his warp speed program. 
I recall when I lived in NYC back in the ‘80’s the city would not repair the Central Park ice rink because it was too far gone. Trump with his own money repaired the rink which is still being used today."
2020-12-16 06:46:10,"Do the shot-givers tell patients which vaccine they'll get?

They should, if they don't.

There's not a great deal of difference between the Pfizer vaccine (95.7% efficacy) and the Moderna vaccine (94.5%), but efficacy drops rapidly after those two. The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, for example, is only 62% effective, and the FDA has said it will approve any vaccine that's over 50%.

I'd sure want to know whether I'd received a 95.7% vaccine or a 62% vaccine, and I doubt I'd even bother getting a 62% vaccine. Patients should be told (and AstraZeneca better get used to the idea that nobody's going to want its vaccine)."
2020-12-16 13:08:09,"There should be no confusion or misunderstanding about vaccines.  Vaccination is a very important part of public health and Vaccines prevent the spread of contagious, dangerous and deadly diseases like measles, polio, mumps, chicken pox, whooping cough, diphtheria to name some. It is unrealistic to expect any treatment to be free of side effects. Covid -19 can be no exception. All pharmaceutical products have inherent risks, and their use involves trade-offs between their therapeutic benefits and their risks. .COVID-19 vaccines according to preliminary reports appear to be 94 to 95% effective. The results as on date are impressive.  Most vaccines take decades to develop, but the vaccines for Coronavirus is likely to move from conception to large-scale implementation within a year, in itself a remarkable achievement. More vaccines are in the pipeline and should soon be available after the regulatory authorities clear them. Efficacy is not the same as safety and the regulatory authorities are rightfully cautious. The manufacturers have advised medical professionals to monitor allergic reaction to the vaccine as of now and this caution is in line with other vaccines as well. Hopefully these efforts by many countries will stop the pandemic and instill confidence to resume their normal life. The logistic challenges of manufacturing, delivering and post use monitoring of vaccine remains daunting."

So it is likely that a very vast majority of cases have gone unreported due to either no test or on reliance on the poor quality Rapid Antigen Test which have a very low accuracy.
As regards death rate that too is vastly under reported since most deaths are either not certified or wrongly classified.

This is the crux of problem. You can't live in India and not think of caste. Near 100% of the decision makers are from upper castes who comprise 10-15% of the population. Even if they are selected on merit, which I seriously doubt, cannot substitute the experience of lower caste background.

India has likely done better than the rest of the world, despite inept handling by its government and lack of infrastructure for health, because it has one of the youngest populations in the world.  Nearly half of its 1.3 billion people are under the age of 25.

The humanitarian crisis is heart-wrenching; personal accounts in this story make the reader feel the real toll of Covid in India, rather than see it in the abstract from the point of view of privileged white-collar workers living in their well-appointed houses/apartments and working safely from there.  I do not doubt that the Modi government had good intentions and was dealing with an unprecedented crisis.  But it is also a fact that the same Mr. Modi has been an advocate of upper-caste Hindus in urban areas.  None of the villagers in this story are from that preferred group of Mr. Modi's party.

Once the pathetic, cruel lockdown was imposed and migrants were forced to suffer hunger, misery and death by Modi, the  poor hungry revolted,  and Modi and Amith Shah had no choice but to unlock and arrange death trains, or what you call virus trains.

2020-12-15 22:57:50,"Dear NYT.

Isn't it a bit late talking about what happened in March, now in December? Why not talk about what's happening in December in December itself rather than later in September?

Since 20 days now, India is seeing the largest protest movement of the world in decades, if not through all time. About a million farmers from Punjab, Haryana and other parts of India have descended upon Delhi to fight 3 new farm bills being thrust down their throats. Another 250 million people are supporting the protest from their homes. Thousands of others are even supporting the protest from dozens of other countries on 4 different continents. 

A million people have made the streets and highways their home in the bitter Delhi cold, and this is the first credible threat to the Modi government in almost seven years. Dear NYT, how do you keep your international claim by not caring to inform your readers about this? History is being made and you are unable to see what is going on?"

Are you suggesting no lockdown or are you suggesting keeping people forcefully inside their shacks like they did in Wuhan or are you suggesting let the migrant workers continue to walk hundreds of miles but don’t provide them trains.

Yes, India is fortunate to have young population which helped stave off a lot of deaths, and maybe the populace has better immune system due to being exposed to a lot of pathogens from the get go, but you have to acknowledge the government’s response too which has helped.

Call me cynic but it seems like western countries find it hard that they are at the receiving ends of covid but not poor countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh."

I'm so very sorry for how this contagion has spread throughout the continent. May God bless India."
2020-12-16 00:57:05,"There is no doubt that Modi’s lockdown seems badly planned, and hasty. But the fact is that any other option back then was as bad. If he had given people 10 days to head home before the lockdowns, Covid would have spread in March - with even less opportunity for local authorities in backward places like Ganjam to prepare to quarantine or treat anyone. 

India lacks medical facilities - and slowing down the transmission of Covid was critical to enable Local Governments to create quarantine facilities. In Mumbai, the Municipal Corporation created massive Covid care facilities in sports stadia - and these helped treat the vast majority of cases over time. The fact is that Covid has been curbed so far in most of India - with a peak that was far lower than in most Democracies, and death rates that are very low as well. While most deaths in India are not medically certified, if there were a spike in deaths anywhere in India, you can bet that it would have been picked up by the media. 

Further your article reeks of bias. How does the caste or gender composition of a task force of experts matter? Challenge the qualifications or the willingness to disagree with the Powers that Be of the task force members if you will, not their gender, religion or caste. Terrible journalism."

There were huge covid-19 outbreak in the dorms and Singapore did not send the migrants home. They isolated the dorms and gave everyone there the best treatment regardless of race and ethnicity. This includes putting a migrant worker from India on ECMO for 60 days. The virus did not spread widely to the general population. Only 29 total deaths out of 58000 cases. The low fatalities rate is due to the young age of the migrant workers. Modi did not have to do this, he should have a stay in place order with treatment at the hospitals.

It is unclear what is the point of bringing caste/religion into this article. Modi (who is the most powerful leader in India since Indira Gandhi and his abuse of power is the real issue) is from a backward community and grew up running a tea stall. The number 2 guy (Amit Shah) grew up as a Jain. 

As a point of comparison, my country (USA) is one of the worst examples in terms of its response to Covid inspite of its enormous wealth. Case rates are spiking all over the country. And its not just Trump. California with Gavin Newsom has messed up (and Newsom himself violated his own rules).

There has not been a single piece written commending the Indian people on their remarkable response to a pandemic that has ravaged the health systems of the world’s most advanced; “wealthy” nations. 

The fact that India only experienced a single peak, and managed to have fewer cases than the United States, whilst having over 3x the population is nothing short of remarkable. 

Some may claim that India’s relatively low case numbers are a consequence of a lack of proportional testing, but here’s the issue with that: if the case numbers were significantly higher than the number of tests being conducted, we would NOT seen the flattening of the curve, the curve would have been upward for  months. 

Sure some things could have been done better, but all things considered, India is a model for not only developing nations, but all nations likewise.

2020-12-16 02:01:14,"When the news about the coronavirus outbreak in China appeared in January, declaring that there was easy human-to-human transmission, one of my first thoughts was to India.

India is one-third the size of the U.S., yet has four times as many people. The degree of widespread poverty and lack of public sanitation is incomprehensible to most Americans. Even in normal times, hospital services are distributed to crushing lines with long waits - sometimes two days.

It was obvious back in January that, short of a miracle, the virus would spread like wildfire. Yet, in the four months up to the lock down in May, what did the government leaders do to prepare to fight the disease? Did they distribute masks, did they educate people, doctors, government officials?

There is wealth in India, but it is hoarded by the people at the top who live in extreme luxury behind walls protected by armed guards. What did this elite do to help their migrant countrymen? Don't tell me there is no caste in India, that this is not part of the decision making. You can see it everywhere, and in the way government officials treat people.

The saddest part of this pathetic story is that the average Indian still blames England for all of their country's problems -- 73 years after independence. And now Modi is fanning the flames of hatred toward Muslims to disguise his government's failings. 

My thoughts and best wishes are with the people of India.

The Times keep pointing at the ""disastrous lockdown"" without mentioning what alternative steps Modi could have taken. 

India is now back to business with the daily virus caseload steadily decreasing. Densely packed cities like Delhi, Mumbai are not witnessing 2nd wave that was widely expected.

Please understand that ""upper-caste men"" also are amongst Shramik and among people who are trying night and day to implement policies to safeguard the public's interest. One should go by their merit and credentials. If there's a problem there, then that is to be reported never mind which caste or gender they belong. If anything this pandemic has bought people out as they helped each other in whatever way they could even in such economic state forgetting to which caste and gender one belonged.  We as Indians, have all seen first hand how things have gone, and yet we are trying to make things right as the pandemic continues.

What will be the result?

Wealthier Indians could be reluctant to have close contact with poor Indians, for fear of being infected. This could be in stores, factories, schools, transportation, etc. In short, this could create a 21st century caste system.

Perhaps it was this fear of disease, without knowing how infections were transmitted, that led to the caste system in the first place. All people knew was that when they had close contact with the poor they risked getting sick. So some became untouchables.

Even in the best of circumstances the poor have limited access to clean water to bathe and wash clothes in. During the months of monsoon rains people live in near 100 percent humidity and heat, leading to mold and mildew. It can also increase the risk of staph infections, which can be transmitted by direct body-to-body contact (touching) in cramped transportation, or simply sitting on a seat after it was used by someone infected.

I have observed poor and migrant workers doing their best to remain clean. It is not their fault.

But when the poor get sick, even the rich can die, too."
2020-12-16 03:05:01,"I will show by some simple math that the number of Covid deaths in India is tremendously higher than reported. Please read patiently. Three personal acquaintances of mine died of Covid in India. Almost all of my Indian friends and relatives know multiple people in their immediate circle who have died of Covid. Ask any Indian you know -- they will say that they know someone who has died of Covid. In the United States, on the other hand, I personally don't know anyone who has died of Covid, in spite of living here for 18 years now. I've asked some of my American friends -- they don't have anyone in the immediate circle of acquaintances who have died of Covid. That's not surprising, because in the US, around 1 in 1200 people have died of Covid this year, and most of us do not have 1200 people in our immediate circle -- so most people in the US wouldn't have anyone in their immediate circle who has died of Covid. The fact that most Indians seem to personally know someone who has died of Covid implies, by simple math, that the number of Covid deaths in India is much, much higher than reported -- I won't be surprised if it's 10 or even 20 times higher. This will eventually come out in the open, when people compare the total number of cremations and burials in Indian in 2020 versus 2019."
2020-12-16 02:49:24,"""Many experts have criticized Mr. Modi’s government for overlooking the plight of migrant laborers, ""
     But the lockdown was necessary though not handled properly.  The scientists (in India) suggest that without the lockdown in late March, the number of active cases in India would have peaked at more than 14 million and that more than 2.6 million people would have died from Covid-19, some 23 times the current death toll.
   Interestingly, based on studies in the two states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the scientists concluded that the impact of the unchecked return of out-of-work migrants from the cities to the villages after the lockdown had a ""minimal"" impact on case numbers.
 ""The peak would have arrived by June. This would have resulted in overwhelming our hospitals and caused widespread panic. The lockdown did help in flattening the curve,"" Mathukumalli Vidyasagar, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, and also a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.

2020-12-16 04:07:27,"I am in India right now. Yes, the curfew decision was a shock but that is what other countries around the world were also doing at the time. In hindsight, I am confident that no one in the policy-making echelons thought about the direct effect on the migrant labor population, and NO, not because of any caste bias, but rather the major disconnect between the haves and the have nots. For most Indians living in cities, it is quite normal to have at least 4 servants - A Driver, A Cook, A Cleaning Lady, and a Maid. Even more for those that own homes versus apartment living. 

So when you take this into account, it becomes clear, why no one thought about what would happen to these people. 

The government did in fact institute an emergency ration system, whereby each family was given a food packet with some 5 kgs of rice or wheat, 1 kg pulses, and cooking oil, tea, and some condiments. That only happened after a lot of noise was made about the poor going hungry. 

Now if that had been published in advance at the same time as the imposition of the curfew, no migrant would have wanted to leave the city and head home to their village. For a simple reason, opportunities for earning enough for food are abysmal in the villages. They need to live in the cities to make enough to feed their families back home, and the lockdown would have ended sooner or later.

In short, I blame the government for not issuing the food rations earlier and on a more predictive note, each week."
2020-12-16 05:43:52,"This article described aspects of the effects of COVID 19
on specific families, like the Behara’s, the homeward migration of  migrant workers on Shramika trains and how parts of the country were adversely affected. National, state and local policies were described; successful, ineffective and dubious as the case may be. I leave it to those whose comments burn with self righteousness, indignation, and swagger who decided they know the truth, know who and what is right. The article details human suffering in pure and simple form. Perhaps more in depth consideration of what could have been done better, what could be done better now to keep people well would be a better use of our human capacity to solve problems and support the well being of everyone involved. Arguing among ourselves, denigrating journalists telling a very specific story, who are trying to decipher the complexities of the situation on the ground seems like a refusal to consider some mistakes were likely made despite good intentions and politicians do make political decisions. 
We are all human, imperfect in thought and deed. I care more about those who died from the virus, those they left behind and what happens next than supporting or vilifying a particular person or party.
India is awe inspiring and like all of us, a work in progress. Can we reach out with our collective will, our humanity for Prafulla Behera, his family, all the souls lost at this tragic time to transform our rage into kindness and wisdom."
2020-12-16 05:17:10,"The lockdown decision by Modi government was undoubtedly not thought out completely. but that just fits into their pattern. Demonetization, the GST, Kashmir statehood demotion. the list goes on and on. 
But sometimes it's better to have a plan and execute on it than forever remain analyzing. unfortunately we will never know what could have been. but looking at the experiences I other much more advanced countries, I feel that India has fared reasonably well in the covid crisis regardless of the suspect data from India."
2020-12-16 05:10:17,What a tragic mess. But then massive poverty almost never plays out any differently. Always seems to be just a matter of time and the right match.
2020-12-16 06:37:54,"I think the government in India did a poor job handling the virus. They had the most cases in the world besides the US and they were not ready for it. The government didn't even enforce social distancing and it was completely non-existent. People were crammed into cars for journeys that took days, and trains would board and drop off passengers in regions that had very few cases. It's surprising to read that the administration were aware when they were moving people from urban hot spots to rural areas. They just said it was managed ""quite well"". instead of shutting down the economy to prevent so many deaths they didn't even enforce any laws such as social distancing. it's sad to see how poorly the government handled the virus and the amount of people who had to suffer from this."
2020-12-16 03:47:03,"""An hour later, he was dead. A subsequent test revealed that Prafulla Behera was Ganjam’s first coronavirus death.""

2020-12-16 09:43:04,"Against the terrible costs, the lost lives, the heartache, the suffering--the people in these communities largely pulled together to take care of each other. America could learn a lot from their shining example."
2020-12-16 08:12:30,"To be honest, in hindsight everyone is a genius. The choice the government in India was between piles of dead bodies and economic collapse. Not sure which was a more immoral choice to make. For perspective , even the darling of the world NZ went into total lockdown to curb the pandemic. And Europe was already in a lockdown before India. In the end, the poor would've suffered regardless of what any government did - implying that the key to human prosperity and end of human suffering is economic progress."
2020-12-16 08:38:15,There is a good reason why Modi is sometimes referred to as an Indian Trump. He has repeatedly shown himself to be more of a showman than a leader who can execute on solutions and solve problems. He has fired competent people from the government because they dared to disagree with him on policies such as demonization. What we are now left with is a government that could have done much much better at handling the pandemic and preventing scores of death. I believe India is the only major economy to have gone into recession.
2020-12-16 07:41:52,"Enjoyed the article but I do think it is misleading to say ""India has now reported more coronavirus cases than any country besides the United States."" Whilst this is true, India also has such a big population that quoting total cases is pointless. You see this all over the media. We should only ever use the cases RATE per million people..... but then doing so doesn't make things sound as awful. In reality, India is nowhere near the top quartile of countries worst affected but yet all people will see is 'second only to the US in total number'. There are 1.35Billion people!"
2020-12-16 09:45:57,"The Modi administration is oblivious to the plight of the poor. Instead, its focus is on religious fanaticism in all forms. One of the worst governments of independent India that is dividing the country for its own political ends. I have been spending few months here and I can see the focus on religion is immense compared to 30 years ago when anyone really talked about Gods or godmen. 
People are getting arrested for marrying a person from another religion. The country is on a reverse gear culturally and intellectually. It wont be long before the economy also tanks."
2020-12-16 09:26:22,"“India has now reported more coronavirus cases than any country besides the United States.”

If a Martian landed today on earth, look at the statistics, the logical conclusion would be the US must be a less developed country than India. We all know this to be untrue. 

India did what it had to do. Second guess all you want. I’m just looking forward to reading the summary of what really happened in the US. Unvarnished and untainted by politics."
2020-12-16 05:44:12,"What the article does not mention is that 2 to 3 weeks into the pandemic, the migrant workers demanded going back to their villages they had started walking back long distances on foot. You cannot indefinitely keep a an unwilling population in a place, they want to flee. 

How many New Yorkers went to Florida, Upstate NY, Hamptons and hometowns across America spreading the disease there and what do locals in these small towns have to say?"
2020-12-16 03:19:04,"Surat provides livelihood to multitude of poor people from all over India. In March when there was a lock down, many employers in Surat either closed or reduced workforce. That forced all the migrant workers to return home on foot since no buses or trains were running. If you had seen photos of migrants desperate for food and water on the roads you would appreciate any help to transport them safely home. The special trains offered were too late. But it was better than walking 100's or 1000's of miles hungry. So I hope you have some perspective on the special trains."
2020-12-16 04:58:15,"The article ignores the fact that Modi government's initial recommendation was for migrant workers to stay put. These workers were to be provided with ration and supplies by the respective States. A lockdown was mandated, hoping that a strict lockdown would curb the spread. Instead of supporting this lockdown, regional political rivals spread disinformation, did not maintain the law and order, did not provide the necessary ration and supplies, and forced migrants to flee across state borders. It was only after millions of these migrants took to walking back thousands of miles back home, that Modi government relented and offered the Shramik Express. It was well known, and argued over and again, that these migrants will take coronavirus back from the metropolitan cities to remote villages, where it certainly did not exist then. It was an attempt to disrupt the economy, for long term political gains. A no brainer, really! 

Easy to blame, especially if you're willing to conveniently ignore the facts and sequence of events. I am equally appalled at the reference of ""upper caste hindu"" making decisions for the laborers. That could be said about pretty much any decision made by the central government, because majority of bureaucrats in India are from upper castes; similar to saying decisions for Blacks and Hispanic in USA are made by white men (which may be factually true because most of Trump's cabinet is white!). Seems like a cheap attempt to malign India's image."
2020-12-16 07:40:03,"This article clearly shows the biases writers have.  Throughout the lockdown, yes I have been living here for past one year, there was nothing about caste system that would decide how the lockdown should or shouldn’t be.  Of course you can find holes in decisions that were taken, but which country other than maybe New Zealand or Taiwan got it right.  US is a big mess including red states like Dakotas or blue states like California, so not just about Trump or the holier than thou Governor Newsom who thinks that rules don’t apply to him.

But here we go, all this article could talk about was caste without one evidence of caste based issue when it came to covid. Identity politics at its best!"
2020-12-16 10:27:35,"Modi and his henchmen are the main culprits for the spread of the virus in rural India.   They cared two hoots for the public health issues till this date.   Modi is busy in helping his corporate masters Ambani and Adani by bringing various newlaws and policies and the apex court of the country is looking at the other side, giving Modi a blanket reprieve in all cases of national importance either rejecting the petitions or delaying substantially by postponing the hearings time and again.  GOD help India and its poor."
2020-12-16 04:19:29,"This government has careened from one policy disaster to the next- monetary (abrupt demonetisation), military (sabre-rattling then quietly ceding), social (CAA+NRC), public health (lockdown without welfare), agricultural (viz. the current troubles).  What keeps it in power is a divisive knack for grandstanding and diverting attention in a way that takes advantage of an electorate wilfully under-educated for critical thinking.  As always, those who suffer disproportionately are those who have nearly nothing to begin with.  But the arc of history is long, India's people are champions of making do in difficult conditions, and I retain a faith that the world's largest democracy, though disturbed from its axis, will right itself.  Jai hind."

2020-12-16 15:06:20,"Well, the last time I checked we (in US) lost more than 300,000 people, it is almost one whole percentage of US population.  Even though there were adequate measures taken by some of the sensible governments for a First World country this is unacceptable.  While the author compares India's active Carona Virus status to US, he is not recognizing the death rate.  India is no where close to US in Carona virus death.  Most of the metropolitan cities are heavily populated in India.  It is an average of 172 people per Sq. Mile comparing to 13 people per Sq. Mile in US.  

Modi government or Congress government, this is a huge Pandemic and they are doing the best.  One who is fanning the flames are local politicians to stay in power just like the politicians here."

It describes an impossible situation, made worse by over-population: 4 times the US population in 1/3 the land area, resulting in a population density 12 times that of the US.  Tragically, like guns in the US, population control is a suicide zone for Indian politics.  There is deafening silence from all parties, particularly after the ca. 1970s Emergency imposed by Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the forcible birth control measures taken then and her electoral defeat.  The demographic disaster which plays out daily in every Indian's life is spun, cheap chamber of commerce happytalk style, as a demographic ""dividend""."
2020-12-16 16:22:48,"I think it is unfair to write, “India has now reported more coronavirus cases than any country besides the United States,” without providing per capita data because India has 1.3 billion people compared to 328 million in the U.S.

According to data reported by NYT, only 1 in 136 Indians had Covid, compared to 1 in 20 in the U.S.  Only 1 in 9,387 died in India compared to 1 in 1,092 in the U.S. Germany, reported 1 in 60 had Covid and 1 in 3,540 died. Canada reported 1 in 78 had the disease and 1 in 2,713 died. Total cases reported in India 9.9 million compared to 16.8 million in U.S. Recent trends have been low and high in the U.S."

2020-12-16 08:54:39,"When the urge to peddle a narrative trumps facts on grounds, a reportage becomes an opinion piece, That unfortunately has been the state of nearly all the coverage that Times has about India, starting from its offensive racist cartoon about India's space launches. This piece continues with that hallowed tradition. 
Here there was a wonderful opportunity for a sympathetic understanding of the complexities faced by a billion plus country trying its best to handle an epidemic that has decimated several countries including US. But it was marred by completely irrelevant diversions into castes, speculations, slanders and cheery picked anecdotes that would further only the preconceived narration.
And the most risible part was its focus on the caste composition of the expert committee. Maybe the Times should start sharing the race, gender and caste composition of its team at the beginning  of every article so that readers could evaluate the validity of their reportage.
My family is in India and they are more worried about us here in US than themselves. India has largely escaped the deadlier second and third waves of Covid while in California we just had another record of 42K cases. And yes, that's after mandatory masks and lockdowns. So, India has gotten something right, amidst all the trial and errors. And it'd have been more useful to the readers and the policy makers, if the focus was that. But that'd obviously not fit the narrative of a poor misgoverned Hindu Nationalist India."
2020-12-16 07:35:52,"While the article here does brilliant job explaining COVID-19 spread in india.

But I will disagree with the statment that Indian government coronavirus taskforce consisted of only 'upper caste Hindus' , if authors of this piece did their due diligence in functioning of Indian government, they would got to know the fact that indian government machinery especially the upper echelons of bureaucracy is hired in such a way to represent caste dynamics of Indian society, the seats for oppressed castes are firmly reserved.

The apathy from government was not a caste matter, rather it was a class issue, there's been a growing disconnect between top brass of decision making bodies with actual ground realities."
2020-12-15 20:01:56,"I am disappointed by the analysis here which is laced with undue commentary about caste and religion. As a physician who has been fighting this pandemic in the US and has worked in India extensively, I have some perspective.

In a country of 1 billion that is 1/3 the size of the US, once Covid took root in India there was no controlling it. The sheer closeness of people makes controlling a pandemic there impossible. Mr. Modi should be commended that he took decisive action to allow for PPE and hospitals to prepare during the lockdown. If there had been an announcement about lockdown, there would have been panic buying, looting and a mass exodus. Not announcing it has had definite issues but probably prevented mass chaos. Unreported are that many migrants were fed and housed- albeit not in the best conditions but still addressed.

India should be commended that it has had only one spike, and is the second highest tester for COVID with >1 million tests a day. Its numbers have fallen substantially and its death rate is < 1%. Its rickety health care system, overhwhelmed in September has now caught up (all from first hand reports of doctors on the ground there). It will undoubtedly produce more COVID vaccines at a fraction of the cost and save the developing world.

This is in contrast to the US- the biggest spender on health care- with the highest number of cases, deaths and a population that thumbed their nose at even the most basic restrictions."
2020-12-15 20:11:51,"India also has a population that is larger than any country bar China and a health system which isn't no where near European or US standards and still has lower per capita infection and death rates in fact this statistic isn't unique to India but to most poor countries of Asia (including neighbours Pakistan and Bangladesh) and large parts of Africa - sometimes numbers need to be looked with a different perspective. Numbers might be under reported but even if you double them they will still look better than US/Europe. Could things have been better controlled  obviously, but harping on only the negatives does no good. May be an article on why poorer nations have a much lower per capita mortality rate will help."
2020-12-16 01:41:45,"When articles in NY times writes such an important article with such strong political overtones, like majority in government from upper castes and also out of context giving credit to an Modi opposition leader Mamta Banerjee is very disappointing.  India is 12 times denser then USA on an average, given the size and economic condition and the sudden pandemic wave, it had one of the most complex situations to grapple with. After about an year, it is fairly safe to say, India dodged the bullet. Credit goes to both the central and state governments. Do you have instances of bad decisions, yes of course? But overall there has been a well orchestrated approach to soften the blow to the poorest, steeping up the healthcare systems, adhering to science. What do i know? I am from so called upper caste and NY times maybe knows better about real india!!"

2020-12-04 20:37:06,"Throughout this scourge I have been amazed at the callous attitudes displayed by so many younger people regarding Covid infection.

Yes, I understand that young people generally consider themselves ""invincibles"".  We saw this phenomenon during the battle to pass the ACA.

Many young people thought they were either not going to catch Covid or, if they did, that it would be a mild case with only temporary ill-effects.

Throughout this I kept telling those who'd listen that we have no idea what the long term impact would be on younger victims.  Any disease that attacks a person's respiratory system can possibly result in long-term or lifetime impairments.

Now we may be beginning to see this.  I expect that in the future we will find that there are a large number of by then middle-aged adults who will have significantly respiratory impairments.  Besides negatively impacting their future lives, this will create new Covid-related financial strains on the healthcare system long after the pandemic itself is ""over"".

It will be a ""Covid echo"" that will remind at least some in the future of what has happened to so many today."
2020-12-04 20:46:40,In a way Covid19 resembles the Polio epidemic. In the 40s the general public really didn’t how it was transmitted. There were mild cases of gastrointestinal illness. There was a range of paralytic illnes from mild to lethal. Those who survived paralytic polio were often left with life-long disabilitites. I’m afraid that covid19 will do the same except many more person will be affected.

After a two month hospital stay followed by one month in rehab learning how to walk again, I still consider myself one of the lucky ones who survived.
Over 33,000 New Yorkers weren't so fortunate.
In the interim I've had to contend with constant fatigue, a failing memory, shortness of breath and hair loss.
But most challenging of all is now I have Dialysis three times a week because my kidneys gave out.
I have no doubt that as this virus continues to spread many more 'long haulers', that's what they call us, will continue to experience a whole range of after-effects which will no doubt put an additional strain on our already overburdened hospital systems.
And that's why I implore anyone who's reading this to take heed of what the health and medical experts are saying.
Practice social distancing. Wash your hands often. Wear a mask.
But most of all, say a prayer for the countless doctors, nurses and frontline workers who will take care of you if you don't. 
That's really not too much to ask."

Each are useful, but I would want to know the specifics. We have known for a number of years that even in influenza A infection, neuroinflammation can precipitate changes  in hippocampal neuronal activity and cognitive deficits. So it appears that within these long term covid effects the inflammatory processes underlying the illness are also to blame. It also appears that one of the most effective means to undue the inflammatory process  is through mitigation utilizing diet, heightening low carb foods, decreasing PUFA's, especially seed oils which are highly inflammatory, and increasing the omega 3's (not canola oil, however). Fatty fish (salmon, sardines, tuna, etc) should be consumed at least 3-5 x a week. Olive and avocado oil should replace the seed oils.  Vegans will find their own solutions utilizing flax seed as well as the other oils/foods mentioned above."
2020-12-04 21:05:56,"There is no guarantee that damage done to the body can be repaired, just as there is no guarantee that you can regain the beautiful body you had when you were 18.  These effects seem to affect a large percentage of those who become infected.

Better to just avoid the virus.  Wear a mask.  Keep 10 feet away from others."
2020-12-04 21:07:06,"Science takes time. We are encouraged by our consumerist culture to expect immediate gratification. Along comes a virus the nature of which and the effects of which may take years to completely understand. Wear a mask, wash your hands, socially distance.

Had I not been able to be tested I would have thought for sure I had had it. I think we need to stop attributing everything to COVID. Additionally, I wish the media would sometimes write an article about people who get COVID and recover with NO side effects. I personally know people ranging in age from 4 to 68 who recovered in a few weeks and have absolutely negative effects.   It would be uplifting to read about that."

2020-12-04 21:17:27,"Look into Dysautonomia/POTS, which can be brought on by viral infection. Doctors who have been brushing this aside as ""all in your head"" for years are now seeing that this is a very real and very debilitating condition that, in many instances, can't be cured. Symptoms can be treated to help lead a somewhat ""normal"" life but people won't ever be the same."
2020-12-04 21:20:11,"What you are describing here very much resembles conditions that have been affecting people for years. It goes by many names and may not even be a single condition. The current name is post viral (fatigue) syndrome, and I believe Dr Fauci has referred to it in that way. It would seem to be triggered by various viral infections. It is also similar to or the same as other conditions including, chronic fatigue syndrome, myalgic encephalomyelitis, fibromyalgia, and possibly others. It can range from completely debilitating to chronically undermining. It is not fun. It can be devastating. I've had what would seem to be a mild case of it for over 30 years, and a wonderful friend, who had a very severe case, recently died from the long term destructiveness of its effects. I can only hope that research will continue to help understand and possibly even cure these conditions."
2020-12-04 21:24:29,I got COVID 8 months ago snd still have problems thst linger . Out of nowhere a shortness of breath occurs then chills return in an independent manner. This virus puts strain on sleeping habits and will be a problem for many years. Who in their right mind would take this shot without larger tests for this virus will mutate. This shot msybe frozen parts of the virus that then prepare the body to fight the existing virus. Good idea if no mutations occur. However I think it will work in only 55% of those getting the shot not 95%

Nine months later, I still have chest pains on my left side.  They are worse at night, when I am laying down.  EKG's, blood pressure readings, and a chest X-Ray were normal. 

I suspect vascular damage due to the inflammatory response my body had (the veins in my hands were bulging when I got sick), but no tests are available.  I've gotten 2nd and 3rd opinions, with docs agreeing to take a wait-and-see approach.  Oddly (and perhaps just coincidentally), a daily glass of orange juice seems to help.  This is uncharted territory, for sure."
2020-12-04 21:35:16,"This is definitely a real syndrome ( on the spectrum of chronic fatigue syndrome/ POTS-dysautonomia. ) I hope workplaces will be reasonable about workplace accommodation for these patients...Otherwise, we’ll see a spike in long term Disability claims, which is the last thing our economy needs right now."
2020-12-04 21:45:38,"There's already a name for it. Post-viral dysautonomia. Hopefully COVID-caused dysautonomia patients won't have to wait a decade or longer to be diagnosed like many of those who already suffer with it from other viruses. 

I developed post-viral dysautonomia from Epstein-Barr virus in 2004. I was misdiagnosed/ undiagnosed until 2017 and still cannot find a doctor in my region who knows enough about it to treat it."
2020-12-04 21:58:11,"Already, some major medical journals have used the term ""long hauler"", and this is not being disrespectful to the problem.  The reports already define a very wide range of organ system problems, far more than chronic fatigue or other post-viral syndromes noted to date.  To call it ""chronic post-COVID syndrome"" might work, but it waters it down, because this is clearly a highly varied appearance and is likely related to immune dysfunction.  

Some descriptions remind me of post-Guilin-Bare symptoms or even the late post-polio syndrome, but what is reported after COVID clearly can be much worse.  I am glad that physicians seem to be taking this as a serious problem."
2020-12-04 22:02:08,"My mother contracted Covid in late July when Melbourne had its second wave. Her infection was not able to be traced to a known source. She is 72 year old, so was in a high risk category. 

Her symptoms at the time were not considered severe, especially for her age; she was extremely fatigued, had an extremely sore throat, suffered weeks of headaches and lost her sense of smell and taste completely disappeared. But thankfully it never progressed to shortness of breath and she did not need to be hospitalised.

Her symptoms dissipated after about three weeks, with the exception of one; the lack of smell and taste. She was declared recovered in mid-August. We assumed the smell and taste would return soon enough.

Four months later, it has not. At all. Everything tastes like cardboard to her and the world has no aromas. Her memory is also appreciably worse than it was pre-Covid.

Don't underestimate how serious an issue this is and will prove to be in the years ahead, people."
2020-12-04 22:03:17,"Viruses can have serious long term effects. After my daughter had mono, she suffered from all sorts of strange maladies-purple toes and other circulation problems, migraines, migraine vision loss, loss of concentration, double vision, extreme exhaustion, etc. It took almost a year to resolve, and she still has circulation problems. None of the medications prescribed helped. Sleeping about 14 hours a day for 6 months was the thing that finally got her over most of it."
2020-12-04 22:09:06,"I had Covid-19 in March, after returning from a business trip in Asia. I was extremely ill, including shortness of breath and GI symptoms, but because I am younger (36), and have no underlying health issues my doctor told me (virtually) that I should only go to the ER if I couldn't breathe and to simply self-isolate. Because the United States did not have a testing system in place when I became ill (unlike my colleagues across the globe), I wasn't able to confirm my symptoms. About a week in, I lost my sense of taste and smell entirely - only for it to return after about six weeks. My sense of taste and smell was normal for about a month, until I began experiencing what I now know is post-viral parosmia. Certain smells (like onion, garlic, mint, and meat) smell and taste completely wrong, and often unpleasant. It's December and I'm still dealing with fatigue and parosmia - something my doctor told me could take years to improve. 

I feel lucky that I wasn't hospitalised, but the long-term effects still impact my quality of life."

8th I lost my sense of smell and taste, the next day I was ill, 
not with the typical Covid symptoms, I will not go into the gory details of months and months of unexplained illness bouncing around my body, (just take Tom Hanks and Hugh Grant's descriptions of their illness and spread it out over nine months)
 I am only marginally better, now I can just make it through a very simple 45 minute zoom ballet class once a week, and that is all I can do on that day.

And yet their contributions are studiously ignored by the press and traditional practitioners alike, who continue to insist that ""we don't know anything about this phenomenon."" This is a wake-up call for western medicine. The model of treating individual organs in isolation, medicating symptoms instead of looking for underlying root causes at the system level, and dismissing nutritional, supplemental, and mind-body approaches as ""fringe"" is no longer tenable, and hasn't been for some time."

2020-12-04 22:45:57,"This seems to me a very strange virus. It does so many things to people in so many ways. I can't help but think that maybe this did escape from a lab in Wuhan where it was being manipulated. Is that paranoia? Unfounded suspicion? Maybe. Certainly could be just my ignorance at work. 

The Chinese took this very seriously from the get go. Because they knew how unpredictable and difficult to treat it would be? 

But all that speculation aside, this virus could easily become the number one strain on health care in years to come. People fixate on number of deaths, but what about hundreds of thousands of people who suffer from chronic, debilitating symptoms that are difficult to pin down. 

I feel that if you were to devise a virus that would be a potent weapon to weaken your enemies this would be a fine candidate. 

Has anyone been able to compare this virus to the likely candidates found in ""the wild""? Or is this case closed, we know exactly how this got here?

The shows could be daily, similar to what the mayor of New York did, or themes￼ in popular serial TV shows. EDUCATE AMERICANS!

Trying to make a case that thousands of people, possibly millions are going to be having chronic health conditions is not something that is going to go over well.

Anybody who thinks Covid is live-die and if you live, no problem, should be aware of post Covid problems. Unlike the acute ones, these hit productive people in mid-life, often with no pre-existing problems.
 
I hope there is not a great deal of doctor bashing over this issue. We are dealing with a new virus and do not know anything, I repeat anything, about 1 year post-infection, because we have not yet reached 1 year.   

What we do need are curious patients and curious physicians, who notice things, write them down, ask questions, test hypotheses, be willing to admit when a hypothesis is wrong (without being slammed for doing so), and trying different approaches which may or may not--and most won't--work.

Right now, much of the medical profession is dangerously  overwhelmed by the amount of really bad acute Covid, the killing kind, and they themselves are at far greater risk than most Americans for all the problems mentioned here.  It would be helpful if more of us would wear a mask, do all the other things we know work, in addition to offer ideas that can be tested.  That's how we make progress."

My answer to that was that death may not be the worst thing that could happen with COVID-19.  So little was known about the virus at that time, that my position on getting infected is that COVID is like Russian Roulette.  You can’t predict how your body will react to infection.  You may be infected and not know, you may be infected and die or you could get sick and recover from the virus.  The true unknown is whether COVID is like Varicella Zoster, Polio or Epstein Barr in which the infective virus can lay dormant in the body and symptoms can return or the infected person may have even more severe symptoms later in life.  Physicians and scientists don’t know.  No one knows.  Only time will tell.

I’m not aware of any studies yet that address this issue, but thinking of HIV and of chicken pox, where a virus sequence or a virus can “hide” in body reservoirs (to resurrect itself later - think viral load increases for HIV after medications are halted, or shingles, in later life) the possibilities alone gives me the absolute shivers.

2020-12-04 23:38:15,"The more we learn, the less we realize we know.  I will draw a parallel with the HIV virus.  Although biotechnology has greatly advanced since 1980, epidemiologists are more puzzled by COVID-19.  HIV went through a painfully long process trial process. Just for therapeutics. There's never been a vaccine.

The first HIV FDA approved medication AZT, was horrifically toxic. The next several iterations of anti-retrovirals, DDI, Ritonavir, Stavudine (Zerit), (Lamiduvine -Epivir) all had long-term side effects. Abacavir (Ziagen) required immediate discontinuation, if a patient had ONE adverse side-effect. 

A litany of FDA approved medications were proven to be unsafe.  Integrase inhibitors, unlike protease inhibitors, which had hideous side-effects - led to MK508, Merck's Retalgravir (Issentress). Its positive effects were noticeable after just two 400mg doses. Zerit, (Stavudine) on the contrary, caused neurological side-effects only after reviewing data from multi-year studies.

Comparing COVID-19 with HIV-1 is like comparing  basic arithmetic to quantum psychics.  We know so little. Any vaccine approval now is premature. Long-term efficacy, dosing are unknown. The delivery system is riddled with unknowns. The testing system is faulty. Few receive RNA-PCR tests. 

Long-term side-effects are immeasurable. Read all reliable data. All our lives depend on this. Please PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

Long-haulers are not new and novel to the Covid-19 virus.    The federal government and most researchers have given myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) short shrift for decades. ME was DEAD LAST in CDC funding priority for many years. Approximately 75% of people with ME report their symptoms preceded by a viral infection like Epstein-Barr or SARS Covid-1.  Had our nation invested in research years ago, we would likely have had answers for today's post-covid long-haul patients.  Preliminary research indicates that ME affects women, people of color, and disenfranchised communities disproportionately (hence the short shrift). Now the long-haulers are embarking on a suspiciously similar path as those who have suffered (and have died from) ME.

The patient-speakers (including the rep from the the Body Politic and Dr. Piot) all highlighted these issues. Dr. Piot was honest about how he did not qualify for a COVID-19 test per NHS standards and obtained it via a private doc. But I didn't see much discussion about a plan to address this possibly very large group. It's true that initial data is based on easily accessible groups, i.e. the hospitalized and those with confirmed tests, but we can and should do better.

Especially important because a) one of the large patient-led surveys showed that people without a (+) test were not different in their chronic symptoms and b) Townsend PLOS study recently published showed severity of illness had no impact on who was still sick and how sick 2.5 months out. 

The group who did not have a COVID-19 confirmation may suffer even more when they present with chronic symptoms  than the COVID-19+ patients, who already encounter much disbelief."

I applaud that this is becoming more recognized and that we -- both as a society and the medical profession -- should take these concerns seriously. However, it is also important for people to understand that medicine has limitations. Since we don't yet have a full understanding of range of post COVID symptoms and their underlying etiology, we also don't have a great idea of particular treatments or management strategies (that isn't to say we aren't trying). So it becomes frustrating for patients and medical providers when there may not be an exact answer for the symptoms or particular treatments to alleviate such suffering. But recognizing the range of symptoms and degree of suffering is the first step, and I am hopeful we will learn more about the lasting effects of COVID and come up with viable ways to manage them. In the meantime, I will continue to respect the concerns of patients I encounter and help them as best I can."

I finally started taking a multivitamin in early November, and that's what fixed it; I'm full of energy again and back to my old pre-covid self.

He called in April and told me that he has a fever. I frantically told him: rub yourself in oregano (distilled) oil (diluted with olive oil) - we have this oregano oil at home as I can not tolerate medication because of the added sugar or artificial sugars in them. After loong research I found oregano oil is being extensively studied for bacteria mainly also for antibiotic resistant bacteria. We have used it when I or he has had a fever. Within 15 minutes no more fever.... 
I read also, it kills bacteria, fungus and viruses. It goes into your bloodstream and renders the intruder ineffective..
That’s why I told my husband to rub it everywhere. He used it for about a week and was fine (we are 60 ).

I returned home a month ago and saw his toes. He explained, didn’t wanted to be a cry baby, how there were blisters, itching, everything.

We made four warm water bath with little drops of oil of oregano..... and his toes have finally improved!!

Google it. It has been studied extensively. It is interesting.."
2020-12-05 01:25:50,"Among all the arguments, bogus arguments advanced by uninformed Scott Atlas, Kristi Noem, Hannity, Ingraham, Carlson....zero reflection that even asymptomatic infection may have long-term serious health consequences. We have known this since the 1918 Flu pandemic (Encephalitis Lethargica), but also infections with eg., EBV, HSV, Polio. Every indication from all the preliminary studies I have reviewed is that long-term consequences will be dramatically commoner consequent to COVID-19 infection and not delayed for decades as with Polio as en example. Herd immunity was absolutely rubbish but let me also add we don't even know if prior infection with this virus will confer life-long protection from re-infection."

The learning curve about a new virus is steep. New information is persistently forthcoming. This does not make the old information “lies” anymore than the new information, such as long-term effects of Covid, is to be discounted because it hasn’t been seen before or isn’t happening to everyone. 

If the media can do ONE THING right here, it would be to remind us in every single article or report: “SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causeS Covid-19, is a new pathogen, and we are learning more about it every day. Please remain tuned for more information, prepare for the possibility that initial assumptions may be revised and that, for your safety, public health guidance might change over time. We know it’s confusing. Learning often is, and when we are learning something about which there are no current experts — because it’s NEW — it takes time, patience and persistence.”

I wonder if the recovery process would go much faster if everyone got dexamethasone during acute illness, and/or if everyone got some hydrocortisone daily to support the recovery phase."

From an able, active, healthy person you turn into an exhausted, debilitated mess in the space of a week and stay that way for years, often never fully recovering. Meanwhile, all medical tests come out normal, just like in this covid syndrome, which for a long time led doctors to think it was depression. It took years for doctors to realize CFS is a real disease and take it seriously, but it's remained a peripheral field of medicine and they've never found out what causes it or how to treat it, except symptomatically.

Maybe with so large and dramatic an occurrence in front of them, the medical community will finally muster the attention this syndrome requires and figure out what is going on. Then maybe we'll know what CFS is, too, and be able to help the millions who have it. (My speculation is that it's some kind of fungus, for which doctors never test, but who knows.)"

2020-12-05 04:43:46,"Doctors could mitigate much of the suffering and death if they would simply treat the illness.

In 1918, doctors realized that many of those infected were not dying of the flu, but rather, secondary bacterial infections that were a consequence of the viral infection...most commonly, pneumonia.

Doctors in our neck of the woods have steadfastly refused to prescribe antibiotics at all, even if the patient is obviously suffering from pneumonia.

They should be prescribing antibiotics as a preventive treatment, BEFORE patients get deathly ill.

I have a 94-year-old friend whose doctor refused even to see him for treatment, until he was tested for covid, even though he was already suffering respiratory distress.

He had to wait four days, over the weekend, for results. 

Even then, the doctor did NOTHING to treat his patient. My friend ended up in the hospital, with pneumonia, and is now on oxygen (but doing OK, no thanks to his doctors...he's just tough).

This could have been prevented.

I do blame doctors for their incompetence, and lack of care, for much of the suffering and death related to this epidemic.

Once the crisis is past, perhaps there'll be time to trace Covid19. There are anecdotal reports of cases outside the official USA time line. Did Covid19 appear earlier than we think? Were there precursor forms not as easily transferred?

In mid Dec. 2019 I was diagnosed with ""some very strange virus I haven't seen before."" When the pandemic started, I saw my symptoms were a match, but didn't think much of it until there were reports of sequelae and 'long haulers.'  That match caught my attention.

If it is any hope to those in the thick of it, even if what I had was not Covid19 but another virus with almost identical impact, the physical debilitation has lifted in the past few months. I don't know whether the mental impact has lessened or I've adapted to eerily fleeting focus and lost words. Brains work differently than muscles.

Some Covid-19 autopsy studies have shown that a majority of deceased victims have direct viral damage in 5 or more organs and biological systems.   Direct causes of death have been pulmonary, vascular and, in a few cases, neurological.  This is physical evidence, not opinion.

Flying and ground travel is not easy for us.  When we get to a port, we've researched the port and set out on our own to find what's happening locally.  If possible, we've learned a few words of the local language.  We sample local foods.  We ask before we take pictures.  Sometime we run into seedy neighborhoods and seedy people, but we've never been robbed or threatened.

Workers did certain kinds of jobs in February 2020 because of consumer demand, industrial organization and technology, none of which has fundamentally changed during the plague year. When consumer patronage comes back, these businesses will come back. Some capital was and will be destroyed, but if anything we've been awash in capital during the last two decades.

In order for the economy to fully recover, these workers will need to successfully transition to new jobs requiring new skills. It’s not difficult to envisage that for these workers, a smooth transition will require government assistance with job training, childcare, transportation, etc. Yes, these are not easy requirements but they are needed. That’s why we have a government; that’s why we pay taxes—to do what’s needed even if, or especially when, it’s difficult."

Artificial intelligence will eliminate the ""high tech"" jobs in computing and software that unemployed low-skilled workers aspire to. Extreme wealth disparity translates into lack of demand for goods and services - how many Teslas do the one percent need?

Universal basic income for all citizens can help drive demand and lower poverty providing a genuine safety net and financial backstop. People will be free to pursue their dreams or simply enjoy life. There is clearly plenty of money to pay for it as evidenced by the recent massive tax cuts for corporations and the ultra wealthy."

2020-12-01 13:11:56,I am not sure I agree with the article basic premise that food industry jobs will never return post-Covid.  Bars and restaurants will re-open.  What IS changing in the job market is that many customer service jobs are disappearing for good and many of those customer service jobs are going into full automation with one or two humans running the whole show.  The other big change is that large centralized office environments seems to be disappearing in many (not all) industries.  On the other hand data centers are becoming massively centralized and as that happens the need for low-skilled IT workers will dissipate in many many places across the USA.
2020-12-01 13:13:52,"Bring manufacturing back to America and the retraining issue is solved. This can be done through coordinated tax legislation
on the federal, state, and local level. First at the federal level remove all tax incentives for overseas investment. From the 1960's through today the U.S.A. encouraged mid/large manufacturing businesses to migrate to Mexico, Japan, Taiwan,
and lastly China through a combination of U.S. Tax Law and 
U.S. controlled trade organization such as the WTO. 
Now the average USA worker (3, 4, 5 & beyond generation American) wages are decreasing in purchasing power. Wealth inequity is back to where it was prior to 1929. This
is by design by the 1/2 or 1% business class working since
FDR busted up this class of people in the 1930's. They have worked hard to get this point and they will not let go without a great fight. We know this by the fact that approximately 72

2020-12-01 13:55:00,"For many decades now, the American economy has been an ungodly hybrid Rube Goldberg system comprised of a pyramid scheme, built from a house of cards, and fueled by debt, greed and corruption.

The world economy was going through massive tectonic changes prior to Covid.  The pandemic simply exposed the unstable and unsustainable nature of the system.

We have just gone through two centuries of massive industrialization and technological advances.   One could argue that the paradigm of ""economic growth"" was necessary to drive society to the present high standard of living we enjoy.  

But now that we have such abundance and so many creature comforts, we must shift to a new paradigm that does not rely on perpetual economic growth to function.  

Most people cannot imagine such a system, as all they've ever known was the growth-addicted economic system of the past and present.  However, once you start looking closer you see that the only reason perpetual growth was required was to keep feeding the parasites at the top of the pyramid.

In a way, we've treated economics as an engine that requires continuous fuel (""growth"") to keep running.

However, economics is not physics...  The laws of thermodynamics do not apply.  Therefore you CAN build an economic perpetual motion machine where the existing wealth circulates freely without the need for growth -- as long as we are not continuously feeding a huge chunk of the wealth to the bloated crooks at the top of the pyramid."
2020-12-01 13:59:55,"With so many Americans out-of-work, Biden might want to rethink his plans to annually accept large numbers of refugees.  Most of today’s refugees have little education and know little English so they are largely limited to finding work in the very fields that are disappearing, such as cleaning buildings and working in restaurants.  

Many refugees work in meat-packing plants and others drive trucks.  Both of these industries could automate in the near future.  Robots already exist that can cut up whole sheep and that can bone the front part of chickens, and then package the meat for sale in grocery stores.   Meat packers could buy these robots and invest in the development of others rather than continue to hire large numbers of low-skilled workers.   Similarly, self-driving trucks will not need drivers.  Refugees will not have as many jobs open to them in the future.

In each of the fiscal years 2014 and 2015, we admitted 70,000 refugees.  In 2016, the number climbed to 85,000.  All of these refugees need work, not just the year they arrived here, but every year after that. 

Biden said he wants to substantially raise the number his first year in office to 125,000, and then raise it further every year he is in office.  With many native-born Americans and many of the refugees who are already here having difficulty finding work, I wonder whether Biden will find it politically feasible to admit large numbers of new refugees."

People are harder to train as they get older, and moving to these new jobs will be hard.

We may be approaching the point where we simply have a mismatch between what jobs need to be filled, and the skills of our workforce to fill them. We can reduce that number with the upcoming generation if we aggressively fund education, but for those already in the workforce, I don't know if that can be done.

We need to accept the fact that unemployment will grow in the near future, because there just won't be enough people with the skills to fill the jobs that are available, and adapt government programs to that new reality."

Talk with educators, social scientists, community leaders and local government types to understand the state of the American work force today. Understand the state of education today.  Identify the gaps between what we need and what we have.  

Put together a grand strategy, with local responsibility to fill the gaps. Fix education and continuing Ed. Provide aid and resources to poor families with children.  Provide retraining grants with stipends. Revolutionize schools and fund them based on required need.

We boomers will need care workers, but hopefully the nation will see its way to supporting childcare for everyone, and we'll need trained childcare workers as well. 

If we get serious about public education, we'll support enough teachers to reduce classroom size and provide paid classroom aides, school counselors, tutors, and special education staff. In the meantime there is quite a bit of remedial and ESL tutoring needed to prepare young people for the post-secondary training and education that'll get them into these jobs.

If we want to reform the police and get people off the streets, we'll need cadres of social workers and other trained mentors and counselors to provide treatment and long-term support for those recovering from addiction and mental illness.

The signs have been present for some time.  In most colleges, most of the teaching is actually done by low-paid adjuncts and foreign graduate students.  The entire student loan business is fraudulent.

The higher education system needs to be restructured to focus on getting good jobs for students on graduation.  Federal student aid should be contingent on colleges demonstrating job placement for their graduates.  I suspect that a large fraction of colleges would fail this test.

Regarding online education, most students are not self-motivated solitary learners, so that a hybrid system of online lectures and smaller offline discussion groups will probably work better.

COVID-19 may be the straw that broke the camel’s back of higher education.  There will be a major shakeout in this industry, and most of the current players will not survive in their current form.  

Look for a combination of bankruptcies, mergers, acquisitions, and franchise expansion.  In 10 years, the landscape of higher education will be drastically different."

It would be great to do a follow up article featuring these schools as many people simply are not aware of this option for training and re-training.

Thats why we need to tax the super rich so people can be retrained to do new jobs that wont necessarily  be profitable.

We have the mistaken notion that every American should be a college graduate, and for those who aren’t, for whatever reason, the alternative is ditch digger.

2020-12-01 17:27:30,"There's one thing you don't mention in all of this.  States will try to do all of the retraining as cheaply as possible which means that some of the programs will be useless.  And in some states you get only one chance to retrain.  The next time you have to pay for it whether or not you can afford the cost.  

The US needs to have some national standards for retraining programs and better plans than improvisation as the crisis unfolds.  It's been hard to find decent jobs for far longer than this crisis has been in existence.  Older people, people without college degrees, single parents, and people who work minimum wage jobs (and may not ever find anything other than that) need more than a do it yourself handbook that has advice which often doesn't pertain to their situation.

We need to put teeth into laws forbidding discrimination on the basis of age, gender, religion, sexual preferences and include political views in that because I've seen people fired for political views.  We need to stop making unions the scapegoat.  And we need to stop expecting high school grads to go on to college when they may not have the aptitude or interest in it.  

There are plenty of jobs that need doing.  Some are as simple as picking up trash but they add a lot to our public spaces.  People would rather work than receive welfare.  But if they can't find jobs welfare is all that's left.  Perhaps we need to examine how much we pay CEOs versus the people who keep the country running."
2020-12-01 17:32:22,"Of course many (if not all) of those jobs will come back; however, Americans should reconsider the wisdom of an economy that had switched so drastically from manufacturing to services - possibly one big reason the US economy has been hit harder than some other ones - and try to re-establish non-service industries.

And also reconsider an economy that has transitioned from full-time to fragile gig ‘employment’ that was poorly paid even before the pandemic."

This article makes clear why the ideas promoted by Andrew Yang are so timely and important.  Automation and artificial intelligence are here to stay.  It is coming for us all!  Today it's waitresses, tomorrow it's truck drivers and contract attorneys.

If waiting on tables is your calling, great, but then you have to do it better than an automated kiosk at McD's.  The ugly truth is that no human can evolve as quickly and continuously as artificial intelligence and robotics--competing head to head with technology results in the human losing!  We have to co-opt the technology!  The surgeons lost scalpels and gained robotic lasers, and they still make great money.  The only thing you can really do is be a lifelong learner and stick to skills that complement a robot or offshore worker, and ultimately direct the ""robot.""  

For those who cannot or do not wish to study, re-train, we should provide a minimum, guaranteed income without the stigma of lifelong disability.  It won't be much, but it will keep this population fed, housed, and away from bloody revolution or opioid pandemic."

We've been through this before, with the Industrial Revolution and similar events/times in history where humans invent things that make life easier for humans while simultaneously reducing the need for those humans.

A human doesn't make my latte the same every time; a machine can and does, and doesn't come to work late or sick. Conversely, I visit human healthcare providers, because they're human - like me - and there isn't a replacement for those services (yet, or maybe ever?)

I don't think we can or should stop the growth of technology, as the rewards are significant. I do think people should stop making more people until we figure out what to do with the 7 billion we've got on-hand presently."

I'd cut the work week by 10h/week and adopt some kind of basic medical care system so that everyone can have a job whether they're a computer whiz or a good manager or not, but that's just me. Want as many people working as worked in the '50s? Want people off welfare? Make employers hire more people, even the spotty apples, but do it in a way that they don't go bankrupt in the process.

Germany has a practice of “Kurzarbeit "" where employers are supported by the government to reduce employee work time during downturns like this. We have a situation now where a small number of privileged workers are paid a lot to work a lot while many Americans are un or under employees. Plus, burn-out is a huge problem in the U.S. among people who work too many hours. Work is asymmetrically distributed in our country and high paying jobs are hoarded because they’re so hard to get, even though they also are exhausting to hold.

Consider technologies of today, like Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which ""learns"" how to perform human tasks by ""watching"" what humans do while they perform those tasks.  The more the humans do what they do, the better RPA becomes at doing those tasks -- and soon enough, the machines are processing bank loans better than loan officers with MBAs or diagnosing cancer better than a team of medical doctors. 

In truth, all jobs and all occupations with few exceptions are essentially about repeating sets of structured rule-based tasks to arrive at specific predefined outcomes... it just so happens that software, AI and machine learning have now reached a level of performance that make them more viable than ever in term of doing those tasks better and faster than humans.

We have one of those, if only Congress and the climate-change-denying GOP would get its head out of the sand. It’s called the Green New Deal. I’m not suggesting we implement every single aspect of that aspirational plan, but we could certainly implement A LOT of it right now. There is no shortage of workers who could be trained to participate in the conversion from an anachronistic fossil-fuel economy to a modern renewable-sustainable energies economy, as well as clean up the devastating and long-term impacts of decades of corporatocracy-inspired environmental devastation.

Changing our mindset from an economy based in consumption to one based on ensuring a healthy Commons — clean air, clean water, clean food, clean fuel — for every citizen of the planet would go a LONG way toward full, gainful, meaningful employment. But first, you’ve got to admit there was a problem with the pre-pandemic state of the world, that what we were doing is not worth rushing headlong back into and rebuilding the same. 

Covid is still giving us a chance to rethink and redesign. Let’s seize this opportunity!"
2020-12-01 20:45:04,"With our economy changing, it may be time to overhaul the 1965 Immigration Bill. It was written when there were plenty of jobs for people with little education so it gave preference to applicants with family ties over those with advanced education and skills.  It is one thing to allow immigrants who have moved here without their spouses or minor children to bring them here.  It is another to let them bring in their aunts, uncles, siblings, and other members of their extended families, and to give these extended family members preference over applicants with the advanced education and skills which could help our economy.  

The 1965 Bill reserves 2/3’s of our annual immigration spaces for these extended family members.  It has allowed a great many undereducated people to mover here, and now these people are having trouble finding work in our changing economy.

Canada does the opposite.  It reserves 2/3’s of its annual allotment for applicants who
1.  Have advanced education and skills that would benefit the Canadian economy
2.  Are fluent in English and/or French
3.  Have the overall ability to assimilate into Canadian culture.

Having an extended family member who already lives in Canada might help one assimilate, but it is not the only factor.

We need to change our immigration system so that (beyond a person’s spouse and minor children) a greater proportion of the people whom we accept will have the advanced education and special skills that would benefit our economy."

Nearly all retail, restaurant, domestic, service or factory jobs such as chicken processing or gig farming are the same in our economy.  They are unstable and as covid has exposed, often not even safe spaces.  

We have historically devalued the worth of these jobs to avoid paying those who perform them.    Government needed to step in,  rather than play the same ""trickle down"" zero sum game.  

We must fairly value work performed while paying more than just  lip service to make small and medium businesses grow, and never at the expense of wages or marginalization. 

What do we value?   Do we want a society with lots of cheap goods but with whole populations of people who have no housing or food?

Covid has exposed our system for what it is  -  in need of an overhaul and reform.    Government has a real role to play.  It can invest, it can train and it can build.

There were already significant downward pressures on wages, whether from an influx of unskilled, precarious labor willing to work for bad wages or policies hollowing out unions or just cyclical decreases in work.  Why would anyone hire a 50 year old union carpenter at $56 per hour when they could hire an undocumented worker at $11 dollars an hour?

The biggest failure that followed from this was the abandonment of a huge industrial economy just because businesses had no ability to anticipate and to adapt to changes which occurred without clear warning in 1973. The cost of petroleum skyrocketed and the never upgraded manufacturing facilities which had been operated as cash cows became devastatingly unprofitable overnight. Foreign companies had invested in new technologies, nearly all of which had been developed and perfected in the U.S. but never implemented because it would redirect profits back into operations instead of to stockholders. That's what happened to both steel and automobiles and many electronic products. That is why Japan emerged with the best of all three for consumers. Had the government planned for the future, the effects would not have been so devastating for the whole country.

We’re going to be drowning in people out of work and desperate not because they’re lazy or unqualified or welfare cheats but because our heroes of capitalism decided to dump them.

I don't know how S. Korea sees this atrocity as a value to the kids or the country.  One wonders what is actually being 'tested'.  And note the national suicide rates.  Get a clue, S. Korea.  This is a bad idea."
2020-12-03 23:34:54,aking the nine hour college entrance exam and as coping with the pandemic is bravery and we all must give our well wishes.

Education has nothing to do with mass anxiety hysteria , dollars , and children suffering ..."
2020-12-04 12:30:35,"Nine hours? What are they complaining about? The old British A-level exams consisted of at least five papers (depending on how many subjects you took), each 3 hours long. Cambridge scholarship exams in the 50s required 21 hours of exams, spread over a week. Nine hours is nothing, except perhaps by the watered down standards common in this country. Also, and please note, none of those silly so-called 'objective', as in multiple choice, questions, but all essays. And did we 'suffer'? Of course not. It was the common expectation and exams - at least the essay sort - could be, and were, learning experiences. We were happy to try and demonstrate our creativity."
2020-12-04 14:08:39,"Wow imagine the fate of your life being decided on a test you took while you running a fever in a hospital ward...they really couldn’t offer alternate testing dates for something this important?

As for the test itself, I think instead of blaming a test because not everyone can or should go to university, maybe they should reframe other occupations or outcomes as equally valuable. Plenty of successful people go to community colleges and trade schools, and often do more impactful work on day to day basis than “academic elites” anyway..."
2020-12-04 15:05:51,"Before you criticize South Korea based on the coverage of their exam in this article, and before you pass judgment on their whole education system: look at the United States response to the pandemic. Get your own house in order."
2020-12-04 15:13:42,A grueling test indeed. The only thing most American kids that age can do for nine hours straight is sleep!
2020-12-04 14:19:04,This whole process is ridiculous. What's the value in testing how much memorization one can do. Putting this much pressure on students for one exam is a recipe for disaster and no wonder the suicide rate is so high.
2020-12-01 12:02:33,"In the interest of safety, given the issues of the coronavirus, I would have expected a severely muted ceremony in the rotunda of the Capitol.  This is not a time when we need grand tableaux  with a sea of humanity during an inaugural speech.  Whatever ceremonies or parades are planned, they must include proper social distancing and use of masks.  It is important to honor those who have died from the virus by taking proper precautions to protect the living."
2020-12-01 12:10:02,"Remaining cowed by the pandemic is not Leadership. Being on Top of the Pandemic even at its worst is the stuff of Inspiring Leadership. 
President-elect Biden should use the Inauguration as a global opportunity to showcase his Out-of-Box Leadership by observing all social distancing - masking - hand sanitizing public health norms & yet having a Huge Outsize public celebration. Like President Obama’s 2009 Inauguration. Yes, We CAN. 
Maybe it requires a vast multi-level Inauguration Viewing Grounds, quadrupling the space for the people. Why not ?"
2020-12-01 12:14:43,"Trump will use this as an excuse to claim that President Joe couldn’t possibly have been rightfully elected because his inauguration is so small, regardless of Trump’s own small inauguration crowd when there was no safety concern restricting crowd size.
But that won’t matter.  Trump will be out of office and I will no longer have to care about anything he has to say."
2020-12-01 12:17:51,"Why not have a swearing-in ceremony and speech, televised or viewable electronically and get on with the work of cleaning up the messes we have. It would be safer and cheaper."
2020-12-01 12:11:57,"Whelp, if enough people show up and they all 'social distance,' then we could have the largest inauguration crowd measured by square footage. I can live with that."
2020-12-01 12:26:35,Americans don’t need a show. We just need truth and sanity.
2020-12-01 12:27:21,"That is fine for me. Biden and Harris know how to stay safe. Thank you!

Let Trump make fun as he slumps out the door."

2020-12-01 11:31:56,"Anything more than swearing Biden in on Zoom is a delusional mistake.

2020-12-01 12:53:08,"Totally unrelated, but I'm also looking forward to watching concerts at the Whitehouse in the future. I think the musicians will come back for the Biden family. I really enjoyed watching them in the past with the Obamas. I know it's early, but it will be nice to have a few normal things along with this Presidency. Plus they both read."
2020-12-01 13:01:17,"Come on people!  Sure everyone enjoys a parade, but this is not the time. Buy a bottle of champagne and celebrate the end of the trump regime safely at home. And avoid jeopardizing the safety of all the public workers who would have to be part of a big celebration. President-elect Biden doesn’t have to prove his popularity. The votes did that."
2020-12-01 12:56:59,I was talking about this over Thanksgiving with my family. Having a small and solemn inauguration is exactly the perfect way to welcome 2021. The virtual DNC roll call during the convention was extraordinary so the inauguration can have a prelude that commemorates people around the country and take a moment to observe the people who have died this year because of the virus. Bring the ceremony to our homes.
2020-12-01 13:14:25,"After the inauguration, Biden should go to the White House press briefing room and say, with a winning smile, ""this was the smallest audience to ever to witness an inauguration, period."""
2020-12-01 13:35:32,"Please ditch the parade, ball, and all the pom stuff of the past...it's elitist, outdated, and inappropriate during a pandemic when so many people have made great sacrifices and are hurting.

As for Trump...he's the last person I would want at my party.  His time has come and thankfully gone.  Book him a table at McDonald's instead."
2020-12-01 13:25:52,I admit that after the election for a moment I imagined crowds exceeding Trump’s at the inauguration as his last defeat. And then I knew it wouldn’t be possible and Trump would use that against Biden.

2020-12-01 14:00:07,"Nothing inside the White House. The trumps have the right to occupy it until noon on Inauguration Day. 

Plus, with all the super spreader events held inside the White House, the Bidens should not move in until it is thoroughly sanitized, including the vents. And send the regular staff home on paid leave while it undergoes its deep cleaning."
2020-12-01 13:39:16,"Trump does not want to attend the Biden inauguration. The inauguration needs to be slimmed down because of coronavirus. This is a win-win situation. And let’s  stop being concerned about Trump’s continued unwillingness to concede that he is no longer President. In fact, the appropriate reaction of Joe Biden to Trump’s refusal to acknowledge reality is for Biden to refuse to acknowledge that Trump ever WAS the President. A good start is to NOT invite him to the inauguration and to refuse to refer to the current and soon to be former President by name. If Biden ever has to refer to the guy who was in the White House from 2016-2020, President 45 is sufficient. Or President *."
2020-12-01 14:42:25,"Planning a thoughtful, respectful and understated Inaugural calendar would without question be the most appropriate and prudent approach. It would serve as another immediate example of how our next President and his administration will be restoring the respect, restraint and common sense we need now to help us heal and move forward. It, quite simply, is the right thing to do. Imagine that."
2020-12-01 13:20:40,"Excuse me but I live here. Please don't even think of coming to DC for the inaugural. There should be a very small group of people that are necessary to inaugurate the new President.
Joe Biden spent the entire election season speaking in front of very small groups of people and he needs to keep this celebration to a few hundred people and frankly that is too much!
There can be no parties, parades or balls because of the restrictions in DC that are sure to still be in place on January 20th.
So swear in...give a speech and get to work."

Maybe 8 million.

But the fact is, there IS a pandemic.
There has been for almost a year.
And, because Trump made it a zoo, he lost.

By 8,000,000 votes.

Do not endanger either yourself or others on that day.
Stay alive, for we will need every person of common sense alive in the months to come.

Well done, Biden!"
2020-12-01 15:58:15,The Inauguration will be much more dignified if trump is not there. Let him hold his oft mentioned rally in the parking lot of a landscaping company on Inauguration Day. It would be a fitting comparison.
2020-12-01 16:11:48,"As much as I would LOVE to be there in person to welcome the beginning of what I hope is some normalcy in our country, I hope to watch, safely, on TV, with members of my immediate household only. This needs to be small, dignified, and, while celebratory, at the same time solemn. I am quite literally counting the days until the inauguration, but I recognize that it needs to be small and socially distanced, and safe."
2020-12-01 16:42:39,What a grand gesture and signal of responsibility it would send to the country to cancel ALL pomp and circumstance around the inauguration and simply have President Biden and VP Harris take their oath of office and then make a televised speech. Civility and safety.
2020-12-01 14:58:55,"Just one more reason to be grateful Biden won. If trump had prevailed, his inauguration committee would be planning the mother of all super-spreader events, which would have given the pandemic enough fuel to cause a backdraft.

At President Obama’s first inauguration, there was a second, modest swearing in because Chief Justice Roberts muffed the oath of office on the big stage. Why not use that simple ceremony as precedent?"
2020-12-01 15:55:03,"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris should invite family and a few friends, let the rest of us watch virtually.  The backdrop can still be the Capitol steps.  After the ceremony, send the Press Secretary out to announce the inauguration took place in front of the smallest crowd for as far back as anyone can remember, and that the President and Vice-President could not be happier."
2020-12-01 15:59:21,"President elect Biden, I beg you to postpone your inauguration celebration or better yet don’t have one . Donate all that money to a special fund to be given to the families of frontline heroes  who gave their lives to save others. Have a small celebration with your family and the family of Vice President Kamala Harris in the White House. Please don’t be a super spreader event like the ones of the out going person in taking up space in the people’s house."

Man of the people..."
2020-12-01 16:28:51,“Expect smaller crowds and More Social Distancing”.  That’s because Joe Biden has some common sense and ACTUALLY cares about America and Americans.
2020-12-01 14:54:07,"An ideal cover for what was bound to be lackluster attendance. Turns out, the 90% of the country that's been falling into an abyss of sickness, debt, addiction, eviction, ignorance, outrage, and despair for the last four decades isn't all that keen on yet another grinning Wall Street presidency."
2020-12-01 16:11:44,"It seems this country thought that how Trump handle crowds was just fine, OMG if President-Elect Biden do anything close to what Trump was doing since the pandemic hit we will for sure make Biden pay.

It's sad that this wonderful event has been daunted by the pandemic, but even worse by trump. I guarantee trump will be having his 'its a fraud election' party with his base and of course not following any guidelines.

Strange how we are now Demanding that Biden play by the rules and if he doesn't........"

2020-12-01 16:15:02,What do you want to bet that Trump will be tweeting crowd size comparisons by the end of the day?
2020-12-01 16:34:20,During a pandemic I think the most appropriate ceremony would be for Biden and Harris to arrive at the White House at 11:45 and to have the oath administered at noon on the Truman balcony (you know where Trump stripped off his mask).  Once Biden has taken office Trump needs to be placed in handcuffs and removed from the property to face a firestorm of criminal and civil charges.   Biden can get to work on trying to repair the damage Trump has caused.  No need for crowds and marching bands we can stay home and stay healthy for what I hope is a brighter future.
2020-12-01 15:28:51,"People are such lemmings. Social distance at 6 feet to prevent the spread of Covid. And we blindly follow. No supporting science but we still follow. According to Oxford University,  airborne droplets laden with SARS-CoV-2 may spread up to 24 feet concentrated in exhaled air from infected individuals, even without background ventilation or airflow. We stand in line 6 feet from the person in front of us in case they have Covid. They move up in line and we move to the exact spot where the person who may have Covid was standing, as if the virus in the air 6 feet around that person moved with them. Restaurants have tables 6 feet apart. But when one group leaves the table another follows. The table might get disinfected in between but this is primarily an airborne virus. The air doesn’t get disinfected. So much for social distancing. The virus has spread anyway."
2020-12-01 16:23:50,Months ago the Rose Parade in Pasadena was canceled for public safety reasons related to coronavirus.  Bringing any number of people together for merely a public swearing in that’s just as valid done in private is irresponsible and Joe should put his money where his mouth is and forgo the traditional inauguration pageantry completely.  It’s not like he hasn’t been to enough of them already.
2020-12-01 16:57:28,"I'm a bit surprised that any kind of public inauguration is planned. I would have expected the whole thing might involve just a handful of people and a camera operator so that the event could be televised. 

A couple predictions: Trump will not attend. 

After it is over, Biden will be able to  boast, in all honesty, that he had the smallest inauguration crowd in decades."
2020-12-01 16:17:52,"The stupidity just keeps going on and on.  Biden is no different than Trump.  Why not try, ""No Events at All"" and swearing in via Zoom.  Running around like there is no virus."
2020-12-01 16:27:15,"I can picture Trump tweeting on Inauguration Day that his crowd was ""bigger"" than Biden's."
2020-12-01 16:47:02,"Any crowd will be smaller then Trump’s 2016 crowd, duh."
2020-12-01 16:28:21,One hopes Trump sees the construction and hears the sounds of electric saws and hammers every time he looks out of the oval office window.
2020-12-01 17:03:48,"""One uncertainty for lawmakers: whether Mr. Trump will agree to attend his successor’s inauguration given his complaints about what he calls a rigged election.""

I hope he doesn't attend. He is not wanted. He is not a decent man. He was not a president for all Americans. He didn't want to be. He wanted to be a divisive and destructive to the fabric of this country as he possibly could be, all because it was always only about him. He is a nasty stain on this country's history. He can stay at home and complain like a loser on Twitter (it's the same thing he's been doing for 4 years) and then get out of our White House, get on that helicopter, and go the heck away."
2020-12-01 15:26:26,Expect crutches at Biden's inauguration.
2020-12-01 15:51:32,The democrats set the social distance standards and they should follow through and forgo all cloud gathering celebration.
2020-12-01 16:58:38,"Smaller crowds ? No, no, I am sure Biden's crowds will be the biggest ever. Way, way bigger than all the other crowds. 

And the virus will disappear in the spring."
2020-12-01 15:41:09,Finally a decision proving that the new president isn't insane.
2020-12-01 16:15:18,I hope that Biden can brag that his inauguration was the smallest crowd ever.
2020-12-01 16:24:54,"I anticipate that Biden will be very reserved in the planning, and will discourage people from travelling from across the country.

He has to be an exemplary leader while he works to get ahead of the virus.

Of course Trump will demean and insult Biden for so few people, and FOX will have hundreds of people out there looking for 3 people standing by each other without masks on."
2020-12-01 16:58:38,"Set an example.  Do it online, like the Convention.  Next January, when we have this miserable disease under control, have the outdoor party.  I will totally buy a ticket."
2020-12-01 17:01:13,"January 20 2021 will be a great day in American and world history.

America reborn, trying to forge a more perfect union, having freshly rid itself of a Civil War President who tried to tear the nation in two.

2020-12-01 18:32:33,Biden won the election. He received 80 million votes. There is no need for a celebration or to show he has more people in his crowd than Trump did in 2016. We are in (hopefully) the final stretch against COVID. Let's all just celebrate at our own homes instead of going to a massive public event. We can all just watch the inauguration on our TV in the safety of our homes.
2020-12-01 18:43:07,"Citizens already celebrated when they partied and danced in the streets across America when Biden won.  I know they shouldn’t have but they did.

Nothing could be more beautiful than that.  Free, spontaneous, informal and historic.

President elect Biden - just take the oath then get to work on day 1 as promised."
2020-12-01 19:09:59,One thing that will be completely different this inauguration is the man taking the oath of office.... will actually believe in America vs the former who was more concerned about fleecing it.
2020-12-01 19:26:16,The priority should be to keep Joe Biden safe while he is sworn in and allow him to speak to the nation. Certainly don’t need to see a bunch of bigwigs and backslapping—nor a bunch of unspeakable Republican hypocrites who chose to keep their base inflamed with hatred and fear rather than acknowledge Biden as the President-elect. Save the parade and balls for the Fourth of July when we don’t have to worry about the pandemic.
2020-12-01 19:48:10,"Frankly, if I were a member of the inauguration committee, I'd be doing everything possible to make sure Trump does NOT attend the ceremony!  It would only be an unwelcome distraction and the sooner he and his grifting family and sycophantic administration are swept out of Washington, D.C., the better."

Biden and Harris will do something creative, festive and safe, no doubt. They will find ways to be dignified and traditional, to mark this very important transfer of power. 
Just cannot wait til that moment they're sworn in, perhaps a walk up Pennsylvania Ave... and when we see the moving vans outside the White House."
2020-12-16 12:17:26,Thank you NYT for publishing this data. Somehow this presentation has brought the reality of the pandemic into focus for me. Talking heads on videos and TV are fine but to see what’s happening up close and personal is awesome and frightening. I for one am grateful to the professionals in hospitals and public health departments for this service.
2020-12-16 12:22:20,"Your article was a real eye opener for me.  My local ICU is 95% full.  My daily early morning walks, weekly visit to the grocery store or monthly visit to the home improvement store are experiences of mask wearing, social distancing and much less crowding.  The behavior I see and the ICU crisis near me are incongruous.  Yet undeniable.  

From their website  ""WakeMed Cary Hospital, the only full-service hospital in Cary, NC, brings advanced medical care and technology to one of the top-rated places to live in the nation.""

Despite the area's affluence I have neighbors that minimize and/or trivialize the magnitude of the pandemic.  Thus the importance of staying ever vigilant"
2020-12-16 12:01:38,"Important tool to save on your phone. I’m a surgeon who cares for these patients in the ICU. Anything over 75% occupancy of the ICU beds should scare the living daylights out of you. 

If you see anyone not wearing a mask in public, call them out on it. Publicly. Loudly. Let them know they are personally responsible for some innocent person’s death."
2020-12-16 12:31:28,"The article:
A note from H.H.S. staff accompanying the data release cautions that the numbers should not discourage sick people from seeking care. “Hospitals have protocols in place to keep patients safe from exposure and to ensure all patients are prioritized for care.”

On the contrary, the numbers have calmed me a bit knowing there are still available ICU beds near me (as of 12/10) -- and perhaps I won't be triaged OUT because I'm over 65."
2020-12-16 12:39:38,"Thank you so much for this locator tool.  It means so much to us!!  You have eased my mind so much.  

We are in a rural area, ten miles from one town with one hospital, twenty from another town in another state with three hospitals, and a 2 to 3 hour drive from a city with many hospitals. I live with someone who is at very high risk of death; and have tried daily to sort through info on the ICUs - trying to always be vigilant with an updated emergency plan.  My county now has a rate of more than 160 per 100K, so it's not just a theoretical exercise.  I hope our self-quarantine etc. keeps us safe, but this additional info really peels away a level of uncertainty about what to do and where to go, if needed."
2020-12-16 12:52:38,"This is helpful but also a distortion.  Every hospital in normal circumstances has an ebb and flow of ICU care, and this should be seen as a normal baseline of activity.  Staffing at the doctor and nurse level is planned based on this.  For example, every winter, the ICU utilization will peak along with the flu season.  

So, the statistic we really need is to compare current utilization with what would normally occur.  Also, where there are regional referral patterns, the statistics should look at clusters of hospitals that have overfilled their ICU capacity.  Smaller hospitals tend to have fewer staff physicians ""on the bench"" to be able to handle an overload, so they will need to refer to larger regional facilities.  When a region fills its capacity, the situation becomes dire, and death rates will increase because of lack of resources.  On the present map, one can see the regional overload in Houston, Dallas and in several west coast cities, for example.  In contrast, the northeast is not seeing that trend.  

People living in areas with saturation of capacity, especially in the ""tertiary care hospitals"" need to take extra precaution for their own protection for these reasons."
2020-12-16 12:50:25,"Tragic.  On top of this, my mother works at a mental health hospital in Kansas City.  They have been housing and treating overlow CV19 patients there for over a month.  As bad as the situation looks according to this data visualization. It's actually worse."
2020-12-16 12:44:39,"I work with people who are developmentally disabled, many of whom, at all ages, are particularly vulnerable to this disease.  Many of my clients have died.  And I just learned yesterday of a new outbreak in one of the facilities.  Yet I feel this part of the population is never mentioned.  In some ways, their deaths are even more tragic due to their youth and number of quality years they would otherwise have left to live.  It strikes me as discriminatory that so little attention is paid, as though those lives aren’t meaningful.  But we do know that individuals with disabilities, even those with profoundly severe ones, can have long meangful lives.  Why so little attention?"
2020-12-16 12:50:14,"This is great data, however incomplete.  To make an accurate assessment of the situation we need to understand what hospital ICU bed utilization looks like pre-Covid.  In other words, how many ICU beds are typically available?  Also, how do Covid patients relate to ICU beds and total hospital beds?  The data is presented incomplete and thus allows people to make their own interpretation vs. how worse is it now than normal."
2020-12-16 13:26:10,"Most ICUs are running at 75-80% capacity most days under normal conditions.  The typical post-op patient stays 24-72 hours then is moved onto the a general ward.  The difference here is that COVID19 patients stay longer, need more precautions, and are generally harder and more complex to deal with.  Good luck to them all and really sorry to know that the already exhausted staff are going to be facing this for months longer."
2020-12-16 15:21:45,"How are there hospitals that are over 100% capacity even though others are under? Clearly there are more problems at play than just biology.

I've already lost hope though, that the employer-funded, segmented approach to human rights is going to be removed from the US any faster, due to the pandemic."
2020-12-16 15:20:28,"NYT please continue to provide this helpful data if possible. Previously it's only been readily available if a person works at one of these facilities yet it's critical information for our local communities.
Thank you."
2020-12-16 13:45:55,"Before my father died he was quite ill for a couple of years. He had to be hospitalized a few times ... I don't remember if it was 3 or 4 but every time he was admitted via the ER he had to wait for an ICU bed to open before being moved ""upstairs"" - it was always at least a day wait but on his final trip to the hospital ... the one he never returned home from he waited three days in the emergency room before a bed in the ICU became available.

My Mom, who lives West Palm Beach, the world capital of healthcare has been hospitalized twice in the past 18 months. Both times requiring stays in ICUs - both times she had to ""wait"" for beds to open up. 

Intensive Care Units filled to capacity isn't new, it isn't unusual. 

Without providing historical context for ICU capacity this story simply adds fuel to the subjective, divisive, Covid has sadly become. 

The New York Times has the resources to do better and should be."
2020-12-16 14:41:23,"Thanks to the NYT.   However, the impression is false.  The data show the percent of ICU in colors.   These colors are for ICU beds occupied, period.   The article gives the impression to a casual reader that this graphic with coloring is for  patients with a positive cover test, percent occupancy of ICU beds.  

Some hospitals have 100% occupancy of the ICU beds, but these are not  all Covid patients.  It could be 28; that looked like a high number."
2020-12-16 14:57:53,Why were IHS hospitals excluded? We know Native communities are some of the hardest hit by Covid - not including their data further marginalizes and obscures what is happening on reservations.
2020-12-16 13:56:06,"I serve on a local Wisconsin hospital Advisory Council, a Community Alternatives Board of Directors, our County Commission on Aging.  My husband taught on a Native American Public School all his career and still subs there - when the school is open. (Not yet this year - all virtual) 

I’m not rich, not anything special except being a retired RN.  And I count being a healthcare worker Special.  I honor each and every single one.  

Please, please, think of our healthcare workers.  Please, please, please wear a mask.  Social distance.  Do the things that will help those who have given their whole lives to help you.  Please."
2020-12-16 15:10:42,These numbers should be compared with the AHA survey data. The ICU bed capacity in some areas is reported as the surge capacity but not the usually staffed capacity. That is not consistent over the US so these numbers are a bit misleading. For instance Buffalo is reporting less than half capacity for covid-19 but their total reported ICU beds is at least double the normal capacity and much higher than other more populated areas.
2020-12-16 15:23:11,"I hate to be ""one of those people"", but what was the typical ICU occupancy before Covid?  When I first read about Covid driving ICU's into running out of beds, I did some searches for stories about ICU utilization prior to 2020.  It's interesting.  The two main sources of hospital data (HCRIS and AHA) did not, as of 2019, provide such numbers.  But other sources showed typical range being 53%-83% for three years prior to 2013.  These numbers help to put the current situation, even if it serves to relieve some of the element of panic in what is undoubtedly a bad situation."
2020-12-16 15:05:59,"The medical community is giving itself privileged priority to vaccinate the many millions of themselves, young and old alike.  

Instead, only medical workers over 50 should be vaccinated first, then vaccination of the entire public according to age, oldest first.  If that were the priority then within about 18 days would begin a rapid decline in deaths and in hospitalizations.  Within 30 days, hospitals would have many, many fewer beds occupied by Covid patients.  Within 90 days there would be very few Covid deaths.

Therefore, we would not need nearly as many medical workers to care for the many fewer Covid patients.  And there would be vacant beds galore in the hospitals.  

97% of Covid deaths are people over age 50.
70% of hospitalizations are people over age 50.
This despite that people under 50 generate 70% of infections.

People under 50 usually suffer only mild illness, seldom need hospitalization, and rarely die.

But the medical community is first vaccinating even the millions of its younger than 50 workers.  The result is that many thousands of elderly people will unnecessarily die during the next 90 days, and the hospitals will continue being near capacity"

The failure of national leadership on Coronavirus will be the lasting legacy of the Trump Administration (and second only to his gross incompetence will be the absolute lack of ethics and decency, including Trump's personal enrichment, his indictment with Cohen, his impeachment for twisting the arm of Ukraine for dirt on his political opponent; and we have not yet seen the full Mueller Report or audited the PPE money giveaways or investigated Barr or looked into the misdeeds of DeVos and Pompeo and the rest his cabinet, all of which should be investigated immediately and results widely and repeatedly publicized)."

2020-12-16 17:03:18,"The ability to misrepresent data in maps through data classification and symbology choices is an important thing to be aware of when creating maps. In this case I believe the choices should be reviewed.  70% capacity is likely more of an emergency than represented by your choice of light yellow.  As much as I question my own opinion here, I think it MAY be more helpful to your viewers to adjust the colors to a more alarming color scheme.  

It may also be more ""accurate"" to normalize the data based on typical ICU occupancy vs percent occupied."
2020-12-16 17:07:13,"The fact that Trump never felt the need for a coordinated national plan shows is tragic.   ICU units in the hospital  nearest to me are 97% occupied.  There are reports of a lack of staff due to illness and/or isolation due to exposure.  

Trump knew how serious this was and how easily it was transmitted early on, according to his recorded conversations with Bob Woodward, yet he played it down.  The lack of leadership on his part is inconceivable and unforgivable."
2020-12-16 15:46:41,"I am so thankful for this page and the NYT coverage of the virus with thorough information and honest reporting. 

Unfortunately, in our local county in rural W.KY, our leadership allowed over 20% to died in our LTC facility and my MIL was one of them one week ago today. I am grateful to someone or something or anything that gives us accurate information because trusting anyone in my own community is asking to be placed on a ventilator."
2020-12-16 17:57:02,"Seems like there should be an adjustment for smaller hospitals. If there are only 4 ICU beds and 3 are occupied, that doesn't seem like it should be the lowest occupancy color on the map."
2020-12-16 18:27:27,"I don’t quite understand what these numbers mean. For  example, I see two hospitals near me which both have reported ICU occupancies of about 90% with both having two remaining ICU beds available. That would seem to imply that each of these hospitals has a total of about 20 ICU beds. But on of the hospitals has 18 COVID patients and the other has 48 COVID patients, which is much more than the total number of ICU beds at the hospital (20). So is it that not all COVID patients in the listed data require ICU beds?"
2020-12-16 18:44:15,Vibra Hospital is included in the data and the average for my region even though it is a long-term acute care facility and has no ICU beds. I'm concerned that it's skewing the numbers. Thank you for this resource.
2020-12-16 19:51:01,"Looking at the comments, readers seem to be focusing on the physical ICU constraints.  I believe the true bottleneck is staffing- you can always create triage ICU's.  

Hospitals staff to their normal load - no hospital has lots of extra nurses and doctors sitting around waiting for a pandemic- they were overworked before this hit.  It takes years to train and hire professionals.  Therefore I see no solution at this point other than to support our medical professionals as best we can until the vaccines works the numbers down.  And keep that mask on."
2020-12-16 17:00:44,This is extremely sobering. I live in a metro area with ~2.2m+ people. I can count the number of available ICU beds on one hand within a 30 mile radius.
2020-12-16 17:41:54,"I don't think is at all helpful to publicize this information on the front page in such granularity. It may encourage people not to seek care from a specific hospital, or to seek out a different hospital based on this very incomplete information. I would encourage the Times to rethink this approach. A one sentence disclaimer is not enough of an action."
2020-12-16 18:51:26,"Looking at my nearest hospital, every ICU bed is occupied by a COVID patient. I had to look at their website to see how many total beds were in the ICU; that info would have been helpful as another column on this graphic. 
That being said, I just hope no one in my house needs to go there for a life-threatening emergency."
2020-12-16 20:00:27,"So, is ""Available ICU Beds"" the number of open/unoccupied  beds or is it the total number of beds the hospital has (""available"" whether occupied or not) in its ICU? 

In addition, it's not clear what portion of the overall ICU occupancy is specifically attributable to Covid.  

Let's do better."
2020-12-16 18:09:25,"It's a very interesting graphic - really impressive.  To grasp what is happening, we also - as others have pointed out - need some sort of  ICU usage baseline from non-covid times to understand what is happening. We also need to know if the hospitals reporting have restricted other procedures during this time, which might have a bearing on ICU use - -  
Still, a brilliant graphic presenting complicated information."
2020-12-16 18:17:38,I know of 2 local doctors getting this vaccine within the next 2 weeks. One is an ER doctor and the other also works with COVID patients. It is good to know they’ll be protected  as they continue their vital work. I hope the vaccines eliminate the number of doctors who fell ill or even died while bravely treating COVID patients. May they all stay well.
2020-12-16 16:44:56,Incredibly useful information.  Thank you NY Times.

2020-12-16 16:06:54,"I live in a very blue region of a red-trending purple state.  One of the reasons my area is blue is that it has the major universities and medical centers for our state (nationally-regarded). In other words, educated people who recognize science is real. Our county (except when the University let students initially come back to school at the end of summer) has been exemplary in masking, distancing, and keeping spread low, because we took this virus seriously from day 1. Tragically, the red, rural counties around us have not.  And our local hospitals are where those outlying rural areas send their serious medical cases.  So while we do the right thing, our hospitals are filling up/have reached capacity with people not doing the right thing, along with the innocent  store clerks, teachers, nurses, and neighbors those selfish/ignorant people have spread it to.  These selfish, dangerous fools should not be allowed to imperil the rest of us without consequences. But, unlike them, I'm not cruel enough to deny them medical care because they aren't the ""right"" people."
2020-12-16 20:55:08,"I fear that the virus will out run the vaccinations being planned, for the next months like a forest fire with wind at its back. Terrifying!"
2020-12-16 15:45:12,"As other commenters have pointed out, this data presents an incomplete and in some cases, a rosier picture than reality. Staffing needs to be taken into account because without nurses, an unstaffed bed isn’t going to do a whole lot of good to anyone. Staffing issues are a very real issue here in CA. Not to be all gloom and doom first thing on a Wednesday, but I’ve seen a couple comments already where people have wiped their virtual brow and said “whew! My hospital still have room for me!” If the hospital is only staffed to take care of 50 ICU beds, even though they may have 100 beds, they will only fill those 50. ICU nurses are an amazing skilled set of people who are going above and beyond to meet the demands placed upon them. But last I checked, they can’t appear out of thin air."

We go nowhere except to the curbside for groceries and gasoline, masked and shielded, and see no one except on Zoom. As geezers beyond the three-quarter-century mark but with no other risk factors, we are in line for the vaccine behind medical personnel, nursing home residents, first responders, essential workers, those with medical conditions, teachers, and prisoners, but somewhere ahead of the maskless, immortal young folks who jog past on the trail in front of our house.

I received my first dosage in the week of July 27, when Phase 3 of the Moderna trial launched and my second dosage 28 days later. The trial was conducted with scientific precision and utmost care. The same with the post-dosage monitoring. I urge everyone to take the vaccine, once approved."
2020-12-15 15:55:33,"""the risk for her of getting Covid is so much higher than the risk of a side effect""

I think that comparison really hits the nail on the head.  People will have to decide for themselves which of the two possible scenarios are a bigger fear factor.

We equate this vaccine like the flu shot.  The flu shot will NOT prevent someone from getting the flu but could very possibly lessen the symptoms if someone were to get the flu.  I got the senior shot a few months ago.  My husband was perfect after receiving it.  Later that evening I became sick with differing side effects that came and went and was in bed for three days.  But at no time did I ever feel as bad as I had last year when I got the flu.

No one knows for certain how anyone will react, or not at all, to this vaccine. We do know that almost 300,000 people have died from COVID since February.  Right now I see this vaccine as a beacon of light in the distance rather than a speeding locomotive coming right at me.

Good luck everyone.  I wish you well and a healthy holiday season."

In short, stereotyping an entire group, in this case senior citizens, is meaningless. I'm pretty sure most of us will jump at the first opportunity to get vaccinated and, finally, get out of our houses and hug our kids and grand-kids!"
2020-12-16 02:08:19,"If people don't want to be vaccinated in the middle of an epidemic, you can't force them.
There are a few desirable side effects. First, tens of millions of unwanted doses can be donated to developing countries where they will do good. Second, it may provide a lesson to others as the epidemic still rages in the antiscience crowd. And lastly, this may raise the national average IQ."

What has not been clear is whether Canada is receiving merely token shipments of doses over the next few months, as opposed to the more substantial per capita dose amounts that Britain and the US appear to be receiving. There is a concern that, since we have to import it from Belgium and the US, we may not be 'front of the line' despite the millions of doses on order."
2020-12-18 01:22:55,"The NYT is trying to pander to what they think their readership wants to hear, following the Murdoch format that all American media now use. Fact and perspective is irrelevant. WaPo and Fox also falsely panned Canada toda for other reason and silliness. 
1. Canada has had 12,800 cases per million to date. The USA has had 53,000 or 4 times as much.
2. Canada has a Covid-19 fatality rate of 367 per million. The USA has had 957 per million die. 
In a nutshell, if the USA had Canada's common sense, there would be 200,000 more Americans alive and 13,000,000 million Americans would not have become sick. 
The days of Murrow and Cronkite are long gone."
2020-12-19 18:43:25,"The US pop. is 328 million. If a 70% immunity rate protects the 'herd', 230 M need a vaccine or recovery from infection to achieve it. At 0.3% fatality rate, multiply the number of deaths by 333 to arrive at the immune figure. About 106 M now have some immunity. With the current 3,000 dead per day average, another 30 M are becoming immune per month. Without the impact of vaccines, the US may have effective herd immunity by late April.

 With the slow rollout predicted so far (hackers are already targeting the computerized tracking system), vaccines will likely only reduce that by a month or so, although they WILL save the lives of some of the most vulnerable, and give health care and front line workers protection from infection. If vaccines go to the worst affected areas first, many will be 'wasted' on people who already have immunity through recovery from infection, further reducing their impact. 

I'm not passing judgement or making recommendations, simply tabulating figures based on data currently published in the media and drawing a few conclusions. The situation in the UK, Spain, Italy and France is similar. 

Based on the above, US deaths may exceed 600 k directly from COVID, with another 200 - 300 k from 'extra' deaths due to lack of timely medical care, opioid overdoses, suicides, etc.. With continued outbreaks over the summer and fall, nearly 1 million Americans could lose their lives to the pandemic. Aggressive measures can significantly  reduce that number."

Thus, the Black Death of medieval Europe from cohabiting rodents, AIDS from wild monkey bushmeat from equatorial Africa, the 1918 worldwide influenza plague from a Kansas farm, the 1993 hantavirus outbreak in the southwestern US from wild rodents, the 2002 SARS epidemic from Chinese meat markets, the 2014 MERS outbreak in Saudi Arabia from captive camels, the Ebola virus from exposure to tropical African apes in 2014, now the Covid virus from wet market in China. 

Renovation of agriculture involving land-based animals and birds, and the exotic animal trade, is badly needed. But we do not pay attention. More pandemics are sure to come, and we are not prepared."

That leaves open the possibility that there will be excess vaccines in different places in the country if those in the first group choose to wait.

2020-12-14 12:54:42,"Research into effective methodologies for influencing behavior—including, for example, changing attitudes towards climate change—has shown that a science-based approach is not sufficient on its own. Emotionally impactful, stirring human stories are what's needed to engage people and inspire them to get the vaccine—content that will connect directly with all of us through our shared humanity, and stir empathy. Most people are then more likely to be open to scientific fact if they have experienced an emotional ""unlocking"" in response to stories, and only then consider a behavioral change/decision."
2020-12-14 15:03:25,"Are we forgetting that it is much too early for actual FDA approval of these vaccines? We are currently defining efficacy using of n of less than 200. This would never fly in peer review. The vaccines are currently under Emergency Use Authorization, which means that the risks are so high for some that they warrant participation in what is essentially phase 4 of the clinical trial. There's nothing wrong with this, but it's important for people to understand it."
2020-12-14 15:42:46,"To say the vaccine ""has been developed in record time"" is (I get it) a point of pride. But it is also scary to many people who think they're being asked to be ""lab rats.""

In a recent video with one of the key CDC players, an important point was made that the vaccine now in distribution is a refinement/variation on a class of vaccines that have been getting developed over the last 17 years.

I can't attest to the truth of this. But it fits with other things I know about previous vaccines. If this is the case, it's an important fact to keep putting out there.  This COVID19 vaccine is not something devised DE NOVO in the last 11 months.

There's much more history to it."
2020-12-14 15:43:07,"Speaking as a physician, the vaccine rollout thus far has been plagued with shortcomings undermining confidence. I have taken part in several recent gatherings of medical professionals, and the interest in vaccine uptake has been dismal; although most of us are open eventually to taking the vaccine, less than a fifth have been willing to do so straight away (and thus are unwilling to recommend this for our own patients), largely due to concerns that remain unaddressed by recent data releases and FDA EUA review. The mRNA vaccine technology has never been used in human patients before, and without long-term safety data (5-10 years) as virtually every other vaccine has had, we're skating on thin ice as compared to ex. a vaccine based on more conventional technology with a longer track record, even aside from ""unknowns that are unknown"".
For example: What, exactly, is the tropism of the lipid nanoparticles (LNPs') used to deliver the mRNA vaccine, and why is this not being measured in the trial volunteers? Without getting too technical, traditional vaccines (ex. killed virus and subunit) tend to be taken up by specialized antigen presenting cells. But the LNP's are apparently able to enter any cell in the body, including many almost never infected by viruses, which raises pointed questions about long-term autoimmunity or deadly inflammation (seen in the animal studies). We've also had questions about recombination potential and ADE, but these have largely gone unanswered."

2020-12-14 13:57:46,"""The campaign is on an extremely tight timeline."" And that is why I don't trust it. Everything surrounding its release has been excessively rushed. We barely understand the virus, much less the vaccine. No one knows for sure it is safe.  I'm not an antivaxxer: I even participated in a long term anthrax vaccine trial. Obama and Dr. Fauci can say ""It's safe: trust us"" a million times. I trust science, and no matter how severe a disease is, science takes time. I will continue to wear masks and socially distance until I see longer term  results."
2020-12-14 12:12:15,"We should look for creative solutions to overcome public distrust rather than relying on an old-fashion (and expensive) publicity campaign.  

For instance, maybe a few hundreds vaccine dosages should be auctioned off, in a televised auction, now to the NFL team, NBA team, pro golfer, pro tennis player, or other professional athletes or teams who would be willing to pay the most and be vaccinated in the next few weeks in public view. Unlike other high-earners who can work from home, professional athletes usually need to travel and physically interact in order to compete. Also the physical demands of their profession often means that their years of peak performances are very limited. It is difficult for them to make up for lost earnings due to a lost season. They have strong incentives to be vaccinated a few months earlier and can therefore benefit greatly from such a scheme. 

Such a scheme would also be extremely valuable for promoting vaccination. The proceeds of the auction can be used to raise public interests and awarenesses. Instead of paying for celebrity speakers as in a typical campaign, we now have speakers paying dearly for the privilege. More importantly, watching numerous pro athletes, who are idolized and emulated across our social divides, hotly bidding in a televised auction for the privilege of being vaccinated may persuade some doubters to sign up for the privilege as well. It would be much more convincing and effective that a typical celebrity endorsement."
2020-12-14 16:02:58,"The logic of this escapes me. We've got millions of elderly and people with medical conditions who can't wait to get a vaccine that's in very short supply. Why are we encouraging those who don't want the vaccine to get in line now?

Campaigns to get people vaccinated should wait until there is sufficient supply for people who want it.

Yes, I do understand that we ultimately want everyone vaccinated for the good of society. I'm just talking about the order in which this is done. Let's first get vaccine to people who want it."
2020-12-14 17:05:18,"As a person who trusts science and expertise, I plan to get vaccinated the very day it is made available to me. That said, I'm struggling to understand  how this administration thinks that it is going to be able to sway people one way or the other on this issue. To say that there has been mixed messaging coming from our president is a bit of an understatement. I haven't the foggiest idea what this chaos factory stands for at this point. And if I were someone who was on the fence about getting inoculated, the Trump administration would be the last source I turned to for guidance."

Now he tries to convince us we should quick get a vaccine, promoted by the leader of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, a man who was a lobbyist for pharmaceuticals, no medical education.

I’m a nurse.  I’m elderly.  I have a health condition which puts me at risk.  I’ve been living a life of isolation for nine months and have not been infected.  

In the meanwhile this president, who calls the November 3rd election a fraud, when clearly he lost, says I should be ok to get this COVID vaccine.

But they are certain COVID 19 will keep causing serious medical problems for many millions and death for millions of others. No question about that.

Neither our lives nor our economies will return to normal until we stop the spread.  If the virus keeps circulating it will eventually find you and your loved ones.  No question about that either.

So let’s all join together, roll up our sleeves, take the vaccine and beat this virus."

They rationalized it by saying first responders needed them. How is that not disingenuous and subject to making us cynical and doubting? Anyway, if people don’t want the vaccine, fine. Let’s get everyone who does vaccinated first. Deal with the others later."
2020-12-14 15:22:04,"This so-called plan exemplifies the haplessness of the Trump Administration. Their initial ideas were completely tone-deaf and self serving, clearly intended to boost Trump's campaign. The delusional thinking behind their plan to enlist celebrities met up with reality when out of 274 entertainers, only 10 were sufficiently supportive (or at least not outwardly opposed) to Trump. A shifting cast of characters - all inexperienced and less than competent couldn't work together to develop a strategy, and likely had no consistent direction from the president or his senior aides. Did it occur to this team that an administration that has downplayed the pandemic, lied about it, and promoted dangerous cures might not have much credibility? And now they're rolling out what might be a reasonable plan, but it's likely too little, too late."
2020-12-14 16:13:12,"I would like to know more about the contractor entrusted with this $250M effort.

We know the Trump administration has been leaning on its agencies for four years -- in particularly, any agency with a scientific mission (the EPA, the CDC, the FDA, NOAA, the DOE). Who's to say HHS isn't leaning on this contractor to produce certain results? Who's to say we can trust any of this research? The contractor is literally being paid, by a government many of us believe is corrupt, to produce ""persuasive research"" convincing people to get the COVID vaccine. Shouldn't people be allowed to make this decision for themselves? The article itself describes the contractor as a market research company. They're not scientists or medical professionals. 

If HHS wanted to provide reliable information to the public, they should have produced an education campaign themselves backed by doctors, CDC researchers, scientists, pharmacists, etc. Instead, they just farmed it out to another overpaid, inside-the-beltway moneymaker to create some slick PR ads. 

That's our government, looking out for us as always..."
2020-12-14 12:17:56,"I'm baffled by the quantity of news stories trying to convince vaccine skeptics to get vaccinated.

Have these journalists and editors not noticed that there is an extreme *shortage* of vaccines???

All this coverage does is reinforce to skeptics that they are in good company.

Reinforcing the shortage of vaccines could make them more desirable. Plus, it's the truth. 

If vaccine skeptics skip the shot, so what? There are so many high-risk people who desperately need the paltry 25 million doses that are on the way. It's not like they won't find takers.

Best strategy is to take the skeptic conversation for now and let the fight for the vaccine play out. By the time we've vaccinated the 50% to 60% of people who desperately want the vaccine RIGHT NOW, we'll be 6 months into this and have ample data on even the most rare vaccine side effects.

The best way to ""convince"" the skeptics is to let them see what happens to the first, say, 100 million people who are eager for the shot and get it. Not to mention letting them see how these people don't get sick and can get on with their lives."
2020-12-14 13:23:30,"The bigger issue will be convincing vaccinated Americans to keep wearing masks and physically distancing until enough of their fellow Americans have been vaccinated that case numbers go into a sharp and self-sustaining decline.

 I will take a vaccine when it's my turn because technical infromation is available,in layman's terms, on the basic research begun a decade ago on new RNA based inovations on creating new vaccines. 
There are little detailed available data on how recent election procedural changes in swing states could have,or would not have affected the outcome...just a narrative amounting to ""nothing to see here"" trust us.

I am filled with pride to see the huge volumes of precious cargo being transported and delivered across the nation, knowing this is all the result of American company managements creating seamless, coordinated systems and American workers getting the job done.

Seeing this occur has lifted my spirits from the depression of my contempt for and total loss of trust in the government's CDC for the priority of vaccination it dictates, a priority which I regard as unethical and immoral.  And, I regard the medical community as unethical and hypocritical for implementing the CDC's immoral priority for vaccination."

2020-12-14 15:39:35,"I find it rather difficult to understand the justification for the victory lap being taken now  by the U S government and Trump in particular, over the successful development of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the corona virus. Here are the facts as can be gleaned from information available in the public domain. This vaccine was developed by the biotechnology firm, BioNTech located in Mainz, Germany which subsequently coopted Pfizer to conduct the necessary clinical trials and scale up the manufacture if and when the vaccine is finally approved by the concerned regulators in various countries. The CEO of Pfizer has asserted on several occasions that his company had neither sought nor received any financial assistance from any government on the world, including the US. The clinical trials have been simultaneously  conducted in several countries and not exclusively in the US. The development of this specific vaccine  therefore, has been nothing more than a vanilla type, commercial one launched and managed by a consortium of a private biotechnology research company and a private pharmaceutical company. What all the Trump administration is doing now is to distribute, just as other governments like the UK have already commenced doing, the vaccine manufactured by Pfizer and delivered to them. Where, then, is the scope, against this backdrop,  for Trump and his ""warp speed"" effort to beat their drums as if they were solely responsible for the successful development of this vaccine?"
2020-12-14 16:59:31,"I'm baffled that the first vaccinated in the US are health care workers -- indeed, it would seem, even just any kind of worker in an hospital. The great majority of them are not vulnerable to the worst effects of the virus. Nor, so far as I've read, is there any strong evidence that they are sources of transmission to their patients. 

In the UK, it was the genuinely most vulnerable -- nursing home residents -- who got the first doses. 

Do those in the UK care more about their vulnerable elderly than we do?"

2020-12-14 14:20:40,"The Trump administration once again is a textbook case in poor or absent leadership. He has spent the better part of the last year telling the country “it’s just the flu,” dismissing masks as useless or as somehow hurting your “liberty” and constitutional rights, and spouting conspiracy theories and anti-science nonsense. NOW, only after our nation tragically and unnecessarily leads the world in deaths and covid cases, with countless people dying as a direct result of his utter contempt for leadership, he wants to claim victory for the vaccine and its acceptance by the nation.  Yesterday, when the White House was paving the way for staff who work closely with Trump to get the vaccine first, I was dumbfounded. How can the same people who peddled death and disease to us for nearly a year claim the right and need to jump ahead of medical personnel and other truly essential workers?  I will never forget, forgive, or trust Trump and all his enablers. However, I will get the vaccine as soon as I am able, based on the science and independent scientists, like Dr. Fauci."
2020-12-14 13:16:38,"As a black man, I am still hoping to get my vaccine as soon as possible. 

For one, they are done with clinical trails. The vaccine has already been tested on tens of thousands.

Another reason is that the vaccine isn’t targeted at any one group. It is for the human race to gain herd immunity. For there to be herd immunity, we need 70% of people to get vaccinated. It benefits more than the person vaccinated when a person gets the vaccine. It is a step towards herd immunity for the human race.

Another reason is at least one black scientist was involved in the work on one of the vaccines.

In spite of the history of experimentation on blacks and minorities,  we as blacks should be able to trust that this vaccine was created to provide immunity for everyone against the coronavirus and will help us from having the disproportionate negative outcomes from the virus."

""But the president’s role in promoting vaccination would be extremely contentious. It would come after months in which he played down the threat of the virus, railed against common-sense measures like mask wearing to slow the spread of the disease and embraced bogus therapeutics that health professionals said were unproven and potentially dangerous."""

If Trump can get on camera and convince his followers to get the vaccine and why, he just might redeem some of his reputation. Maybe he should get the first shot."
2020-12-14 15:21:10,Trump spent his presidency denying science and contradicting medical experts. Don't get vaccinated by his say-so. Get vaccinated because the medical experts he dismisses are telling us to do so.
2020-12-14 16:08:30,"First, the bandwagon approach (once vaccine availability and distribution aspects are addressed): EVERYBODY’S doing it!  It’s the thing to do, all the rage!  Join the crowd, hop on the bandwagon, and roll up your sleeve. Illustrate the snowball effect.

Support it with a catchy, terrific, and omnipresent song (quite difficult to do at this time of year, but somewhat easier after Christmas music season is over in a few weeks). There is probably nobody today universally popular enough to present the song, so use various versions performed by various artists, all singing the same song... and ultimately, singing it together on tv for New Year’s Eve, at the Inaugeration, football games.

Trump seems to have gotten past the celebrity endorsement concept because too many celebrities see him for the jerk he is.  But wait! It’s not too late!  The celebrities employed need to be individuals with credibility among those the data show will be hardest to reach and persuade - that is, hardcore antivaxxers and Trump’s reactionary  supporters. Enlist conservative religious leaders, fringe politicians, gun rights activists, and brutal dictators from around the world - perhaps some of the Proud Boys will man up and roll up to fight Covid! 

If that doesn’t work, it’s still possible to create a cartoon character as an endorsement figure - like Ready Kilowatt, Mr. Peanut, or bring Aunt Jemima out of her enforced retirement.

As Trump’s children say, Where there’s a will, there’s a way!"
2020-12-14 13:42:51,"So, they worked overtime undermining science, ridiculing the protocols, seeding conflict and reactionary behavior, and now, seizing an eleventh hour opportunity in order to get credit for any subsequent reduction in this pandemic, they're going all in on an education campaign...forgive my disgust. They will come up against an irrational populace made so precisely because of all the work they did to destroy science and reason. Good luck with that. I'm just going to note the irony."
2020-12-14 15:31:42,"I have to say, it's to Mr. Trump's credit that he has tweeted that neither he and White House staff will be among the first to be vaccinated, contradicting the initial announcement, but will wait their turn until the ""appropriate time.""

I was angered at the news that politicos would get the vaccine first before medical personnel and schoolteachers. Mollified somewhat.

Now please tweet that you have lost the election and plan to attend Mr. Biden's inauguration, acknowledging that the office of the president, and not the man, is the main point of a republic."
2020-12-14 15:58:22,"Gosh...if they'd put even half as much effort into promoting mask wearing as they have in getting a overdue pro-vaccine education campaign off the ground, we might not be needing to place all our hopes in the vaccine basket. I'm just waiting for trump's wink-and-nod towards his anti-vacc'er supporters."
2020-12-14 13:01:55,"I hate to be a downer at such a promising moment, but I fear that Trump will merely watch poll data and react in whatever manner promotes his own interests.  Based on his normal behavior, I cannot believe that he would suddenly change his stripes and responsibly, consistently and without self-interest, support the vaccination effort from start to finish for the public good.  Yes he desperately wants to take credit for Operation Warp Speed, but remember that Trump has embraced anti-vaxxers, and if he suspects for one minute that the public is either losing confidence in the program or crediting Democrats for its success, he will return to form and sow fear and doubt in an effort to undercut public confidence.  It’s what he does best.  So it is in our best interest to stoke that man’s ego as if our lives depended on it, because they do."
2020-12-14 14:19:22,"All I can say is, thank the almighty lord that Joe Biden is coming to literally save our lives. He's not a panacea, and of course I have disagreement with his policies, but who in their right mind would trust this administration to get anything right. Or any Republican at this point. It enrages me ... probably to the point of unhealthiness so I'll stop."
2020-12-14 15:33:00,"Asked my sister, who is a virologist and professor at a prominent national medical school, which of the three leading vaccine candidates she would take. Her response “the first one they offer to me”. That’s a good enough endorsement for me."
2020-12-14 12:44:01,"An administration that said the coronavirus was just the flu and would magically disappear is going to try to encourage vaccination.

This administration has been against science from its start and it has flouted scientific recommendations to date. We do not need it to now recognize science."
2020-12-14 13:31:21,"Does the Trump administration really think that, after all the denial, all the flagrant public abuse of the real science, the endless debasement of the same people who have been trying so hard to encourage preventive measures, the constant flouting of guidelines, that they can make a case to trust them?"
2020-12-14 15:27:22,"""Campaign to encourage Americans to take the coronavirus vaccine?"" - Why? Are they not willing to get vaccinated and protect themselves by a possible virus threat? Or are they so adamant? I just do not understand, why this campaign?"
2020-12-14 13:24:47,"Public education should include clear information that vaccination only, is not the magic wand. The vaccine's first dose is not 95% effective. We must continue following the proper use of masks and distance. Avoiding close spaces with not known people. Remembering that not everybody infected has symptoms. People, in general, are not afraid of the vaccine and they do not need to see the rich and famous getting the vaccine first"
2020-12-14 14:08:43,"Nearly a year into this pandemic with hundreds of thousands dead and billions spent on the vaccine program and the Trump administration finally notices a problem? 

The irony of Trump and his base also being the core of the anti-vaxxer movement has been clear to those of us who have actually been watching this tragedy unfold for quite some time indeed."
2020-12-14 15:38:40,As soon as people start getting vaccinated the conspiracy theorists and trolls will be rolling out their horror stories of vaccination gone wrong. It is inevitable. Any campaign that is rolled out to encourage people to accept the vaccination must also address and disprove conspiracy theories.
2020-12-14 12:12:06,"Just imagine if president trump had taken COVID-19 seriously at the very beginning instead of comparing it to the flu; if he had immediately instituted a program to inform the public of the dangers of the disease, listened to scientists and taken the precautions that people now take, how much better we would have been, how many fewer people would have died? But he did virtually nothing."
2020-12-14 13:02:57,"A person close to me was told to work all weekend on the roll out and the material would be delivered some time Saturday. Who knew we would be distributing vaccines one day? Yes, everyone. Another example of the Trump administration’s continued botched handling of the pandemic."
2020-12-14 13:57:21,"We need about 80% of people to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.  Without herd immunity, people who can't be vaccinated (e.g. those who are immunocompromised, such as cancer patients on chemotherapy) will have no protection.

Trump has stopped even pretending to be the president when he lost the election.  He wants credit for the vaccines, even though the credit should go to the scientists who developed them.  His only essential role was to prepare the public to accept vaccination.

Did anyone really think that he'd do his job when all he cares about is destroying democracy to get a second term after losing the election?"
2020-12-14 12:19:18,Had Donald Trump and his administration taken the COVID-19 virus seriously from the beginning of the pandemic they wouldn’t have to try persuading people to take the vaccine. He called it a hoax and laid the seed of disbelief in the minds of his followers. Too little to late.
2020-12-14 14:11:12,Let us hope that the pro-vaccine campaign will work. We need one campaign in Canadas too.
2020-12-14 12:36:34,"The problem with anything coming out of the white house is that people will think it's a scam and not want to have anything to do with it.

Maybe if Dr. Fauci leads the charge people might accept it, but not if Trump's pushing it."
2020-12-14 12:44:56,"The best education plan would be a televised lineup of Trump, Pence, McConnell, McCarthy, Pelosi, Schumer, Biden, and Harris , as well as Fauci, Radford, and Hann getting vaccinated. Either they believe in the vaccine and vaccinations, or they don’t."
2020-12-14 15:22:01,Very important initiative. Monitoring  the Twitter comments for Fox and Breitbart I see most Trump supporters will not get vaccinated.
2020-12-14 17:09:33,"Hmm. Interesting that those ""high-risk Americans"" begin with the fat cats on the White House staff.

Given the administration's responsibility for the vast number of unnecessary deaths from Covid, I'm still enraged that Trump should even have been treated for his infection, given that so many others were denied it."
2020-12-14 14:22:35,"Expect a strategy of perpetuating a sense of denial, resulting in a public outrage at being denied the vaccine due to station, age or occupation.  Soon people will be rushing for a vaccine as if it were a pair of Michael Jordan sneakers."
2020-12-14 14:48:33,"What we need is a large-scale education campaign to educate Trump. Honestly, the last thing we need is him and his bunch of clowns telling us what’s good for us. My take is that I’m getting the vaccine. If you want to die, that’s your business. 

But the reality will hit when in 6 months you can’t do anything from get on a plane to go to dinner to go to the movies without being vaccinated. Once People realize they can’t waddle into Denny’s or Water Safari without getting the vaccine, we will become an educated society quite quickly."
2020-12-14 15:08:38,"After 9 months of downplaying the Corona virus and effectively saying it was just a Democratic ploy to make Trump look bad, now his administration is trying to reverse the tide. There are 74 million people out there who voted for him and a large portion are Covid deniers, antivaxers, and flat earthers. It will be very hard to get them to change their minds as Trumps rhetoric has been repeated so many times, it is all they believe. Good luck changing that."
2020-12-14 13:22:47,"All virus deniers, science deniers, and anti-maskers belong at the back of the line.  That includes every member of the Trump administration, the Trump family, and Tump’s GOP mouthpieces. To suggest that they all stand ahead of Americans battling this virus despite a complete lack of presidential leadership is an affront of epic proportion."
2020-12-14 13:34:08,"We are approaching 300,000 dead Americans and now he and his super-spreading, non-mask-wearing appointees are rushing vaccine distribution and have put themselves at the front of the line (although they have always said the virus was a hoax).  Nothing is more predictable than taxes and Republican hypocrisy.  Republicans lie and Americans die. It's been this way since Nixon's corrupt administration."
2020-12-14 14:53:19,I think most of the people ( 61   percent) in America will take the vaccine. The question is will the WH take the opportunity to step forward without a “ wink wink” approach is the real question.
2020-12-14 15:26:34,It would be nice if there were a comparable campaign to encourage mask wearing.
2020-12-14 15:32:18,"Call me cynical, but will 45 take it, and THEN take credit?"
2020-12-14 16:44:34,"Reagan poisoned the politics of this nation when he sold the BIG LIE that ""Government is the problem, not the solution."" Too many Americans have swallowed that political bait, hook line and sinker, especially the Republican Party.

The BIG REALITY is that those we elect to represent us are the problem, not the government our founders created to better  serve us.  Under Trump, he and his appointed minions along with a do nothing Senate are the whole problem and represent nothing but the problem which is them, not the institution.

The pandemic and our national debacle of an election have combined to provide the perfect stage on which to display that reality.

The contrast could not be more evident as Trump ignores the pandemic while subverting the election with his constant lies and fantasies while Biden, not even in office yet, is moving forward to lead in beating the pandemic down and try to united a divided nation.

Meantime, Trump sulks and tweets and stirs up his ""base"" and the senators we elected to serve us do nothing but argue among themselves and take long recesses as We the People and our economy literaly crash and burn under the weight of Covid 19.

No Mr. Reagan, government is not the problem.  The people in govenment who want to obstruct it for their own advantage are the problem.

Since we elected them, it is really We who are the problem because so many of us  believe Reagan's BIG LIE."
2020-12-14 16:49:38,"Okay so hold on.

What a reversal."
2020-12-14 13:40:38,"Like masks, vaccines protect not just you but your family, friends, and community, but only if at least 70% of us get vaccinated.  This is a matter of science, not politics."
2020-12-14 15:18:24,"To get people to take it, they first have to acknowledge that the pandemic is real. They spent months telling everyone that this was a Democrat plot. Now they have to admit that was a lie and a smear campaign against Democrats. They don't want to do that.

Now Trump wants credit for developing a vaccine that wasn't necessary (if the virus is a Democrat hoax)--but he wants credit for it anyway! Good things happening--""I did it! I did it!--bad things happening...well...that's someone else's fault.

It's hard to flip your message 180. It causes confusion. And confused people will then choose to do nothing because they don't know who to trust.

Trust this: if you catch someone in a lie (like Trump), then you know all you need to. They are not trustworthy.

Listen to other people, like scientists."
2020-12-14 14:57:48,"Our outgoing ""president"" has spent the last 11 months denying science and promoting quackery yet he now wants Americans to believe in Covid vaccines. His supporters are already screaming that they will eschew the vaccine. Fantastic, more doses available for sane people."
2020-12-14 19:27:02,"The rush to condemn this vaccine in this comment section is disturbing. I've studied and listened to a lot of doctors and other experts, and it all looks OK to me.

It reminds me of climate science denial. People can sound expert without having the right skill set to evaluate this work. And in some cases the arguments, while using numbers and technical terms, do not match data I've seen elsewhere.

I'm a layperson, but I trust Dr. Fauci and the team of experts chosen by PE Biden far more than people venting in this comment section.

We need to work together rather than labeling and condemning based on limited information. Right now, we're looking at enough anti-vaxxers to destroy the community healing that can happen if we all do what we can and must to get past this."
2020-12-14 18:54:22,"The inverse correlation between knowing the facts about Covid vaccination safety and efficacy and wanting to be vaccinated is clear. Unfortunately, many more Republicans than Democrats are showing what happens when you ignore facts and instead, embrace misinformation. 

My friend's daughter just completed her ED residency and was immediately plunged into to the onslaught of seriously ill Covid-19 victims arriving at the emergency department of a major medical center. Her family refuses to recognize the inadequate support that our federal government's political leadership has provided. This heroic, newly trained doctor is 29 years old and she is terrified while she awaits vaccination, hopefully within the next two or three weeks. The family is fractured which is very sad."
2020-12-14 18:52:32,"The people attempting to publicly shame others into taking the vaccine should be among the first to get it.  Fauci should be getting a shot today on live television instead of making the cop out statement he will get the vaccine when it is made available to him.  And it should be the genuine vaccine, not an ""Obama drinking Flint water"" exercise.   Don't tell anyone else to do something you are not willing to do TODAY."
2020-12-14 19:13:47,Chamalah said she won’t take the Trump Vaccine so her supporters should refuse same.
2020-12-14 19:25:10,It seems like a waste to spend money on this now. Let those of us who have been patiently waiting for and wanting this vaccine to get one before you convert the nonbelievers who have made this pandemic much worse than it should have been. Wait until there is a surplus of vaccines to advertise.
2020-12-14 19:22:09,"Thanks but no thanks. People I know who are leaning towards not taking the vaccine say it's because of Trump trying to take credit, which discredits the care scientists and doctors have taken to make sure the trial is legit.

This goes double for the black and brown community, who are tired of being victimized and being the biggest sufferers, without getting help."
2020-12-14 18:24:39,"If they tell me to do it, its the opposite of what I will do."
2020-12-14 18:54:48,"There are plenty of democrats here to answer this question: “why should trump assign any credit for the vaccine to Biden? What exactly has Biden done to develop and distribute the vaccine?” 

Thanks for the honest responses."
2020-12-14 17:35:42,So they're going to rush now to try to undo the damage they did in the first place.
2020-12-14 17:53:40,"Trump admin planning to have a campaign to encourage folks to take the vaccine.   why?  it suits  them now.

Having spend a year downplaying the virus threat and lacking a national strategy to limit the spread of covid-19, this administration is ill suited to carry this message."
2020-12-14 18:25:42,"Good luck with that.  Trump spent almost a year contradicting CDC guidelines both in words and actions.   Trump politicized the mask, creating a bogus personal liberty issue instead of a  public health safety issue.  He chose to forego the mask, and spatial distancing setting an example for his supporters to follow.  He advocated the use of  unapproved medications and had the government stock up on hydroxychloroquine when he had no scientific evidence proving its effectiveness. 
 
Trump cemented distrust in science and governmental institutions with lies and conspiracies for nearly 4 years.  Even now despite the election being a settled event, he's still claiming he won.

How will he possibly square that circle by encouraging Americans to get vaccinated with the COVID vaccine.  
I'm not a betting person but I feel sure Trump will NOT elect to be vaccinated, claiming he doesn't need it since he already had COVID.  

His base in large numbers will refuse the vaccine.  Anti-vaxxers and the skeptical, and the uncertain will not rush to be vaccinated until time shows how safe it is."
2020-12-14 18:45:43,"It would be best if he would stay away from endorsing this vaccine. After all of the snake oil sales pitches of ultraviolet lights, bleach and other at best useless if not harmful products his endorsement of this vaccine will only suppress participation.  The voters have spoken and he is not fit to lead in any capacity."
2020-12-14 17:35:55,"If you're actually significantly vulnerable to the disease, the ultimate argument for getting vaccinated will be hearing about the needless deaths of many in the same boat as you, who also refused to be vaccinated.

Don't be that person."
2020-12-14 19:00:52,"It's just beautiful how this Administration needs to be reminded about such important components of a vaccination campaign. We've had to have public outreach on most situations like this in American History.  Hiw could this have been a surprise?  If it's so important to these idiots to win elections and stay in office, then they should really do us all the courtesy of learning how to operate the government and do actual work."
2020-12-14 22:44:20,"Apparently I've understated the number of people who won't get effectively vaccinated. It's not only the ""anti-vaxxers"" and the few who get the virus even though they've been vaccinated (the Pfizer vaccine is only 95.7% effective, after all, and that percentage could drop when final results are in).

Apparently a third group should be added to the list: Those who won't get the Pfizer vaccine because Trump recommends it. Kamala Harris is in this group, for example. 

That increases considerably the number of people who won't get effectively vaccinated."
2020-12-14 22:33:03,"Comments like this one suggest that some readers don't know that vaccinations will be free:

""It seems like a waste to spend money on this now."""
2020-12-14 22:24:50,"Agreed:

""The rush to condemn this vaccine in this comment section is disturbing.""

Frankly, I can't imagine NOT getting vaccinated when my turn comes. I won't change my behavior right away, but I'm persuaded that the Pfizer vaccine is at least safe (the Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials aim at that). Unless one is an ""anti-vaxxer"" (I'm not), why NOT get vaccinated ASAP?"
2020-12-14 22:53:19,"This reader apparently hasn't been paying attention:

""If you're actually significantly vulnerable to the disease, the ultimate argument for getting vaccinated will be hearing about the needless deaths...""

Apparently there are MORE people than I'd ever imagined who won't get effectively vaccinated. I'd always understood that ""anti-vaxxers"" wouldn't get vaccinated at all, and I'd always understood that some people who do get vaccinated will nevertheless get the virus (and infect others) because no vaccine is 100% effective. 

These two groups are fairly small. But apparently there's a very large THIRD group: people who will refuse to be vaccinated simply because Trump recommends that they do. Kamala Harris, for example, says she won't get any vaccine that Trump recommends. Presumably at least some of her supporters will do the same.

Foolhardy or not, that's reality. And reality is what we have to deal with."
2020-12-14 23:07:35,"One reader writes:

""I'm a layperson, but I trust Dr. Fauci and the team of experts chosen by PE Biden far more than people venting in this comment section.""

I think Dr. Fauci is PRO-vaccine, whether Trump recommends it or not. 

I'm a layperson too, and I don't plan to do what Trump tells me to do. I do, however, plan to do what Fauci recommends, whether or not Trump also does."
2020-12-14 22:14:48,"It was inevitable, I suppose: Various groups jockeying for special treatment in vaccine delivery, pushing down other groups on the priority list. (The NYT, for example, has two other stories about longshoremen (even young ones) and White House staffers asking for special treatment (the second story since retracted). Longshoremen indeed are special (White House staffers are not), but so are members of several other groups.) Though the sequence was set long ago (and it strikes me as fair_, obviously this can change, and various groups are demanding special treatment. 

Whether or not the vaccination sequence changes, by the end of next summer (2021), everyone who wants a vaccination will have got one, and there will be only two groups left that aren't protected:

1. Those who choose not to be vaccinated -- the ""anti-vaxxers"" for example.

2. Those who’ve been vaccinated but nevertheless get sick because vaccines sometimes don't work (for example, preliminary data shows Pfizer’s works only 95.7% of the time).

Combined, these two groups will be fairly small, and getting sick will require, after all, that both persons – the infectee and the infecter – not be effectively vaccinated. Essentially, the pandemic will be a thing of the past, fairly soon. 

The message (which I will heed): be patient. Feel free to ask for priority, but don’t get too upset if you’re not moved up the list. They’ll soon get to you."
2020-12-14 21:50:33,"On the #ABCNews in Sydney today, Dr Norman Swan said that the American approach of vaccinating against covid 19 in so small numbers, runs the risk of the virus adapting and mutating to survive . Here in Australia they plan to vaccinate everybody to eradicate covid 19 transmissability."
2020-12-14 20:20:25,"It's a little rich seeing many of the same people who did everything they could to undermine credibility in Trump, by distorting what Trump said into something he clearly did not, now declaring that it is he who is fully responsible for the lack of credibility when it comes to combating Covid.

No, he didn't say that we should inject bleach into our systems. No, he did not say that Covid itself (rather than how Democrats were using it to attack him) was a hoax.

Every time people repeat these false accusations, it is they -- not Trump -- who deserve the blame for ginning up fear of the vaccine developed under his watch."
2020-12-14 21:15:46,"The Trump administration should take the 250 million they are wasting of taxpayers' money on a public education campaign and pay people $1,000 to get the vaccines so we can get to herd immunity."

2020-12-15 02:25:33,"I'll wait until the Germans approve it and I see Angela Merkel getting a shot. Not that it really matters since I'm not a first responder and wouldn't be able to get it right away anyway. Both the US and UK have destroyed their credibility through poor handling of the pandemic. The Canadians are probably trustworthy, but I think Germany is the country to watch."
2020-12-15 02:15:03,"To her credit, Kamala Harris did say she'd be vaccinated if scientists recommend that, even if Trump also does. 

Not so with her supporters, though. Many of them see only that Trump has recommended the Pfizer vaccine, and so they won't take it -- even if scientists happen to agree with Trump this time. 

Foolish (and dangerous to others) it may be, but that's reality. Maybe Kamala Harris can persuade her supporters to take the Pfizer vaccine, but maybe not. For the moment, many of them are not inclined to take it."
2020-12-15 02:39:46,"This should have started months ago with a focus on African American, Latino, & Native American communities. Trump's politicization of the vaccine was very unhelpful."
2020-12-15 04:17:00,"Maybe Trump should take complete ownership and responsibility for the Pfizer vaccine, have huge public awareness campaigns with big country stars endorsing him and his vaccine, have motorcycle rallies with Trump vaccine themes, etc.  Everything Trump and the Pfizer vaccine.

Biden can do the same with Moderna’s.  He made the vaccine, greatest thing ever done for science, Trump couldn’t do it but Biden did, etc.  Really play up Biden’s Moderna vaccine to the Dems.

Maybe then we can actually get everyone vaccinated, as long as they each think they are getting the good one, from their own awesome political hero."

Looming over the events of yesterday is the shocking reality that a large majority of this presidents supporters still believe that the election was stolen, even in the face of no evidence and nearly 50 lawsuits looking to overturn the election thrown out of court due to lack of credible evidence!

Nearly 60 to 70 million of our fellow Americans believe that there's ""legal"" and ""illegal"" votes!

That this pandemic is a global hoax fostered on us to rob of us our liberty and freedom, even in the face of nearly 3,000 Americans dying every single day from it.

We are on a bad path that an election cannot change."

From creating a false narrative minimizing the impact of the COVID on population and economy, to pushing the USA to the edge of racial tensions, to lying about electoral fraud to soothe his sick ego, no matter how you look at it, Trump's effects on the USA and the world have been negative and destructive.

Trump and his acolytes have sent us back decades in social and economic justice, destroying the already fragile trust conservatives have on government.

And let us never forget Trump did not do this alone in a vacuum bubble. Conservatives did this with their unwavering support on a man who did everything he could do destroy the unity of our nation.

The man who was exhorting us to heal was the one who had started his political career with a terrible personal tragedy, losing his wife and daughter in a car accident just as he began his political journey.He found the grit to go forward just as he did after he lost son, Beau, to cancer.Joe has never given up or lost courage-he is perfect to guide us out of the abyss caused by Trump and the complicits.He has a vision for better days-there is reason to hope."

There were many moments this year when I couldn't hear her sing. But yesterday she sang the most beautiful song, and I smiled. Thank you, Emily Dickinson, for your beautiful poem, and to all the people who have worked to create and distribute a vaccine.   I am especially grateful to those who have cared for us when we are sick and will continue to do so even after this scourge is gone.

Thank you to everyone who helped make this election the largest and most transparent in history. Thank you to the journalists who seek and report the truth. And thank you to our president-elect for speaking with compassion  for us all.

2020-12-15 12:46:53,"I cried with relief when the Electoral College announced its results. I cried looking at the pictures of frontline workers being inoculated.

There is one point though, that needs to be made about trump's celebration of the Covid-19 vaccines. As usual he is taking credit for another thing he did not do.

One of the most important reasons the Covid vaccine was able to be developed so quickly was the massive amount of research and development that occurred after the outbreak of SARS (aka SARS Coronavirus-2) in 2002 - 3. It would have taken years for the Covid-19 vaccine to be developed from scratch had this research not been available.

The reasons we have to celebrate have nothing to do with trump."

I""m with Jill LePore about never finding our bottom as long as Trump maintains the influence he has.  To cover a routine ceremonial exercise as if there were suspense--created of course by GOP threats to storm state house capitols and replace sworn electors with ones of their own--isn't wonderful, it's sad.

But Peter Baker left out two other important events that occurred yesterday, important in their symbolism.  First Trump backed off first-in line vaccinations for White House staff, realizing for once how selfish that looked in a time of 3000 deaths a day from a poorly managed pandemic. 

And second, Joe Biden called out those who would reverse the results of the election through cynical court ploys in his brief ""electoral College acceptance"" speech.

Yeah, sometimes when it's raining it's time to put up that umbrella."

2020-12-15 12:44:59,"This story goes right along with the same themes you see pretty much everywhere in the MSM.  But these articles do not provide hope but, instead, do a great disservice by giving the false impression that both these things are over, finis, done... when nothing could be further from the truth.

Like it or not, many people will take the vaccine news as an excuse to ignore the safety measures that are still critically necessary the next few to 6 months and to go back to gathering and socializing.  Not everyone, but many.... enough to keep the pandemic raging and killing.  And Trump, his 74 million base, his corrupt congressional followers, and the right wing propaganda machine aren't going away anytime soon.

So my advice is to STOP with these happy talk articles and stay focused on the challenges that remain ahead."
2020-12-15 13:29:17,"The real story of the cosmic convergence is that Trump is clearly shown the only avenue he may have had to actually have been re-elected and yet on the same day shown that because he campaigned in a different direction that the avenue was lost to him.

Surely Operation Warp Speed will indeed live on as a major, if not most significant accomplishment, of his administration, yet Trump turned away from focusing on resolving the pandemic in the spring and instead focused on what was very bad advice to treat the entire pandemic as a losing issue politically and look to more traditional negative campaign issues like Hunter Biden.

If there exists a truly correct target for Trump’s rage, it should be whoever told him to start ignoring the pandemic.  For a while in the early spring, he did not, but then someone bended his ear.   He might have been able to capture an electoral majority if he had not followed that advice."

What if the vote in the whole country came down to a few thousand votes? Would we recount all 50 states? Of course, in this case, there would be no need for that, but it’s something to think about if we decide to move in that direction."
2020-12-15 12:43:05,"Joe Biden is still the apparent president-elect, not the president-elect. Members of Congress can challenge electoral votes; therefore, Biden cannot become president-elect until Congress accepts and counts the electoral votes on Jan. 6.

 The difference between an apparent president-elect and a president-elect is important. If an apparent president-elect dies before Congress counts the electoral votes, the House of Representatives would elect the next president. If a president-elect dies before Inaugural Day, the vice president-elect becomes president.

 Members of Congress usually challenge some electoral votes. This year, Republican members of Congress will challenge electoral votes cast by electors from swing states with disputed election results. But electoral votes can be rejected only if both chambers concur. Since Democrats control the House and the Republicans control the Senate, no electoral votes that matter will be rejected this year unless some massive scandal engulfs the president-elect prior to Jan. 6."

And don't forget that there is one more hurdle to pass in Biden's election: January 6th, with Mike Pence presiding. Biden's installation in office is far from ""settled."""

Every aggrieved individual today needs to get over it by finally seeing that the election was fair. 

Except, of course, for the 300,000 dead from trump’s lies and mishandling of the pandemic.

Scietists don't know what kind of COVID -19 antibody protection the vaccines give nor how long it lasts.  Science doesn't know if a COVID-19 vaccination prevents spreading of the disease to others. Science doesn't know if the COVID-19 vaccines prevent long-term or permanent damage to major body organs.

While the Electoral College farce exposed the reality that America is not and never was meant to be a democracy.

America is and and always has been a very peculiar kind of republic.  A divided limited different power constitutional republic of united states.

This statement is important. I keep hearing that Trump's supporters believe he was the real winner and has been cheated. It's not true and all but the most deluded know it. What they do believe is that they are much more important — both in their own eyes and the eyes of a god as they have created him — than those of us with progressive, inclusive values.

2020-12-15 12:43:53,"Trump has always been a tempest in a teapot. The reality of the election has always been a foregone conclusion and fears of what Trump might do have only lived in the minds of the Trump hate faction. The Supreme Court ruled like it always does - using the rule of law, not the ""rule of Trump"" which so many feared. At the end of the day, the American Government system will do what is right. The virus is another thing - yes - science has triumphed but - we have to make it to next spring. This is where people enter into it ( just like Trump derangement) - we now believe masks are only needed in public, that when our friends and family enter into our home, all are somehow protected and that community spread exists in the community not our neighborhood.

And with the world's most powerful healthcare resources, our ability to fight a new virus should never have reached this miserable point. We even had a playbook drafted for dealing with a pandemic -- but one impostor of a president tore it up. The key to future return to normal is predicated on never again electing such a terrible person to the highest office in the land."
2020-12-15 13:09:57,"Sad to say, I'm with Prof. Lepore.

In reading Kochland, I have been reading how wealthy elites have promoted an agenda to transfer our national wealth to a few by breaking labor and destroying the middle class. And while that should have earned the emnity of blue collar Americans, instead the disposessed (or soon to be dispossessed) have swallowed whole every bogeyman thrown their way by think tanks and media. More unbridled liberty doesn't make all of us better off. It simply turns the strongest into bigger predators. We are to be punished for not being rich like them.

So we will still have a huge right-wing propaganda machine wedded to a base comprised of millions of displaced, suffering workers done in by their own inability to think critically and their self-indulgent victimhood.

And a Democratic Party also taking donations which will try to ameliorate worker's pain through healthcare and a stronger safety net while they still struggle doing service work at minimum wage. And staying mired in an economic struggle, they will indulge conspiracies while accepting propaganda uncritically.

Or maybe the Democrats could think about making America prosperous through work again? After all, it's supposed to be in their DNA."

This is a hopeful article and it’s idealism is  appreciated, however this is an option article not an objective news piece. The electoral college confirming the results of the election is an important event, although factually speaking the EC remains a highly controversial institution. And many could argue the merits and ‘goodness’ of the EC as an undemocratic body. There are only one set of opinions in this article and they all agree with each other.

The second event of vaccinations that is conflated with the first is also hopeful but similarly based in opinion. The public needs factual information about the vaccine, not to say that tearful tv spots of people getting the vaccine doesn’t inspire hope. Hope is important, but facts and information play an enormous role in science as they should in journalism."

Does it really matter though? I'm troubled a little about why that is important. It is almost some sort of competitive ranking that delineates a winner, the people living now who experienced the worst year ever. 

This is a side point to the article really, but I just feel like there have been no winners in the last four years. Sadly, there are those that got what they wanted from a Trump administration, like stacked courts, and deregulation to name a few, but there are no winners.

Hopefully we can begin a new era of responsibility and accountability. A place where accountability to the truth and to justice for all Americans is valued again. It is still going to be a struggle but there is real hope now that some good can transpire.

Plenty of protesters thought BLM couldnt help but win after the country resoundingly agreed on george floyd. Those of us who have been around know better. The truth is vaccine or not we are just as open to another pandemic or a mutation of this one. Joe biden, though a better man, is still stuck with a global pandemic and ugly economic outlook.

By his ignorant self-serving public behavior and downright lies Trump actually worsened the spread of the epidemic.

He noted that Trump had his day in court to contest the election almost 60 times.  And lost each time because he had no facts or law to support him and because he waited until after the election to take legal action.

Covid-19 has been spread as much by disinformation as by sneezing and coughing.   Likewise the death threats against election officials and unrest related to the non-existent election fraud have been spread by the drumbeat of disinformation. 

Fox News and other right wing media outlets have gladly participated in Trump’s various disinformation campaigns throughout his tenure.  Responsible news media outlets have sometimes unwittingly aided the disinformation campaigns in the interests of being “fair and balanced”.  This needs to stop.  

President Biden’s biggest challenge will be to address the disinformation loop that has enthralled too many in the nation.  He made a good start last night."
2020-12-15 14:47:07,"“A pivotal juncture” after the misery of 2020. I would like to think so, but I seriously doubt it. While in college, I was an active participant in the misery of 1968. Yet, I never had the sense of dread for the future of our country that I have today. The clashes of my day were about the proper role of government in a democratic republic. The clashes of today are about whether the republic should be replaced with fascism. This threat will continue long into the future as the republican party has now completely embraced authoritarianism and rule by the minority as a justifiable means of retaining power. An entire political party has consciously chosen to replace democracy with demagoguery and that did not change on December 14th."
2020-12-15 14:06:15,"The election may have been about the pandemic but conflating the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccination in lock step with the Electoral College vote is absurd to signal that a Biden Administration is the shining light at the end of the darkness the pandemic brought to many people in the US and around the world.

A 180 degree turn by the media is only that, and does nothing to change the reality that a Biden Administration will bring much relief."

Christmas has come early this year and the country received the best gift ever!  And no returns necessary."
2020-12-15 14:21:40,Our American psychodrama turned a corner yesterday. As a country we have had a weakness for the flim flam artist who promises more than anyone reasonably can  to the gullible who hope to avoid the inevitable struggles of the human condition. But we are also peopled by those who don't buy into those promises and who do the hard work that is necessary to survive and prosper.  Our challenge now is to find a way going forward for those 2 cohorts to talk to each other as respectfully as possible. It won't be easy but it is crucial that we do so if we are to continue to fulfill the great promise of our beloved country.
2020-12-15 14:45:04,"What an extraordinary year that led to the two events that happened on Monday.  The price paid not just by the country but to all those victims of this disease who either died or who lived and are still battling the effects.  Covid has changed the world  and it also played a major role in defeating Trump.  Had he had just a glimmer of compassion, had he been able to express even the slightest amount of empathy, he might have easily won re-election.  Instead he could never get past his need to be seen and heard, and in the end, his own demons drove him to defeat.  Now the country can once again seek normalcy and here’s hoping  Biden and his team can do that."
2020-12-15 15:27:58,"I was telling my teenage grandchildren that just like the historic days that we lived through (assassinations, moon landings, etc.), they will remember these times and days as well.  Adversity behind us and hope ahead - hopefully."
2020-12-15 15:32:25,"It occurred to me that yesterday was the day between the 4th and 5th night of Chanukkah. For those who don't know, Chanukkah is an 8 night festival that begins on the 25th of the month of Kislev on the Hebrew calendar, a lunar calendar. This means that the holiday always straddles the new moon in the month proceeding the winter solstice, the ""darkest night of the year"". It is thought that this relates to older winter festivals in the Levant, and that the lighting of candles is meant to evoke a sort of sympathetic magic: the moonlight fades away during the longest nights of the year for the first four nights, and at the halfway point, it begins to return, the candles, more each night, supposedly bringing the light back. Thus, yesterday marked the day directly in the middle, the day meant to represent the turning point from darkness to light. While I personally believe this to be coincidence, not magic, I can't help but appreciate the accidental symbolism."
2020-12-15 15:35:10,"Sorry, but the ""Pfizer vaccine"" is NOT a part of Donald Trump's ""legacy,"" no matter how much the media report it that way. It was invented by a Turkish-German couple at a small company in Mainz, Germany, that had nothing to do with ""Operation Warp Speed."" The global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, who partnered with the inventors to mass produce and distribute the vaccine, did not participate in Operation Warp Speed either. And Great Britain, without Operation Warp Speed, implemented the vaccine before we did. 

Without any vainglorious posturing by Trump, dozens of companies around the world have aggressively pursued the vaccines which will roll out in the coming year, incentivized by market forces far more than by anything Trump did or said. In fact, by politicizing the scientific process, Trump did far more harm than good, because millions now must be convinced that the vaccines are safe despite his apparent interference. 

And finally, when it comes to taking credit, the basic principle that we all learned in kindergarten still applies: there is no credit without responsibility. I'll be glad to give Trump credit the moment he takes responsibility for the needless deaths of 100's of thousands of citizens."

From Jonas Salk — Anatomy of Reality 1983
“Our system for the selection of leaders who are suited to the time in which we live is no longer appropriate, useful, or effective.”
&
“I sometimes feel that we may not be able to reverse rapidly enough the tendency toward massive madness.""

A note to Mr. Yuval Levin, ""the director of social, cultural and constitutional studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute"" regarding ""reality breaking  through.""
I suggest you look out the window of the Free Enterprise Institute and absorb this reality breaking through:
The Sky & Ocean are being armed with weapons of mass extinction while we Breathe, Drink & Eat microplastic.

Verily, that Reality speaks, explicitly, resoundingly, of a lethally unbalanced world culture — largely driven by our dominant information processing mechanism or app for relationship interface — humans deploying monetary code.
“The most fundamental phenomenon of the universe is relationship.” Jonas Salk
The Free Enterprise system doesn't work for relationship interface per our unprecedented environs. It summons, clearly, I submit, ""premature and perverted death"" for our children.

And verily, it bothers me when I consistently see ""future historians"" penned by guardians of the status quo.

His performance was authentic and truly patriotic. I would say the same for Gabriel Sterling in Georgia. How come these two citizens had the courage to speak out against the President whereas so many elected officials (elected by their constituents, not by lobbyists) could not face doing? 

These two gentlemen  reflect so beautifully what Obama said  in his Farewell speech--- that Citizen is the most important role to have in this country. President Elect Biden was most gracious to the work of the many who GOTV-d and helped energize the Americans to vote in historic numbers—so many died for the right to vote, so many continue to be denied the right to vote.

We haven't begun to plum the depths of the national travesty that is Donald Trump and his enablers. Do you think that they are just going to go away now? Or Trump and his various cronies and family offshoots and their schemes and corruption. They are like a weed that spreads and spreads until all that is good and green is gone. Despite all the rhetoric to the contrary we have just barely defeated Trumpism for now. And if the underlying structure and causes are left in place it will rise again. It doesn't have to be led and nurtured by Trump and his enablers since ""movements"" can survive long after the initial leadership has ended. This has always been about more than Trump as his millions of voters and supporters should have shown us. I wouldn't be running any victory laps yet, the hard work has only just begun.

2020-12-15 15:04:46,"Yesterday, was a truly remarkable day. One big takeaway was the close up look at what a Rube Goldberg, outmoded, and clearly unnecessary process the Electoral College is in a 21st century democracy. We can and should celebrate the day, but not let it pass without realizing that it has revealed many weaknesses in out Constitutional democracy.  A  second takeaway from William Barr's firing/resignation revealed how vulnerable the nation was to an autocratic president. The Justice Department must be removed from the control of ruthless, corrupt Presidents and placed in the Judicial branch with the Attorney General given a ten-year appointment subject to removal only by impeachment. Third, the blatant corruption of the Republican Party that resulted in 126 Republicans in the House of Representatives nullifying their oath to the Constitution in order to support what amounted to Trump's last-ditch seditious coup attempt means that under the Constitution (see Sec. 3 of the 14th amendment) they must be removed from office and not be seated this January 3. Democracy can not survive if one party is committed to overthrowing it. That's what the Trump Republicans have now become--a subversive party favoring one-man rule, the rule of Trump, over the Constitution and its rule of law. It was an historic day, but it was filled for important lessons that must not be ignored in the celebration a ""sigh of relief."""
2020-12-15 15:13:36,"""But after so much uncertainty, after so much doubt, the way forward appears clearer at least in two major respects.""
What a naive statement!
Trump is still trying to hold on to power.
It's not over until it is.

Don't be surprised if most don't feel your optimism."
2020-12-15 15:31:38,"To all the people heaving a big sigh of relief, really?  I am certainly glad that a vaccine now exists, and is even available for some people.  But I'm dismayed that the Trump regime passed on the opportunity to get a lot more.  Can anyone explain the logic there?  It appears that Trump could have made sure far more of us would be vaccinated promptly, but instead, many will continue to get sick and die before vaccination is adequate.  And while I'm certainly pleased that Trump and his crime family are getting evicted, the threat he poses and the tragedy of his legacy remain.  A bunch of Americans continue to favor a gun-loving theocracy in service of corporations, and most Republicans  showed us just how craven and phony their stated ""principles"" are.  You think Mitch McConnell is going anywhere?  Democracy may have survived this particular skirmish, but we haven't defeated fascism by a long shot.  I see no cause for celebration.  On the contrary, I fear we are so exhausted and demoralized by the last several years that many will be tempted to forgive and forget, content to let treasonous vipers slither back into the shadows."
2020-12-15 15:20:30,"We won't know for months what the actually efficacy of any vaccine, but it certainly does look promising. My two greatest concerns for the future are:

 1) That elements of lockdown culture will never fully disappear; that certain liberties and elements of daily life won't ever return. We have lived in that echo-chamber for almost a year now, and the vast majority of people happily outsource their responsibility to think critically. Gov't has become too top heavy, the tenor too authoritarian and too many of us are little more than complicit enablers. True democracy is a kind of reverse totalitarianism. Emergency measures are one thing, but we as Americans must remember who we are as covid mercifully draws to a close.

2) That Trumpism will not only persist but thrive throughout the Biden years, growing steadily as its fires are continually stoked by Mr. Trump's Twitter rantings & the lockstep bullhorn amplification provided by sympathetic, sycophantic media and his millions of followers. 

2020 America reminds me of Centralia, Pennsylvania, a town that has sat above a smoldering coal fire for six decades, and which is now little more than a scorched wasteland. Efforts were made to extinguish the fire over the years, but for the most part, apathy and denial prevailed. No one believed that an entire town could be consumed, just as no one really believed that any American could embrace a leader with blatant fascist and totalitarian aspirations. 

Yet, as they say, here we are."
2020-12-15 17:02:37,"hmm, I am not sure this is such a momentous day.  The GOP senate leader has done something that we could roughly equate with being cognizant at the most basic level - as if one of us acknowledged that we are breathing.  And a still somewhat experimental vaccine that is not for everyone, and will not be made available to everyone, with still not entirely clear long-term effects (be it immunity or side effects) is being administered.  These are not steps backwards, but I would not exactly call them leaps for mankind."
2020-12-15 17:10:40,"I'm happy and relieved on both fronts, but I'm with the historians who feel that we're still in the grips of something that will torment our country for perhaps decades to come. Ever since the election, I've been thinking of those famous words of Churchill to the British public after an early WWII victory:

""Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.""

I think that's where we are in this national political drama that is splitting our country in half -- at the end of the beginning, of Act I. At least two more acts remain to be played out."
2020-12-15 16:34:47,"A good day indeed. Too bad that the trust we developed over a lifetime in our democratic institutions may be erased at the drop of a hat...by a shrewd demagogue...when supported by a cowed party seeking assurance of being allowed to perpetuate in power...in exchange of blind loyalty...no matter the cost. Shall we listen now to historic Santayana, so not to repeat our complacent mistakes, as we learned a lesson in despair?"
2020-12-15 16:35:02,"Now we wait to see how effective and safe the vaccine is in practice.  As for the electoral college it is a disgrace that the Republican Party, and democracy itself, were held hostage by the liar and fraud Donald Trump.  It should not have been a major event, and now the stage has been set for more of this nonsense in the future."
2020-12-15 17:05:42,"I wonder how many dead Americans could have been saved had Trump not been so discounting, blocking and lying  about the Covid-19 pandemic? 

He should be prosecuted for failing to be responsible for the lives lost and for speaking lies about just how dangerous Covis-19 was!"
2020-12-15 17:02:50,"We've experienced American carnage for 4 years. Will the carnage continue as our democracy undergoes the quadrennial change from #45 to President Joe Biden, #46, next month? It's great we have the first woman Vice-President in our history.  That Americans are being vaccinated today against the Covid pandemic. 300,000 Americans died of the virus yesterday.  We all hope for a happier and more healthful New Year."
2020-12-15 16:44:43,"A ""cosmic convergence""? Sorry, it feels more like the aftereffects of getting hit by a Mack truck. Trump and the virus are the Mack truck, the rest of us are the ones who got hit."
2020-12-15 16:50:44,"We dodged a bullet - 

had Trump won the election the riots in the democratic strong-holds would have kicked into over-drive yesterday by  the BLM the Anitfa the Resistance - thank God that conservatives, even the deluded among them, are not the violent mob that the democratic party has doing its bidding.

In other news, slightly used plywood can be had cheaply, so there is that."
2020-12-15 16:50:52,It's not easy for Fox News to break old and deep habits.  The Hunter Biden investigation could lead to nothing for all we know.  Trump's long tax fraud may have far more severe consequences for him once Cy Vance and Letitia James pursue legal redress after he leaves office.
2020-12-15 16:47:10,"Mitch McConnell is clearly signaling he isn't interested in entertaining a Republican challenge to the election results in the Senate. Looks like there may be some very sore losers in the House who might.

Seems to me now is a good time for a cooling-off period, and for Congress to reach a compromise on a relief package. Democrats may have to give a little for the good of the country, and maybe they can work together on a few things when Biden takes over."
2020-12-15 16:53:36,"The two events are linked as it is quite likely that it was Trump's response to the virus that turned people against him. Yes, he was an incompetent President but he was the incumbent with a booming economy which would guarantee reelection for any normal President. But Trump chose to be his most truculent self, ranting and railing untruths about the pandemic, and because of that he lost the election. He has only himself to blame, but really for the overall well being of America, it is a good thing that he showed his true colors when he did and we are now rid of him."
2020-12-15 16:51:42,"I am much relieved but, as historian Jill Lepore says, it was a good day but hard to trust that we have finally turned a definitive corner. I worry that 1) Mitch McConnell will continue to  sabotage Congress, turning us into a failed state 2) the delusional Trumpists will promote a ""stabbed in the back"" mythology that will undermine democracy 3) the Biden administration will fail to take on the forces that have resulted in our deeply unequal and unfair society, substituting visual ""diversity"" for real policy changes.  We have a chance now to right the sinking ship but it won't be easy."
2020-12-15 16:56:31,"Maybe if the democrats were a little more tenacious, like the republicans, the outgoing wouldn't have been able to appoint three supreme court justices.  Just saying."
2020-12-15 16:48:07,"Indeed, an historic day for many reasons. 

Two were crucial, the start of the end of the pandemic with vaccines made from genetic material of viruses developed very quickly and the successful conclusion of the second to last step of the electoral process for the office of the President. 

But the rest were about a neurotic personality trying to retain the office for which he was not elected by arousing and insurgency based upon false assertions of fraud of a supermajority of those who had voted for him. 

The day reflected two successes and two bizarre sets of circumstances which seem unnecessary. Trump could have earned a landslide victory had he just did his job as the President to manage this national pandemic with the tools provided to that office. He could not do it. Those who Trump manipulated by playing on their negative attitudes never grasped that at no time did he appeal to the better angels of their natures because of the emptiness at his core. Trump was a figure who really snatched defeat from a seemingly assured success. His preoccupation about appearing a loser seems to have confused him into a failure."
2020-12-15 17:29:35,"We could use some hope right now! Maybe we can actually move forward and manage the pandemic, save the economy, address racism through anti-racism, stem the opioid epidemic, address the climate crisis, fight Big Oil and Gas, stop biodiversity and habitat loss, and measure our progress by a focus on evidence such as quality of life again."
2020-12-15 17:42:15,"An important day to be sure. I do recall another day of equal importance, at least for the U.S., though. On January 22, 1973, I was minding the AP teletype machine in a college newspaper office as five-bell alarms kept going off for major stories. Roe v. Wade was decided, Lyndon Johnson died, and George Foreman beat Joe Frazier to win the heavyweight boxing title, among other events."
2020-12-15 17:31:54,"The day belonged to Donald J. Trump, who never took his eye off the prize -- a vaccine -- regardless of what they did to him.  It's hard for his critics to acknowledge his extraordinary role in our country's having a vaccine by the end of the year.  

They cannot.  But the rest of us can and will always be grateful to President Trump for delivering a solution so quickly.  It's why his support was always so high -- because he delivered."
2020-12-15 17:32:02,yes!
2020-12-15 17:11:31,"Peter, really...
“CNN even had a graphic at the bottom of its screen tabulating the votes as they came in as if there were any actual suspense.”
The NYT, too, had a “live” tally page showing the constantly changing results, “as if there were any actual suspense.” 
But when the Times does the same thing, it (somehow) doesn’t merit mentioning?"
2020-12-15 17:18:35,"If the Gutless Obtuse Pariah members of Congress, governors, state attorneys general, state legislators, et al, had any conviction in their insane tantrums of election fraud, if they possessed any backbone at all, they would all resign their offices, en masse, to demonstrate their undying fidelity to what’s his name. How can they possibly justify to continue participating in the cabal of dark magic and global conspiracies?

Of course, the gop lacks both conviction and backbone, so we know this is not going to happen."
2020-12-15 17:53:12,"Vladimir and Mitch synchronized their concessions on the same day, over a month after Biden actually won the presidency.

Coincidence? I think not.

Russian intelligence operatives counterfeited the software update patch, the piece of network management software used by Mitch’s neurally networked brain cells to hold sway over the senate and all of our lives. “This is Vlad calling Mitch, Vlad to Mitch, you ... must ... obey!” 

Definitely true, and Sidney Powell will soon publicize this nefarious plot."
2020-12-15 17:29:52,"That the vaccine has arrived is wonderful news. But we will never forget our fellow citizens that died because of failed leadership starting from the Oval Office, Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell. Don’t be fooled by any congratulatory messages from Senator McConnell and his ilk. A leopard does not change its spots. He and his loyal Republican toadies still take their marching orders from Donald Trump and will do everything they can to thwart Joe Biden. They still remain as enemies of America and every one of them should be charged and prosecuted for treason."
2020-12-15 17:38:08,"A good day?  To some extent, yes, but let’s not bandage over the gaping bloody wounds in Lady Liberty that remain a bleeding. Timorous Senators like Portman and power hungry Machiavellians like McConnell managed to utter the last words “President Elect” with what seemed a dying breath.  But not before praising our criminal president for his manifold accomplishments real and imaginary and without a word about the very real seditious behavior they complictly nourished. The Devil is in the unheeded details. 

I’m amazed that no one has calibrated just how much of McConnell’s behavior is due to his wife’s vassalage as a term long Trump cabinet member who keeps her mouth shut.   Portman must have gotten the go ahead from his corporate masters after whom he has dutifully padded tongue out his entire career, including Congress. Cautious Rob cut his eye teeth as errand boy for Master of the Universe Carl Lindner,  bit player in the Den of Thieves Saga of so long ago.  


And then there is two term/timing attorney general William “Should be Dis”—Barred. Why didn’t the press pick up before he was approved on his first stint,  helping Pappy Bush obstruct justice being done to the Irangate burglars?

Someone is going to do a lallapalooza history of these years.   It’s been our own Gilded Age.  

My only guarded hope is that we still have freedom of the press and free elections in 20 years or so when it is time for a full and frank look back."

My husband is 85 and I am 78, and we learned that you are never too old to be surprised (at the malevolent, rampaging, highly destructive  Trump phenomenon) or grateful (that Biden, commonsense, and basic human decency won). 

Yesterday was like coming out of a dark, scary tunnel with no identifiable landmarks into the sunshine again. Lots of credit goes to the scientists, doctors, healthcare workers, and election officials and workers, who simply did their jobs--whether they were Democrats, Republicans, or Independents--and despite all the misinformation, interference, and damage from Trump and his enablers, who clearly were on the wrong side of democracy and history.

Many times in history, you really can't determine the proverbial turning point until there is a clear resolution or conclusion to the crisis at hand, whether war, political strife, or public health disaster.  Unfortunately, we are not there yet -- and I am afraid the end is still quite uncertain.  So while I pray that the existential anxiety so many of us have been beleaguered by has finally reached its zenith, I'd feel a lot more confidence believing this was true if that two-pronged ray of light didn't coincide with both the grim milestone of 300,000 deaths and the repeated refusal of the White House to accept the results of a free and fair election."

And a historic Pandemic which has killed and infected and has led to so many jobs and livelihoods lost, a Pandemic which under the right leadership would never had spread so brutally and cruelly as it has.  No it could not have been prevented, but I am convinced that it could have been assuaged when we consider the expertise which abounds in the science of American medicine.  Who better than a man with decency, a moral compass, years and years of political experience and the knowledge and wisdom that is born from it than Joe Biden?  We are on a trajectory now of healing, of our bodies, our minds, and the soul of a nation built upon a living Constitution.  I can not say that this journey we remain on is a blessing, far from it.

Biden's election was confirmed by the EC, as it should have been, while Trump's emphasis from the beginning on an accelerated vaccine program versus extraordinarily destructive lockdowns has proven to have been the right path.

Instead of choosing the path of dictators like banana republics with ignorant populations, and rich, rich padrones,  we rose up and tore Trump and his lies down. We elected a democratic leader, a man called to serve and not someone who has no plans other than to listen to his 'stable genius' brain, which has already cost Americans more lives than most wars and massive loss of employment and businesses as well as the scorn of the world's democracies and the praise of dictators. Dictators like Kim who write Trump love letters while Trump gives them permission to build city-buster hydrogen bombs and ICBMs to carry them to us. (Kim Jung-un sure played Trump like a fool, and succeeded.) We can't undo the fact that now Kim threatens millions of Americans - which he could not do pre-Trump.

Prior to reading this article, my perception was that the US did not fund and did not secure through contract sufficient vaccine quantities to inoculate its population. I've read a lot of commentary indicating that the US did not do its part to lead this effort.

Now this article says that the US paid billions to fund vaccine research, and received sufficient doses in return to vaccinate about 2X the US population. This is confusing.

2020-12-15 12:28:17,"But what did everyone expect?

From the very beginning, the rich world as prioritized saving its own citizens through lockdowns  over the greater mortality and morbidity the economic disruptions from lockdowns cause in poor countries. Maybe we saved a few tens of thousands of deaths in the US by shutting down, but in the process of doing so we sent 140 million *new* people into acute hunger across Africa and Asia.

The only shot we had at equity was to dance with the virus, to show an ounce of courage in the face of a modest increase in the risk of death, a mortality increase that sets us back as a country to the prehistoric mortality rates of the year 2000, or maybe the year 1990 for just one year. In our panic to avoid a truly mild pestilence producing 1990 mortality rates for a single year, we sent 140 million people into famine.

Of course vaccines are going to worsen the global health inequities. Every single person in the US who fed into the fear of COVID is responsible for this."
2020-12-15 12:53:22,"The takeaway from this article comes near the very end:  Whether rich countries get the vaccines first or share with poorer countries from the outset, “Either way, many more people will die along the way.”

However, it is the inherent responsibility of nations to secure the health and well-being of their own citizens, not the citizens of other nations.

And, as the article notes, rich nations are already discussing possible arrangements to share any excess vaccines with poorer nations once the donor nations’ populations have been vaccinated.

As they say, charity begins at home."
2020-12-15 12:58:48,"One possibility left out is that wealthy countries will fall victim to first adopter inefficiencies. Meaning that we don't yet know if the pharmaceutical companies botched their trials or lied about the data (again) and, we won't find out about until 10s of millions are vaccinated and months wasted to learn we have to do the vaccinations all over again with different product.
There is a possibility that being a late adopter will have some benefits both financially and efficacy."
2020-12-15 12:48:47,"Let's see, where is the virus ""raging"" at the moment? Oh, right, the United States, Britain and many parts of Europe. Maybe that's where the vaccine should go first."
2020-12-15 13:13:13,"I think that many in the countries at the top of the list (in terms of vaccine preorders) will likely adjust what they ask for as time wears on. Much depends now on how effectively each plans the inoculation process. Hundreds of thousands of doses will need to be administered per day, so if the recipient countries cannot manage such high rates of inoculation, the deliveries will likely need to be deferred and/or redirected. 

In my view, a country like Canada ought to consider other possibilities--such as a move to redirect tens of millions of unneeded doses to countries that would otherwise have a difficult time of procuring so many doses at market prices. For example, Canadian officials could engage officials with the African Centres for Disease Control to establish a transfer plan (in coordination with vaccine manufacturers) in a way most suited to recipient country needs."
2020-12-15 13:02:49,"I go by a very simple logic: I spend billions helping develop and/or buy a product (think Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer, others), why should I give it to someone else before I give it to my own people? 
Being rich seems to be a curse word  at the NYT. Countries became rich, powerful, advanced, developed, give it a name because of its people and the system they put in place. Unfortunately in quite a few countries that is not the case. It’s easier to blame someone else why a country can’t lift its head and make something out of their country.
The CEO of the Serum Institute in India (largest vaccine manufacturer in the world) promised to give (sell) half of their production to India. Should they give it to other countries first? 
And like it or not, it’s the current administration that spend the billions in project Warp Speed.
I don’t understand what this article is trying to convey.  And thinking first about your own people, doesn’t mean that you won’t help others. I don’t  feel guilty about living in a prosperous country. I am glad I do and there is nothing wrong about it."

What makes this article disturbing is not that the bar graphs shine a spot light on the gaps between the more and lessor developed countries but the information is not very useful. Methodology or how the numbers are calculated is an unknown in this article ergo untrusted.  I think we all knew or suspected the more economically (wealthier) developed nations would be able to acquire more vaccine doses that the lessor developed ones. In the research community many strive to create vaccines that prevent or at least mitigate the effects of viruses. While science evolves the economies of scale lag far far far behind making many medicines unavailable to much of the lessor economically developed world. Yes I am cynical but the cold sometimes deadly truth is where the money flows the vaccines will go."
2020-12-15 13:44:37,"It would be a compassionate and visionary gesture for President-Elect Biden to fairly soon announce that, as our needs are met, he would help make surplus vaccines available to the poorest countries of the world.
It would also be consistent with meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 3, for Good Health and Well-Being; and 10, for Reduced Inequalities, as well as help with the other 15 Goals.
It would be noted around the world, a statement that part of the best of America is returning. We still have space for caring for those around the world in trouble, a form of the often-cited ""leadership"" and maybe ""exceptionalism"" that actually means something.
I bet it would be replicated by other countries with a surplus."
2020-12-15 12:57:47,Certainly the profits earned from selling and administering the new vaccines in the richer nations will help underwrite the cost of its development and the cost of delivering it to the poorer nations soon after. It is good pharmaceutical economics.
2020-12-15 13:41:53,"The theory of the argument is based on statistical nonsense. The US and Canada placed big bets across a series of vaccines not knowing who would make it,  thus our orders are for more doses than we have people. It is more likely than not that the US will release its excess capacity as vaccinations roll out. It is also more likely then not that the US will still pay for the released vaccines delivering them for free to poorer countries."
2020-12-15 13:24:42,"This isn't toilet paper we are discussing but a life saving therapeutic. Hoarding is unconscionable. On the other hand, wealthier nations are in the position to help less developed countries and like helping out at the scene of an accident you have to protect yourself first to be able to help. But you don't need to hoard to do that. The fact is that there are not enough doses to go around to everyone and we face choices that we wish we didn't have to make."
2020-12-15 13:21:19,Big deal.  We and others got this to fruition.  Tell gates and his plutocrat buddies to pony up after Americans get taken care of.
2020-12-15 13:23:31,"The attitudes expressed by many of the commentators on this article reveal humanity at its worst. Selfish and arrogant and just a little bit smug. People don't seem to appreciate that if they are fortunate enough to be born in a rich country, they have done nothing to deserve it. Moreover, from an historical perspective, so many of the rich countries are wealthy precisely because they raped and pillaged many of the poorer countries that are now waiting in line, and/or stole the land of others for themselves. We can recognize the inequity in the world without celebrating it or pretending it is somehow ""natural"". There is nothing natural about a nation-state. It's a political entity about 200 years old. It is true that many of the Western countries are the places where the disease is raging the most out of control, but even there the reason is interesting. In the US, especially, it is out of control because of the selfishness and stupidity of its population. In much of the West, the refusal to exercise self-discipline and care for others, combined with the inability to put off instant gratification, has driven the disease. From that perspective, I suppose another display of intense selfishness coming out of the West is completely in character."
2020-12-15 13:30:21,"This reminds me of the story of the little red hen.  

She wanted to bake a cake and she took all the steps to gather the ingredients and marshal her resources and expend the energy to make a fine cake and then everyone, who did not participate, wanted a piece of the cake.  

And the little red hen did end up sharing the cake; however she never made cake again.  

And all the fat, lazy, overly prolific, corrupt, and totalitarian neighbors of the little red hen wondered why she never made cake again.

When China has come clean on the source of the Covid 19 virus, and the World Health Organization has fully explained why it felt that a visit near the source of the outbreak was sufficient, rather than the actual source of the outbreak; then, and only then, should we begin to question the little red hen about the equites surrounding the distribution as to her fine cake."
2020-12-15 13:32:47,"But let’s also not miss the fact that in some
Less resourced countries such as many in Africa Covid has been a no show. My daughter was there and in her country it did not hit anything like the West. Send the vaccine where there is need (South America is certainly on that list)"
2020-12-15 13:35:58,"As you've heard countless times on an airplane, ""If you are traveling with someone who requires assistance, secure your mask on first, and then assist the other person."" 

That's essentially where the US and Europe are in this pandemic. 

We're in the middle of an emergency, the little oxygen masks have parachuted from overhead, and we're desperately grabbing those little suckers before assisting others with their masks. 

This isn't the Titanic, there will be plenty of lifeboats--All in time."

2020-12-15 12:47:40,"The information missing here is how long this vaccination lasts or is effective. I’m wondering if they have the data. Probably not. Sure would be unfortunate if we give away millions of doses only to find out the vaccination only lasts 6 months. 

In the event of an emergency you put your own oxygen mask on first. You are instructed to do this so you don’t die before you can help the person next to you. We are no help to the world in the long run if our economy completely collapses and we are the ones producing the vaccines. Last I read the U.S. pumped billions into this vaccine effort. It’s no time for a guilt trip. Once the virus is tamped down here, you can rest assured that there will be public health people by the truckloads arriving all around the world inoculating people so foreign travelers don’t bring it back here. This is the same process for most diseases including polio."
2020-12-15 13:51:02,"Why does quoting Candian Conservative (opposition) leader Erin O'Toole have any merit in this discussion? His partisan viewpoint is meaningless as his only goal is to criticize the government in power to score points with voters. Snake oil for sale?
He's not directly related to the issues so let's try to stay on neutral, objective ground, please."
2020-12-15 13:12:15,India actually has at least 2 other locally developed vaccines in various stages of development that will be part of the mix not just the one from Serum Institute. There is one from Zydus Cadila and one from Bharat Biotech. Not sure if this article has accounted for those.
2020-12-15 13:31:16,Rich countries spent billions of tax payer dollars to create the vaccine for their populations.  What is the expectation here?
2020-12-15 13:36:22,"The article is missing important context.  Trump's unhelpful vaccine nationalism forced small countries like Canada, which lack pharma manufacturing facilities and financial clout, to hedge as much as possible.  (Which turned out to be prudent in the case of Moderna). Put bluntly, much of this drug arms race could have been avoided had Trump not been President.

In the end, Canada will no doubt donate its surplus generously."
2020-12-15 13:53:24,"It’s no surprise that the country with the capital, resources and capability to develop a vaccine would receive the benefits of the vaccine first.   It makes perfectly logical sense, at least to most people, that the product of such a society is not equally shared with the poorer countries until the rich country’s needs are met.   It’s capitalism 101.  

Oh I forgot, it’s 2020 and capitalism is evil.  Never mind what I said."
2020-12-15 13:08:27,"Then why do we “general public” people have to wait until July?  (I understand prioritizing. But if we have enough doses... May I have one, please?)

I suspect that it will depend on the state as well.  The national MSM says “get tested for coronavirus”, etc—But here in NM If you don’t have a specific job or specific symptoms: no test.  If you can get a test: no results for a week or two. So when they are telling us all to get shots—I will get one as soon as I can. But I don’t even believe July."
2020-12-15 13:43:42,"Every country needs to invest in building up capacity to manufacture critical items, including vaccines. As India has shown, it is easier to get a license to manufacture a foreign vaccine in your own country, than it is to order millions of doses manufactured abroad. If you are completely dependent on imports, then you are completely at the mercy of others.

Every single country in this world spends millions every year on tanks and bombs. Not many of them have the ability to manufacture vaccines. Maybe it is time to rethink national security."
2020-12-15 12:43:58,We aren’t safe from the disease until everyone has the vaccine. And we aren’t compassionate human beings until we willingly share this with the world.
2020-12-15 13:00:08,"When the US was borrowing money to pay for tax breaks for the 1%, Canada was buying vaccines to give free of charge to everyone. Also, it helps to have friends and allies.
Since we couldn’t rely on the US,  our government signed deals with European companies.
P.s: remember your president signed orders to deprive us of N-95 masks and vaccines."
2020-12-15 13:25:39,"The problem is that poor nations continue to have too many people. They need to tackle that issue before continuously asking other nations to help them. 

When i was a child I grew up hearing about starving children in China and India. There was basically a Marshal plan for them with special trade agreements where jobs and opportunities were shifted to their countries along with billions. In the meantime the poor and working class in the United States saw opportunities and jobs slip away. 

We continue to give billions every year to so called poor nations  and some not so poor nations while congress dithers over giving $600 a week to our unemployed or a $1200 check to our poor. Time to worry about our own and stop worrying about other nations. 

Would you let your kids starve to death to give some strangers your last food? I am not even taking the vaccine due to medical issues, the infomercial type hyping of the vaccine, the billions that will be made off the hype and as a person of Black and Indigenous ancestry I just don't trust this. As a descendant of those  American communities how about a Marshal plan and the same concern for us? Still waiting for that to happen.  Still waiting for a national plan to roll out pandemic  protective gear , a national health plan and work protections for many Americans. Get that right first before the next pandemic and worrying about other countries."
2020-12-15 13:28:11,"Even in the poorest third-world countries there are wealthy individuals who make thousands of times what the poorest individuals make.

You may be sure that in these poor countries it will be the wealthy people and politicians, often one and the same, who receive the vaccines first."
2020-12-15 12:58:24,"Perhaps this is another notch on the scepticism belt?
 
A rush to approval to hoard inventory is certainly not a confidence-builder.

Add in profit, prestige, and political motives and things begin to smell a little funny."
2020-12-15 13:35:47,"And yet just last week this paper ran stories about how it was somehow a failure of the Trump administration that some quantities of the Pfizer vaccine were purchased by other countries. I am all for a skeptical and aggressive press, but sometimes not everything is a scandal. Sometimes things are just playing out somewhat chaotically in real time and will sort themselves out as things progress. Sanity check: of course Canada is not going to stockpile vaccines in quantities 4 times their population."
2020-12-15 13:12:44,"News flash: our tax dollars payed not only for the vaccine but I'm sure we payed double to get the best minds on the planet to get the vaccine doubly quickly.  Unfortunately for some, the world does not continue to turn, and human beings do not continue to exist on,  love, air and sunshine alone.  I and millions of other taxpayers in this Country are at a higher risk then others and I don't feel badly for living in a country where I will get immunized more quickly.  To the usual ""it's not fair"" crowd I say: America First. Oh, and a hearty thanks to President Trump for pushing to make these vaccinations a ""warp speed"" reality."
2020-12-15 13:39:12,"I’ve had a bit of a rethink on this. Since 40% of Americans (95% of them Trump supporters) don’t plan on taking the vaccine, why don’t we secure vaccines for about 200,000,000 people in this country, and give the rest to poor countries? It would be one thing if the Trump crowd planned on taking the vaccines, but they don’t. So why bother having them available for them?"
2020-12-15 13:00:15,"From the beginning Canada's spoken up for universal access, and put it's money where it's mouth is by planning together with the EU and other nations for the widest possible distribution of the vaccine simply because to leave any part of our world unprotected from this scourge is to leave all vulnerable to it resurgence."
2020-12-15 13:36:12,"Some comments mention Warp Speed, but that program as far as I know was not touched by Pfizer and remember that Pfizer did not develop the vaccine but was brought on board by BioNTech for its production capabilities. Nevertheless, politicians of every country I know swear to foremost protect their own people. They would be going against their own oath to do otherwise. That they overorder is due to the fact that they don't know in advance what will work. Obviously no government would much more than its demand. This is not about the military industrial complex."
2020-12-15 13:16:42,"It only makes sense that countries which paid for development of the vaccines should have first dibs on the vaccines for their citizens. After all, there is no such thing as a world government (yet).

Besides, the survival of the less developed (poor) countries depends on keeping the developed (rich) countries up and running during the pandemic.

Without the economic benefits and generosity of the rich nations, the poorer nations will become even worse off.

To put it another way, the entire world will suffer if Covid-19 decimates the populations and economic output of the rich countries.

Also, the rich countries have the medical and infrastructures that will allow timely and effective shipping, storage, distribution and application of the vaccines to their populations.

Finally, rich nations are already considering arrangements to distribute any excess vaccines to poorer nations."
2020-12-15 13:13:54,"As a Canadian am I supposed to feel bad? Our government hedged its bets, yes. Vaccine production included here is not guaranteed. Canadians have learned painful lessons from early pandemic days - we're on our own, global alliances and the so-called free markets are fickle things... The government here has initiated plans to rebuild vaccine production shut down decades by global pharma supply chains chasing profits."
2020-12-15 13:19:50,"This is, of course, no surprise.  It's what we might think of as the ""natural order.""  Big fish eats little fish, etc.

To what extent should wealthy countries go to help ensure that poor countries also have adequate access to vaccines in a timely manner?"
2020-12-15 13:45:05,"I understand that the production of these vaccines is very technical and challenging,  but with billions of people around the world’s lives dependent on it and the entire global economy, you are telling me that there is literally nothing that can be done to bring production to scale given virtually unlimited money? 

ie, if “what it took” was literally giving Pfizer and/or Moderna a trillion dollars each and turning the entire efforts of the industrialized world to build more production facilities in the next couple months, that would be an extremely good use of our money and energy."
2020-12-15 13:28:33,"The glaring omission in this article; pharmaceutical companies are not required to sell rich nations three and four times the doses they require.

 Given that most hospitals, medical offices, clinics-nursing homes don't have the required freezer storage,hoarding appears to be the operative goal-not necessity."
2020-12-15 13:18:45,"What are the specific reasons that supply of the approved vaccines is limited? This article refers only to manufacturing capacity as do all others I’ve read. 

Why should that be fixed for products in such unprecedented high demand? What are the scarce resources? This is never explained anywhere."
2020-12-15 13:33:48,"The poorer nations are not poorer because they have no resources, or their people are less talented.

They are poorer because they have rejected our economic system and follow those that don't work.

Ours."
2020-12-15 14:06:35,"Poorer countries don't have anywhere near the numbers of new cases, infection rates or death rates (per capita) as the wealthier countries (per various news sources).  So if we're vaccinating based on impact and risk of exposure (e.g., the same reason why the CDC is prioritizing nursing home residents after health care workers), then why SHOULDN'T the U.S. and E.U. countries (i.e., the countries most at risk for high levels of cases and deaths) get the most doses?"
2020-12-15 14:17:01,"Perhaps just the triage of economical reality.  the wealthy nations who drive the vitality of the world economy make sure their populations and economies recover first.  They are the developers and deliverers of vaccines in mass quantities.  This is the reality of economic darwinism.  Nothing evil going on, simply survival of the fittest, in this case though poorer economies eventually get the vaccines. hasn't it ever been so?"

2020-12-15 14:28:47,"I'm reminded of the heat wave in Chicago in 1995 when over 700 people (almost all poor) died.  The disaster was not the heat wave it was the systemic neglect of the south side of Chicago's citizens.  

Covid is not, by analogy, the disaster here.  It is the long-term neglect of the poor countries by the rich countries.  

We are still not focusing on the real problem - poverty in part due to lack of the rich countries to share (education, health-care, and financing) with those in need.   

Now we are left with the dilemma of how to divvy up the vaccine."
2020-12-15 14:36:04,"Well, would it be better if maybe 5% / year of all countries are vaccinated? And continue intermittent lockdowns in Western countries for the next 2-3 years or so?

Maybe some of the less wealthy countries could invest into their infrastructure / manufacturing capacities.

In my view it is key that all available vaccine is given to people and protects them (no waste). Where these people live of course makes a difference for the countries, but not for the total protective potential of the total amount of vaccine produced."

2020-12-15 14:07:43,"What do you expect?  This is the exact same outcome of the partial lockdowns; protecting the middle class and wealthy and the expense of hourly workers and the neglected elderly.  No real attempt has been made to segment elder care workers from the rest of the population--and to give them ""combat pay""--so around half of all Covid-19 deaths are in nursing homes, with the rest concentrated among hourly workers.  The salaried white workers are safe and sound at home.  At least the Republicans in the lot of them are not hypocrites.  This claim, 'we're all in this together' is a joke."

If this way of thinking guided the captain of the Titanic as it began to sink, he would have ordered that the richest people get on the lifeboats first, not women and children.

Doing it as we are is pragmatic and realistic, but not humanistic: Canada and the U.S., for instance, have four to six times the amount they need. I guess it's trickle down here, too.

There is nothing wrong with that...now let's distribute the surplus to the countries that need it and let's not charge them.  Not even a penny. Let's continue to do that as long as necessary and let our rich partners do the same.  
One more thing; China allowed this nightmare to happen. China should be held responsible for every death that occurred and China should also be responsible financially to the United States and other nations for all the economic havoc they brought.  If necessary impose tariffs, fines, and economic sanctions if the Chinese are unwilling to accept responsibility for their crime of withholding information and deliberate distribution of mis-information, lack of openness and total dishonesty.  China must pay."
2020-12-15 14:30:14,"Rich counties have ""cleared the shelves""... Yeah, well, we're also paying for it.  Our sky-high health-care costs in the United States go to pay Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, etc. (Not to mention the tax dollars involved in Operation Warp Speed).

2020-12-15 13:59:50,"These simple bar graphs don't tell of the fact that some vaccines require special infrastructure, such as supercold storage to distribute.  Maximum worldwide availability is the goal, but you attack the problem first where it's worst, as pointed out repeatedly in these comments."
2020-12-15 14:09:33,"This is misleading.  Rich countries funded the vaccines and cannot in good conscience ship them off to others while their people die.  Many, as stated, are working to get massive quantities to poorer countries for free.  Rich nations reserved doses equal to multiples of their populations because they didn't know which would work or when they would be available, they are not going to hoard the excess but redistribute it.  Also the earliest vaccines require refrigeration so col that only richer countries could effectively distribute it."

2020-12-15 14:14:30,"These countries are democracies, and the politicians there are going to put their own citizens first.   Anyone who stood up and said we should share the vaccines equally with impoverished nations would quickly be voted out of office.

2020-12-15 14:04:39,"I think the two Turkish scientists who live in Germany now and developed the methodology behind the vaccine Pfizer is using, should have input into how their vaccine ""creation"", and hard work should be triaged out to the world.  What are their sentiments and wishes?

Also the United States has not ""paid"" billions for the development of a vaccine, we put it on our credit card (national debt), to have future generations of Americans to pay for it.  Therefore we shouldn't necessarily take all the credit (no pun intended) for its rapid development, and should insure that poor nations are treated fairly in the distribution of the vaccine."
2020-12-15 14:21:48,"Of course the vaccine rollout was never going to be perfectly balanced to deliver the doses in a perfectly balanced manner. 

And rich nations have an interest in seeing the vaccine as widely distributed as possible. 

That’s the herd. 

Let’s let this play out. Canada is not hoarding vaccine."
2020-12-15 14:19:21,"This isn't something I'm going to feel bad about. In a world where we can solve lots of the problems of poverty because there's excess, this is one problem where rich countries can't and won't afford to put others first for altruistic or ethical reasons."
2020-12-15 14:21:46,Vaccination. Some Americans are wary. A new poll suggests that many in the U.S. are skeptical of getting a shot. In such a case why to reserve doses when they were not interested in any vaccination. The same can be given to poorer nations.
2020-12-15 14:43:48,"If the government of your country had financed the creation of a vaccine, how would the people of your country feel if it was given away to others before it was made available to them?

What will the US and the other countries who have ""over - ordered"" doses of these vaccines do with a surplus?

As our country's death toll crosses 300,000, most of our country's schoolchildren not receiving a proper education, and massive un-/underemployment, it would be downright irresponsible for the U.S. government not to prioritize vaccinating American citizens with the drug products that they invested in and pre-purchased."

The President - whether Trump, Biden, Obama, Bush, whoever - takes an oath to protect the life and liberty of the *American* people.

Furthermore, it is likely only ""rich"" countries that currently have the extremely powerful refrigeration needed to keep the vaccines from spoiling.  Once less wealthy countries acquire the necessary infrastructure, I'm sure the rich countries will release their holds on excess vaccines in order to enable others to distribute them."

2020-12-15 15:05:25,"It’s not as if those countries have over 16 million cases and a quarter of their population has died with hundreds of thousands more getting infected everyday. It should go to places where it’s first needed. However, hoarding more vaccines than needed is irresponsible and they should be given to poorer nations if possible."
2020-12-15 15:05:35,"Low-income countries have low infection rates and far lower fatalities (mainly due to earlier shut down and younger population - the average age in Africa is 19 for example). 
But they are being impacted by the economic emergency.
So for them getting the vaccine is far less important that getting economic growth back on track. 
This makes much of this analysis nonsense."
2020-12-15 14:48:55,"Have you ever thought that Mr Trudeau or Ms Merkel are far better at distributing the vaccine in corrupt poor countries that would have otherwise sold the vaccines in a black market someplace?

See Angola and the ex president’s daughter as an example of massive corruption and skimming government resources."

That said, I think most readers appreciate there are economic inequities in the world, but what I take from this is just a reason to be thankful to live in the US and for the efforts of the government and private sector."
2020-12-15 15:48:48,"It is very interesting to see how a topic like this is discussed across the pond. Despite all similarities in domestic politics among liberals in the US and Europe, foreign policy still seems to be characterised by ""America first"". That vaccination of poor countries should be high on everyone's agenda, as should be development aid in general, seems straight-forward from over here.

Regarding the higher case numbers/deaths in rich countries: This is not universal (Brazil) and could be a consequence of lower testing, at least partly.

Regarding the notion that Western countries developed and funded the technology - I don't believe anybody is surprised that it could only be done this way. Rich countries do have a responsibility here."
2020-12-15 15:52:59,It makes sense to lay down multiple bets when you don't know which of the bets might pay. A deeper question which is neither asked nor answered in this article is whether the doses of the vaccine would have been manufactured at all if not for the purchase guarantees made by developed economies.
2020-12-15 16:01:32,"The first object of any country is to take care of its own citizens first, just as it is with your family. If Burkino Faso developed a vaccine, I would assume they would vaccinate their citizens first and then share it with the world. I would not begrudge them their decision. To opine that the United States should cut back on its buying of the vaccine it developed so that other countries citizens get the vaccine is an interesting idea. Which group in the United States are you going to deny the vaccine to so that it can be sent to another country? What would be the writer's distribution plan and who would they choose?"
2020-12-15 16:17:06,"I can't even get my Congresswoman to believe Biden won the election, let alone think about who outside the US gets the vaccine.  Yes, poorer countries need to be vaccinated, but it also makes sense that they have access to medications that don't have the stringent cold storage requirements like Pfizer has.  The logistics are staggering even in developed countries.

I  believe President Biden and other world leaders will widen global access."
2020-12-15 16:26:21,"The countries that developed the vaccine will be done monopolizing it in, what, 6 months?  That gives them the time to build out the infrastructure, like ultra-cold freezers and dry ice plants, to support it when it is sent to them."
2020-12-15 16:26:48,"I keep reading that the vaccine protects us ""from severe Covid."" Are they differentiating between severe cases and asymptomatic or mild ones? I feel like I'm missing something. Wouldn't getting ANY type of Covid-19 make us a huge risk to others even if we are feeling ok? Maybe another reader could help me understand?"
2020-12-15 16:42:02,"The cold chain requirements of the Moderna vaccine make it a non-starter for most of the developing countries given that electricity and power shortages are a constant feature of everyday life here especially in rural areas of the developing world. Cost of the Moderna vaccine, of course, is also a major constraint.  AstraZeneca-Oxford looks more promising on grounds of both logistics and cost of purchase. However I foresee the Sinopharm and Sputnik V vaccines winning out over the rest because of Chinese and Russian willingness to subsidize the cost and willingness to distribute them without being concerned about patent restrictions that are a concern for the companies listed on the stock exchanges of Europe and the US. 
Perhaps the Western pharmaceutical companies should consider licensing the technology on a case by case basis to individual developing countries depending on each country's ability to pay as well as need. (Economists call this price discrimination.)
The point is that the world can't afford to relax if the virus rages in developing countries while it is contained in richer countries. At least not without draconian border controls and the stamping out of cross border migration."
2020-12-15 16:48:58,"Far down in the article you will see that there are countries participating in the Covax program -- where *some* rich countries have preordered extra vaccines with the intent of providing them to poor countries. From the moment Trudeau announced vaccine preporder here in Canada, the Covax program for poor countries has been mentioned alongside. Based on communications, Canada has planned on buying on behalf of poor countries since early this year and, as your article points out, is already trying to figure out the logistics of getting vaccines to countries who can't afford their own program."
2020-12-15 16:54:11,"The equity people are at it again, like horses with blinders on.  1. From statistics, high income countries are overwhelmingly  the most impacted as a gross total of cases and as a percentage of population for contracting COVID and for associated deaths.  
2. Middle income countries are next most impacted in gross numbers but less so as percentage of population. 
3.  The numbers for poor countries are comparatively much smaller.
So, it stands to reason that wealthier countries need more doses, and given the developmental phase of the vaccines, it also stands to reason that they will place orders with multiple sources not yet (as of ordering time) knowing which ones will be effective. 
The equity people should rest assured and be a little patient knowing that wealthy countries will not continue hoard but will distribute generously to the poorer countries, which they will begin even before their populations are fully vaccinated, not only out of goodwill, but due to plain common sense because what will they do stocks of 4-5 times population otherwise."
2020-12-15 16:59:24,It may turn out that no other vaccines approach the level of effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines. If this occurs governments should step in and make certain that production is massively increased at Moderna and Pfizer. This will require wealthy countries to pay for production facilities that these companies would not build on their own due to lack of profitability.
2020-12-15 16:43:35,"The people of those wealthy countries paid for the vaccines through their tax dollars. And just because you live in a wealthy country doesn't mean you're wealthy yourself. Some of the worst-off people are the ones who live in wealthy countries, who are expected to pay full price for drugs because of international pricing regimes, but are themselves too poor to pay for them or are on Medicaid or other welfare programs that are unwilling to allow access to them because of the price."
2020-12-15 16:38:07,"It’s like the preamble from a zombie movie. I hope they don’t rush it so much that serious side effects become apparent too late. 
But what’s the worst that can happen? IQ points dropping to such a staggering degree that people have trouble getting dressed in the morning? Limbs falling off? Skin turning blue?
Probably not."
2020-12-15 15:49:27,This is one of the benefits of a for-profit health care system.
2020-12-15 15:25:43,"Rather than looking at it by nation, it's more logical to see it by population. The US is by far the most infected, but it is the most influential who have both  spread and denied it (politicians), the elderly and ill who have died from it, the working class who have suffered (large families and service workers), along with the other most vulnerable (homeless). It makes sense they should get it first. In some other countries (Vietnam, S. Korea) they are better organized so its not critical; the same for India, China, Russia, Europe. Places like Mexico and Brazil are a problem, with leaders dishonest or ineffective, and could present greater problems with Covid in the future."
2020-12-15 16:13:20,"Well apparently we pay more for all these drugs than anybody else, so it stands to reason that we’d get them first? Plus from a humanitarian aspect, our President doesn’t seem to care about us, so it’s nice that these drug companies seem to be taking that initiative. The opposite of Purdue Pharma, no?
We can’t win for losing no matter what happens..."
2020-12-15 16:08:08,"I would like to hope that the more entitled countries of the world would give away the excess vaccines after their own citizens who choose to take the vaccine have been taken care of.  I wouldn't count on Trump sharing it with any country that doesn't support him or cater to him.  If he had his way, he would look at who voted for who, and deny Biden supporters or Democrats the vaccine. Nothing would surprise me with him. The fact that it was developed with U.S. support can justify using it for American's first.  But hoarding more than what you need while others die in less fortunate countries is just wrong.  And I would hope Canada would also share their excess.  It's the right thing to do."
2020-12-15 16:23:19,A life is a life. Why should the moral balance sheet require so many be saved from here or there based on wealth?
2020-12-15 17:13:33,"I am impressed by the research behind the article and the facts it points out, but if the US and other wealthy governments hadn’t funded the manufacturing of these vaccines in advance of test approval, they wouldn’t have been manufactured so quickly.  Only governments can afford to take on so much risk. The billions of dollars part is the cost of tooling up manufacturing and actually manufacturing and inventory. No corporation would take on so much risk without obtaining regulatory approval. 

The phrase “Make America Great” will have meaning when we learn that all of the vaccines are effective and the US taxpayer generously donates billions of dollars of vaccines to others around the world."
2020-12-15 15:37:03,"We paid enormously for this, both in lives lost and in $$$$.

You betcha we have first dibs.

2020-12-15 17:15:56,"This whole victim angle for almost every story, tied in with ethnicity, is getting really tiresome."
2020-12-15 16:52:06,Gosh - it was just last week when the NYT peanut gallery was up in arms at Trump for not executing an option to take more than 100m doses. You can't have it both ways!
2020-12-15 16:55:05,"Please New York Times, get off your high horse. Billions of tax payers dollars were hedged to get vaccins available as soon as possible. As a leader of a country or community or family your first concern is with the safety of your own. This is exactly what is happening right now. If there are doses left after everyone has been vaccinated in he 'rich' countries then the remainder can be happily donated."
2020-12-15 17:56:46,"Some confusion here between 'funding' and 'purchasing'. An American pre-order no more represents 'development funding' than the purchasing intentions of other nations or nation blocs such as the EU, which has also very extensively pre-ordered ALL the vaccines."
2020-12-15 17:42:37,"Part of the problem is that for most of this year there was no clear indication which, if any, of the vaccines under development would be effective or when each vaccine that was effective would become available for mass domestic distribution in each country.

There were & remain questions regarding the nature & extent of the immunity that each vaccine confers, the infrastructure needed to store, distribute & inoculate, etc.

While some clarity is emerging, many questions remain. It follows that those countries that can are hedging their bets through multiple contracts with several likely successful companies.

With luck, many of these questions will be answered shortly & this will allow rich countries like Canada to reallocate surplus stock to other countries as foreign aid.  Hopefully, such redistribution can be coordinated by the international community to ensure efficient & effective control of the pandemic in a timely manner."
2020-12-15 15:37:38,The US shoveled money at Pfizer to get going on the vaccine. Now Pfizer is shipping vaccines to Britain and Canada and the Americans have to sit and wait because there is a limited supply. Nicely done!
2020-12-15 17:15:33,"First a little math.  Each extra shot of vaccine causes the immune system to react logarithmically,  while each doubling of dose per shot causes less than double the immune reaction.  What that means is that there is effectively infinite ability to vaccinate people with a given volume of vaccine.  All you need to know is the required immune response and the mass of vaccine and you can solve for the number and size of doses for a given population.  Based up the phase 3 data on mRNA-1273 and phase 1 clinical trials moderna alone is making enough vaccine for 2 billion people a month on a 2 dose protocol and the entire planet on a three dose protocol.  The issue is a failure to think creatively to solve this problem and not vaccine supply."
2020-12-15 15:48:00,"countries with pockets deep enough to fund vaccine research and development in exchange for first dibs on the finished product....sounds like a 'politically correct' quid pro quo. and, as far as the potential hoarding of the vaccine, i'm sure i've got more toilette paper stacked in my garage than i need. self preservation. that's what the human race has done since day one. i'm empathetic but i'm also thankful that i live in a nation that has the means to hoard and that i'm able to stock up on the charmin. my goal is to give the cockroach a run for his money."
2020-12-15 15:45:31,"Vaccines should be ""open source"" and anyone should be able to use them, not just the richest.
The companies who develop them are profiteering off of the public (it is taxpayer money that backs much of the research and development that goes into these vaccines), and it is leading to hundreds of  thousands of additional deaths all around the world.
They KNOW the outcome, but put profits first anyway. It's murder."
2020-12-15 16:37:20,In these days of life online many of us have friends and loved ones all over the world and do not believe lives in some countries are worth more than lives in other countries.
2020-12-15 16:47:12,So what would the complainers have us do? Not vaccinate the western countries that paid for and developed the vaccine until the infrastructure of ultra-cold freezers is built in the rest of the world. Poor nations always get the short end of the stick. Always have and always will.
2020-12-15 16:49:05,"I'm confused. Why would the rich countries not take care of their own? What universal moral standard prompts these headlines? Surely it isn't based on God's morality (there isn't one). We've accepted that no culture stands above the other, that all our norms are made up by consensus and contingency. The contingency now is to take care of your own first."
2020-12-15 16:46:21,"This is exactly the article I have been expecting from the New York Times.  The U.S. and the other western democracies should be responsible for developing a vaccine but we should give it away free to other countries so their populations have it on an equal basis.  It's right that more of our citizens shall die and our economic recovery will take longer because an equal number of others may be saved and after all, we are all rich."
2020-12-15 16:30:30,"It's called patriotism and a love of your nation; no different to a parent putting their children first i.e. good parenting; time poorer nations started looking inward at the wealth accumulated by corrupt governments in those countries and have a revolution and make an effort to overthrow their governments and become civilised Democracies, instead of passing the blame onto the developed world. Actions speak louder than worlds."
2020-12-15 17:50:19,"To be fair, our money is the only reason a vaccine exists today.  We'll get it and they will benefit too."
2020-12-15 16:25:40,My understanding is that Canada entered orders for excess vaccine in order to be able to share with less wealthy nations.  The article makes no mention of this (if it's true).
2020-12-15 17:47:21,"I think the whole article can be summarized in the last sentence, ""then all bets are off"".  I guess compassion, generosity, fairness, integrity are all conditional.  I know money talks but is it louder and more powerful than the cry of the human condition?"
2020-12-15 15:28:47,"Once richer counties vaccinate their population, they will help bankroll vaccination for poor countries. Except for richer countries, there would be no vaccines."
2020-12-15 15:42:22,"There is much about the world that operates on simple economics and healthcare is one of them (no different from food and clean water.) So I am not surprised in the least by this. I hope that we and other countries who have first dibs will make a concerted effort to assist poorer nations down the line with the manufacture and distribution of the vaccine (as we did and continue to do with small pox, polio, measles, cholera, tetanus etc) Being first in line should not be equated with evil. Think of this as the “put your own oxygen mask on first before assisting others.” We will be in no position to help others if we can’t get this under control within our own borders."
2020-12-15 17:21:49,FYI the Canadian government just committed $800m to assist developing countries acquire and distribute the vaccine. That fact was somehow omitted from this article.
2020-12-15 17:27:57,"Certainly they must get enough doses for their populations or face the political consequences. However, this does not preclude them from then donating surpluses to poor countries.

This will be a win for them."
2020-12-15 15:45:22,"Africa's average age is 18-20 and since this group has the lowest mortality while Europe and Japan are the oldest countries, it is reasonable and medical sound to vaccinate them first."
2020-12-15 15:53:14,"If the US can manage to roll out the vaccine to all their citizens in a timely,
world's best practice way, they'll be one step closer to proving that they can run a national health care system comparable with their first world peers.
Baby steps, but steps matter. If Walter Reed can save Trump, with all his comorbitities and bad diet, then the Walter Reed model needs to be scaled up. That outcome can be accomplished for the cost of a standard overseas US military invasion. The American people have been through plenty of misery with Covid-19, they deserve a better health care system."
2020-12-15 15:21:22,"Where's the evidence that countries with socialized medicine fare worse than the U.S., with our for profit health care industry?  
 
Seems to me countries with national health plans are doing a much better job of it."
2020-12-15 17:06:12,"I would think that the human populations most worthy of receiving the vaccine are those which managed to keep their citizens safe through the well-known public health guidelines of masking, social distancing and hand washing. They have demonstrated responsibility towards themselves, their countrymen and the world. Countries, like the US & Sweden, which failed to protect citizens should receive the vaccine later."
2020-12-15 15:57:17,"In most articles, it is people complaining about the “greedy” 1%. This article points out that our entire nation is the 1% and so the tone of the comments have shifted to “we paid to develop the vaccine and so we deserve it more.”  

Human being (and I guess all life forms) are self-serving and that’s understandable. I’d rather that we just accept that our opinions are based on self-interest instead of trying to justify them with moral righteousness."
2020-12-15 16:04:04,"Since rich countries funded the R&D that developed the vaccine, it makes sense that they have dibs."
2020-12-15 15:53:10,The Canadian position is rather straight forward. First the vulnerable and then the rest of the population. Based on current model the rest will and should be part of the foreign aid mandate. Keep in mind some countries are aware of the inequities and will be shipping out excess as aid. Not all countries are capable of making these type of aggressive orders up front.
2020-12-15 17:03:10,"The US government didn't know which of the vaccines would work, so they hedged our bets by buying from multiple developers.  

So of course they pre-purchased more doses than they needed.  

That was a good idea too, as some vaccine results were not good, and Astra Zeneca messed up their trials."
2020-12-15 16:10:15,Just a friendly reminder that China will be able to supply third-world countries with lots of their own vaccines since they don’t need mass vaccination themselves at this point. If they manage not to make a blunder this could be a turning point for China’s medical industry.
2020-12-15 17:49:48,"It seems unfair to blame the rich countries for the problems with vaccine distribution.  For instance, many of these vaccine only exist because the US funded the research. This is capitalism.  And even the poorer countries will get the vaccine sooner due to the money invested by the wealthier countries."
2020-12-15 15:21:29,"It appears that many commenters are not even reading this article.  Few if any people are saying ""No first dibs"" for countries who are funding research and development.

The question is:  should the most vulnerable  populations of poor countries be denied vaccines until everyone in rich countries (including populations who are not very vulnerable) have been offered vaccines?

It is immoral to make ability to pay the only determinant of priority.   We share the globe with many human beings who are not to blame for their poverty or for poor planning ability of their government.    Priorities should be: 1) vaccinate our most vulnerable populations; 2) release vaccines for most vulnerable populations of other countries; 3) vaccinate our less vulnerable populations; 4) release vaccines for less vulnerable populations of other countries.

This honors the natural instinct to give first priority to those footing the bill, while still giving a priority to humanitarian concern.

We need to open our hearts to the realities and needs of people other than ourselves.   To whom much is given, much is required."
2020-12-15 15:45:14,"For months folks were clamoring about the urgency of a safe and effective vaccine to be manufactured.

Now, not one but TWO pharmaceutical companies have begun to distribute this life saving vaccine.

The moments of joy, elation and relief felt by so many seem to be short lived because now, the mean, ugly and nasty side of people is seem emerging from the woodwork. 

It seems nothing positive can linger for more than a few moments or days, at best."
2020-12-15 17:29:38,"It's a travesty that drug production is trapped in the claws of neoliberal capitalism like every other commodity that promises to fuel the financial coffers of .01%.  Why has there been not a single outcry from the corporate media for cooperation and sharing to develop, test and then distribute a vaccine?  Once a lab discovered promising results, why were those findings not immediately shared with manufacturers world-wide?  When a global disaster cannot marshal a global response, it reveals a fatal defect in the DNA of human species itself."
2020-12-15 15:28:03,"I believe this article makes it clear that Megan Twohey, Keith Collins and Katie Thomas want to give up their doses and wait until all the citizens of the poorer third-world countries have been vaccinated.  

I think that is very generous of them, but not something everyone agrees with."
2020-12-15 15:24:59,"In regard to Canada, Trudeau to his credit has spent an inordinate amount of time front and centre facing Canadians throughout the months of this pandemic encouraging PPC use and social distancing while ensuring the population that his government was there for them financially to the point of a large deficit spending support program. No system is perfect, however at least Trudeau, like him or not, was not prepared to save money and sacrifice lives for the sake of a selfish personal political agenda as obviously has been the case south of the 49th. There was full bipartisan spending support in Parliament. Having said that, most of that money was spent in highly urbanized southern Canada where the infection rates have been devastating. However, to educate Americans, while all this money has been spent by Ottawa and an inordinate amount of Covid vaccine reserved, at the same time many indigenous communities in this country have lacked clean water sources, many on boil water orders for generations. Many of these communities continue living in 3rd world conditions as pointed out by the UN. This is inexcusable for a so called G8 rich nation to act while nailing down vaccines, essentially for the wealthy south. It would be equal to California, the wealthiest state in the Union, failing to support clean water infrastructures to the least and most needy of its communities. Just saying."
2020-12-15 15:33:22,Canada has ordered multiple vaccines ( when the success and roll out dates were yet unknown) and this means we potentially will have far more than we need.  But we are also members of COVax- the international consortium that will be distributing vaccines to poorer countries - so we are “hoarding.”   The other consideration that is relevant at this moment in time is that the two approved vaccines have complex logistical requirements. It makes no sense to try to distribute the mRNA vaccines in countries with poor infrastructure and weak governance capacity. Vaccines with less challenging characteristics are coming.
2020-12-15 17:50:42,"Shall we note that our taxes and century plus of mostly stable democratic governing allows my country as well as others the ability to develop, subsidize, produce, and share this vaccine as well as a plethora of others."
2020-12-15 15:35:46,If you buy into the argument that drug companies deserve high profits on drugs because of the risk they take in developing them then it is logical for rich countries who have paid for the development of vaccines to get them first. If rich countries don't get priority then what is the incentive for them to fund development the next time there is a crisis? The poor countries still benefit since they will get the vaccine eventually whereas without the rich funding development there would be none for anyone. They will undoubtedly also get the vaccine at a greatly reduced cost. It is a case of he who pays the piper calls the tune. Everyone else still gets to listen.
2020-12-15 16:19:58,"I’m thinking about these countries about as much as they are thinking about the health of our country in my family, sorry, not feeling it....￼"
2020-12-15 16:33:20,"If we don't save ourselves how can we help others?  Can you imagine if a world leader from a developed country failed to secure vaccines and agreed to provide them to a poor country? Also, wealth has not saved nations from the virus.  The US is one of the richest and has one of the highest death rates of any country.  By that measure the US needs it more than, say, Kenya."
2020-12-15 18:01:57,"But all vaccines won't work out, nor be delivered at the same time."
2020-12-15 17:59:32,"Generosity in the time of plenty is easy . . . generosity in the time of scarcity is humane and compassionate. Come on Canada, US, and Britain - quit hoarding and share the bounty. And, in case you hadn't noticed, it's Christmas . . ."
2020-12-15 17:54:18,"Two comments:
1. Vaccines work epidemiologically like herd immunity. A large proportion (>60-70%) of a population needs to be immunized in order for an epidemic to be controlled and eradicated.
1b. Contact tracing and continued surveillance should be maintained (and enhanced) even after these levels of vaccination have been achieved.
2. The caveat voiced by Dr. Udayakumar suggest that coronaviruses are as epitopically mutable as influenza viruses. There is no evidence of this."
2020-12-15 17:42:30,"I would love to see a timeline on WHEN all these ""excess"" doses are to be delivered to the countries listed.  It's one thing to look like you are hoarding, it's quite another if you don't get scheduled to receive those doses late in the game.

Trump had the opportunity to be early in line, but refused.  Now he wants to bully his way in (like he always has).  The net result is that more Americans will die than might have.

As much as I despise the Administration, to not make sure the upper echelons of US government are vaccinated early, and to make sure the incoming government is vaccinated early is negligent towards continuity.  I almost wonder if Trump is hoping the incoming folks catch it from his staff."
2020-12-15 17:52:53,I believe Canada's PM has indicated that Canada will donate excess to countries in need.
2020-12-15 17:15:11,"The US should have bought more, now after 300 million doses spread until June we will have wait longer or hope other vaccines come on board.  If we have a surplus we could send it overseas.  

Much cheaper than having the economy shut down and people dying.

The article failed to mention the shortage of reagents which might bring some of these vaccines to a halt.

Yes a global approach would have. been better. I hope the poor here get a shot."
2020-12-15 18:07:51,"The United States and other ""rich countries"" placed these orders before knowing which, if any, of the proposed vaccines would work -- so any effort to obtain an adequate supply of the vaccines that would ultimately be proven to work required total orders in excess of need. And these advance orders helped to finance the vaccine development.

The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses and extremely cold storage. How many poor countries have the infrastructure to deal with those requirements?"
2020-12-15 14:32:52,"So, criticizing the Trump administration for reserving more vaccine (which the U.S. paid for) than needed, less than a week after an article criticizing the Trump administration for NOT reserving more vaccine from Pfizer, thus “losing our place in line” to poorer countries.

2020-12-15 15:42:53,"Wow I expected this comment board to show a bit more empathy and global-mindedness. After all, we are all part of humanity. 

A partying college kid in the US might get it before a frontline doctor in Mexico?

The fear and desire are understandable, but really I wish we were better than this. This is what we showcase as the self-proclaimed “leader of the free world”... after politicizing the virus and refusing even the least inconvenience like mask wearing? We come across as not just fools but selfish fools."
2020-12-15 16:02:26,Bill Gates should ask for more money for vaccines from the billionaires boys club. He and tother billionaires can easily cough up a lot more than one billion to aid poorer nations.
2020-12-15 16:58:21,Seems like pre-orders are causing problems for more than the Xbox and PS5. Maybe the doses will show up on Ebay?
2020-12-15 15:55:22,"Looking at the comments and the amount of untrue information about Pfizer having developed the vaccine and the American taxpayer having financed it, it surprises me how many Trump supporters read the NYT."
2020-12-15 16:30:16,"Let's face it. It's every man or woman  for him or her self.  Who are we kidding.  People are so selfish they can't even wear a mask, do you think they would care about a poor country getting vaccine?  This has been our foreign policy since George Washington, and it isn't about to change.

2020-12-15 16:04:09,I just read another NYT article that pointed out that the USA is still  without vaccine pre orders for 180 million people. we have 100 million diesels coming from Pfizer ( covers 50 million people) and 200 coming from Moderna (covering 100 million people) leaving 180 million without clear coverage.  So which is it?
2020-12-15 15:45:13,"As usual the ugly American stereotype rears its head. What people need to remember is that life can't go back to normal until the virus is eradicated. That means vaccinating everyone or the US gets reinfected again.

In anticipation of counterproductive US selfishness, Pfizer opted out of 'Operation Warpspeed' and Oxford specified in advance that their serum would be sold at cost price. Most of the virus manufacturers skipped the White House 'vaccine summit'

2020-12-15 16:56:04,"People over 75 all over the world should be vaccinated first. That means a 75 year old in South Sudan or India or the DR Congo or anywhere in the world. Then, and only then which may be months later should we start with the under 75 year old health care workers and others. Again treating the globe as one equal place. We are a global world. Where are all the Globalist's in the US government and the demonstrators now when lives are on the line. We are one big integrated global world....walk the walk. If a 38 year old in Seattle voluntarily gets in line to be vaccinated before all the 80 year olds in Jakarta have had it then you lose your right to scream equality for all the worlds people. We will see who believes what they say or just wants the admiration of their friends and likes on facebook posts."
2020-12-15 16:05:28,"This article rests on a vacuous premise. How many rounds of vaccine do you think EACH citizen will have? No more than one (i.e., 1). So WHAT's your point?

Are you stoking outrage over the fact that richer countries funded the research/development of a desperately needed vaccine? And as a result, their citizens should reasonably expect to receive the benefits of those efforts ... having PAID for them?

Sheesh. 

Don't worry, excess supply of vaccines will go to wherever they are demanded. Just like the for-profit NYTimes business... it's how efficient markets operate."

330 Million people in America.
We need 660 Million injections.
Trump ordered 50 Million.

We have no where near the amount needed to even cover the front line healthcare workers in America, much less the nursing homes and sick elderly. And meanwhile the death toll quadruples.

Add this to Donald Trump's list of colossal failures."

It's also shooting yourself in the foot.

If half of the first available vaccinations aren't sent outside the country, to Africa etc., then an extra 2 million people will die from Covid19. And the increased infections will affect the world at large."
2020-12-15 16:23:36,"These are purchase options, not on hand inventory. The article makes it sound as if Canada will be hoarding 4X the amount of needed vaccine. I'm sure once our population has been inoculated, we will either release those options to  be sold, or donate our excess inventory to countries in need. This is a ridiculous and needlessly inflammatory take. And BTW, where is Russia on these graphs?"

2020-12-15 16:20:35,"Quite the headline. It creates an image that Canada, the US and Britain are hoarding the life saving vaccines. Canada announced $230 million to procure vaccines for UNICEF to buy three million courses of COVID-19 antibody therapeutics. Another $255 million will go to Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a coalition that is ensuring equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to poor countries. Canada's total contribution to ACT Accelerator to $865 million. You can argue it is not enough and it likely isn’t but it is not the suggested hoarding that the NYTimes headline suggests."
2020-12-15 18:04:00,"By the time the vaccines roll out, 33% of the US will have been infected already, 33% will refuse, and that leaves the 34% uninfected and willing. So 110 million is probably what we need."
2020-12-15 17:16:35,"It is obscene to talk about ""intellectual property rights"" in the midst of a pandemic. This translates into the right to human lives, i.e. slavery."
2020-12-15 16:44:01,"You can't simultaneously point out what a bad job the US has done in protecting its population from COVID and then demand that we give vaccine away before the US is fully immunized. Coupled with the fact that we seem to have funded most of the Pfizer-Biontech and Moderna vaccine development, I don't have a problem with prioritizing Americans. But by all means, let's make sure to distribute extra vaccine to the developing world. China is clearly using Sinopharm (who probably created their vaccine using some industrial espionage against Western pharma companies) to do such a thing.

Lastly, the NYT seems to be playing a bit fast and lose with doses versus full vaccines. It doesn't ever seem to be clear if we're reading about single doses in a two-dose vaccine or if we're reading about full vaccine complements of two doses. I'd guess that we're talking about single doses since that might fit the political bent of the story better (i.e. make the Western economies seem more greedy)."
2020-12-15 16:02:58,"I have no qualms about the richest countries like ours attempting to protect the lives of their citizens. Face it, most of the emerging or mid-level countries are so corrupt and disorganized they could not even distribute vaccines such as Phizer's. We will vaccinate our citizens, and whoever is left will receive their's,"
2020-12-15 17:53:26,"since it is two injections per person, it is no wonder that the number of vaccines must exceed the populations."

2020-12-15 14:40:24,"The Times complained about the U.S. not securing enough Pfizer doses last week, and now they complain about securing too many doses this week. I’m pretty sure if not for the Western world’s investment and innovation there would be no vaccine for poor countries to look forward to. That’s the benefit of leading the R&D process...you go to the front of the line. This is another example of why media credibility is declining. The Times only prints stories which fit within their philosophical world view which posits the U.S. is an selfish, racist country and most of the world’s problems can be attributed to the “evil rich”."
2020-12-15 16:22:43,"Citizens of the world, unite! Wear masks, practice social distancing, wash your hands...even these protective measures are out of reach of millions, in nations rich and poor. And yet, they are available, today, and they protect, if you allow them to. Many will choose to not be vaccinated, anyway. Medicine is what is needed when prevention is ignored or impossible. We have the means to manufacture and distribute preventative PPE worldwide. Jeez, pay attention...has this message not gotten through yet? MASK, DISTANCE, HAND SANITIZER!"
2020-12-15 18:14:26,Not our problem; badly run nations and the citizens there need to change their governments so they have secular democracies; these 'so called' poor nations have many millionaires and billionaires and extreme poverty; tells you a lot about the culture and abuse of their own citizens and no patriotism and taxation systems when these millionaires and billionaires use all their own citizens for slave labour and there are no laws to protect them. We're the lucky ones as our ancestors worked hard to put decent foundations in place to protect the poor and vulnerable citizens of our nations. Bad luck if you're born into those abusive nations where they exploit their own people to increase the wealth of their own rich in their nations. Most will be corrupt religious nations and not secular democracies.
2020-12-15 18:03:47,"The reason these vaccines were made available so quickly was because rich countries purchased doses whether they will br approved or not. Its great that it appears many of these will be approved, but they have just started getting approval. It feels really premature to not only speculate that richer countries will not share excess vaccines, but that they should start making plans for the excess vaccines when many havent even been approved. 

These articles really seem to disingenuously try to misrepresent whats occurring so that they can shame the greedy west for not having plans, prior even to some approvals, to distribute vaccines that may or may not be needed. 

There could be issues with some vaccines, in which case we will need to switch to more effective ones. We could find out we only need one of the vaccines, they all end up being effective, and then we can make plans with what to do with the excess. But these calls for us to have plans for excess vaccines when they have literally been approved for less than a few weeks just feels like bad journalism, and trying to manipulate the optics of a situation to stir up uproar over a non-issue. Again, if wealthy countries hadnt purchased vaccines that may or may not fail prior to complete development (and theyve still purchased many that are unusable) then we would not have a vaccine right now."
2020-12-15 18:09:39,"The job of the American government is to protect the lives and property of American citizens any other action would be a breach of their sworn duties.

2020-12-15 18:09:51,It’s a global village. If we do not help the poorer countries to inoculate against COVID-19 then the pandemic will continue. This is a prime example of why the world does not enjoy equality. It’s all about the money. So once again greed dictates which countries will prevail and which ones will not. When will we ever learn?
2020-12-15 18:15:02,Canada will hopefully give their extra to a poorer country.    Why did they order 5x?  Why did anyone order more than the population?   Greed?
2020-12-15 18:21:10,"There are plenty of millionaires and billionaires in these 'so called' poor nations, who could buy vaccine for all their citizens; except that won't happen as they privatise their profits and socialise their losses such as supporting the poor and vulnerable in the nation with a decent taxation system."
2020-12-15 12:36:49,"So what if the rich countries have ordered more vaccines for their own citizens. I guess writers do not understand the concept of a nation-state, a country is supposed to be the lookout for its own first. The US needs to have ample doses for every man, woman, and child who wants a vaccine, and then only if we are generous enough we should give to others. We don't owe anybody anything."
2020-12-15 15:12:56,"Companies have made it clear it is a matter of “when” not “if.”  And yes, poor countries have less of mostly everything, so this all seems a bit moot.  But  it should be noted that the mRNA vaccines require complex manufacturing and distribution, likely much proprietary, so threats of patent busting may either dissuade companies from supporting local manufacture, or local manufacture that is reverse engineered will not result in comparable or active products.  That said, I note that Congress and in particular progressives haven’t volunteered to delay their dosing until the vulnerable have been treated, even those in this country."
2020-12-15 14:58:46,"We Americans have had our lives disrupted, ruined or ended by this virus that China unleashed upon the world.  American taxpayers have had to pony up billions of dollars for vaccine research that sooner or later will benefit every other country, including the culprit (China).  We have every right to have first dibs, and if anyone has a problem with that, talk to China."
2020-12-15 18:52:50,"Let's at least acknowledge that part of the reason wealthy countries are getting more vaccines is because they are the societies that also actually developed the vaccines.  Part of the reason these societies are wealthy is because they developed the knowledge, skills, and expertise to succeed in the modern world.  Many of the poorer countries have only been producing more poor people that will need vaccines.  They can wait."
2020-12-15 18:37:06,"Well, this is just the same thing as hoarding toilet paper, manifested on the national scale.  Countries are just a reflections of their populous, i.e., many are selfish, fearful and belligerent."
2020-12-15 18:39:12,"Not too long ago we were treated to a storm of outrage over the plight of poor migrant families  and children in cages. Fast forward today, we hear nary a peep from the same crowd of outraged moralists over the fact that the very families whose treatment they were fond of calling 'a crime against humanity' will have to wait until late next year or 2022 just to get our vaccine sloppy seconds because we and the Canadians have hoarded the supply. Which is to say that apparently the level of outrage we generate in this society over a social wrong is entirely dependent on what political advantage can be leveraged from it. In this case, any moral outrage over hoarding won't get you votes at election time and/or make Biden look bad, nor will putting a sign outside your church castigating Americans for vaccine selfishness add members."
2020-12-15 18:51:37,"Even after the vaccine has been distributed, COVID-19 will be a disaster haunting America for years.  It was all Trump’s fault, and it was preventable. Future historians will regard this as the Trump Plague and the Trump Global Recession. 

The US is the worst in the world in dealing with COVID, because of Trump’s denial and incompetence. Woodward’s tapes prove that Trump has been lying about this from the beginning.

The US has about 1/3 of the new COVID infections in the world, and about 1/5 of the new deaths, with about 1/25 of the world population.  300,000 Americans have died from COVID, and it will be more than 500,000 before it is over.  Millions more have long-lasting or permanent injuries.  

Remarkably, a majority of Trump voters believe the Trump propaganda that COVID is no worse than the flu.  If they understood the truth, they could not have voted for Trump.

On Jan. 20th, President Biden can start the healing, both medically and politically.  A vaccine will help next year, but this must be applied to everyone across the planet to eradicate the virus.  That requires rejoining WHO and working with public health agencies around the world.  Otherwise, a mutated version of COVID will be returning every year.

President Biden should also create an international program to prevent the next pandemic from getting off the ground.
Never Again!"
2020-12-15 18:43:21,"' “The high-income countries have gotten to the front of the line and cleared the shelves,” said Andrea Taylor, a Duke researcher who is studying the contracts.'
This is silly: if it weren't for orders from high-income countries, the drug companies would not have manufactured these drugs in such quantities in the first place. It is evident that these high income countries have purchased far more of these drugs than they need. So what are they going to do with this excess? Presumably, give it to poor countries."
2020-12-15 18:31:17,"'Some experts predict it will be 2024 before there is enough vaccine. Others, like Dr. Hatchett, think that as more people get sick and acquire natural immunity, the need for the vaccine will diminish and the supply will be adequate by late 2022.'

I have issues with the article like many in the comments, but I continue to be disappointed that wanting to help people or communities with fewer resources is so often sneered at. But of course we’re now living in a political climate where a wanting to do anything to help anyone elicits deafening screams of socialism and communism. It’s really not that hard to help other people when the benefit to them vastly outweighs the cost to you."
2020-12-15 18:36:54,"Excellent: This way the 'rich' countries can recover their economies early, get their populations off food lines, before helping 'poor' countries.

The rest of the world can wait! Our government has pre-ordered lots of the vaccination and I couldn't care less if I get the vaccine or not as I wear a mask. I'm about the only person who wears a mask and feel a lot healthier since covid-19 and closed borders. :))) We're having a brilliant summer in NZ as we're covid-19 free and our economy is doing well with massive diary orders from China exceeding previous orders. Exports are up in our nation! We're a secular democracy and take better care of our people than religious nations.
2020-12-15 19:20:30,"Have we not learned over the last year that we are only as safe as the least safe amongst our communities?

I wouldn't take any vaccine that was not approved by the World Health Organisation, either."
2020-12-15 19:26:46,"Full credit to Canada for being one of the few smart countries that actually sat down and drew a realistic roadmap that accounted for the reality that these vaccines take multiple shots and that we may see more waves of this diabolical illness. 

On the other hand, come on, Canada; you don't need more doses than you have citizens. That's true of all nations. If this turns into a situation where wealthy Western nations hoard this vaccine, we'll have proven we learned nothing during this pandemic. 

It's in everyone's interest that we ensure even distribution. For a decade, we've brayed about this ""flat earth"" economic theory that posits the idea that we're all in this together and that the world turns on international trade and cooperation. 

Very few fell for this naïve line; it was always a transparent stratagem to fleece poorer countries by exporting work to  nations willing to work for pennies on the dollar. The ironic thing is that in its purest form, the theory is correct.  

The climate crisis, pandemic crisis, and dwindling resources clarify that it's so urgent that it's literally life-saving that we learn to share resources, talents, and ideas. But if this pandemic has proven anything, it's that we're a fatally selfish, short-sighted, and greedy species. There's no vaccine for that other than the one both utterly simple and preposterously complex... changing. 

Old habits need to die hard so that we can evolve into being a more philanthropic and generous world."

Vaccines are something that really only work when their is herd immunity so nations need to vaccinate a majority of their populations.

Let's re-visit this issue once the primary nations are vaccinated to herd, seems a bit premature now."

2020-12-15 22:40:57,"While the facts might be correct, the messaging is wrong. No country deliberately purchased vaccine dosages for multiples of its population. As several comments point out, they were placing bets on which of the vaccines would work. Happily it would seem, they are all very effective. Once these countries have sufficient dosage for their populations, the additional dosages will be released to countries who need them more."
2020-12-15 22:45:27,"I believe it is entirely prudent for our government to have purchased enough vaccine to cover the population, even four times over. 
That means 
1) the government is doing what it is supposed to do, serve the people who elected it.
2) the government has hedged its bets that it will be able to proved a viable vaccine to its people.
This does not mean that the government is going to use ALL of the vaccine it has options on. It’s not like I want to be vaccinated four times over.
Once its own population has been covered, I believe the government will make the excess available for distribution to those countries in need.
I believe our government has acted entirely responsibly for its people."

if you take that much public money, you have a responsibility to give back and to make your vaccines available to the world so that everyone can be vaccinated quickly. No one is safe from covid until everyone is safe from covid, and it’s in everyone’s interest to share these vaccines now. The hoarding by rich nations is shameful.

2020-12-16 00:54:26,"Does anyone remember how the left heckled Alex Azar’s claim that a vaccine would be available before the end of the year? I will just say, thank you very much Pfizer, Moderna, and last but not least President Trump. As for the commentators who were wrong? Perhaps you will learn to look past your hate of Trump and perhaps be more solution oriented."
2020-12-16 02:18:22,"It is perfectly OK to take care of ourselves first.
What is NOT OK is to sneer at other countries for being unable to afford to vaccinate their populace, as several commenters have done.

In the age of Trump, Americans do not seem to understand that it is nicer not to mention certain things, even if they are true.

America does do a lot of good to other countries, pro bono. We should have been one of the world's most loved people.
But our attitude makes us look much worse than we actually are."
2020-12-16 04:08:07,"I'm not entirely sure of the value of this data analysis, because it doesn't distinguish between countries with huge populations (such as the US, China and India) and those with tiny populations (such as Kuwait and Moldova). 

It also fails to focus on the number of cases per country. A striking feature of Covid 19 has been the very high incidence of disease in the highest income advanced countries of the world, such as the US and Western Europe, and strikingly low incidence in many poor countries, aside from India, Brazil and Peru."

If it means that camera operators, set designers, scriptwriters, actors, et al., will have jobs, let the commercials begin!"
2020-12-16 19:01:25,The NFL this year was a disgrace. They basically ‘forced’ the season despite a deadly pandemic. Games were postponed and cancelled. Players got sick. No fans in the stadiums. The right thing to do would have been to take a year off from football. Instead they forced the issue and gave us a terrible product.
2020-12-14 13:11:27,"No one in China would even have to actively push this message for it to be successful.  It is obvious to anyone paying attention that they handled the virus infinitely better than Europe and the US.  Particularly in the US, even if we had had competent leadership, decades of austerity means that our government lacks the capacity for the kind of mass mobilization China used to crush the virus.  Now they are essentially giving away a vaccine to most people on the planet.  What’s the benefit of living in the US, again?  Someone please remind me as I enter month 10 of quasi-quarantine in my overpriced studio apartment, while my neighbors wait in food lines and hospitals fill up for the second time this year."
2020-12-14 13:30:08,"We would like to believe the vaccine will enable us to turn this page into history.  However we have never had a permanent vaccine against the flu virus. In the Fall of 2021, we may put Covid behind us - but only the current version.  Recurring pandemics will push some minds into believing a more authoritarian response is in order.  If so, history may be on the side of a model somewhat like Chinas."
2020-12-14 13:26:49,"It’s not the authoritarian system - it’s a question of leadership. Who will point the country and its people in the direction that will lead to success and prosperity? 

We have not had that sort of leadership for the past four years. China’s Xi, surrounded by his politburo, has kept whatever squabbling it endured under wraps and deployed a strategy that is working right now.

A strong western leader could humble China by not succumbing to its demands in exchange for trade. We should keep our secrets. We should take the steps to insulate ourselves from China’s threats.

One example - rare earth materials used in electronics. We have all the rare earth materials we need. They are encased in the scrap of discarded computers, cell phones, televisions, and more. We are unwilling to invest in the facilities to recover them in an environmentally safe manner. So what do we do? Send it back to China at scrap prices. They distribute it for recycling and the result is polluted water, birth defects, and death. 

We should care about that. We could solve a lot of problems with some government backing and a plan. We  could stop China in its tracks. No jet engines or spare parts. China doesn’t have the technology or equipment to build a modern jet engines. Find what they must buy and deny to sell it to them. Certain agricultural products. I don’t want to starve anybody, but put an export tax on it - the reverse of an import tariff - and make it expensive for them. That will hurt, too."
2020-12-14 14:00:09,"I lived in Southern China for  many years, and I speak Mandarin. I remain in contact with my friends in China. 
I would agree with the article’s premise.
The Chinese government simply gets things done,  without having to quibble with an opposition party.
Human rights aside.
The Chinese govt has modernized infrastructure. Built  new dams, modernized it’s power grid. High speed rail now visits most Chinese large, and medium sized cities. They have quashed COVID with stay at home rules. Which, in this country would cause a violent revolution .
The CCP doesn’t  have to worry about a political party using every obstructionist tactic known to man to block legislation . ( See Mitch McConnell).
The downside of single political party lasting power is obvious :
Human rights and freedom of speech become threatened. Corruption can spread like COVID.
The judicial system is no longer separate from government interference.Freedom of political speech disappears into the nation’s history. 
Under Donald Trump , we’ve had a little taste of what authoritarianism might look like in America.
As Trump attempted to control the independent justice department,  the Pentagon, and SCOTUS. Trump’s war on the MSM as “the enemy of the people.”
Personally, I like the idea of high speed trains and quality broadband across the US.
However, I believe in checks and balances,  and a robust loyal opposition facing the political party in power, and the loss of America’s constitutional freedoms."
2020-12-14 14:07:29,"The West has been at war for years, not in the traditional sense but economically.  What is consistent from China is their commitment and relentless execution to their strategic goals, of note: growth, environment and technology. 

The West can be successful, sticking to common core principles of our governments (freedom, liberty, equality), but we’ve got to quit arguing with each other and align on a vision for the future.  The US also needs allies as we cannot go it alone and be successful."
2020-12-14 14:11:11,"China is an authoritarian one-party state, but it has not rejected science, reality and facts.

That gives it an advantage over the USA, which has a major political party opposed to science, reality and facts.

If you want to see how destructive that rejection of reality can be, take a look at the collapse of the old Soviet Union that was built on propaganda and the same type of Down Is Up and Up is Down sensibility that defines today's Republican Party.

America can become a powerful and sane country again, but not with the current GOP weighing it down like an anchor.

Heckuva' job, GOP.

So much for patriotism."
2020-12-14 16:18:10,Those familiar with China’s detailed 5000 year history of authoritarian leadership are not surprised with China’s surging growth and dominance. Lest we forget until the 1700’s China was the world’s largest economy throughout recorded history. It speaks volumes that all Chinese students learn to speak and write English. And within recent decades China has established a broad based first class western style college and university system. And finances upwards of half a million top students studying in the bet western universities. Those following China’s remarkable achievements in the past 30 years have few if any doubts about the success of China’s quest for global economic and military dominance in our lifetimes. Those who view “democracy as the only way forward” need study modern China.
2020-12-14 16:05:27,"Its worth considering that at no point in history would a free democratic nation be able to pull off a rapid uniform response like an authoritarian nation. Its not its nature, democracy is messy and slow, that's what makes it human.

The strength of democracy is its flaws and failings, those are the opportunities to adapt and improve, we know its not perfect.

Authoritarian systems need to maintain perfection. They may look great when things are going well, but when the cracks show things get bad very fast.

Lets not forget that, the acceptance of flaws and willingness to improve is our goal, perfection is not.

Its also good to remember, if something needs to be pushed so hard to make it look good, it cant really be that great."
2020-12-14 14:34:13,Thank you Chris Buckley and Amber Wang.
2020-12-14 14:40:26,"Does anyone really believe that China has no coronavirus cases? After they retaliated against the doctor who tried to warn everyone against it? And the raw, live meat market where coronavirus started has been razed to the ground. It has been an excellent cover-up and no one believes China about anything anymore. The international community should demand reparation for this act of biological warfare."
2020-12-14 14:44:49,"I am so tired of the endless China bashing that our government and media has engaged in. It is counterproductive at best and dangerous at worse. It is clear to anyone attuned to reality that the only ""combative nationalists"" pushing for a conflict are on the American side, no matter how much Buckley attempts to gaslight us otherwise. By focusing on scapegoating China, we have on both conscious and unconscious levels reinforced the perception of China as ""other"". I believe that this has been part of the reason that our response has been so delayed and inadequate. Remember the ""relief"" when this hit Italy because then we would get some ""real"" information and see how a modern Western nation could successfully deal with Covid without resorting to the ""draconian"", ""totalitarian"" and ""Maoist"" strategies employed by China. Then to our astonishment and horror, we saw this thing literally steamroll Italy. Oops. It really doesn't matter what China publicly said, they gave us a step by step playbook of how to handle this. What they did to contain and mitigate was literally visible by satellite and based on sound reasoning and science. If we did not see them as ""other"" we would have appreciated the severity of the threat sooner and would have followed their, now proven, strategies. We are blaming them for our own failures and continuing to do so will jeopardize the global cooperation that is required to deal with this and future pandemics."
2020-12-14 14:39:56,"The fact that China and America embrace different values is no surprise. Such differences have persisted for centuries. What is sad is that China does not forget and forgive the hurt the West exacted on it beginning from the days of the Opium War in 1839. On the other hand, America, representing the leader of the western world since 1945, has remained broadly uninterested in knowing much about China. Gripe and apathy make bad company."
2020-12-14 16:04:18,"great reporting and this topic can and should be analyzed in all of its context. but maybe also important to take a minute away from the context. like all the isms these attitudes are juvenile and don’t have a leg to stand on spiritually, ethically or intellectually. but manipulative “leaders” worldwide eat it up. at the world’s expense. left or right, east or west.  The Buddha suggested a more worthy approach, among other actual spiritual leaders."
2020-12-14 15:51:03,"Back in late January, when the scale of the disaster that had hit China and the Chinese government's gargantuan efforts to contain it first became apparent I commented to a friend that, much as the notion terrified me, maybe such extreme crises could only be met by rigidly authoritarian means. ""If the virus ever comes here [to New Zealand] it will be chaos."" Well, I was half right and half wrong. New Zealand has so far managed to contain the virus very effectively despite facing extraordinary hurdles in the months of February, March and April, as larger countries snatched up all available medical supplies and supply chains stretched to breaking point. But larger democracies have failed spectacularly, completely unable and unwilling to implement targeted and consistent measures. It makes me wonder whether true democracy can only function on a small enough scale that people can retain a sense of common values beyond rabid patriotism (which can inflame a people at any scale), and whether the support for populism that has been sweeping the globe is a tacit recognition of the problems that large scale democracy faces. Freedom is a basic human right but it can only function alongside personal responsibility, coupled with transparency in government. Communism doesn't offer this but neither do most modern models of democracy..."
2020-12-14 15:48:39,"When I was young man long ago, I set about reading Will Durant's massive, multi-volume, history of mankind. I remember little but one of the last lines of his 1935 history of China has stuck with me. China at that time was at the depths of its poverty, depravation and weakness. 
Yet Durant, in a stunning prophecy, foretold that "" Imagination cannot describe the possibilities of a civilization mingling the physical, labor and mental resources of [the Chinese] people with the technological equipment of modern industry...China will lead the world in luxury and the art of life"".  When I toured China law school as a 'foreign visitor' 35 years ago, I felt and saw the vibrancy that was promised  by Durant. It was remarkable. The scholars were back from the pig farms and the horror of the Cultural Revolution was over.  Mao could even be criticized 30%. No kidding...that was the rule.
The land had been given back to the peasants and the food markets were full.  Next step was freeing industry and they surely did that in an efficient, mercantile, authoritarian manner. It undeniably works. 
The West could accept a little instruction right about now on how to talk less and fix more. But the one thing I have heard is 'resistance' and now that  idea moves easily over from the left to the right.  
It is time American united with a common purpose to rebuild our national strength and culture."
2020-12-14 15:56:08,"I am not in a hurry to equate authoritarian muscle, human rights violations, and stomping on individual freedoms with an effective Corona virus response.  First, since China has been less than transparent or forthcoming with their data and second, since many Democratic nations with competent governments, those not embroiled in destructive internal squabbling cheered on by their political leadership, have done a good job as well."
2020-12-14 15:28:33,"Today's world, though very different, seems similar to the period before The Great War. Globalism has grown, economies seem interdependent, and great power war unimaginable. However, we must take care not to stumble into a conflict that would be devastating. China's rise will be predicated on support from other western powers that, like the United States, are seeing growing nationalism and distrust of China. All one needs to do is look at the opinions held by the people in countries that are not China and The United States (See Gallup's polling). This article misses the point, who will side with who when conflict arises?  My first hope is that The United States will reaffirm it's role on the world stage but, this seems unlikely in the short term. Therefore, It is my hope that if we, The United States are not the leading power, let us hope that Europe will assert its power. A world led by the CCP is unthinkable. Further, while the US is far from perfect, at least we do not have re-education camps. (No locking up illegal immigrants is not the same is communist re-education camps.) It is also unlikely that China has eradicated the virus as they say. Do we actually believe their current Coivd-19 numbers are real?"
2020-12-14 15:43:51,The decline of the United States has been on full display for the rest of the world during the last four years but we’ve been in decline for longer.  Our only hope for reversal of the decline is a functioning government.  I’m not optimistic.
2020-12-14 15:02:59,"There are advantages to China's system where things like refurbishing a public energy system or addressing pandemics are concerned.  Not so great for citizen representation or human rights but then, we are in no position to criticize them."
2020-12-14 15:41:21,"Mr. Buckley needs to expand his contacts.  While young men such as Mr. Fan do represent the opinion of some, a broader net would reveal decidedly contrary views.  I have taught Chinese college students in Beijing for the past five years (excepting this one), and an overriding goal for many if not most remains departure: to get to the US for education, and to get their (or their parents') funds out as well.  Until the CCP begins to allow for real freedom of speech we won't be able to know how widespread these views are (and I for one am not holding my breath that this will occur anytime soon).  But the sentiment is there and I have seen it, from young men and women who come from the same background of Mr. Fan and who have the same aspirations for their future.  China's 40-year transformation has been remarkable, without doubt, and we should all express admiration.  But it risks being derailed by the crude intervention of President Xi and his hardline advisors who seem to think that the usual ups-and-downs of a democratic society are indicative of a collapse of the system.  The communist mythology has clung to this fantasy since its founding (does anyone recall that Stalin was convinced that the West was near collapse at the end of WWII and the great Soviet system was on the verge of global victory?).  And finally, let's remember one other point before conceding defeat: where did the Covid problem originate?"
2020-12-14 15:24:55,"The narrative comparing today with 1600s Manchu invasion is the most frightening of all. This suggests not just a China willing to defend its borders (a fair impulse for any nation state). This suggests a fundamental cultural change: A willingness to go on the attack. One of our great insurance policies these past decades has been the Chinese reticence to expand territorial reach beyond a few disputed waters and islands. For centuries, China has been obsessed with protecting the Middle Kingdom, not expanding it. This new script would have them grabbing for more. Biden team, please take note of the aberration -- and fast."
2020-12-14 15:56:08,"In 2098 all of China will be a prosperous urban and suburban landscape, while the entire American continent will be a coast-to-coast agricultural district serving as China's breadbasket. This district will be populated by the handful of Chinese technicians who maintain the agricultural robots that run the large-scale industrial farms.

As for the fate of hundreds of millions of former Americans, this will be carefully explained in the Chinese museums of American history, which will note how the former residents of Manhattan sold Rockefeller Center to China, for a mere one billion dollars in cash."
2020-12-14 13:46:23,"I remember in the 1980s that the Japanese economy was growing quickly, and everyone believed that Japan would take over the world.  It didn’t happen.  In recent years, Japan has grown more slowly that the US.

In the past 30 years, China has been growing very rapidly, and its economy is approaching that of the US.  But looking ahead, we can expect that China, too, will saturate as its economy matures.

China’s handling of COVID has indeed been much better than the US, but that is because of the gross incompetence of the Trump administration.

President Biden will restore American leadership in the world.  That means working with our allies in Europe, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific.  We can work together with China and others to create a better world:  defeat COVID, slow global warming, and promote economic growth."
2020-12-14 13:52:06,"Don't scare us.  China is a big country, but not a strong nation.  Patriotism alone won't help China to become a strong nation.

We still hold significant edges on high end chips, airplane engines, precision machines, and industrial software.  Not to mention our pharmaceutical capability, military superiority, space research, and educational excellence.  It will take China at least ten years to reach our current status.

If we don't continue to progress, we will lose the competition eventually.  But I am sure our future president won't stand still and do nothing."
2020-12-14 13:45:51,"I have no doubt that China will eventually eclipse the Untied States in many categories:
- economic size and might
- technology
- military
- education
- science

But will never eclipse the United States in:
- freedom of religion 
- decency
- freedom of speech and thought
- imagination and invention
- the arts, theatre and entertaining

China may one day lead the world in transactional areas but the US will always lead in the areas that make life worth living."
2020-12-14 14:22:24,"While there is truth regarding the fractious nature of our country at this time but I can't help but beleive that, after trying all the foolhardy alternatives, Americans will come full circle and learn to work through our differeneces.  We are Americans first and that definition is as unique as each of us.  

I beleive that some people think that the U.S. is great because it's a Captilistic country and less so a Democratic nation.  Not so much.   America is great because of its Democracy and less so its capitalism.

I aslo beleive that while China needs to be respected for what it is.  It will grow stronger and more influential but it will be better than the U.S.  or most democratic nations.   Chna enjoys the fruit of capitalism while spoil its gains as an authoritarian country.  

Wants proof?   I doubt many people in the U.S. or most other democratic societies look to China as a better place to live.  

The article keeps referring to China in terms of its strengths.   China less  a country that is a power of example more that example of power.

America makes its mistakes.  It's often and chaotic but it's also creative.   We have times, such as now, where we need think better and more about our citizens.   Amercia works because we continually learn to be more tolerant of the inherent differnces of our humanity.   

Oh, and no 24/7 cameras, no ""social credit"",  no mass incarceration of Uighers and others.   

We are funny like that.   We like the power of the inndividual."
2020-12-14 15:56:16,"Any kind of triumphalism always runs the risk of being humbled. Remember when the Cold War ended? Western triumphalism was rampant. The ""end of history"" had arrived and the future was going to be Western-style liberal democracy, imposed on the world, with a heavy helping of American-style capitalism. Anyone aware of history and of the profound weaknesses of capitalism knew this would not last. Economic crisis after crisis, culminating in the 2008 collapse, was the result. Chinese triumphalism now is entirely understandable. China has handled the virus far better than most Western democracies. The West has also revealed profound weakness. Somehow, liberal values have morphed into sociopathic selfishness and trumpeting of ""rights"" that have no respect for duties or responsibilities to others. This collapse of society may well be the logical outcome of any excessively capitalist system. The US may well be in an accelerated state of decay. It is also true that well-run authoritarian states have advantages in important areas. China is likely to address and deal far more effectively with climate change over the next few decades than the US, which is mired in denialism and anti-science attitudes. But thoughtful Chinese know that their system works well in some areas but not others. Westerners should make the same concession to reality and admit that China does some important things much better than we do. Then let's agree to  find a way to get along."
2020-12-14 16:32:19,"This is an interesting article, and it highlights something that my workmates and I have discussed over the past ten years: as the world and technology grow more complex, is the federal model of the United States the best way to govern, or is China's model a better way forward. This pandemic has shown the inherent flaws and weaknesses in our federal system, where we have 50 state chief executives, a mayor of our nation's capital, and a president who either can't, or won't, impose national mandates to halt the spread of the virus. China bay be on the right path. Perhaps people would be better with more safety and less freedom, which can too often degenerate into anarchy."
2020-12-14 14:24:06,"A huge multitude of native born mainland Chinese, many extremely well-off, have emigrated to the U.S.   Why?  Freedom!  The Chinese authoritarian model will always have this very important and basic shortcoming."
2020-12-14 16:39:49,"Apologies for putting this comment in such simple terms. But whenever I read  articles like this, my first thought is always: if the Chinese system is so good and their people so happy with it, then why are they sending hundreds of thousands of their young to sturdy abroad in western schools and universities, and millions of their middle and upper classes are emigrating and/or taking money out of their country. And I don’t see too many people going the other way."
2020-12-14 16:45:00,"There is a kernel of truth in the propaganda about ""Chinese values,"" among them the supposed willingness of Chinese citizens to sacrifice more than Americans would do for the good of society. Historically, Communist regimes have equated what's good for society with what's good for the party - but at least one American political party likewise equates its own ideology with ""American"" values. Also historically, countries competing with the U.S. have underestimated its resiliency, and that of democracies generally; but does the U.S. remain in the latter category?"
2020-12-14 16:48:01,"We still don’t know the truth as to what really happened with the initial viral infection, leading to wild conspiracy theories.

And who was truly behind the cover-ups: local ‘rogue’ authorities or at the national level ? Either way, fear of the central authority and the need to maintain it and control the flow of facts were factors behind the Wuhan hotspot and deaths.

This was only one of many environmental disasters - except the Chinese govt couldn’t keep the truth away once the virus left the borders.  How many others are suppressed because they are limited to small villages and the interests of the Party - or a powerful connection - are more important than that a handful of lives in a country of a billion?  Moreover, once the national economy and reputation suffered, they had to acknowledge it, fix it, and even profit from it by selling PPE and now vaccines.

No, an authoritarian regime is not the solution.  But a democratic one in which the people believe and want to cooperate mutually in the interest of public health (or other matters of public interest)."
2020-12-14 16:46:58,"If it is finding so many fans at home why do they still suppress people who dissent? 
Surely the ""fans"" of the current model have a rational argument that proves the dissenters wrong. Even if they don't surely the truth is self evident."

2020-12-14 16:53:26,"Wow. I expect the responses of the NYT commentariat will give new meaning to the term 'triggered'.

Interesting that one Chinese commentator defines the future as belonging to both China AND Europe. I've argued here for years that for more than a decade, Europe - specifically the EU - has been on a trajectory re: China relations that's markedly different to the US posture. A much more collaborative, nuanced, constructive approach. Not, necessarily one that will preserve European culture and values intact however - but one which recognises the inevitability of China's ascendancy to sole world superpower. So far, that relationship has proved productive and positive although I'm not naive enough to believe that the nature of that current relations will endure indefinitely.

Donald Trump has worked hard to demean and alienate all of America's traditional allies, including Europe. Having got rid of Trump (but not Trumpism) in the short term, it's very unlikely that Mr Biden will succeed in restoring the status quo ante of America's alliances.

Still, Americans can take heart that at leat 75 million of them agree with China - Authoritarianism IS best."
2020-12-14 16:55:13,"China is now a direct threat to the US and the world. US companies were more than willing to contract cheap labor from China so that they could make even more money. Now that the US manufacturing sector has been gutted, we can’t even make enough N95 masks for the pandemic. It’s much more than just unfortunate - it’s a national security problem that must be resolved. We need basic manufacturing to come back to America. It’s about time that companies actually make products here in the USA and not in China."
2020-12-14 16:55:53,"The very notion of calling the American way of life a “system” is in itself a commentary on the Chinese leadership’s view of superiority. Monarchical, authoritarian, ultra-nationalist and centralized economic systems are what this country has successfully fended off since its founding. China’s adherence to central committee dicta has indeed succeeded in stemming this pandemic. But statistics aside, in the long run, does China believe that a system founded on intolerance, obedience and unquestioned loyalty to the state could possibly be a model the rest of the world wishes to emulate? I would remind the Chinese leadership that 80 years ago, the Japanese believed their imperial order to be morally superior to decadent America. Free societies often have a way of catching systems off guard."
2020-12-14 16:56:01,"It seems to me that this article, rather than explaining China's intentions, reflects America's real experience and fantasies.
In peripheral regions, such as Latin America, whenever a country underwent a regime change that was not to the advantage of the United States, the Americans would undoubtedly challenge it and fabricate a coup.
And regarding China's current power, what fantasy is shared more deeply among American factions than that of a Chinese revolt and regime change?

In a reverse scenario, if China were in the midst of a health crisis and social protests, wouldn't the Americans be celebrating their government and, unlike China, would they already be instigating a democratic turn?

Americans should be happy that the Chinese government is not like theirs."
2020-12-14 16:56:35,"There are strengths and weaknesses in both authoritarian systems and democratic systems.  I think most people in the U.S. recognize ours.  

Yes, the Chinese top down system can mobilize quickly with laser focus and that allowed them to quash the coronavirus.  That same top down system has juiced the economy with empty buildings, created a huge urban/rural divide, and discouraged innovative and critical thinking skills.  It also leads to cheating and corruption, which will undermine its efforts in expanding domination beyond its borders."

China's huge infrastructure projects have put countries such as Sri Lanka into massive debt and are destroying entire ways of life in places such as the Mekong River delta. People who live in Asia are not as sanguine about China's efforts as the article might suggest, and as other articles in the New York Times have reported."
2020-12-14 16:58:21,"As I recall, China’s authoritarian model actually hindered early control of the virus. The authorities arrested doctors and denied that there was even a serious pandemic, all to avoid losing face.

Only when it became clear that they could no longer hide the daily death toll did they take serious concerted action.

As for our own recent experience with authoritarian government, all I can say is if that’s how dictatorship works, then I’ll take messy democracy any day."

2020-12-14 17:08:59,"If response to the SARS CoV2 pandemic is the yardstick for communism vs democracy, consider the responses of Taiwan and the US. Taiwan was praised in the Lancet and the Journal of the AMA as exemplary; they have had a total of seven covid deaths, the last one on 5/18/20.  Lockdowns were not necessary, so the control of the virus was not by repression of the populace. In the US, our deaths are escalating towards 300,000. Both countries are democracies.

If you compare repressive nations as Russia and China, I believe you will see Russia's response was to deny the pandemic and China, after initially denying the virus, turned to science and repression. China worked out the genetic code of SARS CoV2 in early January 2020 and gave it to WHO, which distributed the code worldwide. Germany was the first nation to develop a covid test based on the genetic code. And China used harsh repression of its citizens. 

I would say it is far too simplistic to brand one type of government as inherently good or bad. All governments can fail their people ion different ways, or not."
2020-12-14 13:50:25,"I don’t think it’s loose talk to say what we’re seeing in China is Communism, Fascism and Authoritarianism/ Totalitarianism all rolling into one and building to some unknown crescendo.  

What would Hannah Arendt’s  observation of these times be I’m unsure but Napoleon’s trenchant observation of China as a sleeping giant not to be awoken has certainly proven prescient.  

Something would have happened in China regardless.  Too many people with too much energy and talent to be contained but what seems clear is ... 

The Wesr’s leaders, and esp it’s business leadership, stoked the fires of change in China primarily not to liberate or liberalize Chinese society or serve our own citizens but instead to line it’s pockets and increase it’s profit margins via fueling a wasteful and ultimately globally and socially destructive cycle of excessive consumerism and consumption that appears to only be reinforcing a cycle of global social and political instability we have clearly entered.

Change will be quickly required at this fundamental level if we are to persevere our democracies and social fabric regardless of what happens in east Asia.  The sooner we collectively decide to get on with it, the better off the entire planet will be and the less likely we as a species will be to face genuinely catastrophic social and environmental consequences."

The choice is not between the ""perfection get it done"" of China's authoritarianism, and a ""free society"" such as the US

For the US is hardly a free and democratic society. It is imperfect, it lacks will, and prizes the individual far too much over the society the person lives in and among. (see Covid)

The Chinese model presents the group as the priority and for the # of people in the society demonstrates far too little creativity of any sort, whether artistic, business, tech or finance. Much less political.  Ever seen Chinese students in an American university classroom? If they can't memorize ""facts"" they often appear lost. 

The 18th Cent was Spain's...The 19th cent was Britain's to rule., The 20th was America's...for we were able to sort through differences, and yes, compromise. The disdainful and selfish power grabbing politics of 21st cent America spell its downfall. Yes China is ruling the roost now.

2020-12-14 16:18:09,"The PRC reminds me and many others of Kaiser Wilhelm's Germany: its obvious strength fuels hyper-nationalism and hybris, which is already backfiring.

Stoking nationalism at home may be good politics for an authoritarian regime. But China's Wolf Warrior diplomacy abroad is an unnecessary, self-inflicted wound.

For instance, just a few months ago Europe and many developed Asian nations were so wary of Trump's America that they looked to China as a rational power for defending the global order, at least when it came to trade.

But instead of leveraging this situation, the Chinese deeply alienated Europe with their absurd Covid-diplomacy, and turned public opinion against working with China. Likewise, many in East and South East Asia are now wary of China's aggressive posturing.

For a long time, policy makers in the region assumed that China was only interested in economic dominance, not in spreading its political system or Chinese culture. Now that that's changed, the Chinese will find it much harder to meet their goals.

It is a testament to Xi's poor statecraft that he decided to mimic Donald Trump."

It has been years in China that not learning from and not appreciating the experience, knowledge and theory from the West are considered as ignorant and uncivilized. In the last few decades Chinese intellectuals were zealous in looking for being admitted by the West as modern, unsavagious and ''civilized'' people while the media have never shown its prevention from bias and orientalism. During the early stage of the pandemic what Chinese saw from our media were all about how eating bats caused the pandemic, how ''savagious'' the government was and how ''uncivilized'' the Chinese people were, though the bat photos were actually taken in Palau instead of China. Someone in China pointed out that this is exactly the situation that safari people (Manchu and other related tribes) in the Northeast once was stuck. As the media showed no mercy, finally it is claim on Chinese internet that being admitted by the West and thought as ''modern, civilized, proper'' people are impossible, just like the safari people would never be treated equally unless they win the war against Ming dominate China. The problem is not whether the ''combative nationalists'' are really combative. The problem is that the West is losing its aurora over China.

Let’s be clear, there is nothing to admire about a country that has put millions of its own citizens (Uighurs) in concentration camps, withheld critical information about a deadly virus from the entire world, and that regularly sacrifices its own people to ensure continuity of the one-party system. China’s authoritarian system allows for faster decision making, and government officials are often the best and the brightest in diverse disciplines (not just a bunch of lawyers with no knowledge of science or technology) but the system creates perverse incentives to cover up mistakes and punish whistleblowers which is why the virus raged out of control in Wuhan for months last fall before bursting on to the international scene.

After a brief interruption to squash the pandemic, China returned to work several months ago. China is busily and decisively consolidating its homeland, expanding its best-in-the-world infrastructure, and developing trade agreements and foreign infrastructure that will supply raw materials and consumer markets for Chinese industry through the end of the 21st Century.

The US is still locked in the pandemic, with the worst months yet to come. Trump's failed pandemic response is badly crippling the nation. America is consuming, rather than expanding, its economy. Even if and when the pandemic fiasco has been moderated by sensible precautions and effective vaccines, our economy must restart from the level of 2016. 

Before Trump and the pandemic, the US manufacturing sector was already in decline from lack of investor interest in productive enterprise. Now, the US capital markets are locked in hysterical gambling that has ballooned stock prices to double the underlying value. 

The US agriculture sector was hit hard by Trump's foolish tariffs. China's import market is permanently closed to US farmers. China has developed more reliable sources of grains and soybeans in South America.

In the middle of change, where one system seems to “beat” the other system it is next to impossible to judge the merits of each.
One aspect that cannot be historically judged because it never occurred before is the planet altering activities of humans while connecting the very existence of one system to the other. What I think will not happen anymore is that a dynasty takes over. Our lives across the planet are so tightly interconnected that all systems will rise and fall in unison.

The level of corruption in China is unknowable in detail, but in aggregate, the signs are there - over investment, excess capacity, accumulated debt. 
The ham-handed Trump effort to fight illicit technology transfer through his trade war will be exchanged for a targeted set of patent wars and surveillance of Chinese techno-spies (burglars).

They have had issues even folding in other groups that many would call ""chinese"".  Manchurians for example.  Still on the outside.  It used to be I think that they wanted power, control over people.   But today I think it is economic power that runs their ship.  And they do that very well.  They have always been ""all about the money"".  they have sacrificed a lot to mon ey.  That is their driving force.  Money unites them all, their pursuit of money.  Their very highly centralized system is always pushing this.  That is why their totalitarian system works well.  And by and by most people do not mind, as again, it is all about the money.  The flip side is just how do you govern a democracy of 1.5 BILLION people?  Just look at America and our last election.  It has almost torn America apart.  Add in an extra BILLION voters and just what do you think you would end up with?  Chinese nationalism supports what the majority of people want.

 Did anyone hear about Ebola? Swift response from the pandemic response team would have shut this down or at least made the deaths a fraction of what it is now. Donald shut this part of the government down. 

China was allowing flights out of Wuhan internationally for several days after it shut down routes to Beijing. This has to be investigated. 

In essence authoritarianism started this pandemic — in China by denying the doctor who raised alarms, and really bad policies like allowing flights. Donald’s authoritarian tendencies exacerbated the spread similarly in US by denying its existence and focusing on hushing and downplaying it.

Just like mom, they all had gone on to complete their post graduates in European and American universities, obtained research positions just like her and worked over seas for years. 

However, unlike her, they became Americans citizens, mostly, one became a German citizen. These are the intellectual elites of China. They are no longer Chinese. When the job is done, they fly back to their homes in upstate NY. 

What’s more disappointing, was that she found out, their Chinese company(state owned), were paying her colleagues three times as much. Since they are classified now, as “imported talent”. 

So with all these propaganda, it might give most people a nice ego boost, but those with means to leave, will."
2020-12-14 15:39:34,"What makes China different from America is one word: filial piety.  It doesn't exist in American families.  American children do not want to live with their parents.  They value love and friendship over parents.  Even during the pandemics many American elderly have to take care of themselves.  Their children would not help them order groceries or other things online.   Chinese, on the other hand, would even live with their parents after marriage."

2020-12-14 14:33:23,"There can be little doubt that China (along with many SE Asian countries) took the correct response in attempting to stamp the virus out instead of either denying it, or believing it could be controlled.  That decision, which certainly appears to have put people ahead of short term economics, is one China needs to be proud of.  Economically, China’s strength results from its embrace of capitalism, and in particular smaller entrepreneurial companies, the large state owned companies are, if anything, a drag on its growth. Coupled with an astonishing lack of leadership in the west, where countries increasingly look inward, and act to polarize their own populations in hope of short term gain, it is no wonder China looks good. There has always been an advantage to countries that take the long term view, its disappointing China takes the lead by default.  

Looking forward, China’s poor record on human rights, repression of those with alternative viewpoints, and subsidization of bloated state run companies will restrict China from “global domination” if that was ever its goal.  It is a shame China cannot open its politics in the way it opened its economy, then the West would have something to fear, however, countries with one man repressive rule traditionally either go out in flames, or slowly deteriorate, becoming irrelevant.  Hopefully it’s the later."

Our handling of this has been dismal, disturbing and unintelligent.  A few weeks of surrender of your liberty to go wherever you want would have gone a LONG way in reducing transmission rates. However, any admiration for the Chinese way of doing things quickly dissipates when reading about China trying to ""inoculate their youth against Western culture.""  Eww.

On the other hand that often means they do things they shouldn't do, dictatorships like the USSR and the warsaw pack left behind an environmental mess that makes the pre epa US look tame, China is an environmental disaster area pure and simple. Not to mention that dictatorships often make decisions based on idealogy and doing things 'the right way' and in the process suppress mavericks and dissenters..who after all are the ones creating new things. It is much like corporate America vs the rebels, IBM in computers ,while they had labs creating new ideas, was as stolid and stodgy while silicon valley cleaned their clock with the pc and unix servers and the cloud. China despite all its bluster has contributed very little to pure science and their R and D is basically stealing what others have done; the old USSR claimed all these great advancements, in some limited areas created new technology, but in many things they again were reduced to stealing technology from the western democracies. For all of Stalin's and Hitler's brutal reign, the US created a war industry that was staggering, in innovation and the speed of ramping up.

Democracy is something they have never grasped, not for lack of ability or understanding, because it has been kept from their reach.   The great wall is filled with skeletons of the workers who died building.  Now China claims to be anti-socialism when communism is the end-point of socialist societal evolution.

If your government is not supporting and encouraging 'society', which is all socialism means, them it is supporting only those with power.   The real secret that hundreds of years of tug-of-war will reveal to our two giant nations: we are exactly the same.  We obfuscate truth.

It is easy to brag about dominance & success when complaints can lead to executions.  Who would dare veer off-message?  America could project an equivalent image if we just barred journalists from interaction with the impoverished or imprisoned.  It is not real power, it is so fragile.

Fascism always meets the same end: one soul gathers all power unto himself, soul meets death, power vacuum demolishes fascism from inside.  If you really believe yourself to be favoured of the people, give it a vote; I dare you.

Xi and the Donald have more in common than either would like to admit. And China’s reliance on the west especially the United States is still a dominant factor in China’s economy. If Xi and the CCP held a sincere belief in the ascendancy of the Chinese people and their society there would be no need for the manipulation of populism and nationalism in China. The weakness of their position is emphasized by the aggression and oppression of the Uighur and Tibetan people. One doesn’t need to create a police state with concentration camps and disappear dissenters when one is secure. It is a form of cowardice that Xi betrays, without a subservient CCP he would be just like Trump, another failing authoritarian thug."

2020-12-14 14:03:55,"China is a rfascist nation. It is not a product of horseshoe theory or anything like that, it just simply was never communist. 

Do the workers own the means of production? No. 

Are the workers exploited at the whim of the state-corporate interests in the pursuit of a nationalist agenda? Yes. 

Does politics function as an extension of the will of the workers? No.

Is politics aestheticized and subservient to a contrived spirit of the nation? Yes.

The difference between fascism in the 1930s and fascism today is a function of crisis and technology. Fascism in the 1930s was capitalism in crisis. Italy and Germany were suffering from catastrophic economic depressions, and there were serious structural threats to capitalism’s survival. To survive, it wrapped itself in a flag and pseudo-religion, but ultimately retained capital dominated politics.

The fascism of today is techno-fascism. While it retains much of the definitional standards 30s fascism set, and was born out of crisis and civil war, it has survived more on the ability for technology to maintain stability and order rather than the perpetual conflict that 30s fascism required.

To be clear: fascism in both forms is essentially capitalism played out to its fullest extent. Capital and government fully merge into one, and all labor becomes subsumed into the national will, which is the will of capital. China is not communist, they are technofascist. We must understand the underlying structures if we are to address them."

I recently lived in an upscale apartment complex in the center of a 1st tier city in China. It was two bedrooms and cost about 400 bucks a month for 1,000 square feet. It was cheaply built, the water, power, and internet went out frequently, and most Americans would consider the kitchen tiny and cheap. It did have a nice view of the pollution building up in the morning, so after we got the hang of it, we could predict the air quality index pretty accurately (bad to very, very bad). We had to be on constant lookout for scammers, especially since I'm white, and prices immediately go up for ""foreigners"". Don't let our own media be lazy and borrow the CCP narrative of how strong China supposedly is, because it isn't. Global warming is a bigger threat."
2020-12-14 17:31:14,"Being ruthless in executing power may appear good in short term but in the long run it will collapse. That's what history tells about authoritarian regimes. What appears as strong China can vanish once their economy tilts down. Failure of Western countries to control this pandemic is partly due to insane human rights guys ignoring basic human values -to follow expert suggestions. Also poor management by so called ""hype"" leaders grossly underestimating the medical guidelines."
2020-12-14 17:48:29,"China and is people are slowly climbing Maslow's pyramid.  While it is undeniable that a huge section of Chinese poor have been lifted to an increasingly prosperous middle-class, that will not quench the desire of the same people for basic freedoms which an authoritarian rule suppresses.  It is for this reason that the Chinese government will fall.

Whether it happens overnight like the Soviet Union or in a series of pressure-valve releasing steps is to be seen.  But the Chinese can draw comfort that their economy is resilient, and huge hard currency reserves will ease the transition pains in comparison to other nations which went down this path."
2020-12-14 17:08:29,"The Chinese public has a lot of faith in itself for a country that couldn't beat India. The reason is because they are fed a steady information diet by their government that doesn't expose their own flaws. Imagine only seeing Donald Trump's twitter. Best country ever.

I work in the defense/security industry and if there is one commodity the world wants from America it is the men and materials needed to make war. We export more things that go boom, their accessories, and the human capital necessary to make it all happen than any country in the world. 

China hasn't chosen to not use force against us because they are friendly. They haven't used force because they are weak. If China thought they could win a war or overpower us they would have done so by now. 

Chinese policy papers and strategists recognize this. The Chinese public doesn't. We need to press our advantages in the region and work to keep uniting the countries around China against them.

To paraphrase the great American poet Gucci Mane, ""China, you don't want the smoke."" 

They know it. Why don't we?"

They do have one significant advantage, however, and that is that they're not obsessed with diversity and political correctness."
2020-12-14 17:25:50,"In a disaster, authoritarianism seems really tempting.  But how much freedom justice are sacrificed along the way.  

Chinese monitor and control media, the economy, healthcare, and education to a degree most Americans would never stand for. Just ask the people of Hong Kong.

Also, much easier to get consensus and compliance when 91% of your population are all one ethnic group and the public practice of religion is effectively outlawed.

America will never be like that; SHOULD never be like that.  Our cultural priorities are not uniformity and control.  They are diversity and freedom.

Democracy is messy.  The Chinese don't like messiness.  They can have their anti-individualistic, authoritarian, centrally managed, measured, and controlled system.  I'll take our noisy, tumultuous, unperfected American-style liberty and justice any day of the week."

China seems to have had a steady streak of good leadership recently, even as the US was marred by a lackluster second term Obama and of course, the too-distracted-to-look-straight President Trump.

It was long believed that institutions, democratic checks and balances would protect a democracy against personality shocks. These 'institutions' turned out to be a little like polished weather vanes I'm afraid.

Lets not even get into how less robust states are faring under indifferent leaders.

An under-educated populace thinking that facts can be decided by opinion is scary indeed."
2020-12-14 15:20:11,"China has been very smart in turning the money they earned manufacturing cheap products for America and Europe and investing it in businesses in Europe and America.  Both Europe and America were only happy to take their money and allow them to buy controlling interests in our multi-national corporations as well as real property.  China then took it a step further and went into Africa, South America and the Caribbean among other places and did the same thing.  Essentially the next places to manufacture what China makes now when China prices rise as the cost of living for their population rises.  They intend to own the manufacturing there as well.  At this point it is not too late to stop.  China is a menace and should be stopped from giving away free cheese to control smaller, poorer nations outside of their local sphere of influence.  A key example to watch is Barbados right now where China has salted the islands' economy with large amounts of investments, pushing their local contractors out of the building business with cheaper labor and supply and now has demanded their island free itself from its' last vestiges of British control.  If that happens, China will control the island while we slept."
2020-12-14 15:59:52,"Congratulations to China -- police states can bully, control and manage the biological units called humans better than Western societies.

That doesn't make those humans more creative, productive, free, happy or any of the other essential qualities that give a life meaning and value. 

If the measure of success is being able to control all behavior and activities of the group, ants have it over even the Chinese. But I don't want to be an ant. 

Stories like this are facile, specious and ultimately of little value."
2020-12-14 17:14:19,"COVID is just one and most obvious thing. But it is certainly an illustration of a bigger picture. Chinese system is superior because at its core it is based on humanism and not on profit as the American system is. China puts people first - their wellbeing, their aspirations, their health, their security, even their spiritual and intellectual development. If you tell Chinese people that they are somehow 'less free' because they are not allowed to ignore others and think only of themselves, they will laugh at you. The reality is the Chinese are far freer than the Americans are - because they know themselves to be a part of something bigger and feel the power of that collective spirit protecting them as individuals too. Dealing with COVID is a perfect parable of that - people working together as one towards a common good and a single purpose make everybody stronger and freer and more prosperous. That is why China cannot be defeated."
2020-12-14 17:47:37,"The simple tale of a central elite demonstrating its inevitable rise to paradise is a vision worthy of President Trump's good news tweets.  But it is not clear which route is the Road To Serfdom.  

What is clear is, the global economy has an unsustainable need for fossil fuels, it is encouraging the asymmetric generation of billions of humans, cows and chickens, its exhaust is killing the planet and the continued drive to replace the natural world with farms and buildings will bring on more destructive pandemics.  

Central planning has not shown itself to be any more effective at grasping the problem: with China adding more coal fired power stations and moving to fix it, with promises to do the reverse; than the Capitalist strategy that has rushed to optimize the economy and driven away its robustness."
2020-12-14 17:17:06,"In the case of Covid-19, both the West and the Chinese are missing the point. The global pandemic is indeed a disaster where a top-down system has advantage. The good of the collective definitely outweighs that of the individual. Here China shows great resolve and its people sacrificed greatly in just a few months to get things under control.

The West is afraid of acknowledging this point for fear of praising an authoritative state. They cast about and praise the like of Taiwan or South Korea. But the population size makes a huge difference! It's one thing to contain the virus on an island; it's quite different for a country of hundreds of millions of people, as is painful evident in the cases of US and India.

The Chinese is also missing the point. The pandemic is a once-in-a-century disaster. Few other challenges in today's world would be like that. When this is over, a democratic society with free thoughts will boost innovation and progress, while a rigid system could kill them. 

What the world needs now is not dogma, but to look at the problems analytically for solutions, and decide their merits wherever they exist."

2020-12-14 17:53:30,"The Chinese form of government is not our concern. Soon, their economy will overtake ours. US national security assessments of Chinese military capabilities are doubtlessly flawed, as were our assessments of North Korean nuclear capabilities. We have legitimate geopolitical considerations as to Chinese intentions, particularly in reference to Taiwan and South Korea, and Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War"" does model some of their thinking.

That being said, the US military is still dominant, but for how long? Militaries are the products of economies. The pandemic has set the United States back a decade. Likewise, the rupture of our security relationships with our allies cannot be restored quickly or easily. Going forward, the only way to counter aggressive Chinese behavior will be with having our allies firmly beside us."
2020-12-14 18:41:49,"Ok, the western democracies are a better system, or so we believe.  So we have to prove to the rest of the world, that we can do better in managing a crisis like COVID-19; we can do better in resolving the racial tensions within the society; we can do better in addressing the poverty and inequality within society.  We can't just claim we are better, we have to DO better.

Ironically, the hard right wing is most supportive of Chinese style autocracy, despite the constant freedom chants.  The left wing of society is the side that is committed to democracy, rule of law, and moving forward together as a society with a common goal."

2020-12-14 18:07:59,"First and foremost, nothing I say is a reflection or criticism of any individual Chinese.  This is a critique specifically of the CCP.

What the world faces today is not entirely different from Germany and Japan in 1933.  The CCP might not be as perfectly evil as those regimes, but it's certainly the evilest of any permanent Security Council member.  The CCP's plans for world domination dwarf those of Germany and Japan in 1933.

The parallel to 1933 continues with CCP apologists who hate Trump, America, and/or democracy so much that the CCP doesn't even need to recruit useful idiots; there are volunteers standing in line (google ""American Axis"").

There are 13 Chinese who have been awarded Nobel Prizes*.  Three of them (3/13) are of Communist China. One (Liu Xiaobo) ""for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China"".  Ten of them (10/13) are from outside Communist China.  The Communist Chinese system produces untold thousands of highly competent technicians.  But creativity is by definition nonconformist.  The CCP crushes nonconformity.  Those who sympathize or apologize for the CCP regime are enabling a cruel and destructive masquerade.

This is as close to clear-cut as anything in today's world: You either stand for basic human rights or you stand for the CCP.

Some individuals thrive in systems where government has a lot of influence in their lives for the ""common good"", which is also defined by the government, while some individuals cannot breath in such systems.  Alternatively, some individuals experience lots of anxiety in systems where the government leaves them to make most decisions about their lives (cannot deal with uncertainty) while others thrive in the freedom from government that such systems offer.  Therefore, you cannot have a system that works for both types of individuals.  I have experienced both systems.  The US has a good balance, although there is now a drift towards bigger, more intrusive government which did not exist when I moved here 35 years ago."

Most American elites probably believe that the United States is somehow excused from this ironclad formula of human history, but reality is showing otherwise. Great imperial powers always think they're going to dominate forever because [insert stupid reasons here]. Whether it's the Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Persians, Romans, or the Nazis and their 'Thousand-Year Reich,' it's always so easy and comforting for the ruling elites to believe that they're destined to rule forever. In this stage of history, it's China's turn to rise and our turn to fall. A long time from now, it'll be China's turn to fall and someone else's turn to rise. 

But it doesn't have to be all bad news. Hopefully relinquishing our status as the world's sole superpower will make us focus less on dominating the world so a few corrupt capitalists can score huge profits and make us focus more on investing in our people here at home and on renewing our tattered democratic ideals."

I suppose the fact that China is murdering our most precious animals, driving them into extinction for the elites to access ivory and precious minerals, as well as the fins of sharks and the massacre of whales means little to those within China.

I suppose the fact that China is obliterating indigenous peoples, enslaving those they deem 'lesser,' and 're-educating the populous through control of media and education means little to those the CCP embraces.

But, for all that live in China, there can be no dissent.  So, to claim that global rule by China is attractive to the Chinese people is a bit of fantasy.  And the communal philosophy that the nytimes so loves is only proof to me that the Democrat party has truly lost it's way."

But please bear in mind, before you get too cocky, that you're playing with dissent mechanic and globalist elites on ""minimum"" and that you're using a base pop with 90% homogeneity and the [shame] cultural attribute. You're also running with natural resources on ""v-high"" and external migration/invasions disabled. There's a reason why achievements are limited when you play this level of difficulty.

That's a 300% bonus to event difficulty. It'll be a whopping 500% when the [climate change] patch hits.

The truth is, and it was reported here previously in the NYT, that after the SARS epidemic the dictator of China established a system to monitor and report any emerging outbreak. It was staffed and officials trained and the reports should have triggered the early measures that would have contained the disease. It would have stopped the local outbreak from becoming an epidemic, much less a worldwide pandemic. It failed.
The reason it failed is because the Chinese dictatorship constantly suppresses it's people and can't by it's nature tolerate any reports that express anything except praise for itself and it's glorious leader.

The same officials who were needed to make the reporting system work knew what would happen to them and their families if they actually raised any alarms. This was proven when a courageous doctor tried to call attention to covid19 in its early stages. He was threatened with prison by the police and later died from the disease.

It's the dictatorship that is the problem and this recent attempt by China to rewrite history and take credit for a disaster shouldn't go unchallenged.

The NYT should have included the facts from their previous article in this new one.

We have seen the death and misery caused by lies spread by governments, trolls and other bad actors. What chance is there for truth when the most respected newspaper in the world repeats propaganda and won't present a balanced article."

President Xi lives in the real world and knows how to move China forward while President Trump peddles alternative reality. That is one reason why China has advanced greatly the past 4 years while America has had to spend its time dealing with a petulant child trying to destroy our country and our democracy. With Joe Biden at the helm things will now change for the better. If someone stood in front of the White House and said Mr. Trump was a jerk they might be arrested but you would hear from such person again. If that same person called President Xi a jerk in the middle of Tiananmen Square such person may disappear permanently. Requiring blind and mindless loyalty to its leaders with no challenges may hold in the short run but it is not a viable long term strategy. People will eventually push back.

My wife as an ER doc has for decades exercised the power to order the detention of patients who are ""a danger to himself or others""--an example of an important  public health power. This power is well-recognized and critically important to protect the public. President Trump, however, failed to act over and over and over and over again, acknowledging that the U.S. was ""at War"" but oddly shirking Federal responsibility and leaving the States and Tribes to fight the War almost alone. We didn't make New York invade Normandy Beach and fight the Nazis alone or make Idaho fight Japan in WW2.

The comments sections are so full of nationalist comments, either saying China is more powerful than any other country, or that the Chinese people are victims of the U.S., India, Australia, etc, etc... That isn't a depiction of strength, like the CCP thinks it is, it is instead rather pathetic. I doubt even the most nationalistic U.S. groups would be that bad.

In addition, China has adopted capitalism (state capitalism) as their economic system, so obviously communism wasn’t the answer to all of their needs.

Though let's give the Chinese their due. While Trump and Peter Navarro were stomping their feet with a trade war trying to get them to change their economic system, China pulled off a new Asia/Pacific trade deal.

The U.S bailed out bankers and let millions of Americans lose their jobs and homes.

When COVID struck China recovered very quickly from initial errors, effectively contained the main outbreak and limited total fatalities to around 4,700 with very few new cases since late Spring. The U.S., in contrast, stumbled repeatedly 300,000 dead and about 3,000 more dying every day quite likely for the next few months.

Americans like to congratulate themselves on how free and democratic our country is, but are our two parties really more representative of the interests of the majority of Americans than the 90 million member Chinese Communist Party is of the Chinese people? And with a significantly larger number of people behind bars and police killings of Black and Brown people occurring every day or two, is the U.S. really in such a strong position to criticize the human rights situation in China?

The average American still has a considerably higher standard of living and we can say what we please about Trump or Biden on social media, but any serious comparison of the trajectories of the two countries should cause us to question the superiority of our system.

Where the CCP thinks things are headed and where they are going to end up are not going to be the same thing.

They barely have a blue water Navy. Pray tell how they plan to rule their backyard seas? 

And that's just for starters. China is saddled with this dreadful weight of having to operate a massive authoritarian state. As a model of large scale social and governmental organization, China is currently a boat anchor.

The amount of squabble in a country does not necessarily indicate weakness. Sometimes it indicates, rather, how much chatter that particular society can handle and still deliver the mail.

We can handle a ton of squabble, ship still runs. An authoritarian state, by definition has no tolerance for squabble. They build to spec their own very real limitation, and self-imposed burden.

Sorry. I'll keep my chips at this table. I like our deal."
2020-12-14 19:02:23,"The difference between China and the US is that the Chinese government uses misinformation to stabilize the country and we use to bring our democracy down.

2020-12-14 19:32:11,"Taiwan has done as well as China in fighting the virus, so no advantage to totalitarianism there. And China is doubly responsible for the spread of the virus . Knowing the risks of wet markets from previous epidemics, but allowing them anyway, and dereliction of duty during the crucial early days of the pandemic, when the CCP was more concerned with celebrating their own glory than with taking the virus seriously. The Emperor of China claims he took charge of fighting the virus on Jan. 7, but on Jan. 17 he allowed a massive pot luck party in Wuhan that supercharged the epidemic. Inconvenient truths the CCP thinks they can erase from history."
2020-12-14 19:13:45,"I would think that most comments would address the success of the Chinese pushing their message, and how we counter that.  Instead most folks seem to be offended by the very thought that anyone could buy that message.

People are buying that message, and it's up to us to answer in a rational manner.  Keep the emotion under wraps for now."

Between the choices of fight or flight, it has chosen fight, and its propaganda is busy at its work, not unlike what we have seen in this country."
2020-12-14 17:49:15,"Sure. An authoritarian system run by reasonably competent technocrats will be materially superior to a quasi-democratic system with a poorly educated and misinformed electorate.

However, our democratic traditions are a strength, rather than weakness. What we need is restoration and strengthening of democracy. 

However, to make democracy work, we need to put renewed value and emphasis on truth-seeking, education and science. We need to figure out a way to check conspiracy theories and falsehoods that permeate the internet and various media, such as Fox News and the like. These need to be recognized as national security issues. 

Ultimately, the authoritarians of the world fear the example of a functional democracy more than they are intimidated by the Pentagon."
2020-12-14 18:56:20,"President Xi saw the CCP at risk of losing control to tech titans and Chinese capitalism so he introduced combative nationalist foreign policy for party survival. That aggressive posture awoke the complacent Western democracies that had facilitated China's rapid rise with education, jobs, capital, and technology. Covid-19 showed how Chinese leadership gave no responsibility for the world community. The West, shocked at its vulnerability to such a country, is removing all critical manufacturing from China to Taiwan and elsewhere.
China is losing much of its Western export tailwind just as it has satiated its own infrastructure program so it will be largely depending on consumer consumption from a population that, thanks to the consequences of the 1985-2015 China One Child Policy, will collapse 40% by 2100 - the largest demographic collapse in history. The chances of The CCP surviving that social turbulence are slim, the odds of their private sector remaining highly productive under recently announced party-controls are much diminished, the possibility of  their economy matching that of The United States in coming decades is remote.
The 'Combative Nationalists' are therefore at their high point, drunk on Covid-19 aftermath and high on Xi-party propaganda while there is no doubt that for the above reasons American dominance will continue and likely grow larger in future."
2020-12-14 15:17:07,"When you have near total authoritarian control of your citizens, it's much easier to be responsive to crisis. Of course, the citizens are given one choice in how to act in the crisis-there's no refusal to wear masks, there is only one message given by the state government. 
Meanwhile, in our federated union, 50 state leaders can act independently of the federal government on many issues; and 300 million Americans can chose to ignore the rules if so inclined.
People like order, security, and direction. They like black and white issues and disdain complexity and areas of gray. It gives the appearance of safety, but the populace has to have trust even in the authoritarian government to feel that safety.
Perhaps, the people of China for the most part felt the government was in control of the virus, that was diametrically opposite of our experience here in America with the virus.
If a government, whether democratic, authoritarian or other wise, gives you security-personal, social, and economic and a comfortable life-it's easier to give up individual freedoms for security. Unfortunately, that security in American has been waning for decades and we see the accompanying  social unrest and a growing ineffective government to address the security needs of Americans."
2020-12-14 19:26:43,What did you expect with the most corrupt incompetent administration running the government ? We are best like a third world African Kleptomaniac's State with the Criminal Trump regime running the joint.
2020-12-14 20:00:51,"It suggests that China's authoritarians are more competent than Trump's and Putin's, but if China is so superior, why did they allow this virus to jump to humans in the first place?  It's rather pathetic and quite predictable for authoritarians to take credit for solving a problem that they themselves caused."
2020-12-14 19:56:31,"It is important for China and other to remember that a number of democracies managed the pandemic well, or very well, including Australia, New Zealand, Soth Korea, Japan ... and Taiwan."
2020-12-14 19:54:14,"I don't really care about what Chinese really think about themselves and about the US.  But with the daily Covid death count in the US exceeds that of 911, we have a colossal failure in our system of government and in us as a whole. This is beyond any political ideology debates, with near 300K death, we failed miserably."

2020-12-14 19:56:53,"The disdain of the US that is now going on in China is another version of group compliance condoned and encouraged by the Chinese communist party with the expected result that it further strengthens its dominance over its people: a common enemy, the US, unites. This opportunity for China was ironically triggered by our dismal response to the Covid pandemic- a self inflicted tragedy caused by the incompetence of the Trump administration. 

Speaking of  Trump and his followers, the unified disdain of the seriousness of the virus and its mitigation, the derision of climate change, the health threat of environmental pollution and its control, in fact the scorn of science itself, is a dangerous groupthink that could, if unchecked, be our Achilles heel. It may linger after the Biden inauguration and slow its progress, but I believe that ultimately it will fade. I put my faith in our youth on whom an unchecked environmental disaster will fall, but who have shown an unprecedented zeal to tackle the issue. Their spirit together with the scientific prowess of the US and western nations will not only counterbalance China's quest for dominance, but surpass it through innovation and savvy. China is a superb economic competitor and manufacturer of commoditized products, but has little to show for transformational innovations that today powers the global economy. Such advances are the byproducts of the intellectual institutions of free societies, but are suppressed by China's groupthink."
2020-12-14 20:05:35,"The U.S., Europe and India are good at creating things. China is good at making things. (Although China has some engineering marvels of their own, those are mostly grand infrastructure projects.) We need each other, if anything. Success depends on how you measure it."
2020-12-14 20:21:22,"I am old enough that I can remember when President Kennedy went to Berlin and gave his famous speech to thousands of cheering Berliners.  I will paraphrase what he said :  “ Freedom has many difficulties and democracy has many problems, but we have never had to put up a wall to keep our people in. “ That is how I feel about the comparison of the Chinese and United States government.  We have had a terrible time during Trump’s reign and his government has grossly failed us during the pandemic. But we never lost our right to protest, to speak out, to organize and advocate for new leadership and to yes, unfortunately, to refuse to follow medical advice about masks and social distancing. Our democracy has survived and a new administration gives us hope.  We will be fine.  And if any of us are unhappy or disgruntled, we can stand on a soap box in front of the White House and rant and rave against the government without fear of a twenty year jail term. We can access the internet and speak freely without censorship or fear of reprisal from the police.  We can worship as we please, celebrate and keep our cultural heritage, join or form any political party. Yup, I’ll take democracy over totalitarianism any day."
2020-12-14 20:23:11,"China's current economic power was directly derived from the globalization movement.  The Chinese became the de facto outsourced manufacturing hub of the planet.  Those skills translated into a whole new crop of billionaires along with the a manufacturing infrastructure that is second to none.  While this happened, American and European companies happily off shored their operations for the lower labor costs and lack of unions.  Jack Ma's open endorsement of the 996 work schedule (9am to 9pm, 6 days a week) is positively Dickensian but its becoming universal in China.  American and European labor fought, bled and sometime died to improve conditions and establish a 40hr week.  A 72 hour week is only possible with an obedient, compliant and tractable workforce.  A workforce that is also kept tightly in check by the power of the State too.  In a very real sense, how different is this really from the days of Imperial China?  How different is the Communist Party leadership from the old Chinese Nobility that were pushed out at the end of the 19th Century? Not very it would seem."

2020-12-14 21:12:10,The fact that the US is close to China GDP wise despite having less than a quarter of China’s population shows that China has a long way to go economically to catch the US.
2020-12-14 21:40:37,"Mao Tse Tsung called America a paper tiger some 75 years ago. But that descriptor wasn't apt until 2020, when Sec of State Pompeo loudly decried the suppression of Hong Kong protests, while screens worldwide showed American police brutally fighting peaceful demonstrators, while armed looters went completely unchallenged. 

China's authoritarianism does represent a threat, first to its neighbours but ultimately also to its citizens that end up on the wrong side of their policy (see the Uighurs). 

Combating that has to include more than repeating the same old critiques. It must begin with the US (and others) addressing the deep and systemic corruption that's led to the current state of affairs where China is the rational, organized power."
2020-12-14 21:43:23,"Seems like a fair prediction unless the US grasps the thorny issue of constitutional reform. It is hard to tout the advantages of democracy when our politics are dominated by the extreme conservatism of our rural hinterland. We are heading to be the 21st century version of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, everyone knows what to do but no one has the political power to implement it."
2020-12-14 21:44:29,"There are many reasons for China's success.  But at this crucial time in world history, one of the major reasons for China's ascendancy, not just economically and but also technologically and scientifically, is  Donald Trump.  

At a time when the democratic model needed to be seen as a viable alternative that was capable not only of ensuring civil liberties but also of advancing civilization in a humanitarian way, Trump did his best to cast the democratic model as a failure.  
   
We need to make it clear to the world that the failure is Trump, not our system of government."
2020-12-14 20:46:48,"I lived and worked in China for 11 years.  Even before COVID, the US was quickly losing respect with the election of Trump.  His shabby performance as president was the single best anti democracy propaganda we could have provided.
The media there had no need to massage news regarding America's flailing White House.  It was obvious to anyone.
In my years there, I saw China slide into a more controlling dictatorship than it already was.  In exchange for this, there has been a dramatic reduction in (blatant) corruption, pollution has been reduced, infrastructure projects have continued at breakneck pace, and the overall standard of living has improved.  Controlling the COVID outbreak is a huge accomplishment, although much easier with a vice like grip on the population.
Recent crackdowns on Uighurs and Hong Kong as well as other government intrusions into people's privacy make me glad to be no longer living there.  
Much of what you see there is superficial.  Fancy facades hide shabby architecture.  Modern, massive government buildings house creaky, corrupt, incompetent bureaucracies.  Greed is the prevailing motive for most enterprises.
Education is a stifling exercise in mind control.
China does not have a lock on being the future world's greatest superpower.  It could just as easily slide into the kind of madness that enveloped it during Mao's reign."
2020-12-14 21:42:57,"I've lived in China on two occasions.  The Chinese people are most hospitable and welcoming of Westerners.  But many defer to the authoritarian state.

2020-12-14 20:20:14,"The author certainly did not hider his superiority in the article. Will the author and  western media ever realize that the problem is the West, who has always felt they are superior to China and other countries. The West and the U.S. have been selling and imposing their ideology to other regimes and countries. Their logic is absolutely a colonial ideology--we colonized you before, we exploited you before, we were the leaders and we created the world order before. But the world is different now and they refuse to acknowledge China's strength. They have never given China the credit for its rise. It's Chinese people's hardworking ethics that has built the country's economy. Without China, the west would not even be able to celebrate Christmas (on youtube). The West uses the same old disparaging view on China. First, China and its people have their own rights to decide what to do and where their own country is going. The U.S. has been relentlessly interfering other country's business. Western media is certainly spreading the same ideology to other places. The U.S. and the west are perpetuating their ideology and perspectives, this is why Westerners will never ever change their perspectives on China. They are reading the same books on China, have never even been to China, don't speak the language, have the same filter, use the same disparaging lens and language on China. Their education lacks knowledge representation of other civilizations through other peoples' perspectives."
2020-12-14 20:23:28,"Chinese rhetoric is extremely nationalistic.

And when nationalism affects a lot of people, used as propaganda by the government so that the population does not revolt, it means that the country is experiencing a serious economic, financial and social crisis.

Everybody in the world blame China for the worldwide spread of Covid19, and chinese autorities come to tell us that they're superior to any others... It's like Trump being defeated and pretending he has won, it's fake news and political propaganda, to avoid responsibility for their failure.

Some decades ago, when China was isolated from the rest of the world the rest of the world wasn't plagued by such epidemy, chinese irresponsibility killed so many people who thought it was safe to buy their product.

China's 10% growth is gone for ever, and the blame is because of them.
Now they can move like the japanese imperialism of the 20th century by shifting to military conquest but they know the result."
2020-12-14 21:56:50,"I would not blame the genuine pride from the Chinese people on their recent achievements. On the other hand it is so easy for the  propagandist of the Chinese government to turn the genuine pride into hubris when faced with difficulties.

The fact of the matter is that the United States are so much more stronger than China. I hope the top leaders of China understand the reality instead of being fooled by their own propagandists."
2020-12-14 20:05:52,"I believe all the aggressiveness from China is because it knows COVID was a biological weapon or a lab experiment by an overzealous scientist, that leaked out of the lab.
They are afraid what that would do to their carefully crafted world standing of last 20 years, not to mention to their domestic one. 

Hence the need to show aggression in advance - they have no other choice. 

We MUST find out the truth."
2020-12-14 20:49:59,The US do not run large scale concentration camps. Unity is always an illusion when the slightest dissent is stamped out with violence as just happened in Hongkong. Dictatorships project the illusion of power until they come crashing down. Democracies appear disunited and weak but are capable of surprising resilience. The aggressive behaviour of the Chinese Leadership is a camouflage of their intrinsic lack of legitimity.
2020-12-14 21:48:51,We are doomed under a Biden Harris leadership. Neither of them have the intellect nor the resolve to stand up to China. Biden as POTUS has emboldened the Chinese leadership.

2020-12-14 21:30:54,"Let them believe what they will. China might just be different than USA or the West. And let their society play out based on their facts. And the facts remain that because they are a communist regime and an autocracy, COVID 19 started, they’ didn’t even KNOW it, and when they did, they covered it up, failed to stop it until it spread everywhere in the world.

Hiding information and clamping down on dissent is certainly easier when you are an autocracy. Keep that up, sure."
2020-12-14 20:10:23,"Dearest China,

Your culture is mightier that America's, especially when the margins of selection are contracting at an accelerating rate, which they're doing now.

But like our ""defeat"" of the Soviet Union, your ""defeat"" of America will be temporary.

Why?
Because there's not a culture or a government on earth that can handle our species' Numbers, Powers & Reach.

Look out the window... the Sky & Ocean are being armed with weapons of mass extinction while we Breathe, Drink & Eat microplastic.

Nationalism, while understandable, won't work.

I think China will likely last longer than the U. S. & much of the world. Authoritarian governments can move faster than democracies during collapse.
I also think the Chinese people are tougher than Americans.

Years ago I wrote a comedy riff about a Chinese general wanting to invade America. He cited a few American stats:
#1 job in America: cashier.
#1 prescribed med: antidepressants.
> 70% of American youth are too damaged for military service... The general closes with: ""I think we can take 'em.""
An American responds: ""So what if I'm a fat, depressed cashier... all I gotta do is push a few buttons and you're gone.""

Bigger Picture: Humans don't fit the environs we've generated.

We’re Not Coded (built) — biologically or culturally — for relationship interface with complex, global environs undergoing exponential gains in complexity for X number of years, nor for the myriad emergent consequences  that come with exponential dynamics."

I think that the USA must change if it does not want to suffer more of what is going to suffer."
2020-12-14 22:29:47,"Views of China as a total authoritarian state are overblown.  Regions and cities have a lot of leeway from the center, and within the Communist Party you have political fractions that range from neoliberals trained in the West to Maoists. There are also tens of thousands of street demonstrations each year. Not as big as the ones in the US, mostly local grievances, but the Chinese people aren't cowering in their homes either."

2020-12-14 22:22:06,This is all propaganda. The Chinese nationalist have no idea what we in the west are all about. Brainwash. I predict China's audacity will lead to less and less international cooperation and will put them further and further into isolation over the next 50 years. There will be a new Chinese wall (or curtain. Name TBD). We all should be rolling over from laughter about their ideas and start to look for new business partners.
2020-12-14 22:39:13,"One day someone should do a study on the extent to which patriotism breeds racism. Both China and the U.S. are deeply racist countries albeit in different ways. 

Patriotism has its place but when it is valued above all other values it is a disservice because it serves as a blinker and prevents a country from becoming aware of its own blind spots. 

""Communism"" and ""socialism"" are American blind spots whereas China has adopted those aspects of capitalism that serve its purpose. 

Americans are dedicated to the notion that creativity and innovation cannot flourish in a 'communist"" society, yet much of today's cutting edge design is taking place in China alongside diverse achievements in scientific research. Kerala, one of the more prosperous Indian states, has become so under democratically elected communist governments. How shocking!

Those democracies that handled covid-19 well also happened to have ""socialist"" heath systems.

China sees the US as both hypocritical and morally weak. The treatment of the Uighurs has been reprehensible but one should not forget its origins, nor the US's own bloodstained response to perceived terrorist threats.  

Both countries have a lot to learn from one another but that can't happen while each regards the other as some sort of existential threat. This deep prejudice needs to be seen for what it is. Burgeoning national hubris is a danger to all."
2020-12-14 22:45:35,"America hasn't handled the pandemic well, but that's largely due to the incompetence and indifference of the federal government.

2020-12-14 22:25:20,"Yes, the Xi authoritarian regime has been effective at controlling the spread of COVID-19 (after first ignoring it and harassing scientists and health care workers who initially raised the alarm about it).

Xi's authoritarian regime has also been really effective at things like 1984-style control of the Chinese people, crushing any semblance of freedom in Hong Kong, and eradicating millions of Uyghurs -- meanwhile, enriching Xi and those in his orbit.

And, let's not overlook the fact that Xi's authoritarian regime wasn't effective at eliminating, or even managing, the source of COVID-19 -- the infamous ""wet markets"" -- which continue to this day, despite longstanding evidence that these wet markets were, and still very much are, a likely vector of viruses that could spread to humans.

Given this ledger, I'll take our flawed democracy over Xi's authoritarian regime any day."

2020-12-14 22:13:45,"Hmmmm. I read this article a couple of times. What exactly makes China's nationalism ""combative""? Then I looked at the referenced artwork.  How does it depict the US as a ""humbled"" backwater? Is this future US ""humbled"" because it has embraced communism or is it the inclusion of Chinese words in the signage. Now, I can't read Chinese, so perhaps the characters say something like, ""we who have accepted Chinese rule"", but if so, this should've been translated.

My point? This seems to a piece aimed at stoking  American sentiment against China. Yes, I get that some in China feel that "" America isn’t that heavenly kingdom depicted since decades ago” and that “there’s nothing special about it"", but these sentiments hardly rise to the level of being ""combative"". The sooner we realize that there is nothing special about America beyond the work we Americans put in the better."

While China is currently in a virtuous cycle, these cycles eventually end.  Just image the destruction in China if another Mao or the equivalent of Trump were to achieve power. In the meantime, the West should band together and bide their time."

We presumed that what the people wanted was more important than doing what was scientifically correct to contain the virus.  Before we even started, we took the position that a broad-based lockdown would not be possible. Yet, Australia and New Zealand have clearly shown that a tight, swift lockdown could also be achieved in a free society.  You don't solve a scientific problem with weak politicians and endless debates.  You lead, defeat, and then take credit. Unfortunately, Trump is none of them."

They can observe the world by themselves; they can read any printing or website freely. If they believe in western values, they can certainly apply for immigration.

China is the only nation in this world that experiences rising and declining periodically in its history.  Other power would not rise again after being down, e.g. Britain, Germany, and Spain, etc. 

I guess this is the source of so-called ""national confidence"". It has nothing to do with ideology. No matter which party is in authority, Chinese people would always believe that the country will be back to the top again some day."
2020-12-14 23:25:45,"The folks in China have conveniently forgotten that it wasn't Communism that got China out of poverty, but the Free Market system.

American calculus on the impact on Covid-19 is based at least initially that the deaths of seniors and others at risk of grave sickness from Covid-19 are worth the alternative of shutting down the economy for several weeks.  Many are also unwilling to wear masks and practice social distancing and other protocols known to reduce or slow the spreading  of the pandemic.  The willingness to let more older people die as an acceptable trade-offs as long as they are not someone you know, or are already in assisted living facilities."

2020-12-15 00:14:05,"There is another article in this paper, about China's goal of taking some major steps to dramatically reduce carbon emissions, I'm sure by the same methods they have used to make their people do certain things to avoid the wild spread of Covid-19, such as has happened in the U.S. Admittedly, in this sense, China's kind of government has obvious advantages.

Personally, I applaud their desire to make rapid headway in addressing climate change, and hope it works out, whatever their method. 

I'd be happier, though, if all nations put as much into the effort of convincing their populace to save themselves from a environmental future that promises to be, at best, monumentally challenging."

2020-12-15 01:07:53,"The irony of the anti-China posturing by Trump, his enablers in government and his followers among the public is that they have done more to discredit freedom and democracy and raise the appeal of China’s model as the future of good government than the CCP could ever dream of. 

After all, authoritarians in the near future will say, it’s thanks to democracy that Americans elected so blatantly unqualified a person as Trump as president. And it’s thanks to freedom of speech that Americans were able to spread disinformation that thwarted efforts to control the spread of coronavirus and led to death threats against government officials and healthcare professionals, while the Supreme Court put freedom of religion over public health by striking down restrictions on religious gatherings. 

We often try to placate ourselves by saying that democracy is “messy.” But at a time when China is controlling coronavirus and building the future while democracies - especially the US and UK - seem incapable of accomplishing anything or doing anything right, we’re going to find a growing number of people around the world preferring the efficiency and orderliness of Chinese authoritarianism over our “messy” democracy - and no amount of appeals to basic human rights or calling out of CCP atrocities will make us look any better."

Countries that wait may realise they don't need to hitch their fortunes to this fast rising star before the heady opportunity is gone.

2020-12-15 03:14:41,"Chinese culture respects and studies history. Chinese remember the shame of defeat by colonial forces. By comparison, most Americans have little interest in history lessons. They seemed to have forgotten the Korean war, the Vietnam war, invasion of Iraq & Afghanistan. Do they really want a war with China, a nuclear power?

Daniel Moynihan (1923-2003) is already a forgotten historical figure, but his words deserve to be studied in American classrooms: ""Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts."" What is the difference between a ""law abiding society"" & an ""authoritarian society""? Not much.

The 2020 Election not only failed to reduce polarization but accentuates them. Over 300,000 Americans are dead from covid-19 so far.  American Democracy boggles the mind.

The facts on the ground in China are quite different. Chinese are healthy and alive to enjoy freedom, Chinese socialist style.

""East is east, and west is west"" seems firmly entrenched in western mind. Americans are taught to think of themselves as ""Exceptional"", a superior country. Nothing wrong with pride and confidence in one's country. Nothing wrong either when Mr. Xi warns Chinese to stick to their socialism, to be proud of it and on alert of western brainwashing.

It will be lunacy for China to wish other countries to copy its formula. Quite the opposite, it should suit China just fine that the United States, and the west too, to continue on their current democratic course."
2020-12-14 23:07:38,"I lived in Japan for around 11 years.  I moved their with my family several years after its bubble burst.  All peoples are tribal and somewhat xenophobic.  The Japanese certainly were and demonstrated during the 1930s and well into the War in the Pacific with their adherence to the  Yamato Spirit.  It was a myth.  They then rose again during the mid-late 1980s only to have that myth burst to be followed by about two decades of limited progress.  Wealthy yes but not particularly dynamic.  It's success was born of having a talented and well educated workforce; however, its universities were not up to the best of the West.  

Has that changed for China? Japan built bridges to nowhere.  China has built cities with no or few inhabitants.  Even though the nail that stands up gets hammered down (出る釘は打たれる) still in Japan, the kempeitai (憲兵隊) is only a memory of its period of militarism after the Meiji Restoration.  What about China? 

At this time, the Chinese Power Elite are fishing in the dark. Bouyed by an inexpensive labor force and massive investment due to its large market, the next step will be harder.  Dissent in Hong Kong, a separate Taiwan, and global awareness of its internal authoritarian governance make it a very unlikely model to subsume the West.  If not careful, the China Dream will evaporate rather like a fine mist.  The big question will be the extent of internal and collateral damage."

Churchill: ""Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all other forms""

Lincoln to the south: ""if only you had kept faith with democracy""

How many times have we seen this before?

We have been through an especially bad patch for a long time now.

The last time median wage went up in lockstep w/ GNP was 1972, the year Biden was elected to the Senate.

It's a coincidence but we can see the stresses & strains in our society will eventually force change.

The problem in our society is concentration of wealth which happens when a society based on free contract allows bargaining power to become too concentrated. 

Democracy provides a feed back loop that after much strife eventually fixes the problem. That's what happened in the 30s. 

Hitler did an amazing job of injecting Weapons Keynsianism into Germany's economy. By 1940 GNP was roughly 140% above 1929 levels (Adam Tooze ""Wages of Destruction"") but w/out the feedback loop.

Churchill: ""Hitler knows that he will have to break us...or lose the war. If we can stand up to him...the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands; but if we fail then...we... will sink into the abyss of a new dark age. 

""Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duty...so...men will ...say, 'this was their finest hour'.

3/ Australia & New Zealand local community transmission has been eliminated. Case numbers reflect returning travellers in 14 day mandatory hotel quarantine.  China still has limited local transmission. The above 2 democracies do not!

How was it done in non-authoritarian regime:
1/ Good governance, don't throw out pandemic plan, Trump!
2/ Good communications & transparency vs China cover up
3/ Populace worked together complying with the Sciencitifc advise rather then that by Qanon.

USA? Whinging and whinening softies with self righteous assumption of freedom at the end of the barrel of a gun against the heads of those willing to wear masks.

Western concept of freedom is by John Stuart Mill (Wiki) In 
“On Liberty,” meaning “doing as we like, subject to such consequences as may follow, without impediment from our fellow creatures, as long as what we do does not harm them even though they should think our conduct foolish, perverse or wrong.”

Note the clause “as long as what we do does not harm them” i.e. “Your freedom to do as you please with your fist ends where my jaw begins.”

2020-12-15 01:06:45,"What kind of parallel universe is this article and those being described by it living in? From what I recall from the pages of this very newspaper, China's authoritarian ways is exactly what had stifled the dissemination of information when the epidemic was just beginning. The physician who tragically perished of COVID was mercilessly silenced for trying to sound the alarm. The Chinese authorities couldn't stand to lose face and admit there was a catastrophe on their hands, which then fanned the flames of the pandemic. And now they want the world to be in awe of how they can lock down a nation of people who are petrified of the their government? That's supposed to be an extraordinary feat?!

Meanwhile, this so-called ""artist"" who fancies flags of the hammer and sickle in Manhattan clearly has no idea what happened in Tiananmen Square because it is forbidden to discuss historical events in his ""glorious"" country. And I suppose the concentration camps of the Uighurs are of no matter to him either (even if he knows they exist).

I don't fly 2 huge American flags from a pickup truck, but I thank my lucky stars daily that I got to immigrate to the US when I did. When China needs to beat back the scores of people clamoring to immigrate to that country by threatening them with a wall (which I am vehemently against) we can then talk about which nation has more to offer the world."

2020-12-15 04:45:27,"China is a new governmental phenomenon in the world, an autocratic government structure that is competent, truly works for the benefit of improving the economy and the general welfare of its people, and is not corrupt in the usual ways we have seen elsewhere, except that it does not allow the existence of a competitive party, and members of the ruling party have special access to self-enrichment opportunities.

It is reminiscent of the Nazi regime, including parallels about persecuting a  minority group. It also has a plentiful supply of highly capable, hard-working citizens, and it's scientific, rational, intellectual performance over the last 5 decades is nothing short of  of phenomenal and unprecedented.

It is now a world power with the capability to do much harm if a leader like Hitler gains control. Ir also has the capability to contrive beneficially to civilization.
I think overt campaigns of other nations to overthrow the structure of its government is misguided and likely to be unsuccessful. Therefore we should try to find ways to encourage  a more shared power structure, which is a nominal part of their  structure, but seems to be eroding currently.

We should also try to restore our path toward  competent self-management and progress to a more egalitarian society, which will regain the respect and admiration of the Chinese people. Their leadership is rational,and cannot ignore the progress of other nations.

As for Fred and Cliffs points about the loss of good jobs, fortunately, modular homes are price sensitive to distance hauled. They need to be constructed within hundreds of miles to be cost effective. More importantly than the current price sensitivity, workers need to be organized and demand higher wages. Capital is not going to give higher wages without a fight. Hopefully it won't be a literal fight, as in the 1930's when the Pinkertons, police, national guardsmen and goons were used to break strikes and kill strikers. Let's not hold house construction hostage to our current state of labor organization. With the increased storms of climate change, we need more modern houses that are more strongly constructed. Modular could help in that regard. The energy efficiency is also a potential strength of modular construction. They don't have to be like single and doublewides in trailer parks."

If he wants to support my colleagues who are risking their lives and going into the school building 5 days a week, he should require more from the remote teachers with medical accommodations.

There was a definite hint of desperation and panic in his email.  Remote learning is a disaster in our district (despite the efforts of well-meaning teachers), which is suburban and affluent relative to the urban districts in our state.  I can only imagine what it looks like in the large Minneapolis districts.

Anyone who is arguing that remote learning is a success should take a good hard look at the actual outcomes for students.  It IS URGENT to get kids back into the classroom, where they can actually receive an education."

These big city teachers’ unions have shown time and again that the students are not the true priority. They are robbing these kids of a proper education and social interaction (safe). 

Schools in much of the South and Midwest have been open. They’ve had weeks where they had to close and then reopened. They have made it safe and made it work. Those are the educators, janitors, nurses, SRO, and cafeteria workers that should be applauded. They have gone above and beyond to give children the care and education they need. 

I think it’s interesting that in the midst of this pandemic, it appears more students have chosen private education or homeschooling to ensure their child receives even an average education.

I worked in business for decades before I became a teacher.  I spent a year not working to get my credential and a cut pay of over 50% to become a teacher.

I spent the same number of hours working each year as before, even with taking the summers off.  My paid hours were 25 minutes longer than my classroom hours.  You can’t create and modify lessons to reflect this years students (and changes to how the administration wants you to teach) and grade 150 plus papers in 25 minutes a day.  And that 25 minutes included welcoming the students to your first class, and dealing with students after the final bell.  What keeps most teachers in the profession is the contact with the students and watching them grow in understanding.  That doesn’t happen over Zoom.

Many of my former colleagues are not just out of college and have conditions that put them more at risk if they contact the disease.  They would not be dealing with people as ill as nurses and doctors, but there is a reason some teachers joke about their students being disease vectors.

So can the “teachers don’t want to work” junk."
2020-12-15 14:06:38,"We have been fortunate to be in a district that has largely been open all year, full time at the K-6 level.  In other districts, I  think many teachers want to be back in school, but their union leadership is more the problem, not the teachers themselves. 

Here is my thought...move teachers near the front of the line, but with the caveat that if you get the shot, you are in the classroom with your students."
2020-12-15 13:22:06,"When politicians deny science, this publication throws a fit. When teacher unions deny science, the attitude is ‘it be like that sometimes.’"
2020-12-15 13:08:30,"If you have been on the front lines all year, working in person at your place of work.  

That is essential.  All those workers before teachers.  

Of course everyone wants normal again, kids in school, full employment.  More normal maybe fall 2021."
2020-12-15 13:16:42,"Thank you for your continued coverage of the many issues of public education coming to light during the COVID crisis.  

Please - no more photos of white, male teachers at the top of articles about public educators.  The inaccuracy of this representation feels like an unconscious bias."
2020-12-15 13:58:00,"For most teachers, remote teaching is at least double the work that in-person teaching is.  So let's dispense with that myth that conveniently blames teachers (again) for the situation that Districts are in.   

Some unions, like UTLA in Los Angeles, are useless in protecting teachers, choosing instead to focus on supporting outside causes with the money we members pay them, and to work in tandem with the District on its goals while presenting a facade that will mollify teachers.  Teachers, and teachers' unions, do not make the decisions.  So please strike that bogeyman from the list. 

Public school teachers are public servants, but in many areas of the country we have been turned into public whipping boys, having to answer for students who fail, parents who don't care, Districts and Administrators that make bad decisions, and unions that are slave to politically correct agendas.  Now, we seem to be taking the blame for creating more work for ourselves because there's a deadly pandemic and our institutions are too underfunded, paralyzed by politics or incompetent to get us back in the classrooms."
2020-12-15 14:01:35,"What began as a 2 week closure to “flatten the curve” has morphed into a multiple year refusal to work. Young children have not been contracting covid nor spreading it in significant numbers. Elderly elementary school teachers or those with conditions should get the vaccine asap, and the rest should get back to work or be fired."
2020-12-15 14:05:44,I look forward to seeing comments from teachers who would be willing to return to the classroom immediately after being vaccinated. Anybody?
2020-12-15 13:05:17,"Keeping the school open is central to bring communities back to normalcy. It's clear that remote learning is less effective than in-class learning, especially for younger children. The next important step is to have vaccines for children asap."
2020-12-15 13:22:08,"If teachers get vaccines but students do not, it seems that there are still moderate risks to the teachers.  Based on teachers’ previous concerns that any risk from teaching was intolerable, there seems to be no point in vaccinating teachers but not students - because teachers still won’t want to come back to school.  So it seems like vaccinating teachers early would be a waste, and others who are actually in front line jobs should get the vaccine first - even restaurant workers and the like.  As others have said, just vaccinate teachers next summer when the vaccine is widely available and let them go back to school in the fall.

The answer changes for those teachers who are already back at school - obviously they should be entitled to the vaccine early on."
2020-12-15 14:11:22,"As the article points out, it is the teacher's union and not necessarily the teachers, who are the major impediment to schools opening.  Further, I would point out the the vast majority of the major metropolitan areas beholden to the teacher's unions are those with Democratic administration."
2020-12-15 14:18:25,"Of course teachers should be prioritized, but it’s unscientific to suggest that a vaccine is needed to safely return to school. Basic safety mitigation measures, like masks, handwashing, and inexpensive approaches to ventilation have allowed over half of schools in this country to reopen since August. The vast majority of schools in Europe and Canada have reopened, too. These countries spend *less* on education than we do, yet made it work. Some have done so while requiring laxer safety standards than we do, not requiring masks for all kids and adhering to smaller amounts of distancing.

Parochial schools in our cities, too, have smaller budgets than their public school neighbors, but have been open since August.

I generally support teachers unions, but on this issue they are out of step with science, the world, their colleagues in neighboring schools, and other essential workers in their exaggerated portrayal of the risks in their workplace."
2020-12-15 14:39:18,Shouldn't we prioritize the vaccines to the groups that statically have more chance of dying or have at least severe complications from the disease? I guess that includes the personal in contact with them that can transmit the disease. My point is that we need to stay focused in using the vaccine as weapon to lower the death rates. This the best use we can have a vaccine that still in very limited supply.
2020-12-15 14:43:13,"I am confused why this discussion so far has been limited to K-12 teachers. College teachers/professors work with adults, who are far more likely to be affected by the virus, yet they are further down the priority line. Sometimes our rooms are so packed, students are encouraged to sit on the floor or stand in the aisles."
2020-12-15 14:51:45,"No. Along with teachers, other school staff need to get vaccinated. What is the use of vaccinating teachers alone? Does the virus won't spread through other school staff? And along with teachers and staff even students need to be vaccinated. 

Anyhow rich nations, like the US, many have stocked more number of shots than what is required. It is reported that some rich nations, including the US has stored up vaccines more than the requirement and more than their population, which is very bad."
2020-12-15 14:53:25,"Some of these comments are shocking and disheartening. Those people ragging on teachers-- have any of you been in a public inner city school building or spent a day in an overcrowded classroom? Could it be that other countries have been able to keep schools open because they prioritize their children's learning over being able to go to bars and half their communities aren't vehemently opposed to masks? 

Kids internalize and respond to our behaviors, and hearing adults always complaining about terrible this is doesn't make it any better for them. 

Sitting in front of a screen all day is not ideal for any child, but but if you think helping your child learn at home is difficult, imagine teaching a class of 20-30 students with varying degrees of participation and abilities, and you will have an idea of what it is to be a teacher."
2020-12-15 14:13:54,Teachers unions are simply using COVID as a negotiating tool. And that is appalling.
2020-12-15 14:43:07,"Vaccinate the teachers, but note recent research is reevaluating children's role in the pandemic. Children, even the youngest, remain a risk to spread in the community:

""A large study from Austria shows that SARS-CoV-2 infects just as many schoolchildren as it does teachers. Other surveys indicate that while young children may show no symptoms, they are quite efficient at spreading the virus.""

Schools will be a focal point for COVID disease until widespread vaccination has occurred. Also, how long and/or at what level the vaccinated can spread the virus is yet unknown .

2020-12-15 14:18:30,"Remember, back when it was still largely theoretical and the vaccines were in the developmental stage, there was talk about prioritizing distribution to minority communities that have been hit the hardest during the pandemic?

Now that the vaccine has arrived, you don’t hear much of that anymore, do you?"
2020-12-15 14:36:47,"Wow, this article sure brought out the union haters. I am not a teacher, but a retired individual, older, who works part time in a rural high school. Teachers and staff are anxious to bring back students, but like employees everywhere we want to be sure we are not participating in a spreader event. Stop sterotyping people and start talking with them to get the real story."
2020-12-15 14:25:50,"This article makes me sick. My daughters ages 9 and 11 have not been in school since last March. This fall semester they went in person about 20 days. 
This is unacceptable. The value our society places on education is abysmal. Teachers and school staff should be at the front of the line, along with healthcare workers, to get vaccinated and schools need to reopen in person, full time. Period. Why is there no plan for this?! 
In my state all the private schools have been operating (almost) like normal this semester and guess what? No one had died. Thousands of private school kids and teachers go to school here everyday and they are getting educated while my kids at public school are struggling with one or two days a week of in person learning. 
Now the 5 WEEK winter break has started. 
In the meantime, we are going crazy cooped up inside all the time and I can’t go get a job until my kids are back in school. (I lost my job in May bc of the pandemic.)
It makes me sick to think this might go on for another year. 
I have zero patience for this to go on for one more minute."
2020-12-15 14:38:34,"The comments on this article are very disconcerting.  There’s a lot of demonization of one side or the other.  It speaks to our inability to have conversations in this country.

Here’s the reality:  being a teacher means being in a room with 30 students where social distancing is not possible for 45 minute stretches.  Each day, a high school teacher ends up with over 100 “close contacts” as defined by the cdc.

So naturally, this implies a higher risk of infection than the general populace.  The question is, where in line should they fall?  I think the discussion gets back to the risk.  I’m open to discussion about whether others are higher risk, I’d just like to see honest arguments instead of diatribes about teacher unions."
2020-12-15 14:54:51,Reality Check one must wonder which is worse virse or schools our kids go to? Children should be tested for fevor when entering bus in morning. Crazynest to put kids on bus sick because parents have to work . Alot can be done to prevent kids sharing all disease .But little action on part of schools. This ahs to be group effort on part parents an schools if schools can open safely .Sure vaccine may work but what enables it still goes unchecked.
2020-12-15 14:28:11,"If everyone else can get on planes, trains and elevators. Teachers can teach children even more safely. That's data and science."
2020-12-15 14:22:56,"1)  Weren't we told kids are not spreaders, susceptible, carriers and schools are safe and schools should open with or without vaccine?
2)  Isn't the vaccine supposed to be a cure so that if a person becomes infected, that person can get vaccinated and then not get serious symptoms?
3)  Teachers should believe in science and facts, since it's their business to teach them.  Are we suggesting there are teachers who don't buy science?
4)  The people who developed vaccines came out of our ed system.  That's remarkable!  Trust them!"
2020-12-15 14:42:13,"Not just teachers but counselors, school staff, media clerks, custodians, cafeteria workers, we are all on the frontline.  In my district, teachers have been permitted to work from home, because of their contract,  while others of us are deemed ""essential"" and must be on campus every day.  We see students, have special education students on campus, as well as many kids for whom distant learning is not working.  I go to school scared every day.  I love my job, I love my students and I don't want to get sick, I don't want my husband to get sick.  My arm is out and ready for that shot today."
2020-12-15 14:31:37,"As I write this, I am proctoring an exam for high school students in a classroom. We're socially distanced, and masked. 

So far, all good. Thank God. 

But let's get our teachers vaccinated sooner than later. 

It's only our kids' futures that are stake!"
2020-12-15 15:08:03,"As a 4th grade teacher, I will absolutely get the vaccine as soon as I can. I want nothing more than to be safely back in the classroom with my students in front of me. But because I teach in the independent school system, without a union to protect me and my colleagues. I wonder if we will qualify for the same fast-tracking as DOE city employees will?"
2020-12-15 15:10:02,"Teachers are only a piece of the puzzle. There are still all the adults who work in a school; then the kids; then the parents of kids; then the friends/workers of kids. To end transmission, you need to reach herd-like coverage of everyone involved.

The larger issue(s) are, have we redefined education to include more than just education, and is it a good thing?  Have we shifted the responsibility of learning from the student and parent to the teacher? Have we out of convenience, shifted the responsibility of taking care of our kids from parents to a third party?  

Philosophically, if you carry to the extreme, should we allow ""parents"" to be just the progenitors, then in the interest of the State, take the kids away from them and let them be trained by the State?"
2020-12-15 15:13:24,"A couple thoughts:
Masking in school is really not a big deal and certainly no reason to keep schools closed. 

Teachers and unions cannot continue to move the goalposts. If they’re offered the vaccine and don’t want to take it and yet feel too uncomfortable going back, they may have to find a new career. We cannot continue to force our students to yield  to the teachers unions demands. Firm metrics need to be set and publicized that establish when the criterion is met, schools fully reopen. Anyone not on board has notice and time to begin to make alternative educational or career plans."
2020-12-15 15:18:22,"Vaccinating only the teachers doesnt benefit the rest of us much, except they might reluctantly go back in the classroom. What about the families of the children? The other school personnel? The rest if us? 

I see other comments agree. This whole conversation on who is most important and thus should be protected has been interesting. Since the medical people have it and are distributing it, they come first, of course. I’ll be last, if at all. This is too discouraging to deal with and i am out."
2020-12-15 15:26:33,"It appears obvious that in CA the teacher’s union will not open schools no matter what. When the entire bay area was in low risk ‘red tier’ or ‘orange tier’ there was not even an attempt to open schools. The public elementary school in my area is effectively teaching until noon and 4 days a week. There is no virtual PE, music class etc. The teachers are delegating most work to parents and making no effort to engage the kids one-on-one. For the teachers and schools administrators this is the greatest time because they can essentially get paid and keep all their privileges with little work. In contrast private schools are open and doing in person classes! It’s about time we make school vouchers and charter schools the norm and not allow this one group of workers hold society hostage. Public schools have been failing CA students for a long time and they need to be held accountable. As someone working in pharmaceutical industry I have to show up to work everyday and work whole day wearing masks but my son cannot go to school because we need to offer absolute safety to teachers no matter what the cost! For once, the Democrats need to actually follow the science and the science shows opening elementary schools have very little risk for the students as well as teachers! Eagerly waiting for the Gavin Newsom recall vote."
2020-12-15 15:01:59,"As much as I agree that teachers should go (as voluntarily as possible) for a COVID vaccine, they are a part of the same group than first responders, health care workers, nursing home staff and essential workers. That makes sense.

What amazes me in all that noise is that not one of those voices are talking about the food industry workers, those working in slaughter houses, food-processing factories and such. They've been forced to keep on toiling in the most precarious conditions, they don't have access to decent health care and they are left hanging and ignored once more.

Well, y'all know, them are just immigrants, most of 'em, right? We're not gonna waste these oh-so-precious vaccine doses on them, right? But it's fine to line the pockets of the Tyson, National and other Perdue and their very white execs..."
2020-12-15 15:20:04,"Once again, an attack on teachers and their unions.  Talk to some teachers- they all hate teaching remotely.  And even in schools that are open, they are constantly having to teach remotely because they are constantly being sent home to quarantine.  It is not ridiculous for teachers to want to be safe in their workplace, or to want their students to be safe as well. Very few of us were given adequate PPE.  Teaching remotely is more work, and we worry for students who aren't doing well. And we miss our students."
2020-12-15 15:08:13,"It's disheartening to hear blame heaped on teachers and their  unions. If you boil it down to the nutshell, there appears to be a lot of resentment that teachers actually have advocacy and representation.

What you are really saying is it's a pity that the Republican goal to destroy labor unions was not completely achieved before this pandemic, so that teachers across the country could not be forced into an unsafe work environment, because that would be more personally convenient for you and your children."
2020-12-15 15:22:48,"We havent prioritized teachers at any point in this entire debacle, instead making sure that every jerk who wanted to could go to the bar until 1am instead. Now my, and many millions of other, kids are stuck at home doing mind-numbing remote education in tears. 

So excuse me if I say I am skeptical that anyone cares enough about kids or their teachers to make this happen."
2020-12-15 15:53:43,"I miss my students. I miss my colleagues. I am spending so much time on the process of making content accessible to my students digitally, helping troubleshoot their tech problems, following them around google to make sure they are on task when I can't ""see"" them in person or on the camera. I would take the vaccine TODAY so I could safely get back to my classroom. Unfortunately, I don't trust the state, my county, or my district to make my safety a priority.  So until I am vaccinated and my district shows they are putting safety (not just students, but the network of adults who are charged with their education) I will not return to the classroom. My family's health and viability is more important than this job. I am prepared to leave."
2020-12-15 15:55:03,"Can vaccinated people still transmit the disease?  Apparently so, and in the absence of better data, this means masks, distancing and hand washing are still required, but YES, teachers, once vaccinated, should feel more secure teaching children in the classroom."
2020-12-15 15:58:07,"College teachers didn’t have unions. Now two-thirds of them are part-timed permanently, without medical insurance or retirement, without raises for decades. In my state, college teachers over 65, those with cancer or heart disease—the vulnerable—are being ordered back in spring. To campuses where hundreds or thousands of students and faculty have tested positive for Covid. No unions. That’s what that has meant, and more grief as well. We have forgotten the ways of the robber barons and their hired politicians. But they didn’t forget us, a nation of workers to be divided and bled."
2020-12-15 16:00:53,"In Germany schools have been open for months - but they also have followed the Business 101 maxim: You can't manage what you don't measure.""

In Germany, all students and staff are tested weekly - so it is known who is infected and needs to quarantine. There is a sense that the overall safety of staff and students isn't being left to hope and prayers but to rigorous care and disciplined practice. In such an atmosphere, teachers and students are mentally freed to pay attention to lessons, not worry about their health and that their families.

Whether a vaccine is widely available or not, comprehensive and regular testing is essential to know that a school environment is safe. Otherwise we're being irresponsible in opening schools."
2020-12-15 16:08:39,"The one thing obvious in this pandemic is how interconnected we are whether we admit it  or like it or not.  Vaccinating one group say teachers does not prevent the spread of this virus to parents, guards, bus drivers the at risk who encounter students or any of the other groups who need this vaccine.  The waning of this virus will happen over the period  months  or even a year depending on how fast a wide swath of our nation can be immunized.  And  sadly wishing it were any other way will not change things."
2020-12-15 16:31:46,"The article briefly mentions other school-system workers. They are often extremely poorly paid, and very often have second jobs in places where they are exposed to the general public on a daily basis. As a public educator, I would personally put them ahead of me in line for vaccinations. I'm certainly not extravagantly paid, even after 20 years, but I can afford not to have a second job, and can afford the markups and delivery charges for grocery services if I need to."
2020-12-15 16:35:02,"Predicting with near 100% certainty that in my district, everyone (union, parents, school committee, etc) will spend endless time arguing (as they have been all year), with minimal science on any side, about whether schools can reopen once teachers are vaccinated. The objective of those who don't want to go back is to run down the clock until school is out for the summer. Everyone will keep arguing around and around in a circle and we won't see all the kids back in school until everyone has been vaccinated, which could be as late as 2022 for the younger kids, whose clinical trials are the last priority."
2020-12-15 17:21:19,"Can we remember that teachers aren't the only ones at schools? Bus drivers, Cafeteria Staff, and Monitors are at even a higher risk as they can't distance from students as easily with desks. They come into contact with hundreds of kids during the most social hours of the school day. Many of them are also older than the younger teachers are. 

The whole school should be considered, especially as the other staff are working with lower wages and less employment stability."
2020-12-15 15:40:59,"This conversation is bumming me out.  I am one of those Covid-19 long haulers.  I may never run another half-marathon in my life.

So, I lose-lose-lose."

2020-12-15 15:52:14,"I know so many teachers that are “scared” to go back to the classroom, but have no problem going to restaurants, getting together at private homes, and in some cases driving quite literally all over the country. But God forbid they go back to work!

Teachers need to get vaccinated and get back in the classroom or find another job. Period. Getting schools open is enormously important for the economy and any hope at a return to normalcy."
2020-12-15 16:03:20,"My daughter hasn't been in school since March and is falling behind because the Zoom classes are awful. It's absolutely shameful. Here in California, daytime temperatures rarely drop below 55 degrees. There's no reason why classes couldn't have been held outdoors, with masks and social distancing. In the meantime, many kids going to private schools are attending in-person classes.

Now we're being told that teachers are nervous about getting vaccines. They said, back in March, that my daughter would be back in school after the Spring break; then it was proposed they would be in school mid-summer, then autumn. They are now saying January 19th, but no one expects the kids to be back in school then. Now they're saying schools may not resume until the fall. 

This cannot go on. If teachers refuse to be inoculated, they should be fired, pure and simple. Our kids deserve better than this."
2020-12-15 16:22:53,The teacher's unions convinced us with the media help that they were not essential and could not be required to work in schools for fear of catching the virus. Many others in multiple industries were required to work as essential workers. In typical I'm more important than you fashion they now want to be considered essential. Maybe they should be required to put their time on the front lines and take some risks while others that already served should be rewarded by getting the vaccine before them.
2020-12-15 16:28:10,"Flashback:  Arizona  decimated its public education budget in 2018, cutting teachers' salaries so low that there was a mass exodus.
Now they're essential to the state?"
2020-12-15 16:33:04,"Our schools have managed to mostly stay open during the pandemic by strictly adhering to social distancing, universal mask wearing 100% of the day, quarantining all who come in close contact with a COVID-positive individual (identified through contact tracing), conducting symptom and temperature checks on every student each morning, limiting student interactions to just their classmates and so forth.  The schools are also rolling out surveillance testing soon.  I think prioritizing teachers and administrators actually teaching in-person now makes sense, but suddenly administering the vaccine to teachers whose schools are not otherwise equipped to support inperson teaching during the pandemic won't be enough to help them re-open.  For teachers who must continue to teach remotely, they should not receive any priority as they only need to be vaccinated prior to the start of the next school year- let those vaccines go to persons who must actually interact with the public now or who have underlying vulnerabilities (advanced age, underlying health conditions that make them susceptible to death from COVID, etc)."
2020-12-15 17:04:49,"The struggle will be with the teacher's unions....that's certainly true here in Hawaii, where we have the lowest per capita case rate of any state in the nation, and have been well within the promulgated standards for at least a return to hybrid learning for months.   And with our private schools largely back to full time learning for months with precautions and no significant clusters.  This as we watch our two elementary school children struggle both educationally and mental health wise as they lose nearly a year of learning.  
Our next biggest fear:  our teachers will refuse the vaccine and will demand zero community transmission as the standard, no in person school in 2021.    
You can't have a rationale, science based argument with our teacher's union here in the Aloha State..."

Teachers will need to do the same.

The right to organize is recognized as a fundamental right in the UN Charter (thank you, especially, Eleanor!). And the significance in the right to organize rests ultimately in the right of workers to engage in concerted action--to strike. The right to strike is a human right. 

NB, Medical residents are organizing--i.e., young physicians are forming union locals, with real power, in the face of a culture of abuse. 

What does this tell you, dear reader (and dear NYT pundits), about the work conditions of these 'essential professionals'--nurses, teachers, MDs? 

Why are physician suicide rates so high relative to the rest of the population?

Think about it."
2020-12-15 17:11:23,"Teachers should be vaccinated against COVID quickly and all the kids back to school full time. But, this must include testing for COVID to guard against the virus being acquired out of schools."

She claims COVID isn't spreading in schools (Really? Because I get several email notifications a week about it spreading in the school I teach at), but then mentions offhand at the end periodic closures and quarantine, which are obviously due to positive cases. 

Most teachers I know are working in-person at least 50% of the time, but based on how teachers have been mistreated this year-on top of the usual level of being overworked and underpaid-I cannot imagine why anyone would choose to go into this profession."
2020-12-15 16:45:16,"""If Teachers Get the Vaccine Quickly, Can Students Get Back to School?"" Of course not. Teachers union will then come up with some other great idea for why teachers can not teach and students have to spend 5 - 6 hours a day in front of the screen being ""safe"". Keeping elementary school children in particular glued to the screen for 5 - 6 hour a day should be a criminal offense... Especially for poorer minority kids with unstable families and children with disabilities.

From what I know, most elementary schools are open outside of the US. But here, the Teachers Union seems to only care about teachers, not their students. That is why I think that public sector unions are really useless and counter productive."
2020-12-15 16:49:35,"I'm appalled by the attacks on teachers and unions in these comments. Shame on all you people. I would have thought the last 9 months of at home teaching would increase appreciation of teachers, but obviously not.

Let's not lose sight of who's unconscionably poor leadership got us to this point. The fact that bars and the NFL were prioritized ahead of schools pretty much sums up American values."

Now that everyone knows educators are central to a functioning economy, will the profession be treated as such and paid accordingly?

Resentment about union representation sounds a lot like complaints about universal healthcare. We all wish we had it, or think we don’t need it, except when its most necessary.

Anyone who thinks the NYT is “leftist” ought to research the majority of what it publishes about unions and education. It’s decidedly right of center on these issues."
2020-12-15 16:43:36,"School is so obviously the big superspreader event.  Just look at the graph of cases - dropping as schools closed, and soaring when they re-opened in September.
True, children and (maybe) adolescents aren't so hard hit by the virus, but they can pass it on, to families and fellow party-goers in the college towns, as was observed in an article here a few days ago.
As for the purportedly horrendous effects of not attending school, if they truly exist, they pale in contrast to continuing the plague...for how long?
And is skipping school so very bad for kids?  Not all did that well in schools; is it possible that the ones who were successful there can make up learning in a year or two?
I don't envy anyone trying to balance work and children during this trying period - it is difficult even in normal times, but returning to those normal times as soon as possible is in everyone's best interest."

My wife's urban East Bay district did  a family survey in early October--  when the community rate of spread was much lower-- and fully 50% of families responding stated they preferred to continue distance learning.  All students were provided Chrome books and hot spots and they're getting 180 minutes of live teaching each morning so distance learning is more than just a sham exercise.  These are mostly poor families cramped in multi-generational households and they're afraid their kids will be vectors bringing the disease home to older family members.  It's not just teachers who are afraid of spending all day, five days a week, in small poorly ventilated rooms with up to 35 sets of lungs sharing the same air.  Don't blame the unions."
2020-12-15 16:15:42,"Actual teacher checking in. 

Union bashing and  teacher blaming aside...I think people forget the biggest barrier to reopening fully is the constant disruption caused by the quartentines. My school was in person since September and we were hanging on by a thread because teachers and students were constantly coming in and out of quartentines. 
This is a high school setting so students change classes. Therefore, one COVID positive student can put ten or so staff members out forteen days at a clip. We had to go full virtual last week because there was an outbreak among the cafeteria staff. No cafeteria means (legally) we cannot have students in the building. 
If vaccinating teachers and staff reduces the quarantine load (along with masks and distancing) I think full in person school is appropriate and manageable. Granted this would only work if the vaccine does not turn everyone into a asymptomatic super spreader. 
Teachers are suffering, students are suffering, parents are suffering. We have to try something. Medical workers first of course!"

My children have contracted many viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections from school.  It has never been as clean as a Level 4 Biosafety Lab.  With a vaccine, COVID becomes a preventable disease and we can carry on living normal lives again - including teachers teaching kids in person in schools."
2020-12-15 16:23:15,"We are so elated to have a covid vaccine, people forget what has been often reported in the news: it is not known if vaccination prevents transmission. This will be known in time;  until then,  I wonder how giving teachers shots makes schools any safer. 

As explained in a UC San Francisco Grand Grounds video on the web, covid vaccines prevent symptoms of the disease. There remains the possibility of persons without symptoms being able to transmit the virus. That is why masks will still be required. 

Here's the opening sentences from U Washington News 12/2/20; ""Excitement and relief over news of vaccines that help prevent people from getting sick, winding up in the hospital or dying from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, are warranted, says University of Washington’s Dr. Larry Corey. But, these messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines may not prevent people from getting infected or spreading the virus.""

2020-12-15 18:06:52,"Since the vaccines require two shots administered one month apart, and time should be allowed for possible side effects, etc, it doesn’t seem at all feasible for schools to open before well into spring.  At that point it would simply make sense either to declare this entire school year one of so many complications that mandated tests should be cancelled, any student who needs extra help or repeat classes to be able to do so without any detriment to their grades.  It would also make good sense, if schools reopen in the spring, to continue school throughout the summer and through next year with short vacation breaks only.  Let everyone catch up.  The vaccine availability and the logistics of delivering it will not be sufficient to get teacher and student populations vaccinated quickly.  Let’s not be silly."

The reality of in-person teaching is distracted teachers. It’s impossible to do two things at once, and that’s exactly what we tasked to do. The result: significantly poorer educational quality. Oh, and most of the teachers have contracted COVID and been out for long stretches with no subs. 

Yes, I believe those of us teaching in person deserve early access. No, I dont believe high schools are safe. The data is not conclusive. 

I’m truly happy for teachers that have been able to teach remotely and believe at least the older kids will be better off. Let’s stop the union  bashing: the grass is really not greener in person"

2020-12-15 21:29:54,"Nowhere in this article is there mention of the safety of students and their families. I am a high school teacher in a school attended by 4000  students in a predominantly working class district that has been hit hard by COVID-19. Many of my students live in multi-generational homes with older relatives. Many are also essential workers who contribute to their household income. The district has stayed with remote learning, despite intense pressure from the state to reopen, in order to keep people safe.

While the data points to schools not being superspreaders,  there have been over 4000 cases among staff and students in MA schools since September. 

I am very much looking forward to receiving my 2 shots and getting back into the classroom, most likely in a hybrid model with masks and social distancing. A full in-person return would be too risky for my students and their families."

2020-12-15 22:36:05,"Wow, a lot of these comments would make a person think that Americans believe it is important for children to go to school.

Too bad that schools are NEVER a priority except during a pandemic when people need babysitters for their kids.

INSIST that your legislators make public schools a priority, instead of allowing charter and religious schools to steal their funding. 

Let’s see ALL school buildings renovated, class sizes reduced, elimination of criminal profiteering by textbook/testing/curriculum companies and technology companies, teachers paid a professional wage, and sufficient actual nurses, social workers, counselors, custodians, and specialists hired so that teachers can go back to teaching and not be expected to fix every problem in our society.

To all of you who rant about teacher unions, spend some time in your local schools and see what it’s really like to be a teacher these days. You have no idea.

I’ve been a teacher for more than 30 years, in rural, urban, international, and Japanese schools. The American school system is a disgrace, and it’s NOT because of unions or teachers, the vast majority of whom are hard working, dedicated, and exhausted.

It’s because some people are trying to turn it into a for-profit system, just like healthcare.

“It will be a great day when our schools have all the money they need, and our air force has to have a bake-sale to buy a bomber.” Robert Fulghum

We still have plenty of bombers but few well functioning public schools."
2020-12-15 22:24:10,"I understand everyone's desire to get all the kids back in school.  I also appreciate the risks assumed by our teachers.  Bumping them up in vaccine priority benefits the larger community.  BUT, if that is done without including ALL the educational support staff, you will have accomplished nothing.

Educational support staff (cafeteria, janitorial, etc) face the same level of risk, but are often members of an older age cohort, often employed part-time without sick days or health insurance and are trying to survive on much less income than teachers.  When these folks get sick, they are still coming to work - because they have no other choice.

As a school bus driver, all of the above apply to me.  AND, I'm mandated to let every child on board and drive around in a confined space for an extended time without any feasible way to enforce social distancing.  I continue to do this for the kids and the benefit of our smaller community.  But if we move forward with priority vaccinations for teachers and exclude lower echelon educational support staff, good luck with that plan."
2020-12-15 23:21:49,"As a public school teacher, I read this article with interest, and I read the comments with dismay. I am eager for good advice about when it is safe to conduct school and how teaching should look in the middle of a pandemic, but appalled that so many Americans find my fear about returning to the classroom to be a political ploy or some plot to avoid working.

I have been teaching online since the pandemic hit in March. It's rough. I feel lonely and isolated, the kids are so much less responsive online than in person, and I feel like I'm reinventing the wheel every day with limited success. I love my kids, miss them, worry about them.
l too well what happens when a life threatening disease takes over. I'm terrified of covid. What's more, the students are reporting about parties, vacations, dinners with extended families, sports practices in leagues that travel around the country. I hear stories of mask skepticism. I hear about older siblings, home from college with covid . I hear about deaths of grandparents from covid. I love ""my"" kids, but if these are their behaviors, how is it safe to return?

I am looking for scientific rationales for returning. I can't wait to be back in the classroom teaching in person. But I cannot believe that I'm selfish for wanting to protect my own life, hesitant to return yet. This article helped me to see how that might be possible, but until society at large and my students in general follow public health advice, returning seems risky."
2020-12-15 20:58:13,"What makes you think anyone will get vaccinated quickly?  The way this crisis has been handled it could be a year before we see the shot.  Last time I checked the formula NYT put out there’s 118,987,000 people ahead of me in line."

2020-12-16 01:37:14,"Actual teacher here. 

Our school started the year in hybrid mode, which was very difficult but safe. Now we are fully back, though parents can choose to stay remote. I spend 7 hours a day trying to keep kids six feet apart and being the mask police. Not to mention teaching! We have had quite a few cases - both adults and kids - and when teachers are sick we have to scramble for willing subs. 

The vaccine will potentially allow more schools to open and convince more families to attend in person. That’s what students need. Please give teachers the vaccine ASAP for the benefit of all our communities."
2020-12-16 01:57:35,"There really isn't any good reason for kids to go back to school, schools have provided the needed technology for their students. People going back to school will just cause cases to rise as there are hundreds of people in a close distance. Till cases die down and vaccines are available for everyone to have I do not think it is safe for anyone to go back to school. It is not proven that the vaccine will work for anyone and everyone. Even say if the vaccine becomes available it seems these days lots of people like to refuse to do things they don't agree with even though it is better for them. I for one enjoy being in the comfort of my own home where materials are easily accessible and I don't need permission for small and simple things like going to the bathroom. I've had many teachers that would only lets their students go to the bathroom on 2 times a year! Being at home feels safe I am around the same people everyday ensuring that I do not get the virus."
2020-12-14 12:40:09,"I feel sorry for folks who have been laid off during this pandemic. The Congress should have renewed generous benefits “for the duration,” as a generation less selfish and partisan than ours would have put it.

So when this mess is over, I hope we can consider what is truly necessary. We do not need sports, vacations to exotic places, cruise ships, theme parks, restaurant meals, movie theaters, gyms, or bars. It is fine to want them. I’m not a sports fan and I exercise at home, but I love travel, going out for a meal, and sitting at the bar with my friends. These are cravings, however, not needs.

We have confused want and need to our peril, when we should have an economy built upon a foundation of making durable goods domestically and growing food locally by folks paid real wages and with portable health care benefits that survive layoffs. Except for construction, our economy seems based upon entertainment or making money from financial instruments. 

None of that is sustainable and it’s not Trumpism to call for more domestic manufacturing and local, small ag. Very little of what we now have builds wealth for the lower 90%. None of it survives the first shock with recessions or a pandemic. Imagine the shock we have when we again fight a major war with another major power. That will happen."
2020-12-14 13:00:51,"It is sad to see all those jobs ancillary to the professional sports leagues devastated, as they have been
Perhaps, it would not have been as catastrophic  if those overpaid, overhyped, spoiled professional athletes were not so self centered and greedy. Rather than protest and complain, had they shown some humility and understanding, perhaps the fan base would have been more loyal.
This is on the MSM, as well. For, it is the MSM that decides what is important, how to skew the presentation.
The fact that these over appreciated, overpaid, underwhelming professional athletes are allowed, with the help of the MSM, to control the political, social and emotional narrative, is beyond reproachable. 
Unfortunately, this has alienated a large portion of their fan base.    
These professional athletes, with their bully pulpit and multi million dollar contracts, preach from their multi million dollar homes, many in gated communities, while these ancillary workers suffer and try and figure out how to pay their rent and utility bills.

It did not have to be like this. 

Had the country’s leadership encouraged us all to think of minimizing each other’s suffering, while it used the federal and state tools we’d put in place (and paid for), this could have been avoided. 

Instead our leaders made political calculations using people’s lives as their poker chips and prioritizing short term impressions, over our safety and livelihood. 

It is a pity too many of us who are now out of work, whose company’s and indeed sectors of our economy are tanking still cannot (or refuse to) see they have been rolled by these cynical politicians and their oligarchical sponsors. 

While we suffer and die, while our kids schooling suffers and while we lose our businesses and houses, politicians continue to be paid, and we still contribute millions to support their lost causes.

The same leaders who downplayed the virus’s danger and ignored the crisis in its early stages are now first in line to receive the vaccine and the best medical care available. And yet we blindly follow the politicians still.

They can ramble on for hours about the $120Million Athletic department budget, while oblivious to the $7Billion operation which is the University.  Thus, the concept of making the area attractive to new academic and research employees is very secondary to a Chamber of Commerce (CC).

Similar problems with movies.  With music.  With performance of many of the arts.  Even viewing museums and galleries has been affected.

I hope that readers will take this as an indicator of just how bad this virus is for us.  How bad the US was managed (mismanaged) during the whole pandemic, compared to other, less publicized, countries where things aren't perfect but many more citizens alive and fewer internal jobs lost.

Yet we read of those headstrong who are defying common sense guidelines and even emergency orders to gather and put many others at risk.

It didn't have to be this way.  We had a written set of directions how to deal with the next pandemic. Many would have been infected, died, or left with residua, of course, but not to the extent they have been.  There was a time when we did things inconvenient to us, because they were a price to live in our society.  My serving as a doctor on a Navy ship for two years was inconvenient to me, but someone needed to fill the billet, and I was that someone.  Life happens. At least I wasn't shot at.

We as a country could have believed what was happening; we could have done sensible, frankly easy things to mitigate it; state and national leaders could have worked together to limit the harm by passing appropriate legislation to help. We could have recognized that the scientists were learning along with the rest of us, and been patient with the time needed to understand what we needed to do.

There was also a time when not everyone had a megaphone, and words in print had to pass through an editor in order to be seen. 

What is especially sad is that the victims of the virus, whether their livelihood or their lives, have been let down by those who with the power to change our response for the better, instead squandered it in the name of rights, money, votes, and occasionally wanton hatred."

Along with my colleagues, we were a big, smiling family. I can do without the hero worship and commercialism, and those calls from my editor requesting portraits of this player or that. Too often those players had become newsworthy because of spousal abuse or charges of sexual assault. 

The the pandemic hit. Ushers were laid off. The stadiums fell silent, aside from the synthesized sounds of fans. The seats were filled with flat cutouts, sometimes modeled after real fans.

Gambling has taken over sports today;  listen to any sports talk radio or TV show and every two minutes there's an ad for FanDuel, DraftKings, MGM, and a thousand other bookies eager to take your money.  Even GOLF is being bet on and is the next explosive growth area for these bookies.  NYC's old sports talk radio station, WFAN, is owned by Entercom, which is fast becoming a gambling provider.  Fans in stadiums are a thing of the past.  It's all gambling - on anything: coin toss, next shot, next hole.

2020-12-14 18:14:09,"If anyone still believed in the oxymoron ""student athlete"" this would be the year that it is seen for what it, a total sham whereby schools use unpaid labor to reap billions so that guy like Nick Saban can make $7.5M a year and Disney, via ESPN and ABC, can pocket billions. The wag who said college sports was a business that just borrows a school's name was quite correct. Concern for a player's education, well being or health is secondary to making money.

Out in the West the Pac-12 which first flinched when students at WSU, now one of the sickest campuses, demanded to be paid, insured, and promised long term health care past graduation if they were sickened. However they conference cynically realized that if they played a minimum of games to collect their revenue from the media they would play and not worry about the consequences. However the cancelled games and willingness to report sickness in the Pac-12 pales in comparison to the SEC which plays on no matter who gets ill, and in states like Florida stadiums have been filled to capacity.  

Maybe when this is all said and done college athletics will decide to compensate and insure properly their ""so called"" student athletes, and maybe the plague will have had a silver lining."

2020-12-14 18:36:28,I live on the border between Minnesota and Wisconsin.  Minnesota restaurants and bars are currently closed for indoor service.  Wisconsin's are not.  The other day I drove over to Wisconsin in the early evening.  Every bar and restaurant that I went by had many cars in the parking lot.  Some were Minnesota cars but many had Wisconsin plates.  Are these places open on game days for patrons?  It isn't all bad.
2020-12-14 18:45:14,"In my past, I worked at one of the bars near Miller Park.  The months of April - September are crucial as this is the time the area restaurants, bars, servers and bartenders make enough to carry them through the slower months when the Brewers aren't playing.  The impact of no MLB is exponential - loss of hours, loss of wages, less spending throughout the community.  Owners and employees also missed out on the bonus games of having a 2021 hometown playoff team (despite a sub .500 record - another oddity in this strange time).  The 2018 playoffs and the Summer months prior were some gravy days to be serving wings and slinging drinks.

Additionally, Milwaukee and the triangle from Green Bay to Madison to Chicago and back missed out on ten of millions of dollars more with the loss of the 2021 DNC.  Huge investments in infrastructure and accommodations were made.   New bars and restaurants were built specifically with this in mind.  So many private events and hotel/Air BnB reservations canceled. 

I believe the Brewers, Bucks, Packers and Badgers will come out battered, but still operating.  Deep pockets allow for that.  Unfortunately, the small-business owner won't be as lucky.  From what I have been told, it has been brutal.   There is still a long way to go."

Why not have stadiums open at 5 - 15% capacity, and only those under a certain age are allowed entry? (Before you say ""age discrimination"", theme parks have height/weight requirements, another immutable character trait, in the name of health/safety.) These stadiums are cavernous - people should safely be able to watch the game 20 feet away from other fans. Not to say that football is so important, but people's livelihoods certainly are."

2020-12-12 03:42:17,"Could the NY Times reporting explain why the Pfizer Vaccine should not have been the second one approved and used as a backup since Moderna says its vaccine candidate is stable at regular freezer temperature — minus 20 degrees Celsius — for up to six months, and after thawing it can last in the refrigerator for 30 days. It can also be kept at room temperature for up to 12 hours. It is also useful for health care workers in the field because the vaccine doesn't need to go in and out of the refrigerator each time it's administered.
Is it all a timing issue for the total number of vaccines needed from both manufacturers?"

2020-12-12 04:08:14,"While this is progress (albeit with unnecessary political pressure that will prompt suspicion among some people), the number of doses doesn't nearly address the crisis we now face. 100 million doses by March makes only 50 million immunized individuals (all above the age of 16). The Moderna vaccine will add more, but not as many as needed. It's an amazing accomplishment in the history of vaccine development, for which we should all be grateful.

We could be more grateful if the Trump administration had bent its emergency powers for commandeering manufacturing to supply more doses, more PPE for front line individuals and for the rest of us.

We could be even more grateful if the President and his associates had taken steps early on and recently to encourage mask wearing and simply precautions. Perhaps, then, 3,000 people would not have died today. That's more than died at Pearl Harbor, and yet Trump has let it pass entirely unnoticed.

No wonder the public is ambivalent about it. And the vaccine requires two doses, greatly increasing the chances people won't complete it effectively. And what about distribution to rural areas? -94 degrees is a difficult temperature to maintain, even in medical labs. Unless these problems are ameliorated, COVID-19 will remain a public health crisis for a long time."

This White House pressure campaign, after months of misdirection and prevarication, serves no real purpose except to give folks who want to doubt an excuse not to trust the vaccine (because the development was rushed, politicized, and approved on an emergency basis). As for myself, I trust the FDA and its scientists, and I'm hoping to get this vaccine as soon as possible."
2020-12-12 04:21:31,"Regarding Moderna, the FDA needs to pre-prepare the EUA paperwork right away. The FDA put a 3 week roadblock in Moderna’s path, according to the Wall Street Journal, to examine the trial pool, instead of permitting Moderna scientists to move ahead at the brisk pace they are capable of.  Given that 3000 people per day are tragically dying each day in the US, it’s important that paperwork specialists at the FDA get out of the way of the genuinely first class scientists at Moderna.  Outside panel advising FDA re Moderna should meet in 3 days, not 6 days."

      2. It was not Pfizer but its partner, BioNtech that developed the vaccine.

       3. BioNTech is a German company NOT an American company.

        4. The founders, owners and chief scientists of BioNTech are Turkish immigrants and are Muslims.

        So Trump is taking credit for the work of Muslims whom he wants to ban from entering the USA. Totally disgraceful!!"
2020-12-12 05:14:17,"Could we do antibody testing before giving these vaccines? It is pointless to give these vaccines to those already previously infected, which is close 70 million projected Americans (they already have immunity as good as that from the vaccines). Yes, some of those previously infected could potentially get re-infected, but so can 5% of those who get the vaccines. 

Then, with enough supplies already secured by the US government to inoculate 150 million Americans (200 million does from Moderna and 100 million from Pfizer), all needed American adults could have the vaccines between these alone by the end of first quarter 2021, with enough for 20 million people to spare. 

This will also lead to fewer deaths given initial shortage, and stop the spread of the virus faster. 

No need to jockey to be first in line, or favor one group over another, and no need to make those who don't need the vaccine suffer side effects."
2020-12-12 05:23:43,"Wonderful. But I cringed at statements made in FDA testimony like ""the four incidences of Bells Palsy in the vaccinated group were not likely related to the vaccine;"" and journalist pronouncements that Bells Palsy is condition that presents as ""a temporary paralysis.""  Perhaps the incidence of BP within the vaccinated group falls within the statistical norm of rate of occurrence within the general population in normal times. But that does not mean it was not related to the vaccine: Viral inflammation is a known cause of BP, and in socially distant tints like these, how much natural exposure to other viruses is there? Yes, the rate of BP incidence is low, but it's there in fact.  Finally, I don't know anyone who has had Bells Palsy who didn't pray daily that it would finally subside, and some prayed in vain."

By further politicizing the approval of the vaccine  by the final arbiter in such matters, namely, the FDA,   he may, in fact, be, deliberately, stoking the skepticism and anti- vaccination sentiment already prevalent among his base, thereby, making the task of achieving hard immunity through vaccinating the requisite percentage of the population extremely difficult.

IMHO this will become a moot point very soon. Once the public sees that the drug is safe and effective, people will flock to get the shot. Yes, there will always be those who will never take any vaccine, but that has nothing to do with this specific vaccine; that is just their own mentality or opinions of vaccines in general.

Mark my words, by the summer, 80% of Americans will say they have or will be willing to take it."
2020-12-12 12:35:18,"Per Pfizer...""Most Americans wouldn’t be able to get vaccinated before spring or summer, because Pfizer needs time to make enough doses.""

B, thermal probe records temperature, that's it. The box itself doesn't have any means to adjust for fluctuations in the temperature, like a cooling system, or liquid nitrogen backup. Best case scenario is that at the receiving end people would know if the shipment was compromised or not. What we wouldn't know is how the vaccine is handled afterwards. Was it moved to the -80 freezer right away, kept on dry ice, reconstituted properly, etc. And here you'd have to rely on people paying attention and understanding what they are doing."
2020-12-12 13:33:09,I found it quite interesting that Thermo King began ramping up production of its new freezer units at a facility in China a few months ago that will distribute the Pfizer vaccine doses due to the temperature storage requirements.  So now the US Army has to handle the logistics of Chinese made freezer units.  Does Donald Trump know about this fiasco.  So much for MAGA when the country can't even manufacture freezer units in their own country from a USA owned company.
2020-12-12 13:43:47,"I used to get the flu every year like clockwork. Sometimes twice in 12 months. Then my doctor advised me to take the flu shot. That was 6 years ago. I've taken it each year since and been flu free 6 years running.

If my doctor says take the covid shot I will take the covid shot as soon as it is made available to me. And be secure in the knowledge this pandemic is over for me."
2020-12-12 13:45:02,"It rankles my respect for the FDA approval process for a mind as small as our President’s to pressure serious, life-long scientists to rush through the final review of a new vaccine which is intended for tens to hundreds of million people. The minute data details required along with hours of double check and a third check for validation of the resultant basis for approval.
As in so many disciplines, our President fails to honor process with purpose which is the cornerstone of the Advisory Board review and recommendations followed by reviews within FDA for final approval. These procedures and replication of reviews by credentialed scientists with teams of support are somewhat cumbersome by design. The design circumvents disaster and has done so for at least half a century.
Is it frustrating for those in need of the vaccine? Absolutely. The FDA’s mission has little to do with expediency and much to do in the prevention of a human catastrophe. For a man such as Trump to denigrate this intellectually demanding rigor is akin to an observer heckling a surgeon. His absence of expertise or even  respect for expertise is gobsmacking. That Hahn responded with an earlier than planned approval, even by hours, is a dangerous embarrassment."
2020-12-12 13:45:08,"This article fails to acknowledge the hundreds of basic scientists who, over the past many decades, have provided the pioneering molecular biological information that allowed all of these clinical advancements to occur.  Without them we would be nowhere."
2020-12-12 13:47:54,this issue--sufficient funding for the vaccine rollout effort--should be front and center in georgia's senate races. a democratic-controlled senate is absolutely essential when it comes to ending the pandemic and supporting those who have lost their livelihoods until they can get on their feet again.
2020-12-12 13:49:25,"What does ""Emergency use"" mean for a vaccine which is meant to be preventative? Is this approved as a drug?"
2020-12-12 09:09:27,"Thanks to all the scientists who made it possible!!!!

But..... 

Trump wants to take credit for a vaccine that he did NOT backed up (therefore he declined to purchase enough of them) and which solves a problem he spent a year denying it existed. 

His supporters of course will forget they pointed a gun to those who wanted to do something about it and will cook some idiotic reason on why dear leader saved the day....

Go Figure!"
2020-12-12 09:11:24,That’s really hilarious when  the vaccine was approved in the UK few weeks before USA that  hooked man on celebrity A Fauci  criticised  and mocking the UK health agencies approval  now the USA ok the vaccine because of people like him normal people  loose trust in the scientists

He set the gold standard on how to ""perform a miracle"" with a vaccine on all fronts from inventing it to promoting it etc. etc. without hi tech computers.

A big obstacle for the current vaccine is the damage done by ego maniac demagogue moron Trump who could not see it thru if the solution was handed to him."
2020-12-12 13:21:40,"Mr. Trump told Dr. Hahn on Twitter on Friday morning to “stop playing games and start saving lives!!!” Thus the alternative universe ""hero"" narrative for 2024 begins. Trump's cult followers will eat it up...so long as they survive his Covid winter."

How ironic that Donald Trump is  suddenly interested in saving lives by using vaccines he hopes will burnish his pandemic legacy.

It would have been wonderful if he'd taken Covid seriously, setting an example for his allies and followers instead of turning common sense safety and prevention behaviors into a huge political culture war.  

So many needless deaths, and now he talks about saving lives so he can take credit for them?  My God, his hypocrisy knows no boundaries."

2020-12-12 07:03:54,"Why does the article call it the Pfizer vaccine? Because Trump calls it so? I hope the NYT is aware that Pfizer paid for the trail while a German company developed the vaccine. No development of the material, no successful trial."
2020-12-12 12:37:37,Why are the number of doses per state so variable?  Is this accurate?  I thought it was based on population.  This is referenced in next article. What is going on??
2020-12-12 12:47:42,"Emergency Use Authorization of the Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is legal and scientific evidence and proof that the vaccine has not been finally and fully been determined to be safe and effective in all people.

Science does not know how kong the antibody reaction lasts.  Nor if the antibody reaction prevents spread or symptoms of COVID-19. Nor if the antibody reaction prevents long term damage to other organs like the brain, heart and kidneys.

 Moreover the extreme cold and lsrge batch manufacturing technique requirements present natural logistical and economic challenges 

COVID-19 aka novel coronavirus-19 aka SARS-2 aka COV-SARS-2 is still mostly an infectious disease mystery to humanity 's best doctors and scientists.

Unfortunately a majority of Americans are scientifically ignorant and illiterate.   While a significant minority are scientifically stupid. Ignorance can be cured. Stupidity is fatally terminal."
2020-12-12 13:08:33,"The headline for the article, as shown on the main page, is incorrect. The Pfizer vaccine has not been “approved.”  It has been granted emergency use authorization; full approval would be granted after Pfizer submits additional long term safety and efficacy data, which can take a year or more."
2020-12-12 13:39:44,So is it safe? Or is it safe because Mark Meadows said so?
2020-12-12 13:44:55,Thank you president trump for the vaccines! You cared for American people while facing a Russia style misinformation campaign from Biden and media. Thank you for saving lives while Dems played politics on COVID deaths and carnage. Their pre election lies are now exposed as Biden also expressed confidence in the Vaccines developed under Trump’s leadership.
2020-12-12 14:18:15,"Meanwhile over on Fox News they are talking about the next step to ensuring President Trumps re-election and how democrats are going to defund the police.

No mention about the virus- their response is that people die and this is not real.

Free speech is one thing- sedition and treason is quite another."
2020-12-12 06:57:31,"The vaccine has been approved today in Mexico too, those are really good news!. The real aim is that all the people in the front row, get it as soon as possible."
2020-12-12 10:41:52,"This is truly amazing,  it's too bad our government (POTUS) did not react this quickly when the virus was first emerging and didn't practice social distancing and mask wearing."
2020-12-12 06:31:03,"The Trump administration has botched the handling of every aspect of the pandemic response.  This vaccine rollout will be no different, starting with a gross shortage of vaccines. The Trump administration wants responsibility for nothing and credit for everything. 

It's not surprising that neither Pfizer nor Moderna attended Trump's kiss the ring vaccine party.  God help us.  I wish they'd next create a vaccine to cure political cancer and give it to Trump and the grifting members of his awful family."
2020-12-12 07:19:22,"Call me crazy or label me an anti vaxxer but I don’t trust known corrupt companies that make a lot of money and pay no liability, with my life. 

“Pfizer had to pay court settlements from lawsuits filed against them by patients and accusations of illegal marketing. The most expensive settlement that Pfizer has paid was over $2.3 billion paid as a fine to resolve civil and criminal penalties of illegal marketing for four medications including Bextra, Geodon, Zyvox, and Lyrica."
2020-12-12 13:20:04,Happy to see the FDA caved to Trump's threat and moved up their approval a couple of hours. It adds to their recent string of heroic actions in the face of the big orange.
2020-12-12 13:58:26,"Pfizer Inc.’s vaccine had plenty of people in Washington lining up to take credit.

But their funding came from Berlin, not Washington. Partner BioNTech received $445m  from German government.

Operation Warp Speed agreed to buy vaccine doses if approved."
2020-12-12 07:13:53,"But wait -- I thought Glorious Leader, since March, has been publically proclaiming that the virus would just go away.  Now, he 
had Mark Meadows pressure the head of the FDA to approve the vaccine tonight (Friday) or be fired.  Is not the person occupying the White House a person of honor?  Was he lying all these months about the severity of the pandemic?  
Now he is also trying to take credit for actually creating the vaccine?  The research for which was started early in the year?  This is indeed a petty man with a petty mind.  He will leave the office that he has disgraced in so many ways for the last four years on the 20th of January and will hopefully slowly recede into history's quicksand."
2020-12-12 10:29:16,THANK YOU Dr. Hahn for following the SCIENCE.
2020-12-12 13:49:24,"Yesterday I watched a 30-minute Columbia U Public Health Event on COVID that featured Dr. Anthony Fauci. One take-away was that COVID is the third highly pathogenic corona virus - SARS, MERS and now COVID - to have emerged in the past two decades.  Dr. Fauci noted that we need, not merely a COVID vaccine, but a broad-spectrum vaccine to treat all corona viruses. To me, that meant that COVID is not the last, but merely latest and most contagious, corona virus to emerge. SARS and MERS are far more deadly than COVID - unbelievable, given the death toll and misery, to think “we got lucky this time.”  I hope that our administrations, both parties, pay attention to Fauci and other epidemiologists’ warnings, because I sure don’t want to go through this year of Hades again."
2020-12-12 09:10:16,"Why did the FDA take so long . Good for trump to pressure them in this situation...if the UK already approved air and everyone knew we were going to approve it and thousands dying dialysis, why did they not move faster? (Ps didn’t vote for Trump but approve of his actions around the vaccine)"
2020-12-12 12:14:21,"""... all while keeping the vaccine at ultracold temperatures.""
Please stop using such ridiculous unscientific jargon to make the process sound difficult.
The temperature at which the vaccine must be stored is maintained by ordinary dry ice.
For certain, the process of distributing and administering the vaccine will be difficult.  But not for this reason."
2020-12-12 13:36:25,"Should nursing home residents be a priority?
Nursing home residents how they are called are not old and sick. If you have Medicare and Medicaid most likely you can be admitted to a nursing home with minimal care. If you are incapacitated and with Medicare Medicaid, you can be admitted for care, if you had surgery and need rehabilitation also you can be admitted. But those who are old sick and have to stay home are not first priority. Yes the Government made a mistake sending back to a nursing home the patients with COVID but a mistake should not make a priority"
2020-12-12 07:01:35,When did Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine became Pfizer vaccine?
2020-12-12 09:16:09,"Just the excuse Anti-Vaxxers needed. ""Ordered distributed by Trump, the well-known medical expert, expedited by a compliant doctor/official afraid of losing his job.  I'm not taking that!"""
2020-12-12 13:30:40,"Since the election cycle is over and he won, Biden has expressed confidence in the vaccine even though Washpost has reported pressure on FDA chief for a quick approval. During the campaign, Dems created doubts about the vaccine in people’s minds. the dirty politics that they played over public health is going to haunt them as many people will hesitate to take the vaccines. I think Biden and Harris should say sorry for doubting the vaccines and take the vaccine themselves first to set an example. Thanks to Trump, we developed an effective vaccine in record speed while Biden and anti Trump establishment was busy toppling his government. Obviously journalists will never ask him tough questions as they have ditched journalistic ethics for agenda pushing so he will be OK on that front but people will not be silent."
2020-12-12 12:03:58,"This whole rush to approve and distribute the virus is a farce and a political move on the part of the Trump administration. Even though he lost the election, he's trying to save face and score political points by rushing the vaccines approval. It's all about him and looking the hero instead of the goat. He's trying to steal some of Biden's thunder of winning, by using the vaccine as a political weapon. The vaccine shouldn't be politicized. It should be about delivering a safe and effective vaccine to the public. Not about who did it first."
2020-12-12 12:50:22,"Trump behaves like he is the chief executive officer of the Executive Branch of the federal government, and as such, has both authority and responsibility over and for the employees and their actions of those employed by the Executive Branch.  This is a quaint ancient position, similar to the concept of absolute monarchy.  Its time past long ago.  Like modern monarch, as it relates to Federal Agencies of the Executive Branch, the President is not a boss, but rather an advisor and persuader, more analogous to the parents of adult children.  Literally ordering these employees to do something or be fired is soooo inappropriate.  Joe Biden understands this proper role and will defer to his experts."
2020-12-12 14:03:50,"Although unlikely, the MSM should acknowledge President Trump's forceful efforts to accelerate the development of the new vaccines and his push of the FDA to speedily approve these new drugs. Other than China and Russia no one else claims to have developed comparable vaccines,  The effort in the UK at Oxford University was a farce.  So thank you President Trump and America should acknowledge and applaud his efforts."
2020-12-12 14:38:33,"Good, FDA has given authorization to Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine to be administered  to people. Here a problem. In case, if  people develops complications/side effects after administering the vaccine, which I pray should not happen, then who will take the responsibility? How to handle such complications/side effects? Any plans?"
2020-12-12 14:43:57,The vaccine production should be taken up by any decent sized pharmaceutical company and produce as much doses as possible.
2020-12-12 14:55:31,Where are publicly-available links to the data the FDA used to give this vaccine emergency authorization? That information would be a helpful addendum to this article.
2020-12-12 03:46:14,"Amazing news. Thank you to all the scientist who made this possible, those who created the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and its trial, as well as those who laid the groundwork for mRNA vaccine research years ago. As the New England Journal of Medicine published yesterday, this vaccine truly is ""a triumph"". And of course, the beginning of the end of one of the darkest, most miserable and hopeless periods of American history."
2020-12-12 15:04:25,"While I was also reluctant at first to take a vaccine that is promoted by this administration I took care of to many Covid patients in recent weeks and saw too much dying or projected long term disability. The risk benefit equation has thoroughly pivoted towards benefit for me.
The biggest irony however is that this is a vaccine developed by a Turkish immigrant to Germany and distributed by a company run by a guy from Greece who came to the US on a visa that this very administration tried everything to curtail."
2020-12-12 03:47:06,Trump threatened to fire the FDA Chief if he didn't approve the Pfizer vaccine today because he could.  Muddying the science with political pressure won't give Americans faith in the vaccine when we need all people to take it.
2020-12-12 06:00:54,How messed up is it that we still can't purchase N95 masks. Why was there no national mask project? Why is there so much confusion regarding testing? What happened to our country?

1.  Will the second vaccination be different than the first?  Or is it just more of the same that will stimulate a stronger immunological response?

2.  If I am vaccinated with one mfr's vaccine, can I get vaccinated with another mfr's vaccine?  Or must I remain with one mfr for both shots?  I'm 99% sure we need to stay with one mfr only, but 99% is not 100%.  

Thanks for your feedback."
2020-12-12 16:01:07,"Wow! I am amazed at the political tone of most comments posted here. Most indicate the inability to recognize this very good news while illustrating the continued focus on ""Trump did this"" or ""Trump should have done that"".   There is a group of people who refuse to acknowledge ANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS coming from this administration. I think that is very strange. I mean, I was certainly not a fan of Obama. However...when his administration did something good or something that I supported, I expressed my appreciation and support."

2020-12-12 14:26:41,"There is something very wrong with the list of how many doses each state expects to get:

NY expects 170K CA 2M, NC 175K in the first batch, TX, 1.4M
How is it possible that NY gets only 170K.  NY's population is about 1/2 of CA, 2/3 of TX and almost twice NC.

If CA is getting 2M than NY should be getting IM. 

 Please explain this?  Do NYers have to sue the Feds to get their fair share?"

2020-12-12 14:35:11,I'm 77 and not in the best of health.  I've been excited by the excellent work done by Pfizer in spite of Trump's refusal to order addition doses when offered.  Now I've become skeptical because of manner in which the F.D.A. has approved the vaccine.  I'm not sure Dr. Hahn and his board members were unbiased since Trump and his goons threatened to fire them if they didn't approve the drug immediately.  These gangster tactics make me nervous!
2020-12-12 14:39:59,"The folks who do not believe in science or taking preventive measures catch virus, become super spreaders, end up in intensive care and get mRNA vaccine!

2020-12-12 14:54:10,Where are publicly-available links to the data the FDA used to give this vaccine emergency authorization?
2020-12-12 15:07:05,"Everybody has questions and many have no answers to those questions. Much disinformation is being put out there because of this, and the larger push thru of mRNA as the solution to the virus. It's been a 'marketing' effort of epic proportions and it's being sold as a/the cure. And we are accepting this emergency mRNA with many of the questions and information still unknown. The biggest questions how long will the injection last, and when will the availability become available to actually 'cure' (if this works) people of contracting the virus. Do we know or don't we know? We do not. 

Is it because of a severe lockdown potential which would be the major inconvenience emotionally/economically to us all? Be honest to yourselves in answering this question. If one does not have their health, what do you not have?"
2020-12-12 15:42:34,Nothing inspires confidence in a still-largely untested vaccine for mass distribution than knowing that the approval process was short-circuited by an anti-science wannabe authoritarian whose idea of leadership is to threaten the person in charge of assuring the vaccine's safety. I'm sure Little Rocketman is very pleased his mentee is demonstrating strong leadership gestures. I think the ideology is called 'Juche'.

The phase 3 trials showed just what we were hoping for, the first dose demonstrated strong protection after 14 days.  It showed 90% efficacy from 14 days to 21 days.  That implies the Pfizer dosing was way to big and if we used a more appropriate dose with fewer side effects, then we have enough vaccine for 10 times the number of people at +90% efficacy.  Enough vaccine for nearly everyone in the America this month.  The problem with the fda was not the delay, it was approving the giant dose.  When the trials started, Pfizer has no idea how much was required. So they tested the largest dose that didn’t make people feel terrible.  The only downside to vaccinating tens times the number of people this month is we might have to do a third dose. However, the pandemic would still be over in 60 days.  Seems like an easy win."

So, to epidemiologists or armchair doomsayers, what is the worst case scenario if all hell went wrong with the vaccine and the rushed approval and trial came back to bite society bad? What would be a terrible outcome from a scientific perspective?"
2020-12-12 18:14:25,"It's so cute how Trump does next to nothing as President for 4 years, has done less than nothing for the COVID pandemic, and then decides he wants to ""take charge"" on pushing for the vaccine to be approved ahead of FDA reviews since the vaccines are apparently his doing.

He needs to be reminded that Pfizer wasn't part of Operation Warp Speed.  OWS is technically a government program, I guess, but he may have missed that detail (as well as the vast majority of other details) in the one or two meetings he attended before deciding to quit and play golf a few months ago.  

When it comes to OWS, it should be noted that the one company that was not part of his program is the one that beat all the others.  So, like most things in Trump's Administration, the project that they were responsible for actually performed worse than if they didn't do anything at all.

I'm looking forward to seeing how these next months out of office go for him.  His incompetence in business will be what comes to the foreground next, as the Trump Organization struggles under debt.  Though perhaps even his own business might become viable if he encounters the very real possibility of jail time for his corruption. 

This man screws up everything he touches."

2020-12-10 22:51:44,I’m a primary care doctor and studied biochemistry and conducted primary research in molecular biology. It’s good to see the fruit of this labor! I’m getting my shot tentatively next week !
2020-12-10 22:53:20,It’s a high risk decision but given our collective inability to control the pandemic it’s our only option to end the pandemic.
2020-12-10 22:53:58,"Fantastic news, and a major advance for us all.  Bravo!

The paper was also just published in the New England Journal of Medicine - it looks like the vaccine is very effective about 12 days after the first dose.  

So, it's unclear whether the booster really needs to be done in such a short time (3-4 weeks).  If we delayed the second booster until 6 months, we could double the people getting the vaccine's first shot this winter.  Given the desperate situation right now, I""d strongly consider it!"
2020-12-10 22:55:50,"I am very happy that the vaccinations are finally going to begin.  I am hoping that adequate oversight has been given to speed, record keeping, and the prevention of inevitable scams of those trying to sell counterfeit vaccine to the gullible.
I hope that by this time next year we are all vaccinated, and the President Elect Biden has monitored the economy so that some semblance of normality returns to our lives and to those of our families."
2020-12-10 22:57:20,"Not sure if we should be jumping for joy. As Cuomo has cited on numerous occasions, the FDA is NOT to be trusted and is politically motivated to manipulate the data and analysis. I’m not sure any panel is qualified to really do proper analysis given how political things are right now."
2020-12-10 22:57:58,"Great news.

Its unfortunate that the New York Times did not follow this meeting live, with its science writers and other journalistic stakeholders in attendance to  comment live on the proceedings.

Given the importance of establishing adequate safety review for the benefit of vaccine hesitaters,  front and center attention to this presentation might have gone a long way to alleviate the fears of people who are reluctant to receive a Covid vaccination,  whether they are on the right or left of the political spectrum."
2020-12-10 23:00:25,"So, health care workers will get the vaccine next week.  Excellent, but from what I have read quite a few people get flu like symptoms with chills, fever, etc.  Who will staff the ER's, ICU's while the health care workers are recovering from their shots?  Perhaps only vaccinate a small percentage at a time?"
2020-12-10 23:00:39,"It would be interesting to hear the dissenting opinions elaborate. Though I realize it won’t likely happen. Can you imagine trying to get the public to buy in with four “experts” singing a different tune.

While I don’t understand the process, on the surface abstaining seems odd, to put it nicely. There must be more to that story."
2020-12-10 23:02:48,Excellent news. let's hope it can roll out as quickly as possible to prevent more needless deaths. First up: the tireless and generous healthcare workers who have put their own lives on the line to save those of others.
2020-12-10 22:53:13,Wonder how many more countries will have beaten us vaccinating people before we get started?
2020-12-10 23:00:03,"Vote was 17 for approval and 4 against.

95% effective and no serious side effects! 

How did 4 vote no?!"
2020-12-10 23:01:11,"I find the continued use of old tropes about black and native Americans citizens being less inclined to take the vaccine because of historical treatments offensive. Black and Native Americans live in the same world we all do, they watch the news and understand as we all do that for this vaccine to work it will require a substantial portion of the world's population get vaccinated. They can see for themselves that a huge majority of all peoples are getting the vaccine. Those sentences read like they were contrived to bring a racial aspect to this neutral positive for mankind."
2020-12-10 23:06:10,"I would like to know about the 4 No votes.  

There are serious concerns among US citizens about getting the vaccine due to the politicization.  Having 4 No votes leaves this door of concern wide open. 

What members of the committee voted No and why?"
2020-12-10 23:07:02,Nice. They exclude people with allergies from the trial and now want to inject it into those people. What other groups were excluded from the trials?
2020-12-10 23:04:27,"Kudos to all the participants in development and assessment. Not since Jonas Salk has there been such urgency for combating a destructive assault on humans worldwide. AIDS/HIV was a hard fought disease which affected fewer victims, as with influenza and slew of others.

What has been grossly unfair and cruel with Covid-19 is the unforgivable politicization, a senseless battle not yet won among foolhardy diehards resisting PPE, distancing, science, and thereby increasing the harm to others almost as form of merciless ideological warfare. 

No need to name the prime culprit for this near-genocide, this autocratic cleansing of vulnerable people without means to end the carnage, instead urged to deny the threat and pay the ultimate price.

It may be too much to expect science to conquer political aggressors, still, its worth imagining there will come a time when that will be possible."
2020-12-10 23:07:39,"I nearly cried when I heard this news! It's truly a triumph of science. I will be getting my vaccine as soon as I can. It's like the end of a disaster movie, when the treatment finally becomes available, the cavalry shows up, etc. I trust the experts who approved the vaccine, I trust the scientists who developed it. I commend and thank the trial participants. This is a wonderful relief!"
2020-12-10 22:52:52,They should only give the vaccines to people who arrive wearing a mask!
2020-12-10 23:02:52,"Within days? My God, Canada and Britain are jabbing arms. 

GET THEM OUT."
2020-12-10 23:03:04,I am beyond thrilled to see this. Let's hope that today is the first day of the end the COVID-19 pandemic. Sending thoughts and prayers to everyone as we turn this corner! HANG IN THERE and WEAR YOUR MASK PLEASE!
2020-12-10 23:03:07,"""A panel of experts formally recommended that the Food and Drug Administration authorize the vaccine. The agency is likely to do so within days.""

These bureaucrats just can't help themselves, and while the FDA fuddles around, people are dying.

Here's the question I wish some reporter would ask: ""Over the Thanksgiving four-day weekend, was anyone in the Office reviewing the thousands of pages submitted by Pfizer to speed approval along, and why was your meeting scheduled for the 10th, rather than sooner?""

Dollars for donuts, we'd learn that meetings like this regularly occur on the 10th of each month, that there was no reason to vary this routine, and  everybody had lots of accumulated vacation days."
2020-12-10 23:09:36,"Interesting discussion regarding placebo subjects. They should be given the vaccine to continue the study. Otherwise, they will just leave the study and get the vaccine like every else."
2020-12-10 23:12:31,"More than amazed by the 4 nay votes, I'm amazed at all the naysayers who post here, nervous that the vaccine isn't safe. What about having a little joy?  This is a huge development that will save lives!  Is that not worth putting aside doubt?"
2020-12-10 23:13:16,"I’m a physician taking care of COVID patients and I plan to get the vaccine as soon as I can. My hospital expects to receive shipments next week. Because I am under 40, I won’t be in the first group, but I am in the second group as someone who has a high level of exposure to COVID patients. I plan to get my shot as soon as I am able and I’m grateful for the scientists who have made this possible."
2020-12-10 23:14:14,Remember when you get your vaccine this is not the work of the politicians who will try and get credit for it. It is the result of a lifetime of dedication by scientists. It is the result of your tax dollars supporting the NIH and NIH funded research at academic medical schools across the country. Also remember that time and again the Republicans try and cut the budgets of our great scientific institutes and that scientists have to spend much of their time applying for grants to fund their research. This is one of the main reasons young people don’t stay in research careers.   But let’s rejoice tonight because this is truly great news and remember to thank our scientific community for the great work they have done.
2020-12-10 23:15:36,My superhero sister and brother-in-law (frontline hospital doctors) are finally going to get their invincibility shields. The war is far from over. Thank you to everyone who made this possible.
2020-12-10 23:07:56,"I’d take it right now if I could.

I can’t believe how many people apparently don’t want it (approaching 50%).

The vaccine is not going to kill you. COVID can.

The only good news on that is I guess if a lot of people don’t want it, those of us who do will get it quicker."
2020-12-10 23:16:21,"What were the problems for the four against?
Or is it like in nine out of ten dentists recommend toothpaste, the outlier is nurts. 
But then again this is the Trump administration. Maybe the naysayers were miffed the vaccine wasn’t ready before the election. 
No but really what were the problems for the four against?"
2020-12-10 23:18:18,The best thing about this is that Pfizer was NOT a part of Operation Warp Speed so POTUS 45 can't boast we should all thank him.  That being said hoping Moderna gets approval soon as well as all other vaccines that are effective.
2020-12-10 23:08:42,This is a game changer and very good news.
2020-12-10 23:13:19,"If you participated in the study finish the clinical trial, placebo people. Science is counting on you."
2020-12-10 23:14:44,"This is very exciting and hopeful news.  The just-published article in the New England Journal of Medicine is a thoughtful, encouraging read."
2020-12-10 23:13:28,"I do not ever want to hear moaning and complaints about Big Pharma ever again. Those companies are going to save at least 150 million lives worldwide with these vaccines. Thank you, Big Pharma."
2020-12-10 23:23:00,"And how much of the initial tranche of vaccine doses will be rerouted to the WH, and to Trump “friends and family”?  We have already seen how the very short-supply and expensive  Eli Lilly mAB drug has been given not only to Trump, but Ben Carson and Rudy Giuliani, and who knows how many others within this favored circle have also gotten access to treatment?
Zero faith in this administration’s oversight of vaccine access and distribution, I’m afraid.  They’ve shown their cards too many times for any trust to develop, for sure."
2020-12-10 23:20:59,“Within days”. Really. Get this done. Thrilled to see this—now let’s see how the overpromising-underdelivering drug companies perform. Key story from the beginning was getting the manufacturing going before approval. Seems like barely.  Long long long wait ahead for most. Trilled health care first!
2020-12-10 23:21:53,"This FDA approval of Pfizer's vaccine is wonderful news!  Immediate vaccination of the 20 million people (40 million available doses) could cause the beginning of a rapid decline in deaths and hospitalization before the end of the month

Too bad it won't happen!

Why?  That vaccine could inoculate every medical worker over age 50 and then EVERY American over age 80.  But it won't!

It won't because the medical workers at the CDC have dictated that the vaccine must first go to all 22 million medical workers, young and old.  And, then to all the first responders, young and old.  That will consume 100% of the vaccine until sometime in January.  Only then will older general public be allowed access to vaccine.  

97% of Covid deaths are people over age 50
70% of hospitalizations are people over age 50

People under age 50 usually suffer only mild illness, sometimes no symptoms whatsoever

Deaths and hospitalizations will decline only when older Americans get access to the vaccine.  Therefore, the dying of 2000 per day will not begin declining by the end of this month.  Decline in deaths due to vaccination will not begin until about Feb 1, 14 days after the first shot is administered

The CDC had decided that many thousands of elderly Americans must unnecessarily die from Covid in order to prevent mild illness of some young medical workers!

Medical professionals carrying out the CDC dictum act unethically.  Vaccine should go to those whose lives are most in jeopardy!"
2020-12-10 23:24:55,What is happening with Governor Cuomo’s own vaccine review panel? Is it up and running? Hopefully it can also finish its work and opine on the vaccine before the US vaccination campaign starts next week.
2020-12-10 23:25:44,"The FDA is doing as it should, exercising caution and due diligence as it considers the vaccine. Now that an expert panel has recommended approval, it behooves the agency to quickly review the panel's recommendation and move forward.

A vaccine is only useful if people are willing to take it. In the US most survey's show, incredibly, that less than half the population wishes to be vaccinated. This is in large part due to the politicization of vaccine development and testing.  Frankly, most of this is not due to Trump, but to irresponsible journalism by liberal mainstream media. Much of the media, including the NYT, have promoted the false narrative that the FDA's review was politically influenced by the Trump administration. This is nonsense.  

Yesterday, the NYT printed an article that the CDC would collect the names of vaccinated individuals. The CDC is entirely appropriate, only by collecting such data can the CDC assess and document the safety and efficacy of administered vaccines. Yet, the Times' article was biased, and focused on privacy issues. It seemed designed to discourage people form receiving the vaccine, and judging by the comments, some readers will refuse vaccination.

Which is not good.

One more thing: the governors of two of the nation's left-leaning states, NY and California, have said they will restrict vaccination in their states until it is re-reviewed and approved by a panel of local experts.

New Yorkers should think long and hard about this delay."
2020-12-10 23:36:30,"Why is everyone calling it Pfizer's vaccine? It was developed by BioNTech, and Pfizer is only responsible for manufacturing and distribution. You don't refer to movies by the distribution company either."
2020-12-10 23:45:02,As a retired physician I argue that this approval took way too long. Politicians used tactics to delay its release for reasons of partisan politics on both sides killing thousands. I as many am disappointed that more doses are needed than produced. Apportioning should require an antibody TIter because many health care workers are already probably immune. Anyone who can receive this and doesn’t should have to do community service taking care of Covid patients without PPE.
2020-12-10 23:41:44,"Good God, the end is in sight. What an unbelievable time to be alive."
2020-12-10 23:38:46,Hats off to Pfizer..An excellent outcome in record time under immense pressure fro the fascist Trump administration layered with phonies and toadies. And hats off to FDA’s career scientists. Excellent work indeed
2020-12-10 23:43:13,fda is taking its time while thousands of people day daily shame
2020-12-10 23:36:33,"I have an idea.  Why not have the FDA pull an all-nighter and get this vaccine approved for use tomorrow? The past week or so does nothing but demonstrate the sclerotic state of the Agency.  Oh, but tomorrow is Friday and then the weekend and just a few hundred more dead Americans.  So what?"
2020-12-10 23:41:40,Great but there is little or no vaccine and there won't be for many months. Meanwhile tens of thousands more will die because Republicans won't wear masks.
2020-12-10 23:44:59,"Example: 100 people receive the mRNA injection at the rates declared 50% effective for the first dose and 95% effective for the second dose. So 50 people's system accept the dose and their cells message DNA to seek out the spiked virus. The other 50 people's system does not accept the first dose. Three weeks later the same 100 people receive the second dose. Here in lies the question. The 50 people who's systems accepted the first dose, are they now automatically at a 95% effective rate or will it be at the 50% rate of effectiveness? Or another rate in between? Do we know at this time?
The other 50 people who's systems did not accept the change in the message to their DNA, will this second dose give them an effective rate of 50% or 95% or no effectiveness at all, still using mRNA to change their cells? Why are their bodies 'rejecting' the mRNA?

In a worse case scenario of this example only 25 people's system will be changed to accept this injection to change their cellular structure to seek out the spiked virus.

If this is true and given to 100,000,000 people (and more) what will be the estimated effectiveness rate of this injection? And who will be the ones who have been given the injection, that will become virus free? Is there any telling(s)?And do we then keep giving injections of mRNA to those who are not receptive to this program?"
2020-12-10 23:47:02,"As a Pfizer guinea pig who suspects I got the dud, I'll gladly give up my ""thank you"" dose to a colleague still in the Covid trenches. I can stay home and order take out. 

As a college biology major soon after Watson and Crick got their Nobel for discovering the role of DNA, a time when genetic engineering was a gleam in the eyes of my teaching assistants, I'm just thrilled at the technology we've created. That's why I had no fear of receiving this advanced product. We've just set foot on the moon."
2020-12-10 23:46:24,"Stripped of all its wrappings, we are now about to witness this Republican administration's months of painstaking planning for delivering a vaccine that wasn't on their pay-to-play list to the American people.  Good luck everyone!"
2020-12-10 23:33:28,Great news. It is the beginning of the end for Covid-19. We all want to return to normal.
2020-12-10 23:50:04,"It’s all very leisurely. 3000 a day are dying, so maybe the FDA ought to skip their afternoon tea, read the advisory report, and come to a decision."
2020-12-11 00:01:57,"Interesting, Advisory panel approved. This vaccine was not the cure but only minimizes Symptoms of COVID-19, if it's an effective vaccine against minimizing symptoms  of COVID-19,with no strong or dangerous side effects - Advisory panel did their job."
2020-12-11 00:06:06,"17 to 4 with one abstention. I don't know if not getting a unanimous result is the norm for vaccine approvals. But it concerns me. Plus the clinical trials were not broad enough, meaning all types of future recipients were not included in the trials, so the results would look better for those who vote for approval. We have no way of knowing if the vaccine will work for most, if not all, people. I, for one, am very skeptical, and will wait for at least six months before deciding if I'll be inoculated. Yes, I do realize if a lot of people do what I do, it will delay nation-wide progress. But we all have the right to not do something if we're not comfortable."
2020-12-11 00:08:17,"Besides politics and mollifying the public, one has to question why we needed to have this Advisory Committee at all.  The hours of preparation for a report and presentation could have been better spent accelerating the approval.  Most of the public has no idea of what hazard ratio indicates, nor understands the niceties of efficacy analyses.  We need a vaccine, not a show."
2020-12-11 00:02:22,"Good Lord! They were fast enough to take on Trump’s nonsense drugs, but are slow as molasses on vaccine approval....

Speed it up! Get the darn thing out already!

It’s revolting how many parts of the health and safety agencies of the federal government have fallen down on the job so spectacularly! The FDA and CDC proved to be powerless against the political machinations of Trump and the anti-science crowd. Beyond useless!

Some CDC official just recommended that the Trump administration destroy all of their anti-pandemic communications. Destruction of government documents and records is a crime! Those records belong to the government, not to Trump, or the people that wrote them.

The CDC has turned into the most feckless government agency of all. Their job is to fight pandemics, not pander to politics. The FDA is not far behind...

Destroy records and you alter history: right out of 1984."
2020-12-11 00:06:55,3000 people died in one day and these bureaucrats  are still dragging their feet.  What's the issue with these dorks?
2020-12-10 23:54:15,"At over 3,000 deaths a day, why linger over Friday and through the weekend? 
We can't afford a series of red tape meetings when they already know the vaccine is safe. 
People are choking to death in hospitals and in their homes. 
Work through the night the way our doctors and nurses are and get this show on the road. 
Thousands of lives will be saved."
2020-12-11 00:11:12,"Four panelists (almost 20%) voting against this lifesaving and essential drug is proof that some people just like to be difficult and call attention to themselves.  I'm absolutely certain that if each of the four ""no"" votes were actually standing between America and the vaccine, they would have voted ""yes."" Which means their votes were strategic and self-serving. Grow up, docs."
2020-12-11 00:14:09,"Good news.

Does anyone out there know whether the drug companies  plan to conduct trials on children under 16 in the near future so they can be vaccinated too?

I know they're less likely than their elders to get a bad case of Covid, but they can certainly pass on the virus to someone else who might not do well. (Yes, those likely to be badly sickened will hopefully have themselves been vaccinated, but not passing it along in the first place seems a better strategy if that's doable.)"
2020-12-11 00:21:22,"There has been criticism of the Federal government for ""not buying enough"" of the Pfizer vaccine.   I think this criticism is unwarranted.  There are four other very promising vaccines coming for approval on the heels of the Pfizer vaccine.

The extreme cold temperature required to transport and store the Pfizer vaccine is problematic, whereas the others only need normal refrigeration.  Most pharmacies and medical offices do not have the equipment to store the Pfizer vaccine, but do have refrigerators.

And until any vaccine gets out in the public, we really do not know the extent of side effects and adverse reactions.

It would have been foolhardy to put all our eggs in the Pfizer basket.  Diversification of supply makes more sense.

Unfortunately, we are living in an age of polarized media, where a glass 90% full is likely to be reported as 10% empty."
2020-12-11 00:19:46,"There is no choice but to approve this vaccine. Anybody who thinks otherwise are not thinking it through .
This Virus is only the tip of the iceberg. 
It has shown us what it can do and it can and will mutate. 
It has to be stopped now .
And the world has to come together to stop the next virus from spreading to the place where we are now .
And where we are now in a very large part rests on the shoulders of Donald Trump and the shameful Republican Party ."
2020-12-11 00:15:10,"Let us thank the good scientists who bring us here. Medical workers and later all: finally, we have something to protect you as you save and serve us at the risk of yourselves and your families! You are our best and most deserving. One request: please keep in mind that the gene for the virus spike protein can and will mutate to escape antibody neutralization subject selective pressure. Keep those masks on until we can get ahead of it just a little bit!!"
2020-12-11 00:20:02,"I never knew bureaucracy was so steeped into the systems of this country. 3000 people are dying every day and the approval process still has to wait till the weekend!! We all know if FDA was little more pro-active and worked harder, this should have been already done almost month ago when Pfizer declared their spectacular results. All that talk about we are more thorough and diligent and look through raw data- blah blah blah!!"
2020-12-11 00:24:33,"Now what we need is ENOUGH VACCINE for everyone - as that idiot Trump ""promised"".

I would like to know what the considerations and parameters were for deciding how many does of each vaccine were contracted and the rationale for doing so. As with everything Trump, the job is far less than well-done as the moron abandons any meaningful engagement to actually DO something. Golf does not count, nor does his treasonous distraction of trying to blatantly steal a legitimate election and MASSIVE LOSS for him.

Where did he put his sticky little fingers in this for a quid pro quo and, I am sure, obstruct the medical powers that be for his own insane gain?

Trump has been AWOL for four years - now is no exception. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS DEAD UNNECESSARILY because of him, the HYDROXYMORON, and his flock."
2020-12-11 00:26:49,"If this had happened five weeks ago, Trump would have taken credit and it certainly wouldn’t have harmed his re-election chances. If it had happened three or four weeks ago, Trump would have claimed a conspiracy to delay the announcement. Instead, it happened late enough to quiet conspiracy theorists but soon enough to help with the present emergency.  Perfect timing you might say. But this is all irrelevant. No scientist would ever consider timing a vaccine for political purposes."
2020-12-11 00:27:05,I’m an infectious disease doctor and I can’t wait to get it. I hope everyone in my family gets it as well.
2020-12-11 00:27:37,"As with all vaccines, a small minority of people will likely be excluded from getting vaccinated for medical reasons (i.e. immunocompromised.) With a history of anaphylaxis, it appears I may or may not qualify for this one. Same with my elderly mother. That is why it's important that those who can get us out of this pandemic nightmare by getting vaccinated. Vaccination protects not only you but stops the spread of the virus through 'herd immunity' which is the only way to keep the vulnerable protected - one of the few things we could agree on during this national tragedy. If there was ever a time to stand up for shared values of humanity, it's now."
2020-12-11 00:29:13,"FDA should have approved Pfizer vaccine this afternoon. FDA itself has already published its own safety and efficacy data. Delaying until Friday will cause another 3000 casualties, in a few weeks. Delaying until Monday will cause an additional 9000 casualties.  Bad enough that US government has failed to purchase sufficient vaccine doses, according to reports yesterday from Bloomberg and NPR. With casualty rates this high, time to stop messing around. British and Canadian governments had the correct idea. London Times pointed out that their early vaccinations owed much to taking the decision away from the civil service, and simply deciding to START VACCINATIONS. Complicated deliveries with sub zero storage requirements. For all these reasons, FDA needs to get going now, given that the FDA is already 3 weeks too late."
2020-12-11 00:29:22,"Has anyone heard yet how any one individual might learn or be informed that he/she was eligible for any vaccine and could then go somewhere to get vaccinated?  (Not merely learn, for example, we’re in a certain category that could, in principle, be vaccinated.)  How will we find out we could go get it?  Will state health departments for example send out letters?  Will our doctor tell us?"
2020-12-11 00:31:42,"Can we put this out there right now, so nobody says we never told em?-- Folks who get the Pfizer vaccine and others like it will still need to wear masks, for the foreseeable future. That's because the vaccine is not likely to prevent mild and harmless infections of the nasal and respiratory passages. People who have been vaccinated will still be able to catch and spread Covid-19. The vaccine protects those who have been vaccinated but does not sufficiently protect others."
2020-12-11 00:38:23,"Vaccines do not save lives. Vaccination programs and those who comply, saves lives. If there's not enough compliance the pandemic simply continues. 

 There's a fantasy that the vaccine comes out next week and the whole pandemic goes away. It won't. Masks will still be needed, social distancing will still be needed, hygiene will still be needed."
2020-12-11 00:38:48,"While playing golf trump is now claiming responsibility for the anti-virus vaccine. But Pfizer says it developed its own vaccine absent trump. Go figure. Clearly trump could have actively supported and even led the vaccine development effort almost a year ago! But he didn't. Instead he left the nation totally vulnerable and in a place of ""catch up"" instead of ""prevention"" to the pandemic crisis. He dismantled all the important measures the previous administration had taken to  successfully protect the nation from the 2014 Ebola infection crisis and brace for other infection situations in the future. And then he actually blocked the capacity for national action to contain the current mess and is still missing in action."
2020-12-11 00:30:04,"Do the dumbos in the Trump administration realize that by trying to act like they have a role in the vaccine development and approval, that Trump is “pushing” the scientists, they are undermine public confidence in the safety and efficacy of the vaccine?  Like so many things — whatever Trump and his servants touch gets either tarnished or destroyed."
2020-12-11 00:35:23,"Even with the vaccine, the healthcare system is going to be overloaded for some time to come. Let's hope  people understand that now more than ever they need to follow the protocols for stopping the Covid spread—masks, social distancing, hand-washing, etc., are still vitally important.

At the moment most of England is almost in lockdown of some sort. Wearing a mask is at a guess 85% successful, and appears to be gaining ground. However, once we start to lift restrictions up goes the infection rate again, and deaths follow. 
I personally think mask wearing will be with us for another 12 months even with the vaccines available.
I have black friends that are even skeptical about the flu jab never mind this vaccine, but they are like me either in their 70’s or 80’s, and it difficult to change your way of thinking at times.

That's because the vaccine is not likely to prevent mild and harmless infections of the nasal and respiratory passages.

Not only does Big Pharma fund the FDA, WHO, NIH, and CDC but staffs them via the revolving door.

She fast-tracked Merck's Gardasil vaccine in 2006, which caused a 54% rise in cervical cancer among UK's 24- to 29-year-olds.

MDs who advise the FDA are also paid off by Pharma: ""An analysis of pharma payments to 107 physicians who advised FDA on 28 drugs approved from 2008 to 2014 found that a majority later got money for travel or consulting, or received research subsidies from the makers of the drugs on which they voted or from competing firms.""

2020-12-11 01:25:01,"This vaccine is the best shot we have at achieving anything that resembles normal life. With COVID being completely new to our population, no one has natural antibodies to grant them immunity to infection. 

However those antibodies are exactly what is needed in order to significantly control and protect people from the spread of the virus. There are thousands of viruses being spread every year, but we are unaware of their effects and they don't cause any significant outbreaks. This is because since birth, we are constantly exposed to them and develop antibodies, sometimes as a result of being physically ill, and sometimes without being conscious of this. 

This is why I am praying these vaccines that are starting to be administered are able to function effectively. Without exaggeration, this is the strongest chance we have at proceeding with our return to in-person school, work, large gatherings, all without having to wear masks or socially distance. Our world has been shocked in every area imaginable these past nine months, and the recovery will be difficult. However, the recovery will be much easier if more than 60% of our population can develop immunity as safely as possible.

2020-12-11 06:28:20,"This is a very generous interpretation of the FDA. The UK tested the compounds before the trial results, that saved a lot of time. 
It should not take that long to analyse the data of 42,000 .
We all knew there were no serious adverse reactions and the efficacy numbers. We all knew it was going to get the go ahead. Given the circumstances. It should have been authorised earlier. The benefits of doing that far outweigh the alternative."
2020-12-11 06:29:48,What do we know about the safety of the Pfizer vaccine if people who might have an adverse reaction to the vaccine were excluded from the phase 3 clinical trial? The exclusion makes the two adverse reactions in the U.K. very troubling.

The risks of teens ending up in ICUs or dead from Covid are miniscule, so there really is no benefit to rushing a substance without much data, into their bodies."
2020-12-11 11:08:06,Just something I noticed is you said somewhat efficient after two doses which I guess can be kind of true but I believe what your relating that to is when the FDA came out and said it’s somewhat efficient after the first dose with just over a 50% success rate. When taking both doses it has a 95% success rate.
2020-12-11 11:22:23,"How can science be truly objective when profit is involved? 
A message to scientists: the profit motive undermines your credibility. It just does. We can deny it. We can say, ""well then how else can science proceed without lots of money?"" Maybe it can't. But that doesn't change the fact that the profit motive undermines the objectivity of science and the integrity of oversight boards. People are getting rich off this disaster that we are undergoing. They should be donating their profits to people whose lives and livelihoods have been ruined."
2020-12-11 12:20:41,"Great news! Now, here in California as soon as our doctors and nurses on the front lines and real essential workers serving us in our grocery stores and pharmacies and there is no new evidence which states that Children under 16 are seriously at risk for Covid-19, then it would seem that my partner and I are in the next most at risk group. I'm 76, he's 77, and while both of us feel healthy, the evidence points to our ages and immune systems which are not what they were even 10 years ago.

We both can afford to contribute financially and have observed and will continue to adhere to all state requirements to safeguard others by wearing masks, social distancing and not getting together with anyone until it's safe to do so. We both have many years to engage with others. I'm lucky I've only known two people who died of Covid-19 and I don't want to join them. After 10 months of tempting fate and with cases in Los Angeles going off the charts, every trip to the store could be my last. 

 Frankly, I still think we should be vaccinating the children before anyone else. And who should go last? Every Republican Senator and House member, and all the rest of the despicable cowards and crooks who have done Trump's bidding and I don't mind if you add the Cancel Culture Fanatics on the left, as well."

The epidemic deep-state narcissists needed more time emotionally, to feel appreciated and not bullied by someone smarter.

Don't bury the lede. 5/22 people who have looked into the vaccine harder than anyone else in the country did not think, despite all the pressure to approve a vaccine, that they could vote in favor of it. Could we please get more detail on that? What was the special expertise of those people? What were their reservations? Was it the age extension down to 16 year-olds or was it something else?"
2020-12-11 08:34:21,"What is very disturbing to me in the way the Covid crisis is being managed is the following: current deaths are reaching record levels, but there is a medicine in trials for treating Covid patients with ARDS and respiratory failure, which has a remarkable record already in healing the lungs of these patients, resporing surfactant production by the lungs, and healing damage seen in X-rays. It also appears to halt the reproduction of the virus in the Alveolar type II cells, which is where the coronavirus latches on in the lungs. The medicine is called Aviptadil, or RLF-100, and is made by Relief Therapeutics in Switzerland, who are partnered with NeuroRx in the United States. (I do have an investment in this company). The Emergency Use Application with the FDA was applied for almost three months ago! There is still no response from the FDA, and I cannot understand why they are dragging their feet. The potential of this medicine should be headline news in the New York Times. RLF-100 is already proven safe in other uses and is a synthetic form of a Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide, which is also found in the lungs. Please help this effective life-saver reach the critical patients who need it!"

Over 3,000 people are dying everyday so shortening the pandemic by even one day is a big deal. This is a medical emergency! Doctors frequently work through the night even for just one patient. (I was one of those doctors.)

And imagine the optics if the FDA said “this can’t wait until tomorrow.”"

2020-12-11 02:05:04,"We all have virus fatigue.  But fast-tracking a vaccine like this, while it may ""feel"" good, may not be the best thing 

First, we only have about two months of clinical trial data; drugs far less important get a minimum of 6 to 12 months of efficacy and safety data.  This means that we really don't know what degree of immunity the vaccine provides, or for how long.  Second, even this quickly, a larger-than-expected percentage of people are having allergic reactions, either to the vaccine itself or some ingredient in it.

I ""get"" the desire to start active offense and defense against the virus.  But I think we are making health care workers and the elderly ""guinea pigs,"" which we can only hope doesn't lead to future complications due to lack of data."

2020-12-11 19:37:23,Why are they not creating a third arm of people to see if they react to the lipid molecules carrying the mRNA? Would that not give us vital information if that component might instigate allergic reactions? I am so unhappy that there is more than one unknown variable in the new vaccine. And there is no data on the adjuvant/carrier being safe for us.
2020-12-11 21:19:14,Surely the urgency of the situation should have prompted the FDA to dispense with its business-as-usual practice of having an online public meeting with outside experts weighing in.

2020-12-11 16:18:13,"Not even a mention of the fact that most women specifically choose to marry a man with higher earning potential than them? The only mention of why the man in the marriage tends to earn more than the woman is the gender pay gap, which ignores the reality that women usually won't marry a man unless he makes at least the same or more than her, contributing to his career naturally being prioritized if he makes much more than her."
2020-12-11 16:21:57,"The actual stories in this article are about women with kids and high-earning husbands who can can afford to quit their jobs to take care of the kids. Is it really ""women"" who are being hurt when a woman with a high-earning husband quits her job to take care of the kids? Is that really the group we should be worried about? And is the hit to their retirement really a hit to ""women"" as a whole? Isn't it a hit to that specific couple? Is the high-earning husband not impacted by the loss of his wife's income? Does the single woman with kids struggling to make ends meet really need to lament the hit to ""women"" caused by a woman with a high-earning husband quitting her job to take care of the kids? 

There are a lot of strangely paternalistic assumptions behind this article. 

These are really stories of what happens when a global pandemic closes down childcare facilities and therefore parents have to actually take care of their own children full time. The ""solution"" of ""more child care"" doesn't apply here - the whole problem is kids are at home because they can't *go* to child care (whether you call that child care child care or school). 

Now more generally, it is absolutely true that America needs a better child-care system. But these women aren't quitting their jobs because they can't afford child care. They're making rational decisions in response to a global pandemic."
2020-12-11 16:29:30,"What also contributes to much smaller Social Security benefits down the road is Employer Sponsored health insurance, all thanks to the loss of matching employer/ employee Social Security taxes on,  and reduced lifetime total reporting of, earnings earnings spent buying 100% pre-tax-dollar health insurance. Financial advisors always preach to never pass up matching employer contributions to retirement benefits, and yet here we still are, 75+ years now, handing massive chunks of our retirement benefits over to private health insurance companies. Americans are financial illiterates."
2020-12-11 16:46:17,"It isn't clear if more women are losing jobs because of sexism or because the pandemic is hurting certain women-centric businesses more. These include professional child-care and home-cleaning services, waitressing among many others. While these are problems that must be addressed, it's important that the diagnosis be accurate and not tainted with bias."
2020-12-11 16:46:37,"The article barely touches on the fact that married couples operate as a single budgetary household.  Women solely are not impacted when a married woman leaves her job when a higher earning husband keeps working.  Their money is joint, including retirement accounts.  Even if they are superficially in each other's name, all marriages share contributions to those accounts during the marriage.  This is not a him vs her point.  Much of the financial point of a marriage union is that even with division of labor, their joint efforts are shared.  

Sometimes the allusion that you can have it all, is just that.  Homeschool kids and two full-time jobs isn't a great option.  In cases where there is one higher earner, it isn't a punishment to a lower earning woman, but a family's best financial choice as a fallback.  It is also assuming this is forced on women, who in fact have an opinion and say in this matter, and aren't all just victims of the patriarchy here. 

Families are struggling, families are making adjustments in different ways.  It doesn't have to be only about the women if married.  Let's also focus on the topic of unmarried families and how their struggle is different than married.  Let's bring up the unspoken topics of alimony (which still exists) and child support that rebalances many financial situations. And let's include fathers in this entire discussion, half the equation.  And not just to criminalize them all."
2020-12-11 17:15:49,"Despite the skewed examples of the women impacted, this story identifies some key structural issues with our economy and social safety net that disproportionately disadvantage women (child care, elder care, wage gap, etc.) that are all still true today. Whether married, single or widowed, women overall face a weaker economic future due to these inequities. And as with all economic disasters, the pandemic is simply highlighting/exacerbating the underlying inequities that result in systemic disadvantages for certain groups — women among them."
2020-12-11 17:37:31,"It's good to see this piece on how job losses are not just temporary struggles, but that their effects ripple through an entire lifetime. I would like to see this line of reasoning applied to the student loan debate as well. Lack of savings, assets, and insecure futures affect not only those still paying off loans, but those who spent decades paying and have missed out on securing for their futures. So many of us need help."
2020-12-11 17:49:56,"I followed the advice given when I first started working in 1981:  start an IRA.  I did and I contributed to it on a monthly basis.  Then the government eliminated that deduction if we made over a small amount of money.  I still contributed.  I stopped contributing to my IRA after I was unemployed for over 6 months in 1997.  Why?  Because if I had needed to raid that account once my savings ran out I'd have been hit with a large tax bill I could not have paid.  In other words, keeping my savings as liquid as possible was the only way to ensure I'd have enough money to survive extended unemployment.  Since 1997 I've lived through extended unemployment 3 more times.

Our stingy social safety net hinders our ability to save for retirement, cover our medical costs, and keep body and soul together unless the crisis is brief.  Our health care system has us paying monthly premiums, co-pays, high deductibles, out of network costs, and anything else it can find to squeeze us dry.  

Then we have the fact that women are underpaid no matter what field they are in.  As a woman I've been denied mentoring, promotions, decent raises, and even jobs.  I've been asked inappropriate questions, harassed, etc.  To be honest, considering what women are expected to tolerate in the workplace, I think we should be paid more than the men.   And I think that our experience as caretakers more than prepares us to re-enter the workplace after a leave."
2020-12-11 17:54:54,"A word of caution on this issue. I (a male) and many of the women I worked with in my last 20 years in the workforce had low incomes in our early years, but managed to land better-paying jobs late in our careers.

Those years of low income taught me to live frugally, so that when my income did rise, I was able to sock a lot of it away. Those late years of higher income also substantially increased my final Social Security payout.

Basically the future is unknowable. Anyone with many years in the workforce ahead can do fine with a little planning."
2020-12-11 17:56:55,"My retirement savings have suffered because I dipped into them to pay for a custody battle, could not pay extra because I had to pay for child support, and kept losing my job so a guy could take over after I turned things around. Now, pandemic has made getting any job difficult especially for an older woman. My son says he is my retirement plan. He understands how bad it is."
2020-12-11 18:03:00,"The article points out that women in couples tend to earn less than men and that their careers tend to become deprioritized during hard economic times. While it may be true, it’s not an outward sign of injustice. When deciding among potential mates, women tend to select higher earning men and men tend to pursue lower-earning women. Also, it’s known that taller people tend to earn more than shorter people— and that women tend to want to choose male partners who are taller than them. So would an equitable solution be to ask more couples to be comprised of higher-qualified and taller women romantically paired with less-qualified and shorter men? Obviously not, those are social choices. I simply state these things to point out that not every result is based upon an injustice."
2020-12-11 18:17:58,"Something must be done so that the minimum collected on social security isn't a poverty amount anywhere in the country. 

Those of us women (and men) who came into the workforce in the 1980s and after will overwhelmingly rely only on SocSec and savings. Few in this generation have traditional pensions or even 401ks. And there are many more single parents.
 
Retirement savings for all but the professionally very fortunate have been depressed bc of wage stagnation & increased cost of key elements of life: housing, food, healthcare, childcare and education.

Then add in the Great Recession and the Pandemic unemployment events -- and many older workers who became underemployed post the Great Recession are now likely to be unemployed or even further underemployed, thus making it harder still to put savings away. Age discrimination is a huge problem.

There is disaster ahead for the entire economy if something is not done to assist those older workers now and/or in the future."

2020-12-11 19:52:39,"CUNY fired hundreds of long-time adjuncts, including many older women, over the long, COVID-ridden summer.  When challenged in federal court by the PSC, the CUNY teachers' union,  for alleged violation of the CARES Act, which conditioned financial aid on the retention of employees, NYS responded, contemptuously, that adjuncts were contract workers, not ""employees"" and CUNY ""was not operating for the benefit of graduate student teaching assistants.""

As a long-time CUNY adjunct, with a Ph.D. in my field, I am three years from seeing my pension vest. Yet I know that, when my 3-year contract expires in 2022, CUNY will probably fire me and Iwill lose the pension. I am expensive, and my seniority prevents CUNY from hiring me on a year-to-year basis.

CUNY could not benefit students, were it not for committed, experienced teachers. Nor are adjuncts garbage to be used, discarded and disdained. I have taught since the 1980s.  My students benefit from my experience.  If I am interchangeable with other senior adjuncts, that is only because we are skilled, capable teachers.

Lawyers know only facts and legal arguments, not shame; moral arguments are disregarded (and scorned) in litigation. Yet shame on CUNY and the NYS AG. You have obligations as human beings, regardless of what you do for a living.  (If you believed the smears, then shame on you twice over.)

My retirement and social security look vastly different from what they could have been.

I didn't nor did I have anyone to support but myself (no husband or kids).  Did not make much money for most of my working life.  Saved what I could and I am not complaining, but I was never even close to maxing out and I certainly did not have extra money to ""catch up"" with."

In the examples of the article, much emphasis is placed on the higher earnings of the husbands, so Mrs Tyrell and Mrs Ben Ari will have comfortable Social Security retirements even if they never return to work.  This  holds true regardless  of the pandemic.

Some put nothing - they did not even capture any of the 5% match yet had expensive cars and toys. Others maxed out their contributions. The savers retired at reasonable ages and did ok - not rich by any means but ok. The non savers could not afford to retire. Many people just make poor financial decisions. They think the future will never come. Everyone’s life circumstance is different and you can only do the best you can do but do not squander any opportunity. The best thing the Feds could do to help the greatest amount of people is to raise the social security benefit. Especially for low wage earners. Reward the work effort. Also increase the earned income tax credit. Well paid people - please save and delay gratification until retirement.

It would behoove Biden/Harris administration and Congress as well as state governments to help remedy this dire situation. With what is going on now, I don't see that happening. Thus, pure and simple, I will never be able to retire which is not unlike so many of the women in this world.

Why not hold the incompetent private company and the private company's business insurance liable instead of demanding blood from a stone from people feeding their families ?

Why must we privatize the profits and socialize the losses ?

If there were cases where legitimate fraud exists with recipients, then those cases should be pursued and prosecuted.

2020-12-11 14:32:55,"I collected regular unemployment in NJ and when my regular benefits ran out they put me on an extension and sent me 2 letters approving it. When my benefit year ended I tried to open a new claim in NJ (one of 3 states that I worked in.) They strung me along for 9 weeks and then told me to go to PA and open a claim there. They also said I had to pay back the $4200 in extension benefits that I received. I appealed the day I got the letter and in the meantime opened a claim in PA. After 3.5 months PA started paying me (much less than I was eligible for in NJ) and then stopped after a couple of weeks. NJ sent them a notice saying I had to pay them back and that PA could pay me NOTHING until I did. It was now 2.5 months after sending my appeal into NJ and I never heard anything. Eventually, on the advice of PA UI I scraped together the money to pay NJ back. They never alerted PA that I did and so now, almost 6 months later I still have no unemployment benefits being paid. NJ is the biggest mess, ruining people’s lives. I contacted them and told them they took my money in less than a day and weeks later haven't alerted PA. I am still waiting. Lawyers won’t help. The governor is awful and really doesn't care. This was NJ’s fault on ALL levels and there seems to be no recourse. I work in an industry that will be the LAST to reopen and have applied for a ton of jobs outside of my industry and have had no response.

She cannot work from home due to the sensitive nature of her work which cannot be done off premises. 

The questions are very clear about qualifications and how your work was affected by Covid 19. The questions are also very clear about whether you have returned to work and how much you earn.  Then they calculate if you are eligible even for a dollar. A lot is left out of this article.

Legitimate eligible workers are still having their unemployment held up by people who know they don't qualify and that is unfair to them. If people choose to not be truthful then they have to face the consequences of their actions. Pay back the money."

Commenters are saying that the recipients should have known.  Not clear to me at all.  Given the uncertainty of these times, what exactly is intended, and how long the payments will last or be necessary, I don't blame a person for not protesting that $750 is too much money, if that's what the government determined that they were entitled to.  Yes, if it said that they were entitled to $1,000,000, or paid them that much, then they ought to be suspicious that an error was made, but $750 is not $1,000,000."

Individuals whose valid claims have been buried in an avalanche of indifference and denial. An extension of funds that cannot be accessed, no matter how hard one tries, almost seems like a Jean-Paul Sartre satire for which there is no exit. Perhaps a 600 dollar direct payment is our only option, amidst a frayed safety net, a gridlocked U.S. Senate, an onslaught of unemployment fraud, and an overwhelmed status quo, for whom the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few (or the one.... Wrath of Kahn).

2020-12-11 15:37:00,State Unemployment Departments were never designed to pay contractors; it was designed to pay claims for people whose employers had paid into the system on their behalf. And I understand that attempting to file a claim last March was nearly impossible as systems were overloaded. Those who filed a claim in good faith and attached documentation assumed that the claim was being reviewed and any errors caught. They shouldn’t be held accountable for system or people errors. And what good does it do to force someone to repay this debt if they have no means of doing so. It would be heartless and go against the point of providing this relief.
2020-12-11 15:53:21,"I have no idea how the Social Security Administration calculates my benefits.  Even with an ""explanation"" and a college degree, I'm no actuary and I can't figure it out.  But periodically (at least once a year), I get a letter saying I (!) overpaid or underpaid and they would be adding or deducting, as THEIR error warranted, X number of dollars to the next X many months' checks.  

Earlier this month I got a whopping $3 in my bank account, followed by a letter a month later, saying I was owed $3 for an underpayment in 2014 and they'd be sending me a check.  I certainly hope not since they already auto-deposited that $3, but I won't be surprised.

When my father passed in 2007, he kept receiving his check for 3 months post-death, despite my sending them a copy of his death certificate.  It took countless hours and finally a trip to their office (with an afternoon of my time wasted) to give them back their money and STOP the payments from coming.

2020-12-11 15:58:47,"This is a familiar and frustrating story. My husband is receiving PUA benefits in Missouri. An unemployment agent told us on a call back in June (only because WE caught overpayment on his account and called in to inquire) that their system was mishandling funds because they didn't have enough staff to update the system in time, and that any overpayment would be required to be paid back. At the time they said we could set up a payment plan, giving back as little as $25/week. That didn't happen. Suddenly in August the state started taking his whole check, giving my husband massive anxiety. And there was no way to set up a plan for less. Mercifully, I am still working, and we were able to get by. I'm not sure how a family that depends on that check could have survived. My heart goes out to everyone who has been harmed by this failure."
2020-12-11 16:06:43,"What was the goal of the program? To keep the economy afloat and to keep people from starving and being put out on the street. 

The payments did their job. That should be counted as a success and not where the individual payments were made. (I was employed and made too much for the $1200 payment.) 

So if the goal was to get money into the economy to keep it afloat and people off the streets what is the expected affect of taking the money from the people? How does that support the goal. 

When their is a global and national crises we need to remember the big picture and the goal and remember pecuniary vindictiveness solves few problems."

Either way, how is it that they are the ones being penalized, when multimillion dollar companies received massive payouts, many fraudulently as well. But this is how our country operates. We turn a blind eye to billionaires who commit tax fraud but we'll chase down a minimum wage worker for a few thousand dollars. And then complain when they need government subsidies to survive!"
2020-12-11 16:08:07,"The instinct to distribute money quickly to many people was good.  Pump money into the economy in bad times.  It helped.  

It's a bad idea to now remove money from the economy when we're still in crisis.

The mistake was not in the overall aim or in the overall delivery.  So why not let bygones be bygones?  We know people need more.  Do it."
2020-12-11 16:23:38,"The largest PUA issue for overpayment is that income is treated differently than ALL other forms of UI. It is the ONLY one based on net versus gross. And yet, taxes are charged the same on both PUA and UI payments. The states took a great deal of time in creating the PUA system. You had to be intelligible for UI. Most applications were never clear about needing use a different income number on the subsequent PUA. It's far worse for those who had UI information for part time work and then only gig information for the rest of their income. The Department of Labor set up the regs for the PUA to limit payments deliberately.  Secretary Scalia was clear he was against the PUA. Worse, if you're a small business owner,  you couldn't take both PPP and PUA as part of the PPP calculation included your ""salary."" Your forgiven PPP will also count as income, leading to more overpayment retroactively.  Many are in that boat without realizing it. And, just like reducing your forgivable PPP because you also took the EIDL and $1,000 advance (forgivable), it too will create an overpayment retroactively. 

The system was designed to be punitive and difficult."
2020-12-11 16:28:59,"Just another example of the state or the corporation being responsible for the error or the harm and not “manning up” to NOT HAVING DONE IT RIGHT.  

We castigate our kids for doing something wrong and not taking responsibility but we forgive or ignore the unethical behavior of large organizations, whether government or business, when they shift the blame onto others.  

No matter that the impetus to help was a good one, the recipients are not responsible for the errors in payouts.  

The state is and this kind of action against recipients during a time of sickness, job loss and uncertainty is what Republicans use to bad mouth government.  Will businesses and corporations also be required to pay back?  I, for one, am not holding my breath."
2020-12-11 16:30:07,"Hm. I mean $12k in overpayments is a lot of money, I think you would very well notice that – that’s practically half a year’s work at $13/hour, there’s no way the woman profiled didn’t notice making 2-3x as much money as she did at her job (and no way she needed to spend that much on essentials, since she clearly paid for food and rent before). 

Less egregious errors should probably just be forgiven with new legislation, though we shouldn’t hold our breath."
2020-12-11 16:31:01,"My husband and I have been receiving unemployment since the pandemic started, as our workplaces are still shuttered due to the pandemic. We are self-employed. We have been informed by two different unemployment agents on the phone this week that our unemployment benefits are calculated on our gross income. However, both agents (!) gave us incorrect information — for self-employed people they are calculated on NET income. This is a huge difference, and because of this error we now owe $8000 in overpayments due to originally filing on gross (again, as originally instructed). That both agents we spoke to this week misinformed us on this vital fact (and we went over this on the phone to clarify with them, over and over) is beyond frustrating. Many good people are in the situation of owing for overpayments through absolutely no fault of their own. There is gross incompetence with how the unemployment program is run."

I saw people who were literal drug dealers get claims approved for made up businesses, and struggling people with valid claims get lost in adjudication. We should not make people pay back what we shouldn’t have given them. But we should definitely admit this was all wrong from the start, and not act surprised when it’s wrong at the end too."

A poor American is the first member of his family to graduated from college looks for a job but it is given to a privileged H 1B exchange student from India.  Yep.  Unfair.

2020-12-11 19:07:12,"It would have taken far too long for the govt. to take the time to properly scrutinise everyone's eligibility before sending them any benefits. 

There wasn't time, so better to widen the scope to ensure that more truly needed people received them - a course of action that I agree with.  (Same situation in Canada.)  

That said, these recipients have moral and legal obligations to be aware (and responsible) for receiving any public aid.    It's no different from welfare.  

If it is later determined that certain recipients were not eligible, then they should repay said benefits.

These benefits are not a windfall to spent at their whim on non-essential items.  This is not what the money was intended for."

It no longer matters whether I was entitled to receive the money.  The new legal rule is ""finders keepers"".  I suspect that these same recipients would sing a different song if the government or their bank mistakenly debited their account and refused to return the money.  Then it would be fraud and horrific behavior.  

The law should apply to everyone, regardless of circumstances.  If we think that unemployment benefits should be more generous (indeed, they should!), then our representatives in Washington should change the benefit level so that everyone can participate.  The amount of benefit that a person receives should not be a consequence of chance or mistake.  That is unfair to everyone else."

2020-12-11 22:45:01,"I find this similar to an under-reported issue with the our current ACA, where some ACA coverage is not insurance, but just a loan for medical expenses.

It's also walloping people perniciously during COVID.

In the 38 states that expanded Medicaid, people get expanded Medicaid (or sometimes another Medicaid) if their incomes are to 138% of Fed. Pov. Lvl. regardless of assets).

In 10-14 states, including blue MA, MD, and NJ, expanded Medicaid is subject to estate Recovery of all bills paid out for people 55 and over.

(There is no insurance at all!  It's a loan until death for medical expenses.)
 
It's quite the financial bomb for some people, who mostly don't know about it.  Notification varies by state, and is often inconspicuous.  

Some of the states with this problem are blue MA, NJ, and MD, which exercise their option to do that recovery, though other states have stopped since the main provisions of the ACA went into effect in 2014, making all ACA coverage real insurance in those states. (E.g. CA, OR, WA, MN, CT, NY, CO stopped.)

Other states, such as PA, never recovered ordinary medical Medicaids, so had nothing to fix.  (Federal rules require only the recovery of long-term-care Medicaids, not ordinary medical coverage like the ACA provides.)

The problem remains in 10-14 states, including, surprisingly, those blue ones.

Note: People unfamiliar: details and online references are in the Wikipedia article on Medicaid estate recovery.  (Which I actually wrote most of.)"

The government paid private companies, in some cases, to determine the proper amount of benefits;

The companies made errors, resulting in millions of dollars of overpayments; 

Now, instead of making those for-profit companies responsible for recouping the overpayments, many states are ignoring the overpayments and forgiving recoupment, thereby charging the innocent taxpayers for not merely the correct benefit payments but also the overpayments.

And you wonder why all right-thinking taxpayers hate the government."

2020-12-11 21:50:35,"There is a way to resolve this over payment problem!  I work for Seattle Goodwill as an employment specialist through our Job Training Center.  We laid off 2192 people on 4/2/2020, and I have been helping folks with their unemployment issues with my fellow employment specialists since then.  Here's what works to get the over payment issue resolved

1.  Write to your State Senator, your State Representative, your Governor's Office, your US Sentator (s) and Congressperson.
2.  Include your UI Claim #, the date you first filed for UI, how long you received UI, whether you are on PUA and or PUEC.
3.  Explain why you shouldn't have to pay the over payment because it is not your fault, you did not set out to defraud the government and clearly state all the ways you have tried to resolve this.
4.  Explain how this burden is affecting you and your family, including lack of food, inability to pay bills and pending homelessness.
5.  Express appreciation for their assistance and ask when you might hear back from them.

Yesterday, one of our employees, who was facing a $10,505 UI over payment charge and who had not received her UI claim for 9 weeks, had the over payment dropped, $2400 released to her bank account and had her claim switched to PUA (something we asked for back in June).  It took three days after her State Representative launched an inquiry."

2020-12-12 12:07:19,"The author and many of her readers are sensitive but instead naive and unfair. If they received $1,000 from a bank teller who cash their $100 check I assume they would also say it would be cruel to ask for the $900 back if the customer was unemployed or otherwise in need. What they fail to realize is the $900 is someone else’s money. It’s not an extra apple picked from a tree. 

No rational person minimizes the pain and suffering of this pandemic but what is described here is one step above stealing. No, the recipient did not take the money but he or she accepted it. It doesn’t become theirs because they need it. If more funding is needed then push our government to do so...and figure out how and who will pay for it."

She was called back to work in July, and now works about 28 hours a week at $13.50 an hour."" she didn't think anything was incorrect when she began making about $200 more a week than when she was working? $750 divide by $13.50 is 55. So She would have to work 55 hours a week and thats before taxes.I get the hardship, the mistakes but like when the IRS mistakenly deposits tens of thousands of dollars, you have to know - that's not yours."
2020-12-12 14:42:19,"I lived in Hawaii when the pandemic first kicked off. I was a full time Uber/Lyft driver and in March, business ran completely dry.

Because I was a 'gig worker' and 'indipendent contractor', I was told by the state that I did NOT qualify for regular UI, and that I should apply for PUA benefits. In May, after surviving off of a credit card for nearly two months, I was finally approved for for PUA benefits and began receiving weekly payments. It was such a relief to be able to once again be able to eat everyday and not have to pay rent with a credit card.

In the summer, my benefits were put on hold (just like every other Hawaii PUA recipient) for about 2½ months while the Employment Department went through and reconsidered everyone's claims to make sure they were not fraudulent. In September, I was finally reapproved for PUA eligibility and began receiving payments again, after once again having to live off of a credit card.

In November, to my complete shock, the Hawaii Employment Department denied my PUA eligibility and said that under new Hawaii law, as an Uber driver, I was actually considered an ""employee"", and that I actually qualify for regular Unemployment Insurance. Even though they told me I DID NOT qualify for regular UI.

I now owe the State of Hawaii $20,700 in ""overpayments"" that were 100% their fault.
And there is absolutely NO WAY I can pay it back.

I am now facing homelessness and irreversible financial hardship, all from a program that was supposed to help."

2020-12-12 15:21:33,"This is beyond cold. 

From the article: 

Many states waive overpayments on regular unemployment insurance when no fraud is involved, or when paying the money back would cause someone significant hardship. But the federal rules for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance prohibit forgiveness. Even if the state is at fault, the recipient is on the hook.

States often start collecting the overpayment automatically, by withholding a portion — from 30 to 100 percent — of future unemployment benefit payments."

That was finally addressed and the state started paying legitimate claims. There are at least 3 programs, each came in succession and each paid a different amount. It is impossible to know what is what as far as what one receives. One has to take the state at it's word. I sent proper documentation. I don't want what I am not due but certainly do want what I am due. I paid taxes all my days. Republicans in my state have made the unemployment system a mess to make it difficult to use and to shame the users in hopes people will not collect what little is rightly theirs. The GOP should be the ones feeling shame."

2020-12-10 13:42:40,"I think this is overblown.  I’m sure there are children who have not had contacts with other children, but that is the extreme example.  Any family can form bubbles with other families to enable their children to have playmates.  My grandchildren actually have several other children in their bubble. The families are all very careful and are very aware of Covid restrictions.  Sometimes they have to temporarily back off when one of the families goes off the grid but mostly they are able to socialize with other children.  Right now I think it is best not to make every element of the restrictions into a catastrophe. It just makes the situation worse and people unhappier over a necessary situation.  Do you think our parents or grandparents who lived through WWII bemoaned all their restrictions the way we do today?  And they had a good many restrictions. Maybe everyone should read up on the 1918 pandemic."
2020-12-10 13:51:18,"Well, social standards have changed, but I think the effect on young children is overstated. In the past, the majority of children grew up on farms, largely isolated from children and adults other than their family, except for church once a week. The current (pre-lockdown) expectation of swim class, Gymboree, play group, book club, playground, and scooter meetups is a relatively new thing. It’s also a creation of upper middle class parents, who do not represent the majority of the population with young kids, even though they represent the majority of NYT readers.

Now, the effect on elementary school age kids, and their parents, is profound, as they school virtually while their parent or parents attempt to work."

We presently have an entire generation of unhappy people who were sent off to daycare at 6 weeks, pre-school at 24 months...If we stop trying to push kids to be social and just let them be and grow in the context they are in, it is surprising how well-adjusted they are.

I’m more the one troubled because I can’t hold her hand and walk or have her help me water my plants or dig in the garden. She did cut my daffodils with her mother in spring with my watching and waving from inside. 

Like others have said, children who live in more rural settings don’t interact with other children as much and may have siblings. Wonder how kids survived in centuries before on farms that needed them to work and not play with other children. Again, they may at least have had siblings."

What I can't handle is the parents who give their children the idea that other people are dangerous. We've encountered them a few times. You can be friendly (and firm about not playing) from a distance! When my son wants to play, I tell him that we can't today, but we will do that some other time.

Our daughter remained in preschool the entire time of the pandemic except for one month. She has been in kindergarten this year.

Not a single child in either institution has been infected with the coronavirus at school. There was one minor outbreak in a different classroom of our school this year, but it never turned into a hotspot and one class simply had to isolate for 10 days.

Our daughter has gone to the pool, gymnastics, and dance. She does play dates with families in our pod￼￼. We are lucky that no one in our household of three is a high risk person.

Overall we have kept gatherings small and infrequent except for getting our child out and well socialized with her friends. We have noticed that other families have completely quarantined, so our daughter has not been able to play with those kids and we miss them.

It is socially awkward finding out where parents stand on this continuum.￼ But the good news with small children is that you do have a choice because they themselves are not at high risk. Young children stand at the very back of the vaccine line.￼￼￼"

Being an only child, my older parents were very protective of me.  I lived in an adult world.  Was it psychologically dangerous for me?  Well, I'm a retired RN, have 3 degrees, have been married to the same person for 43+ years, have 2 successful sons, and have a group of friends where I live, from former residences, and from college.  There's a difference in being alone and being lonely.  Adults need to utilize this time to encourage reading and imaginative play.  This is also a time when children can learn to like themselves for who they are.  If you don't like yourself, how can you like others?  Adults, please stop complaining about this pandemic and state quarantines in front of children.  You're only sowing seeds of fear and distrust."
2020-12-10 14:38:22,"I'm so glad to see an article talking about this - it's such a difficult situation to navigate. Our daughter is a few months shy of 3 and has been home with my husband and I since the start of the pandemic. Pods were not an option for us as everyone in our social circle opted to put their kids back into daycare as soon as it became available. My husband and I have been debating putting her back in lately for several reasons, but haven't yet because I'm pregnant and my FIL has MS. She hadn't interacted with another child since the start of the pandemic, except to wave from a distance while outside, until recently after my pediatrician told me at her check up that she needs social interaction with other kids, at least once a week. She told me a few months off of social interaction wouldn't have an effect, but now that it's getting closer to a year, we needed to address it. It honestly really freaked me out. We have a great relationship with our daughter and honestly (and very fortunately) have not found the pandemic/working from home situation to be overly stressful. In some ways, I think my husband and I are more relaxed not having to be in the office and having the extra time with our daughter. But I see the comments about children growing up in rural communities and on farms way back when and agree - is this all overblown at this young of an age and how do we know when the guidance is so conflicting?"
2020-12-10 14:44:01,"So what is the control group in this situation?  Is it the middle class toddlers that go to gymnastics and swimming daily with 1.5 siblings?  I know plenty of people in my generation that didn’t do any of that stuff and I definitely didn’t grow up doing it to the degree that many kids do now.  To identify the abnormality, you need to identify the normal.  What is the normal?  The portion of our society with kids in daycare from an early age or with stay at home moms who take their kids out for play dates every day?  Every child’s and every generation’s childhood is different, so it’s a bit difficult to have a control group.  I can say that I personally think that my 16 month old is benefitting from all of this because she is getting to see her father and I way more than she would’ve gotten to and we spend a lot more time together as a family, even on the weekends, than we would’ve in normal circumstances.  I always think it’s important to study, but I personally didn’t start even consider worrying about this until NYT started doing articles about it."
2020-12-10 14:56:20,What a lot of privilege shining forth!  Of course your kid’s developmental milestones are more important than my life!
2020-12-10 14:56:40,"OH my goodness...does anyone consider that families that live in rural or other remote areas have perfectly healthy children? Is the ‘isolation’ difficult?  Yes, perhaps.  But perhaps it is made more difficult by all this angst.  Perhaps we could focus on teaching our children the value of solitude, of internal focus, of mindfulness. And ‘isolation’ is not more difficult than a child who becomes infected and infectious, possibly falling ill, possibly facing long term consequences even in recovery, possibly infecting others.  Are we really THIS fragile, or are parents overly invested in what they consider the ‘perfect’ childhood and ignoring the resilience and capacity for adaptation that is also part of our humanness."
2020-12-10 15:05:18,"I am very concerned about all the articles, inaccurate at best, telling parents and children to be afraid. We are dealing with a pandemic and could be teaching our children about compassion and caring for one another. Instead we are treating them like victims. They are not victims. Where are the adults? Where are the responsible leaders? Our selfishness is what is hurting our children."
2020-12-10 15:07:00,"While the lack of interaction among young tots is a concern, when my children were young one of the things I enjoyed most was taking them on outings to the various activities such as grocery/department stores, swimming/gym lessons and the occasional restaurant for lunch. As my 18 month old grand daughter grows up, it is disheartening to me that she has not gotten to experience  these ""adventures"" of being out in public that are  important avenues for developing critical language and social skills. When this pandemic is over I can't imagine how  overwhelming this might feel to her the first time she goes into a grocery store or to the YMCA. We know children are resilient and adapt to situations but I would imagine there will be some catching up for them in these instances."
2020-12-10 15:08:43,"What an inflammatory article, way overstating the impact of the past year on young children or children of any age. Children don't require constant stimulation and in fact it is good for children to have long periods of quiet thought and contemplation as this encourages creativity and imagination. In the past few decades, children have been increasingly scheduled with lessons and play dates and so forth, to what end I do not know, but it completely ruins the spontaneous interactions of children on their own, finding each other willy nilly. 
Now that we find ourselves in this situation, it is more likely the parents who find themselves in such a completely different rhythm who are the real problem here and who are unable to step up and actually ""be"" with their children. (See article in this paper in which a mom is lamenting the loss of her daily latte). 
Parents need to understand: children are resilient. They will adapt, learn and change as a result of this experience, and as long as they have ""you"" in every intimate sense of what that means - not your distracted, self-indulgent version, but the real, and genuine you - then they may thrive even more than they would have had they not had this time with you. 
Stress, and uncertainty aside, at least we have each other and that connection can survive anything!"
2020-12-10 15:13:20,"Seriously?? A generation raised in quarantine? We've been at this for less than a year, so wringing one's hands about a generation raised in quarantine because a few privileged toddlers are missing playdates and daycare seems an exaggeration. I must agree with the most of the other commenters that children are amazingly resilient and the likelihood of harm from this time, especially for the kids profiled here, will be negligible. Few children of my generation went to nursery school and we somehow have gotten this far, no harm done, and a true generation of European children suffered real harm during WWII, and the ones who survived rebuilt their lives for the most part. These articles, I suspect, are meant as anxiety clickbait for folks who don't have real problems to worry about, and want to feel like they are being seen."
2020-12-10 15:15:24,"My daughter is 6 so not a toddler but has been basically isolated from other children save a handful of times. Just this week she started outdoor kindergarten with two other children. By day 2 she was showing off her tree climbing skills. No amount of coaxing from me could previously convince her to try that, she needed the influence of her peers. 
It recently occurred to me how often we say children are resilient during this pandemic but adults are fragile. I’m interested to have a better understanding of that switch. There’s nothing wrong with parents wanting to raise healthy, thriving humans and to be concerned about this prolonged period of isolation."
2020-12-10 15:22:36,"There is great research waiting to be done on parallels between the Covid generation of kids and the European wartime generation of kids. 

I imagine we are getting a tiny taste of what France (and maybe other places) were like in World War 2.  The same sense of:  Everything stops.  The world is suddenly threatening.  Familiar places become strange.  Being outdoors is dangerous.  Other people, or a chance encounter,  might spell death.   You're in the same place, but it's suddenly different.  There is a siege mentality.  (In Britain, people even had masks -- gas masks.)  Then the siege will be lifted, and the world will claw its way back to normal.  

I think we will see many similarities when the research is done."
2020-12-10 15:34:24,"My parents' entire childhood was marked by a cataclysmic world depression followed by six years of world war. Their generation not only survived but thrived.

So I'm not entirely sure how a year, if that, of ordering Door Dash, watching Netflix and taking classes online will damage an entire generation."
2020-12-10 15:44:00,"Here’s a thought. Don’t raise your kids to live in fear. Be safe, sure, but teach them that risk is something you can only manage, not eliminate or hide from. It was the lesson I taught my kids on vacation in Hawaii over Thanksgiving. 

This way they’ll grow up to be functioning adults who can handle what ever life throws at them, unlike what we see now with millennials."
2020-12-10 15:45:44,"Reading this article brought me to tears. With all the misery of the past year, the inherent sweetness of Rhys Sheppard waving to the babies on the wall calendar touched me in a way I couldn’t have anticipated. I have two sons with families that live out of state and it will be nearly a year since we were last together.  I thought I was managing Covid relatively well until this article.  Rhys’ gesture was exquisitely poignant and heartbreaking."
2020-12-10 15:47:14,"Research shows that the development of human vocabulary takes place during the years between zero (!) and six. Infants and toddlers who are simply talked to, using adult vocabulary, are actively and passively developing rules of grammar and their own lexicon, the size of which will determine their success in reading, in school, in work, in life. This time that parents have with their young children is a golden opportunity simply to talk to them and read to them, producing a next generation that is articulate and literate, open to sophisticated thinking and education. If parents and caregivers only knew this, I would have no worries about the effects of the pandemic and all sorts of hope for future generations."
2020-12-10 15:57:15,"Is the experience of only children much different than kids with siblings? My guess is yes.

And as I’ve seen for many years, the parents of only children are the most stressed out people I know. 

I’ll admit that I’ve been deeply grateful during the pandemic that I have twins. They are very different kids, but they are close."
2020-12-10 16:16:18,"My daughter is 4 and prior to Covid she has made a few good friends. At first she missed them and talked frequently about wanting to see them ""when the virus goes away I want to play with Maya"". Now she has become more resigned but also more outspoken and she complains about the prolonged isolation and missing her friends. Both my husband and I work from home and she is the only child. We go on/off to daycare. In Sept we enrolled her in a 2-day per week program and we send her on/off when cases are relatively down here in Minneapolis. It helps her interact with other children and also helps us, with meeting our work commitments."
2020-12-10 16:17:14,"My area is dogs, not humans. However, my experience with canines is that when they are raised from puppyhood with no socialization among other dogs, and they are purposely kept from interacting with their brethren when they are out in public, they become fearful, reactive and often downright aggressive. All of that “stranger danger” behavior can expand beyond other dogs, too. A dog that is not raised to accept strange dogs will often not accept strange people. Strangeness becomes threat. Fear of the new. 

Anyone who has experience with shelter dogs knows that they can be trained to overcome their lack of early socialization — at least in part. A fearful dog will never be a fully confident dog, but can be conditioned to manage his fears. 

Children are resilient creatures, and a major advantage they have over canines is their ability to understand caregivers’ explanations for why distancing is necessary (people aren’t bad or scary, it’s  the virus that is bad, and the virus is temporary, etc.). I think the thing to avoid is the insidious poison of fear. Don’t project your fears onto the kids. They pick up on that, just as dogs do. Kids look to their caregivers for signals. Send the right signals, and your kids (and dogs) will be fine."
2020-12-10 16:35:38,"Growing up on a farm, 5 miles from a town, a mother that only learned how to drive the year I was born, and 20 miles from the nearest relative, I too was isolated.  I had a sister 3 years older and one that was 1 year older.  Did that affect me, not sure, but I do love to socialize now!"
2020-12-10 16:39:12,"I’m curious how these children will react once allowed to interact and what the longer effect on social bonding outside of the family unit will be.  The world they know is bad, scary and dangerous if you go beyond your family unit.  Will we see long term stranger danger type reactions?  Will these children have trouble leaving their family units?"
2020-12-10 16:42:59,"A lot of posters have suggested that taking a break from hyper-scheduled lives, activities and playdates might be beneficial — a throwback to the way ""things used to be."" They clearly aren't parents of young children today. 

The point isn't cancelled activities; it's the loss of regular contact with other children and indeed, with virtually any other people — normal socialization that has always been a part of childhood. 

An exacerbating factor, which hasn't been pointed out, is that far more children today are only children, meaning they have no playmates at home.

Following the ubiquitous advice to avoid playdates and social contacts throughout spring and early summer, we saw our six-year-old develop behavioral problems and depression from the isolation and tedium.

Yes, children are resilient. We moved closer to grandparents and doubled our bubble to two households, which was enough to turn matters around for now. But the prolonged isolation is an unnatural experience that goes far beyond canceled activities. There's nothing positive about children spending a year without seeing other children."
2020-12-10 16:47:47,"Oh Please!  One year of having intense family time, interacting with your parents is a God send for this generation.  Too many young kids are dragged from one ""experience"" to another, completely frazzled and unhappy.  Finally they get to be home and chill.  This idea that you ""must"" expose your young child to play dates and interaction with other young children in order for them to be socialized is a myth.  Healthy, loving interaction (including playing) with their parent(s) is what a young child needs to be socialized.  Yeah, takes a lot of time to be a parent, spending day after day with your kid, but it's worth it.  I'm speaking as a homeschooler, who lived on a boat with my family for four years, and my son once went 8 months without seeing another child and guess what - he's now a productive, active, super social,  23 year old man who has an amazing job he loves, which pays handsomely.  The time away from society allowed him to grow up being himself, free from trying to fit in with his peers.  Which allows him to be a happy adult, who knows himself and what/who he is."

Only a culture as self absorbed as ours could be so selfish.  I'm sure millions will be extracted from parents pockets in the form of therapy bills and other scams."

I was an only child and don’t recall peer interactions as a huge part of my life (I did have cousins I saw several times a year, elsewhere in the state, and did eventually go to first grade) — living in an adult world suited me fine.

2020-12-10 17:27:30,"Hello all,

There a lovely psychology professor, Yuko Munakata, who did a Ted talk who I think would have a lot of insight to offer on this topic; basically, none of can make accurate predictions of how are children will grow up and who they will become, because even children raised in the same household, with shared experiences, can have widely different perspectives and personalities.  

So probably, many kids will be fine without any lasting effects but some children may have lingering issues, even with the relatively short quarantine. Just saying “ kids are resilient” isn’t actually try as children aren’t a monolith but parents also shouldn’t worry unnecessarily because those kinds of predictions are unknowable.

I truly believe the best thing we can offer both kids, parents, and just other humans in general right now is less derision and dismissiveness and more support, kindness, and empathy. 

*Sorry for if this sounds cheesy or corny!

Happy Holidays everyone."
2020-12-10 17:45:51,"The most important paragraphs are the final ones.  They should have been the focus of this article.

I have 3 young kids, and the pandemic has really hit home what I long thought: kids can handle quite a lot if their home environment is stable, loving, and more-or-less peaceful.  Also: parents set the tone on that.

There's so much hand-wringing among my affluent peers about a year of sub-part education, lack of social options, lack of this or that opportunity.  But....the kids will be fine. Seriously.

The kids I know struggling the most are the ones whose parents are not modeling resiliency themselves.  The parents set a very anxious tone at home and the kids pick up on that.  

This all is really really hard--I totally get it.  Our lives were upended, and our support structures were ripped away from us overnight.  It's stressful.  Lost income is an issue for us and many others.  Distance education for a 6 yr old....ugh.

But as parents, my husband and I vent to each other at night, but make sure we pull our stuff together when we're around the kids.  We acknowledge that times are hard right now, but reassure them that we'll all be ok and point out the many things we have going for us.  They miss their friends and school and grandparents, and I let them know that it's ok to miss them....but also that this will be over soon and in the meantime we just need to count our blessings."
2020-12-10 17:51:14,"The title is misleading, probably purposely so.  But it is not true that an entire generation is without social interaction of peers.  Yes, I'm sure it may be true for some kids.  But most families I know allow some sort of limited interaction (mostly masked and outdoors) with neighbors, or have created pods, or are bunkering down with extended family members.

Not to mention FaceTime with relatives.  Not that the youngest kids care about that, but the youngest kids don't really interact all that much with other toddlers anyway, in my experience.  They are much more focused on caregivers.

Social interactions have been curtailed for sure, but it's hardly a generation being raised without other kids."
2020-12-10 17:54:16,"Very young children will be most effected by the home environment in a pandemic. Problems will be caused by the parents arguing, any domestic violence, psychological stress and tension, depression and neglect, food shortage, unsafe conditions of any kind, etc. 

If your child is sleeping well, eating well, smiles and able to laugh, playful during usual waking hours, the child is probably fine. 

A young child takes their cue from the parents. If the parents are feeling miserable and/or angry, that's how the child feels and assumes there's something wrong with themselves. 

YOU are their playmates now. They can find other kids later."
2020-12-10 18:00:44,"I find it telling that so many Boomer comments tend to reflect on the generations they raised as the source of all frustrations in the world today.  Who is currently throwing a hissy fit that they didnt get their way in the election?  Who couldn't manage to balance a budget throughout one of the most prosperous periods in human history?  Who gets triggerred daily by misinformation pouring through their social media feed?  

Isolation leads to insularity almost by definition.  Less than the pandemic, the increase in digital isolation bubbles and accompanying narcissism will have a far more profound impact on the resilience, or lack thereof, of civilization as we know it.  In that sense, I would be far more concerned about teenagers and recent graduates than toddlers of today.  Nature will eventually force the Boomers to transition to the next generation whether they go willingly or not."

2020-12-10 18:33:28,"There was a time when half the world's children grew up on remote farms, with only siblings as close companions. My wife grew up on such a farm, and was only sent to school at age 9. She developed perfectly normally, became a professional botanist,wrote a number of acclaimed gardening books, took thousands of incredible photographs for her books, brought up our 4 children as I went through the stages of an engineering career, managed our finances, and remained a wonderful companion and friend to me until she passed away last year. We travelled together extensively, including a 2 year safari in our Landrover through 9 African countries. She had many friends, and colleagues who admired her. People who become anxious, even hysterical, because their children are missing a year or so of close social contact due to virus precautions, must be cautious. Children pick up these anxieties, wonder what is wrong, is it our fault, why are mommy and daddy upset because we aren't at school? This is where the problem lies. We have lost perspective in this fast paced ultra competitive world. If we tell our kids it will be fine, then it will more likely be fine. A year or two here or there out of school will not affect our children's development, unless we as parents make it so."

Meanwhile, if parents spend time with their children, the children will thrive, as infants and toddlers are more dependent on their parents than on interaction with other children."
2020-12-10 20:22:19,"Not having kids to play with is potentially problematic, particularly when friends or potential friends are forced to avoid each other, but young kids learn a ton from interacting with adults as well, when that's possible; unfortunately, in most cases, that is not happening either. Most young kids are being placed in front of screens eight hours a day and that is what can cause irreparable harm in a matter of months for young children."
2020-12-10 20:29:25,Parents don’t have to do this to anyone their kids. My sole priority during this pandemic has been to make sure my 3 year old has no idea it’s happening and his life is effected as little as possible. We still have play dates and he still goes to daycare. Any parent who prioritises the 80 year olds who are most likely to die over their childrens well-being is making their own decision and they’ll have to live with it.
2020-12-10 21:01:46,The idea that there will be a pandemic generation is pure hyperbole.  It's not going to last even two years.  Children endure privation in many ways that substantively contribute to their development but I don't think that this brief hiatus is going to do much damage.
2020-12-10 21:33:30,"The first two paragraphs of this article read like the start of a Stephen King novel. Calm down, it's only been a year, and human interaction will be more or less back to normal-ish by next summer. Most kids probably won't even remember it. I think Tyler and Braden will survive missing a few play dates."
2020-12-10 21:38:38,"Since when is there only one way to raise children? What did we all do before there were play dates and over-scheduled infants? I had almost no contact with other children until I was 6 years old. As a result, my contact was with adults who read a lot and gave me a head start on vocabulary and adult reasoning. I developed an active imagination. I learned to be alone. I learned to enjoy my own company. I learned to be independent.

Yes, I had some difficulty relating to other children when I went to school, but it was temporary. The lessons I learned as an isolated only child stayed with me for life. I have never regretted my early childhood, and I now find myself prepared to be old, alone and at peace in this pandemic."
2020-12-10 19:09:48,It’s been 8 months. Get a grip.
2020-12-10 19:43:03,Give me a break.
2020-12-10 19:38:06,"Gee, a childhood is lost in a year or two.  Imagine that.  Of course we could all let them play together, gather and nourish covid 19, then share it with us, and we could all die, and wouldn’t that also be a loss, and with no adults to support them, what a loss for the children, too.

Pulitzer Reporter, please grow up.  We are fast approaching a death count that will surpass the total military deaths in World War II, and sometimes compromises have to occur.

Londoners in WW II took all that Hitler had to throw and survived and defeated his efforts, surely we can suffer a mask or two, and a few days without the playground."
2020-12-10 20:49:31,"A generation, generally, is considered to be about 20–⁠30 years, making the title and this article meaningless."

2020-12-10 18:55:10,seriously 1 year; 18 months?  is the human genome that vulnerable?
2020-12-10 19:06:21,"“People are trying to weigh pros and cons of what’s worse: putting your child at risk for Covid or at risk for severe social hindrance,” said Suzanne Gendelman, whose daughter, Mila, 14 months old, regularly spent rug time with Alice McGraw before the pandemic.

Complications from COVID for children is comparable to that of the flu (see article below).  Would Ms. Gendelman be asking herself the same question if this were a regular flu season?

The morally correct, or so I've been told, cost benefit analysis Ms. Gendelman should be doing is weighing the costs of severe social hindrance with the risk of her child spreading COVID to someone who is more vulnerable to the disease.  Her child, thankfully, is very unlikely to suffer any severe consequences from COVID if she were to get it.

2020-12-10 20:39:24,Not sure how ~ 12 months of relative isolation = “a generation?” Isn’t a generation about 20 years?
2020-12-10 18:55:42,It hasn’t even been a year.
2020-12-10 19:38:57,Stop - for God’s sake this is a year at most - not a “generation”. Polio was a much worse threat. Stop the hype.
2020-12-10 20:00:36,"Yes, good grief.  I had no playmates as a young child, then, we moved to the country.  No one to play with there either.  I believe believed it blossomed my imagination. I never went to pre-school or kindergarten -- didn't have those then.  I hated grade school though -- all those unimaginative kids who were sometimes pushy bullies.   In adulthood I have enjoyed the fact that my partner and I give each other alone time and private space.  Home alone most days because of the pandemic I enjoy my 'self' and the quietness of my surroundings.  Over blown, gosh, let's worry about something else (instead of the 3,000 per day deaths) article."
2020-12-10 20:31:00,A year or so does not a generation make.
2020-12-10 19:14:36,"Goodness, we have not been under quarantine long enough to start stoking these fears.  a ""generation"" has not been under quarantine---we would need to be quarantined for 20 years for that to happen.  

I get that it is not ideal, and that we need to watch the effect.  But the alarming title of the headline seems undo."
2020-12-10 19:17:42,It hasn’t even been a year. That hardly counts for a generation.
2020-12-10 19:02:22,I wonder where the myth began that children get good social education from other children. The best socialized kids spend more time with grown-ups. Close the classroom; keep the teachers. End child apartheid. Add more grown-ups to children's daily experiences. It takes the WHOLE village to raise ONE child. Totally individualized curriculum. There IS a well considered plan. Change everything you believe about education.
2020-12-10 21:43:12,"I am an only child who moved all the time and spent most of my time with adults. I’m reasonably social and well adjusted. It may help that I’m an introvert. Point is, I played alone on the playground, and in hotel pools by myself all the time. It wasn’t sad, I read books and developed a vivid imagination. 
I have a two year old and an infant. We go out on walks. The saddest thing I experience is when my very social toddler waves and greets people and they outright ignore her, and I have to make excuses for them. They didn’t see her or are busy, etc. That has nothing to do with the pandemic. It’s just a lack of overall courtesy that I don’t know how to solve for."
2020-12-10 21:44:41,"I was under quarantine for my first 5 years due to polio.  Then the vaccine came out and we went to school.  We played only with the two neighbor kids for those 5 years.   Only today do they make a big deal about it.  These kids will be fine, just like we were."
2020-12-10 22:25:34,"Oh please not another hand wringing, whoa is me article.
We have had the virus for 10 months, not a lifetime; not even a few years!
Many children in my area have NOT suffered solitary isolation I can assure you - there have been play dates, visits to the park with other families, organised games, walks with the whole family including grandparents, pool parties, birthday parties, halloween trick or treat  etc etc.
Most kids are not depressed or  damaged because of lack of social interaction.  While toddlers may have been more closed confined, the majority of kids have thoroughly enjoyed being off school for these months."
2020-12-10 22:49:31,"Maybe these days kids do need more socializing outside the home because their parents are constantly staring at their iPhones and laptops instead of engaging with their kids. Smartphones have put a real kabash on random, spontaneous conversation and it seems sad, at least it looks sad when I see it happening in public. When I was raising small kids there were definitely times that I longed to get back to my own ""grown up"" stuff, but my kids weren't continuously made aware of it because most of the time those thoughts stayed in my head. Now with smartphones small kids are constantly, physically reminded that this thing called a smartphone is way more important and more interesting than they are and then as soon as they're able they follow suit. Enjoy the down time, kids really do say the funniest things when you least expect it. The stuff kids say is a window into their world and that window closes soon enough."
2020-12-10 23:25:15,"One wonders how the children of the pioneers and farmers out in the middle onowhere ever managed.  I guess they talked with and helped their parents and played with their siblings if they had any.  Toddlers under the age of two really don't ""play"" with each other.  Their play dates were a well deserved chance for their moms (yes always their moms in my day) to have some adult conversation.  These kids will be fine.  Older one in my affluent suburb are playing together as usual and going to their hockey practices, etc."
2020-12-10 21:14:26,"Settle DOWN, author.  It's been NINE MONTHS, not 15 years.  STOP contributing to the pandemonium..."

2020-12-10 21:59:25,Who came up with this overwrought headline? Totally ridiculous to imagine that nine months or a year of quarantine will wreck a “generation.”
2020-12-10 21:30:30,I have to agree with some of the other comments. The byline “A Generation Is Raised in Quarantine” is sensationalist nonsense. This started in March in the USA. It’s not even going to last another year. Stop with the hyperbolic clickbait please.
2020-12-10 21:47:35,Oh I should have said it amazes me that this reporter could write this article without mentioning the relatively recent polio quarantine.  His grandparents can tell him about it.
2020-12-10 23:00:10,"My, my, my... 

How old is the author of this article? It's only been 9 months. Also, the multi-year polio crisis is within living memory - and it was mostly children who got it. Then, all children's areas in North America were closed and the very real threat and wreckage hung like a pall over a full decade. Those children are the majority of NYT's readership. They recovered just fine.
Before that it was war or TB and its quarantines that destroyed the lives and plans of young adults. 

Also only children are not a new thing. Lots of kids grow up surrounded by only adults and are as functional and happy as anyone else."
2020-12-10 21:58:25,A generation raised in quarantine?  It hasn't even been full year yet for goodness sake.
2020-12-10 21:46:27,"Wait. What are you saying? A generation?  It's only been nine months.  Many children have chapters in their lives without a circle of friend, some never have more than classmates - not real friends - until much later.  it's all in how the parents frame it. If you teach children it's a problem, they will understand it that way.  If you approach it as a different, but in its own way special, time, then that is how they will remember it. think ""Life is Beautiful"".  Children accept the world as it is, and accept their reality as normal unless you teach them otherwise.  Get a grip."
2020-12-10 23:08:09,"Let's keep it in perspective, please.

This is not their entire childhood, it is just several months...a blip in their childhoods.

Look at the bright side. They have more bonding time with their families and more opportunities for parents to be more creative with creating stimulations, introducing them to pets and nature."
2020-12-10 21:22:25,"Oh, maybe the editors will hear from plenty of people who, as children, were social outcasts in public schools. Janice Ian even wrote a haunting tune about them, ""Seventeen."" As I recall, the song is about a form of ""quarantine.""

Maybe you should go looking around the newsroom, if you want to see the results of decades-ago, 12 year long social pandemics.

Meanwhile, I agree with other commenters who note that children are resilient. I lived through the Cuba Missile Crisis. It's not easy to think the world is going to be incinerated, when you're 11 years old. It didn't diminish the other, fonder memories of childhood. I even missed being killed in an earthquake, by 20 seconds in 6th grade, when part of a school building collapsed and tons of bricks fell to the ground,  just before I entered. 

I'll bet if you do a story on events like these in people's lives, they'll be very entertaining."
2020-12-10 23:49:26,"I worry less about the lack of socialization and more about the way that this is shaping kids' perceptions of the world. Fearing other people, expecting bad things to happen at every turn. When we left my daughter's preschool for the last time in March, we said goodbye to her teacher fully expecting to be back there the next day. When we received word later that the school would be shut down, we initially thought thought that it would just be for 2-3 weeks. Then we thought that we would be returning in the fall. Now, it is becoming increasingly likely that my daughter will actually never return to that school again. I think that when we can leave our homes again we will need to establish some structure to help kids work through their emotions about these losses in order to become more emotionally resilient, rather than perceiving them as reasons to distrust the world."
2020-12-10 23:49:34,"As the father of a 3 year old I understand the authors points. What is telling are the comments from grown adults below who think the 2-3 year old brain is just like theirs and will shrug it off. Perhaps these adults should try the experiment and not teach a kid language between 3-5 and see what happens.

A child's brain is a sponge between 2-5 and they learn ques during this time; and forgoing this education until older doesn't mean it is the same. 

The idea of having a 3 year old unable to mix with other 3 year olds perhaps makes sense if you live in a world 300 years ago in very very remote rural America - but to compare that to a kid in a city of 9 million out their window they can't talk to is just nonsense on the part of commenters."
2020-12-10 23:37:22,"Uh, ""a generation?"" It's been 6-8 months. This kind of sensationalism about possible futures - without real analysis of many other actual generations who survived much longer and more traumatic isolation and deprivation outside a couple of sentences on the Depression - only serves to increase the anxiety of already over-stressed parents and caregivers. It's a clickbait headline though the article does at least touch upon the absolute centrality of parental care and interaction."
2020-12-10 23:54:43,Every child I know or see seems to spend most of their time parked in front of a screen whether there's a lockdown or not. Why weren't parents as worried about the lack of socialization before COVID?
2020-12-11 00:12:51,"I agree with the other commenters that this is way over overblown. Not only has the quarantine been less than a year long, a ""generation"" is technically a group of people classified together who were born within a 30 year period and we're not even 1 year into this. Some kids will look back and have periods where they did not have contact with other kids but it's hardly over much of their lifetimes."
2020-12-11 00:19:12,"I’m really getting tired of these kind of stories. The kids are fine. Millions of families move due to job transfer, pulling kids out of their environment and they survive. 
Stop your whining, it’s only been nine months. Engage with your child, step up and be a parent."
2020-12-11 00:21:01,"The biggest tragedy is that if these kids live anywhere close to as long as half of the commenters, the world they inhabit will be scarcely livable due to climate change."
2020-12-11 00:14:23,"A generation raised in quarantine?  Are you kidding me?  It would be one thing if we were living in bubbles only getting to go outside once every seven years like the children in the Bradbury story, All in a Summer's Day.  Honestly, we've been in ""stay at home/social distancing mode"" for less than a year...some places not at all.  Sorry, but this is very much a white people, upper middle class and above problem.  (And it's not that less affluent and/or BIPOC don't want their kids to enjoy unfettered, unrestricted fun and socialization, but many of folks are struggling to pay rent, put food on the table and keep the lights on.)

Dr Hagen is more on target than those wringing their hands about  toddlers missing birthday parties or music lessons.  Toddlers don't  know what those things are until they are introduced them.  Buy a set of toddler/primary rhythm instruments (or make your own from items around the house) and have zoom music time with other parents and kids.

I might remind urban parents that some rural children often have very little contact with other children until the go to Pre K, Head Start, day care or Sunday School.  

Quit whining."
2020-12-11 00:26:19,"I keep telling my kids that this is one big piece of sand, one of many in their lives, in their shell that will help make a pearl. Read Susan Cain’s book Quiet, the Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking. Take it from an introvert, if you survive this epidemic, you’ll be ok. For now, let’s build our tolerance for quiet and uncover our inner resources."
2020-12-11 00:24:30,"Tragic as it is, this is not a game ender, not for one year.  Now sure, if it was many years, maybe.  But if humanity wasn't as resilient socially to go without 1 year, we'd be a doomed species.

More important to stay safe, to not have kids get Coronavirus, and to deal with the consequences of being socially distant.  It's not like there's some ideal answer here, but this is a lot of too much attention to the wrong thing, imo.  

Do what you can, but really, 'ongoing social deprivation'...seriously, that's melodramatic."
2020-12-11 00:30:15,"1.  Kids are more adaptable than you think.

2.  Kids are growing up too fast.  Slowing things down for a year may be a good thing.

3.  Lots of kids spend too much of their time doing one sort of organized activity or another.  Learning to spend time with yourself is a lifelong gift."
2020-12-11 00:34:25,"Doesn’t the author know anyone with more than 1 child?  I’m the oldest of six at a time when you first set foot in a school for kindergarten and kindergarten was only a few hours.  We didn’t have play dates. No mommy and me, etc. I wouldn’t trade my childhood for the world."
2020-12-11 00:26:16,Seriously?
2020-12-11 00:44:44,"I feel for the author of this story. I feel for all parents. I am not one. That said, I can imagine 9 months locked down with a threenager can feel like a.. generation? As a career educator - and speaking strictly from the experience of welcoming my young charges back to a school building in Manhattan after 9 months of it being closed, my observation is that your children are so incredibly resilient. Parents right now are trying their hardest and doing their best. Your children will be ok."
2020-12-11 01:03:38,"This is ridiculous. My 2 sons spent the first 5 years of their life at home with each other. I left the work force and stayed home for 7 years until my youngest started kindergarten. No day care. No play dates. No outside activities that we couldn’t afford anyway. They played with LEGO and science kits, read books and rode their bikes and built snow forts etc etc. While we are a family of introverts who come from families of introverts, my sons were straight A students and are both very successful, intelligent  men in their 30’s. They are both in very happy marriages and enjoy being home and will never be ‘jocks’ or have lots of close guy friends. They have great lives and I have zero regrets. I see too many kids who never have time to just BE. Stop organizing their lives and let them use their imagination."
2020-12-11 01:23:45,"Commenters here are dismissive. Might it be because they don’t have young children? 

Today my 3 year old daughter was playing on an empty playground and when she saw kids coming, she ran away and was very frightened. 

I have not spoken to her about COVID but she just hasn’t seen other children or played with them in so long. She also thinks it’s normal to wear a mask and asks me for her mask even when there’s no reason to wear one. She thinks it’s normal to apply hand sanitizer throughout day. 

It will take time to unlearn these behaviors,"
2020-12-11 01:30:48,"How does one year translate into a generation? Oh please. What kids absorb is the notion of being damaged by parents who think lack of peers for a year will somehow destroy a generation. The idea that somehow kids are damaged by this lack of companionship for a year is the problem rather than the actual circumstances. 

Resilience and adaptability are the hallmarks of long term success and happiness. Parents who have luxury to fret about the damage being done to their kids because of lack of companionship would be better served if they used the time to encourage their children to develop solo activities and the idea of being able to entertain themselves."
2020-12-11 01:32:50,The pandemic will kill millions.  It will limit the development options of children (assuming their parents or grandparents don't die) for a year and a half.  Do the math.
2020-12-11 01:28:25,"Ridiculous. Humanity has lived through wars and pandemics and survived. This, too, shall pass."
2020-12-11 01:38:54,"I am really not worried about most kids because they are not socially isolated, they are living with their families and getting plenty of language stimulation and social stimulation."
2020-12-11 01:40:12,"This is horrible. We know that young children are not vectors of this virus. What is happening in these families feels like a form of Munchausen by Proxy, where parents are isolating their children to extreme effect in order to virtue signal. The child who warns of ‘uh oh people’ approaching is far more likely to need psychological intervention in her life rather than any medical therapeutics for Covid-19."
2020-12-11 01:51:45,"Children need to attach to adults, not to other children.  Look up attachment theory and Dr. Gordon Neufeld.  Children don't learn from children, they learn from the adults who take care of them.  I can't believe anyone is concerned because their toddler isn't playing with other toddlers.  Sheesh - talk about first world problems!"
2020-12-11 01:53:54,What is a play date?
2020-12-11 02:09:16,"This article really resonated with me. My daughter was 7 month old in March, she is now 15 months. A pivotal part of her learning and development has occurred during lockdowns. I have had 2 primary concerns 1) giving her experiences with social interactions outside of our family and not associating other people coming close as something to be “feared” and 2) speech and language development.

We chose to send her to daycare in August at 12 months. At that point it was evident she was desperately craving social interactions when she saw neighbours and even saw pictures of babies in books. It was important to us that she build social connections with individuals outside our household and have the opportunity to play with her peers. While close physical contact is not encouraged at her daycare it is not actively discouraged. She is happy and thriving. It was a difficult decision but we have no regrets. All our family lives abroad, we work from home, wear masks and have practiced social distancing, so we were comfortable taking on the additional risk of potential exposure through the daycare. We are fortunate infection rates are comparatively low in Toronto.

My latest concern is speech development. I have many friends with children the same age and they are all delayed. The daycare workers all wear masks throughout the day, so I worry that not seeing their mouths as they form words is delaying her somewhat. We are seeing a speech therapist to learn compensating techniques."
2020-12-11 02:12:56,"I’ve believed for a long time now that isolation during my early years might have contributed to my anti social tendencies. Having said that, I am pretty skeptical that one year of quarantine is going to do lasting damage to toddlers. I was probably always going to be an introvert and still I can get by fine when I need to."
2020-12-11 02:14:55,"I am sorry, but people are dying.  Your kids will survive.  Pretend you are living ""Little House on the Prairie"" if that helps."
2020-12-11 02:18:04,"What this article fails to address is the even more use of electronic devices by young children.  These distractions, for both parents and children, were not available during the Great Depression. As a pediatric occupational therapist, I am very concerned about the social, play, and motor skills of the littlest generation from the prolonged isolation due to COVID.  I already see so many Kindergarteners who can’t hold a pencil correctly."
2020-12-11 02:24:22,"One thing this experience has really brought home for me is the fact that kids take their cues from their parents. 

If we take things in stride, so will they."
2020-12-11 02:27:00,"As a child psychologist, this is quite a complex issue to think about, it’s not like “is this a bad thing for a generation?”  Developmentally, it’s going to have a different kind of impact, positive and negative, at different ages.  Certainly, the level of stress that the parents are experiencing financially, or in their work, or parenting, plays a crucial role in the child’s experience in the home.  As does the ability of the parents to take care of their children, giving them the attention they need, but, also the opportunity to explore and learn on their own as well. Every child, even in the same family, as every parent, will react in their own unique way."
2020-12-11 02:28:27,"Modern parents don’t know what normal human behavior is. For most of the last 100,000 years, there were no crowded playgrounds or play dates. Toys and games, yes. Socializing, absolutely. But age-segregated social bubbles or kid-only birthday parties? Not normal.

Humans have evolved in a wide variety of social environments, from farms to fishing villages to nomadic tribes. Few of them have the population density to support age-segregated social groups. Nor is playing with other kindergartners the best way to learn the social skills needed as an adult.

Many little kids prefer to be with their parents or older relatives than same-age peers. That’s perfectly normal. There is plenty for parents to worry about without feeling guilty for loss of birthday parties or crowded playgrounds."
2020-12-11 02:34:43,"Since when is a generation one or two years long?
Although I agree that there are some real concerns here, I don’t believe you should make sweeping generalizations about the future impacts of COVID-19, distance learning, and quarantines."
2020-12-11 02:39:22,It took no time for my 5yr old to understand that others are to be feared - the damage of social distancing was immediate. It's going to take him a long time to unlearn that fear and relax. It breaks my heart.
2020-12-11 02:46:41,"It will be fascinating to read, once all is in perspective, about all the unintended consequences of our Covid response.  That, of course, assumes that an honest appraisal of those consequences comes in my lifetime.  Given that mainstream sources seem certain, at least as of this date, that to keep kids (and the rest of us) safe, we need to isolate, shutdown, quarantine and be fearful of dying, I wonder if that honest assessment will come in my lifetime as power centers rarely, if ever, acknowledge they were wrong, at least for so long as those who head those power centers remain in control."
2020-12-11 03:11:51,"My 19 month old couldn’t be happier these days, and nearly half of her life has been during covid. People are resilient, especially children. 

Sending my love to all the locked up parents out there who, like me, read this article and needlessly stressed out."
2020-12-11 03:24:01,"these claims seem to miss the fact that hundreds of thousands to millions of kids grew up in the past generations and this current generation of children without going to tons of birthday parties, having large groups of friends around them, and even being isolated in the crowded classroom. for them this situation might have been kinder than the isolation in amongst the many."
2020-12-11 03:22:05,"Nine, perhaps 10 months.  Not a generation.  Get a grip."

My daughter paused immediately, her eyes wide with amazement, her mask barely hanging on, then she tapped my hand and said “mommy look, a girl”. I felt her curiosity to want to “know” this little girl. Then I quickly prepped for the moment she oversteps the required distance, if it comes. I could sense the other mom going through the same mental steps. 
Feeling my heart sink a little, I watched my little girl walk away in the other direction having made the choice to pull a book to the floor and with one dramatic gesture the way only a 3 year old can, get down to pretend read it."

The sad thing about Senate Republicans' refusal to entertain a meaningful relief package is that the money is only going to be needed for a few more months.  But if nothing is done in the interim, millions more will get infected, tens of thousands more will require hospitalization, thousands more will die, thousands of small business owners will lose forever what they worked their whole lives to create, and millions more will fall below the poverty line and go hungry.

Businesses get a lot more government handouts than the average citizen.

Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats need to emphasize the danger to workers returning to specific jobs and that this requirement will protect them, their families and their communities. Too many workers are afraid to return to their jobs due to the fear of Covid 19 exposure. 

Before I retired from a construction job last August, I was fortunate to have worked for a contractor that was very conscious of the dangers posed by this disease to his crews and clients. In addition to providing difficult to obtain masks, he also implemented strict protocols among employees to minimize exposure and contact, primarily by limiting his crews to two man teams. How much more this added to his overhead, he never revealed, even though I queried him several times regarding that particular issue. But, I do know that it cost him. We never took any stimulus money, we never lost any time at work and from the beginning of the pandemic until my retirement we were never exposed to the virus. As far as I know, he and his employees are still virus free and thriving."

It appears to be pure political hypocrisy to worry about the deficit after the Trump/Republican tax cut, which did little to stimulate the economy which was chugging along ever since the Obama administration in 2009 rescued the country from the financial crisis of 2008-09 banking crisis. That debacle was due to greed by many of those fat-cats who were later rewarded by the Trump tax cut. 

The hypocrisy of the Republican Senate under the ""leadership"" of McConnel knows no boundaries.

However, bailing out owners for $5 for every $1 given to citizens at large is not morally right. 

First, as a business owner you trade in some economic stability for the potential upside of making a lot more money. Once a business is established and employs many people, its often the case, especially without unionization, that the sum of the value created is primarily created by the employees who stock shelves, machine parts, habdle customer service calls, etc and not one executive. But the executive/owner takes the majority of value in profits, and is justified in our society through them taking the risk of failure and often putting their own assets on the line, though employees also invest their time in business and opportunity cost of working elsewhere/learning skills. 

Its then morally unacceptable to bail out business owners. 

Also, the world needs organized businesses, and so everybody can't be a small business owner working on their own. We need employees. 

Finally, so much of wealth and success is dictated by socio economic history. Wherentou go to school, money you inheret, systemic racism. So, business owners often reflect an unbalanced - ie white and wealthy - subsection of the population. Subsidizing them perpetuates systematic economic unfairness.

This heavier concentration of incomes and wealth among the elite probably results in lower savings rates and larger proportions of their incomes going towards consumption spending for the middle class and poor. Excluding increased savings by the very wealthy, partially funded by new record levels for NASDAQ and the other stock indices, savings rates for the other 90% of consumers have probably been forced downward by this wealthy-friendly economy. 

Student loans for the middle class also probably show artificially high savings rates because payments toward these loans are counted as savings. In short, many consumers are cash-strapped at the moment.

And, this underlying economic tilt toward the wealthy just exacerbates prevailing economic problems caused by the Covid-19 virus.

2020-12-10 23:58:53,I just got back from Secession Art & Design where I picked up a beautiful pair of earrings for my wife for Chanukah.  And while I was there I ordered takeout for dinner from Bac Lieu across the street. It felt great to support a couple of local businesses I hope will be around post Covid.  I hope congress steps up and does its part.
