2020-08-08 17:31:46,"One problem behind this is that in medical education and well general education there is nearly no distinctions made among ""elderly"".   Some may have many good health span years, others be on last legs. Yet no distinction.  The age difference may span 40 years!  Still someone who could enjoy and participate in the world for 20 to 30 years maybe lumped into the ""old"" category the same as someone  that even in best environment would be unlikely to live 6 months."

2020-08-08 17:26:07,"We get a lot of slack for those numbers, but then again, we do count even suspicious cases, not just the deaths of confirmed cases. I'm actually proud of this honest approach in face of a twisted international numbers competition. When confronted to excess deaths, a lot of other nations will have plenty to answer for."
2020-08-08 17:53:53,"An unbiased comparison is only possible, when also considering other covariates relevant for the morality rate. Why has Nigeria so little death cases? Most likely, because their life expectancy and also their median population age is low. So there is less population at Risk to die from the virus. 

Similar for the US, which ranks 38 in life expectancy and 61 in median age. All the countries in Europe have a much higher life expectancy and as a result also an older population, therefore having more population at risk. In addition we should not forget, that all these countries had much less time to prepare, but now have their crisis management in place and working. That’s why the death cases are also much lower, for some even 0 since weeks. 

Not so in the US. Just look at Florida, there it just started. I think another month down the road, and I am sure the US will also overtake these countries with the deaths per Capita."
2020-08-08 18:14:07,"Don't expect European politicians to learn anything new from this episode; their system worked exactly as intended, providing plausible deniability to officials with accountability while signaling just clearly enough to gatekeepers on the ground to ensure the problems were handed to those with diminished influence. This dynamic is well polished and rarely poses risk for them."
2020-08-08 18:40:05,"Tough issue. Society has been excluding the aged for some time now. I'm 74 so I have an oar in the water, although I'm a long way from a care home. I would have to consider going to one very carefully before I did that, so one issue embedded in this discussion incorporates the validity of congregating people in such places after their sell-by date. 
As it relates to COVID, I try to dig into the stats (being a numbers person) so as to understand the nuances of the hyperbole we hear in the media/news. One area that appears incontrovertible, based on CDC information on deaths by age as measured for the six months ended July 29 is that 80% of all deaths are among people over 65. While there is data on comorbidities, I haven't yet been able to build a matrix that relates age and comorbidities. So the simple truth, like it or not, is that our older population and their declining health/immune systems  proves a truth known for millennia: older people are at much greater risk from disease, and all risks. Survival of COVID via heroic efforts e.g. ICU/intubation, is extremely low. Having watched my son intubated 3x for viral pneumonia and then double lung transplant i won't put my family or me through that. 
IMHO, society via shutdown, massive unemployment, food shortages and hunger, school interruptions, etc. is penalizing the populace without giving much thought to perhaps alternatives. What are they? I don't know but high density care homes aren't among them."
2020-08-08 17:43:05,"One of the things we have learned, specifically in the failures of New York and Cuomos fatal mistakes of sending elderly back to their nursing homes, is that this virus is extremely deadly for the elderly.

Conversely we have also learned that for people 40 and under, the virus is not deadly at all, and for children it’s far less lethal than the flu.  Unfortunately we have not adapted to these facts the same way we have learned things about the elderly.

Pragmatic policy would be to protect the elderly while being far less cautious for young people."
2020-08-08 18:26:23,"Why do you think we are all “youth obsessed” and most avoid talking about old age and death? Nursing Homes. Unless you happen to be wealthy and/or have family members that are willing to take care of you in the most personal ways possible... A nursing homes is where many of us will end up. Adding insult with injury... If you happen to be very poor, mentally unstable, unhealthy and/or a person of color things will be much worse. 

Then you have this moral question: Who lives? A surprisingly strong hurricane/earthquake/virus... arrives. The staff of the nursing home must chose who lives and who is left behind... to die. Who do they pick? You? 

With the world getting older far quicker than most thought possible (Look at Japan)... A nursing home is going to be the best of a very bad situation."
2020-08-08 18:38:40,"Put a mirror up to our own face.  We live in a sick care system where if a person is over 65 and needs a bypass, doctors and hospitals will flock to perform that care because it's covered by Medicare.   For hundreds of thousands of dollars.   But if a person is over 65 and merely sick, too bad.  And if a person is under 65 and really, really, sick with an expensive disease like cancer, then double too bad.   Just because we are all laser-focused on COVID does not mean we are not part of an incredibly cruel system that allows invasive surgical procedures to be imposed upon our own elderly.    Heaven forbid we even think about this cruelty lest we be accused of having ""death squads."""
2020-08-08 18:28:49,"Do you really believe the elderly deaths are all from incompetence? That in every country, every state and region, every city, every county that everyone is incompetent in the exact same way from world leaders to county health departments? No, it is ageism and it is greed. The elderly are seen as not worth saving, as only a drain on the economy through medicare, Medicaid, other social programs. It is with a cold hearted calculation that they are deemed expendable for the greater good. Many of these decision makers will be shielded from nursing homes because of their wealth, but we all we can do is hope that karma comes back and one day they will be the ones who beg for a mask."

She tested positive for coronavirus a few weeks ago during an outbreak among staff and residents. She had no symptoms and eventually tested negative. She has advanced directives in place. We know that she wouldn’t have wanted hospital care, had it come to that. That’s her choice to refuse. Hers."
2020-08-08 19:54:50,"People aren’t living in nursing homes because they are in great health. I think it entirely reasonable to prioritize care for those who are likely to benefit rather than those who are chronically ill and who have already outlined their natural life expectancy. Statistically, the older you are and the more medical problems you have the less likely to survive any prolonged critical illness. That is no less true in the era of covid 19. In my mind what is more problematic is the lack of symptom management for those who are dying."
2020-08-08 20:11:10,"Do we need to make choices? Protect the young or save the old? I am old. I am very healthy. I live without any assistance. When the tide changes, the assistant is likely to be younger than I. If there is danger, the young person's health is more important than mine. If I survive and the young person does not who will take care of me?"
2020-08-08 20:25:07,"The authors make no mention of poor nutrition being a contributing factor, and there is no doubt that our main hormone for modulating upper respiratory infections -  vitamin D - was a critical missing factor.
 
Had the elderly residents of nursing homes (and people of color) not been deeply deficient, then the Covid-19 lock downs might not have followed. A severe flu season with a modest mortality rate among the young has never suggested broad lock downs, in the past. 

There are no announced plans or medical direction to change things. Doctors don't want to admit that the majority of their patients are pre-diabetic or worse, because the SAD 'standard American diet' they recommend is indeed the culprit. A bolus of Vitamin D costs 39 cents, and should be in their food year-round.

The shame is that this whole scenario may repeat itself annually, because the SAD high-carb, cheap fare leaves the old vulnerable as helpless, diabetic wrecks. Medical authorities and supporting families were complicit, content to be willfully ignorant. 

Now they must wonder what will happen if a flu with high mortality comes through. Perhaps the old residents will recall what one of their contemporaries - Grace Slick - suggested they do 50 years ago. ""Feed your head""."

And mostly because of devastatingly poor decisions made by government officials who did little (or worse) to assist these facilities, their residents, and their employees. “Look at Belgium” is a distraction when the leading paper serving the New York area should instead be reporting on the failure of these officials to be held accountable for their role in the nursing home tragedy. And it should be asking questions about what they are doing to avoid a repeat if/when we have a second wave of COVID in our area."

Trump has had it out for these demographics since he stole the election. Now he’s succeeded in killing 162,000 citizens, many of them 65 years of age or over. He must be positively giddy that so many of his ‘enemies’ are dying of coronavirus. This truly is his way of making America great again. It’s come to this. How horribly tragic."

I’d like to see some comparisons with East Asian countries, especially those with strong Buddhist and Confucian foundations, cultures with far greater respect for aged human beings. Here in America we have a culture that feels the aged having nothing valuable to contribute to society and that at best they are object of humorous derision and at worst a costly burden to society."
2020-08-08 17:56:33,"Where has this story been for the past five months as you and other media continued to report the poor performance by the US compared to the wealthy nations of Europe? The one statistic that was usually missing in those stories was the death RATE. Sure, we have the highest death COUNT
because we have far more people than the European nations. But according to this story, Europe has the highest death RATE. That’s not to say we did a great job containing the virus. But it probably wasn’t as bad as reported. I think it was Mark Twain who popularized the observation:
“There are lies, damned lies and statistics.”"

2020-08-08 21:18:46,"Quebec province in Canada, particularly the Greater Montreal region is responsible for at least 60% of Canada's mortality numbers. They were residents of Senior residences, public and private where many neglectful public health authorities allowed to go on for months until the numbers rose above 5600 deaths alone. Brussels is mentioned here, but it seems many international cities and states have failed the older populations. One can only demand that public officials are called to account - unlikely though. I will continue to pray and urge all to be mindful of the measures that may prevent the spread of this virus, perhaps in autumn especially (North America) and perhaps right now."
2020-08-08 21:56:22,"The argument over providing scarce medical care to over 65 or young person with more years to live is a distraction. Nursing homes in Europe, as in USA, are generally for-profit entities with a financial interest in letting a resident die if their care takes more than a couple of hours a day.

In USA, under ACA, an insurance company must spend at least 80% of revenue on care - or return money to insured. No such requirement in nursing homes. By the time the Real Estate Investment Trust (building owner), the management company, the Administrator and Director of Nursing get their profit sharing and bonuses - not much left for patient care. 

For the 10 years I have had relatives in nursing care, infection control has continued to deteriorated. It takes money for PPE and staff time ($$) to exercise proper infection control in low paid staff going from room to room to room.

In nursing homes, their are a multitude of serious circulating pathogens the public has likely never heard of. As well there are rampant pressure sores (look up these horrors that are totally preventable) that lead to lethal sepsis or - for the lucky - survival via amputation. 

Making the debate about young lives versus old lives serves the financial interests and status quo in nursing care."
2020-08-08 22:04:30,"So much misinformation. 
Europe has twice the population of the U.S., but far fewer fatalities. Why is that so hard to understand?
Many places in the U.S. are also prioritizing who gets care. In the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, fewer than half the people needing an ICU bed were able to get one. 
We were warned at the beginning of this pandemic that the curve needs to be flattened in order to maintain a reasonable standard of health care. When the curve is higher than the line that represents the potential for health care, health professionals are forced into making very uncomfortable choices. 
What is remarkable in this article is that some places in Europe have been turning away senior citizens in need of treatment even when health care is available."
2020-08-08 23:08:47,It is a difficult situation with senior citizens. As one doctor noted hospitals are there to treat people so they can recover. One reason that healthcare is so expensive in the US is that over 40% according to the Kaiser Foundation goes to patients with terminal or chronic conditions like advanced Pancreatic Cancer. There is little medical personnel can do. Palliative care pain medications is the best solution not hospitals
2020-08-08 23:26:26,"The societal contract has completely broken in the US. In many cultures that value the elderly, those older family members helped care for grandchildren, contributed money toward marriage or toward a home. These elders provided Inheritance and family businesses for the next generation and often sacrificed immensely for their kids education. In our very individualistic modern western culture many parents consider their jobs done once their child is 18. They contribute little to nothing to help their kids or grandkids and many barely cared for their own kids at all, doing the minimum to get by as parents. The majority of this generation voted GOP and do not want to pay taxes toward the welfare of the next generation - schools and state colleges beg for funding and minimum wage is not livable, while the over 70 generation collects better pensions and social security checks than the young can ever hope to have no matter how much or long they work. And medicare is the most generous healthcare in the US and it is paid for by working people today who are barely getting by themselves. So I think it is a shame that society has abandoned their elderly. In 2016 the majority of people over 65 voted for Trump and supported him completely until COVID was a threat to them, regardless of how others were treated or how many children were placed in cages. So maybe it is time for the elderly to consider whether they have reaped what they sowed."
2020-08-08 23:26:45,"I'm old. I've lived most of my life. If a physician had to choose between saving my life or that of someone much younger with their life ahead of them, I hope that a physician would not choose to save me. Covid-19 hasn't just changed our way of life but how we must look at life itself. Hard choices will have to be made and they have unfairly fallen on physicians. Our governments, everywhere, need to have a plan to control this virus or the current death toll will seem like nothing."

The Times could write a daily article about all the blunders in the New York City Area and its environs. Our state government endangered nursing home patients by sending COVID-19 patients there for care. Our federal government sent medical supplies out of the country at the beginning of the pandemic, thus depriving our health care workers of protection. After telling states to fend for themselves, the federal government confiscated shipments the states had ordered and sent them to states with Governors willing to kiss the president's feet. He even bragged about doing it. Is the Times trying to make us feel better by comparison? Call out the plunders at home. We don't need a blow by blow of some very small country overseas."

And even worse the federal people at the border don't have the competence to declare anyone sick. We already know that some people can be asymptomatic yet carrying high levels of the virus.

2020-08-11 13:58:13,"Another cruel absurd PR move while lying about the three tools we have to reduce the virus spread: masks, distancing & washing. All made possible because mcconnell & every gOP.

And, as the gOP push for school reopening, “97,000 [ US] children tested positive for Covid-19 in 2 weeks” , trump’s son will not attend class in school. 

Please ask every politician/staff, if their children & grandchildren will attend classes w/o COVID- 19 precautions.

2020-08-11 13:48:56,Our life with Trump as President is bouncing from distraction to distraction.
2020-08-11 13:48:56,"On August 1, 2014 at 9:22 p.m. Citizen Trump wrote on Twitter: ""The U.S. cannot allow EBOLA infected people back.  People that go to far away places to help out are great-but must suffer the consequences.""

For Trump, cruelty is a feature, not a bug."
2020-08-11 13:53:02,"Trump will probably ban us, unless, of course, we have Putin's false vaccine.  Autocrats will kill us all with pseudoscience and snake oil."
2020-08-11 13:56:13,"Being a citizen is supposed to mean something. 
It should certainly mean you have a place to be, a place to live,perhaps especially when you are sick or vulnerable. 
Use a quarantine, as other nations have figured out."
2020-08-11 14:01:34,"Trump is desperate to look like a leader, and even more so to cling to his base, a base that loves moves that appear strong.

The horse has left the barn. Keeping one person out who’s sick while the virus is already spreading rapidly? This slows the virus how?

Remember his initial ban? After it was established, some 40,000 people came through! There were reports of no screenings at airports. 

He loves those EOs. Details, not so much."
2020-08-11 13:47:58,"This is absurd.  
With trumps handling of the Coronavirus, let's just say that there is positive pressure in the US.  
It's a bit like wiping sand off the bottom of your feet before stepping onto the beach."
2020-08-11 13:49:32,"This might have been useful, if done based upon medical science, about five or six months ago. Now, with over 5 million reported cases of infection already here in the US, this sounds like nothing more than an effort to rescue Trump's campaign from his own incompetence and malpractice."

2020-08-11 14:07:41,"The right of return is a fundamental, inviolable right of a citizen. It is the mark of a growing movement towards autocracy to consider that certain categories of citizens -- for whatever reason it be -- ought to be denied entry to their own country."
2020-08-11 14:07:35,"So this moron trump wants to stop US citizens from returning to their own country, but he stands around and openly encourages people inside the country to refuse to wear masks, protest and resist any reasonable attempt to restrict large gatherings, undermines our public Heath professionals and refuses to provide any national leadership?

If you need any more evidence that this fool is in the pocket of Putin and trying to drag this country down a rat hole, look no further.

2020-08-11 14:03:21,No one has mentioned testing those suspected of having the virus at the border/airport.   A positive result should mean quarantine at government expense on US soil.  What else do we hire these people for?!
2020-08-11 14:09:50,The right to return of citizens is law in civilized countries.  It is not in third world countries.  Another marker on how far we have descended.
2020-08-11 14:03:49,"So if my US passport doesn’t get me home, just what good is it, anyway? Not only that, but maybe I’d better not leave, which, of course, turns the entire country into a prison, with Trump as warden and Miller as his trustee. How about this, from say, a Joe Biden-type President: “Every American has the right to return home, no matter how sick. Period.”"
2020-08-11 14:04:46,"So, what’s next? Declaring martial law to address a major health crisis largely of his own making? And that could be assuaged, however partially and late, if there were national leadership and intelligent decision making?

Or maybe one shouldn’t put ideas in his corrupt brain because he’d likely think that could also help with elections..."
2020-08-11 14:09:50,"We should already have some way to test and then move to quarantine anyone coming to our airports. That is understandable, and makes sense given that we know isolation of infected people is one part of an effective strategy to fight the virus.
But we have a lack of rapid tests that are necessary for such a good policy to be enacted. So Trump's response is not to ensure that we have rapid testing at all airports, and quarantine quarters reserved too, like in the empty airport hotels. His bright idea is to just stop their entry to the country. It's cheap but unjust. Where are these people to go? Why does the U.S. lead the world in infections and deaths due to COVID infection?
What we need are widespread rapid tests, bold-face warnings to wear masks, socially distance, avoid crowds where ever they occur (indoors especially - bars, sports events, lectures, classrooms, restaurants). The virus is still out there. We must be vigilant, because this is not just like the flu or common cold. The federal government should take charge of this, but right now that means just Trump and family and cronies, so let's hope the National Governors Association steps in its place."
2020-08-11 14:14:31,"As an American citizen, I want to ask where is our home on earth?"
2020-08-11 14:20:47,"I happen to be a USA citizen stranded abroad.  What happens if I am denied entry?  Does Uncle Sam put me up at the airport hotel?

And how much sense does it make to stop letting folks in when everywhere else in the world has a lower level of infection?"
2020-08-11 14:21:51,"Silly goose if you want to control citizens how about blocking large irresponsible gatherings that threaten vulnerable native populations, and others against their will. I am looking at you Strurgis Motorcycle Rally among others. More cockeyed political shenanigans in place of leadership. Why do I keep being surprised at the never ending dark and possible illegal maneuverings of this administration."

2020-08-11 14:24:55,"Given the tens of thousands of new cases of COVID-19 each day in our country, stopping a citizen from coming home does nothing but infringe o his/her rights. 

This is unacceptable and all of us must oppose this.

And please vote in 84 days!"
2020-08-11 14:25:36,King Trump once again overestimates his power to rule over us.
2020-08-11 14:30:09,"As Pastor Niemoller, a Lutheran minister confessed after WW2:

    First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—
         Because I was not a socialist.

    Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
         Because I was not a trade unionist.

    Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
         Because I was not a Jew.

    Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

And now under Trump?

First they came for the suckling baby refugees at the southern border, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a suckling baby refugee at the southern border.

Then they came for the stateside undocumented immigrant and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a stateside  undocumented immigrant.

Then they banned foreign students and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a foreign student.

Then they banned work permit holders and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a work permit holder.

Then they established ""Citizens Academy"" to train US citizens how to surveil and arrest the undocumented, and I didn't speak up because it was somebody else's matter.

Then they banned me from returning to the U.S. with my American passport, because they heard that Covid19 is in Canada, and I could not return to America. 

Game over."
2020-08-11 14:25:51,Stephen Miller’s fingerprints are all over this latest dangerous absurdity.
2020-08-11 14:27:15,"Yet another senseless action. Trump does essentially nothing to stem the internal spread of the virus, while pretending that closing the borders to people who belong here will do anything to help.  He could easily order all persons entering from countries at risk to quarantine in the US, and achieve essentially the same protection from the virus.  Trump's intentions are clear. This is an appeal to his anti-immigration base in an election year, not an act in the interest of safety to the population.   Expect it to be applied unequally, particularly at the Mexican border where those prevented from entering are citizens and permanent residents who are disproportionately Latino."
2020-08-11 14:17:59,"Inane as well as unconstitutional.   How would it be enforced?
The only countries which have US customs and border officers present at airports are Ireland and Abu Dhabi.  
Will they require airlines to perform PCR tests prior to boarding to the US?
Would they refuse entry at a US airport, and require the US citizen or resident to fly back?  Wouldn't the airlines deny return boarding in that case?
If you walked across the bridge from Juarez to El Paso, would they make you walk back?  If you drove from Canada, would you have to turn back?  If you told the Canadian border official why you were reentering, wouldn't they deny entry into Canada?  Would you be stuck in Nomans' Land at the Champlain crossing?"
2020-08-11 14:28:21,"First they barred the wall jumpers and I didn’t say anything because I was not a wall jumper
Then they came for Daca immigrants and I didn’t say anything because I was not daca
Then they came for the legal immigrants and I didn’t say anything because I was not a legal immigrant
And then they came for the citizens and me and there was no one to help me."
2020-08-11 14:32:49,"I think the thing to understand is tha Trump has zero interest in whether this makes any sense at all, and even less in whether it’ll be tied up in coutrs for six thousand years—the point is that he wants to look good for the wacko-birds, and has a bottomless pit of taxpayer money to spend on litigation.

Briefly, it ain’t his prob and it ain’t his money."
2020-08-11 14:33:09,"Someone must have shown Trump a big, colorful chart that said people who cross the border to work vote Democratic. But didn't he close the border with Mexico? Canada won't let us in, Europe too. Our travel list is small. What am I missing?"
2020-08-11 14:34:34,"No doubt, Trump and Miller think U.S. citizens returning from abroad are possibly infected with foreignness, particularly if their skin is not white. If, as the draft is reported to say, citizens and legal residents cannot be blocked as an entire class of people due to exposure to a communicable disease, that is exactly the discretionary discrimination made possible, sub rosa. An order permitting the mandatory quarantine of U.S. citizens after arrival from abroad might be to the point, the discretion to block entry entirely points to another agenda."
2020-08-11 14:35:23,Yeah. Real Americans stay in America.
2020-08-11 14:36:56,Just when you thought he couldn't get any weirder.....
2020-08-11 14:43:28,"So far, no criminal, self-dealing, anti-American, anti-democracy, unconstitutional or treasonous act by Trump has caused any of his devoted cultists to cease worshipping him.  It makes one wonder how they can claim to be Americans."
2020-08-11 14:44:24,"The pure hypocrisy of this president is staggering.

Trump blocks American a few hundred American citizens from re-entry to the U.S. because of suspicion they might possibly be infected but totally endorses and encourages massive gatherings of maskless people at rallies with no social distancing.

Trump's ignorance is so far beyond belief it can only be construed that he as intentionally inflicting harm on America.  

Retaliation for being behind in the polls?"
2020-08-11 14:44:55,Bottom line:  People who are registered as Democrat should not travel abroad before November 2020
2020-08-11 14:46:36,"This immigration ruling is just Part 1 of the Trump plan. If it takes effect, Part 2 is to declare being a Democrat as a communicable disease -- just in time to reduce the number of Democratic voters for the election."
2020-08-11 14:39:14,"My sense is that such a rule would be ultimately found to be unconstitutional. 

If there is a well founded concern, and I'm not sure there is, the answer would be simple but requires providing a quarantine place. Test; if positive, quarantine for a week and re-test."
2020-08-11 14:46:45,"So he DOES believe in testing after all, especially if it means keeping people out of the country."
2020-08-11 14:37:35,"Same old man Trump.  Will never change.  The way forward is to screen the incoming, test, quarantine, isolate as needed and put app on their phones to track for future contact tracing.  Then business will go forward as normal.  All blockage does is harm the economy.  Read the WHO manuals."
2020-08-11 14:38:37,Blocks citizens from returning home. Just great. I’m marooned in Venezuela for months and now this!
2020-08-11 14:47:38,Trump and Miller now want to carve us up into real citizens and the rest of us. I doubt he'll be barring those white people flying home from Europe. It will be all Mexican dual citizens.  Unconstitutional!
2020-08-11 14:49:34,"What is this ""reasonable belief"" by the authorities based on?  The citizen's  skin color?, their accent?, their looks? - all of which Trump focuses on.  Or more measurable parameters such as temperature, symptoms, a 15 min COVID-19 test (which Trump allegedly receives daily).  He has stooped to a new low."
2020-08-11 14:50:31,"This comes about 5 or 6 months too late.  

The New York State tragedy was delivered by persons coming here from Europe.  Their nationality mattered not."
2020-08-11 14:50:44,"While other countries welcome their citizens back with open arms and provide treatment, the US is shooing theirs away. November can’t come soon enough for some Americans."
2020-08-11 14:56:03,"Considering that the US is now the global epicenter for the virus due to this administration's singularly abysmal handing of the situation, this makes less than zero sense. Just like everything else they have done it is bereft of any actual purpose other than to provide chum to his ever shrinking base of supporters. For decades the GOP mantra has been limited government; ironically, this administration has done nothing but prove how important a competent federal government is to all of us. Send the GOP packing in November."
2020-08-11 14:54:00,How about a quarantine for two weeks. That's what Canada does. But that makes too much sense.
2020-08-11 14:51:10,"How is this even news? No one is traveling. No one wants us! Everyday he throws out a can of worms. Can we just get rid of this guy, already?"
2020-08-11 14:51:18,"Well, that will surely fix America's COVID problem. Leave a few Americans stranded in Mexico and POOF! Virus will disappear. What a moron."
2020-08-11 14:52:06,"It would make more sense to deport all the participants in the Sturgis rally. Oh, but that is his base."
2020-08-11 14:53:49,"Probably an idiot statement, but, it's something only Trump could have thought up.   Why would the U.S. fear people bringing covid from overseas at this point.

The rest of the world should be banning US."
2020-08-11 14:56:23,"I’m trying to understand the thinking here, considering how small the effect would be.
Is this another election ploy, a step to shutting the border altogether close to the election, with passport holders more likely to be liberal?"
2020-08-11 15:08:32,"If I, an American citizen, were outside the U.S., why would I want to return to the country where Covid-19 is still spiraling out of control? As long as I could get an absentee ballot to vote BLUE in November, I'd stay where I would probably be safer."
2020-08-11 15:11:46,"While it would make complete sense to quarantine *all* new arrivals to the u.s. for 14 days - what is written doesn't make sense.  As somebody living overseas - the U.S. is the worst possible place to be as it relates to corona.  Ie, anybody coming to the U.S. is by definition lower risk than anybody leaving the U.S.

But it's still putting the wagon before the horse.  Until the U.S. has basic controls in place to reduce the spread in the U.S. - it's not worth caring about people from abroad.  Fix your testing.  Fix your controls on travel to reduce spread.  And actually enforce lockdown until things are under control."
2020-08-11 15:00:57,"Belief is not the same as guidelines.  It seems that a well-maintained list of countries that have high infection rates based on specific criteria is not going to supersede 'belief'.   

My cynical view is that any criteria of this nature would bar travel from certain states in the US, hence is untenable."
2020-08-11 15:07:17,"So, if trump makes an overseas trip and tests positive, does that mean he can't come back? If so, it might be worth doing."
2020-08-11 15:14:00,For entering the country US citizens and permanent residents suspected of exposure to the virus compulsory quarantine would be the wise decision. But Mr. Trump has not been known for such resolves.
2020-08-11 15:22:35,"I know of another country which is doing this- Nicaragua. It's citizens were stranded at the border in Costa Rica for weeks, unable to return to their country, their jobs, their families, by the authoritarian leader, Ortega. Mr. Trump keeps such good company.
Shutting borders to others is unfortunate but sometimes necessary in a crisis such as this. Shutting a border to a country's own citizens' entry is chilling. 
And it doesn't take a great leap of the imagination to envision shutting a border to keep its citizens in."
2020-08-11 15:04:39,In what bizarre world is it okay to demand kids return to school and yet block citizens from returning to their own country because of COVID19?

2020-08-11 15:18:34,Why do I get a mental image of tents being set up in airports staffed by people in PPE. Quarantine in Place. OMG!!!
2020-08-11 15:31:27,"So...American citizens who ""might"" be infected will be barred, but if you're white, you won't?

Nuremburg anyone?"
2020-08-11 15:03:59,"The president is still busy trying to pin the blame for the US virus epidemic on foreigners, foreign countries and people who engage therewith. Fact is, if you've been outside of the US you're probably less likely to have caught the bug, at an average...!"
2020-08-11 15:04:21,"More of the same.  He says something outrageous.  Everyone freaks out.  He once again controls the news cycle, the narrative.  He flashes something shiny to take everyone's mind temporarily off of a pandemic and depression.  He backs off.  Nothing to see here."
2020-08-11 15:11:52,"If the infected people are American citizens and they can figure out a safe way to get here they must be allowed in. Order them to quarantine themselves so as not to infect anyone, at their expense, but they are entitled to return home to this country. Where do you want them to go, Mars?"
2020-08-11 15:05:04,"So, next we are going to start arresting people who are sick 'for their own good and the good of their neighbors'? Are we going to start COVID Camps to keep the sick in isolation? Will skin color matter? Voting record? Charitable giving? Opinions in the NYT?

Or is this just another admission by Trumpism that it is incompetent and uncaring?"
2020-08-11 15:00:00,Can we ban people who have been to Sturgis?
2020-08-11 15:08:10,Terrifying political implications.Under no circumstances.
2020-08-11 15:08:23,And the number one candidate for application of the standard would be the fake president himself. He's the only one traveling and he's the only one I see never wearing a mask. I support this implementation immediately￼.
2020-08-11 15:18:05,"90% increase nationwide among children and 137% in Florida and he wants to send children back to school and play football at the college level. But implement an obvious unconstitutional rule to ban repatriation of American citizens and he is all in. 
Oh and his briefings sans medical personal really make sense don't they?"
2020-08-11 15:32:15,"I’d remind that when Trump restricted travel from China on Jan. 30—not banned, restricted—he also never bothered to institute border checks or tracings. 

Over 40, 000 foreign nationals waltzed right on it.

I’d also remind that these clowns have a bit of a track record of hassling reporters and “politicals,” at our borders, as well as regular old brown people."
2020-08-11 15:11:34,"Too little, way too late. This should have been done in early February, when all borders should have been closed hermetically. That would have saved hundreds of thousands of lives, and avoided the disaster. But hey, the media howled at the idea back then, just like it is doing it now."
2020-08-11 15:12:17,I wonder if Trump is hoping Biden will make a little trip outside the U.S. within the next couple months. The doors would slam shut and there would be such a fuss.
2020-08-11 15:11:15,"Not letting US citizens back in because they might have coronavirus? That should have been done in January and February at the latest. Right, it's just pointless."

2020-08-11 16:07:42,"This is just Trump ""proving"" he's taking COVID seriously.  In fact, if he were really concerned about limiting spread, he'd block exit by Americans, not entry."
2020-08-11 16:18:12,"So would the US government pay for their hospitalization for COVID-19 if they had to go to a hospital in Mexico? Perhaps this is a sneaky way of keeping people of color who are citizens or holders of green cards out of the US. I would not be at all surprised if Stephen Miller, Trump's evil 'Senior Advisor' was behind this."
2020-08-11 16:22:43,"Who makes the call?  An exhausted immigration offcier for the midnight arrivals?  Will they do it like in the Venezuelan bakeries, an infrared baby thermometer pointed at .

Any fruits or vegetables?"" that you know how to answer to avoid re-entry issues?  Will there be reality chek adjustments for a warm waiting room or a jet on the tarmack w/o A/C?"
2020-08-11 16:32:32,"This is outrageous. Americans abroad who become infected with SARS CoV2 are citizens in distress, and they have every right to return to the US to seek treatment.

2020-08-11 16:07:51,"Talk about shutting the barn door after the horse escaped, we ARE a virus hot zone thanks to Mr. Trumps bungling the situation 8 months ago.

2020-08-11 16:08:09,"The NYTimes has written numerous articles citing insufficient controls at airports for travelers, especially international travelers.  I don't think it's wrong-minded to refuse entry to someone that is likely sick or traveling from a hot spot.  Europe has stopped travel from the US for that reason.

It's incumbent on countries to protect the citizens within that country.  If this had been done in February or even March, we'd be in better shape.  Although, with all the peaceful protests and beach parties, it's hard to say how much impact this would have had, or will have."

2020-08-11 17:33:42,"Too bad that Trump didn't enact this before admitting the 40k US folks from China.

Let me take a quick stab at this: if the government can determine that you are a Democrat, you will not be permitted to return to the US after travelling outside of the country."

2020-08-11 16:39:59,"This is another new low from the Trump administration.  American citizens and permanent residents must be allowed into our country.  If they are ill, they can be quarantined, or they can be quarantined in general if they are coming from a hotspot elsewhere.  The fact remains that the US has the worst record on coronavirus, so keeping out a few Americans will do nothing but fuel Trump's anti-immigration campaign, even though these people are not immigrants."
2020-08-11 16:49:19,"It may be Trump's fault and weak leadership from the GOP that could be blamed for the US being the epicenter of the world for this pandemic. I hope the man and his minions are removed come Nov. However, the blame game also needs to take a look in the mirror. People in the US are still having massive parties, gathering in close proximity of each other for whatever event they involve themselves in. (protests?) So before we start taking more draconian steps ordered by this inane government, consider the attitude of Americans. ""It is my right not to wear a mask!"" or ""It isn't real. It's all a liberal plot.""  ""It's the media's fault! Don't believe them!!"" How sad that we cannot simply quarantine Americans who cannot be part of a healthy society. Personally, I wish I could get out of this country. Find a safer society. I would gladly learn the language. But this is by far the worst I have ever seen of American attitude and self righteousness instead of rolling up their sleeves and working toward helping each other. Are we really that angry at each other that would would want to put each other in harms way? This society has really gone backwards."

But these are ""the authorities"" who are to have the power to refuse entry to a US Citizen or legal permanent resident if they ""have reason to believe"" that the person ""may be infected.""   How can immigrant policy get more arbitrary and capricious than this.   There is surely an agenda here.  Take a guess.   Could it have something to do with the elections?"

2020-08-11 19:10:22,"I am a US citizen planning on returning home from abroad in a few weeks. The US is currently the worst place to enter considering the fact that on a worldwide bases 23% coronavirus deaths and 26% of cases have been in the USA although the US has only ~4.5% of the world's population.  That is why I have delayed my entry for months but now I must come home. So, it does not make any sense to restrict US citizens' return from abroad. By the way, the country where I will be coming from has currently 15-18 deaths and about 1,100 cases a day for a population of 83 million."
2020-08-11 19:22:56,"Until we have a rapid test to determine whether you actually have the virus, a temperature check only means nothing. There are hundreds of other conditions that could give you a fever. And if you ""looked"" sick, that too means nothing. Also, don't ignore the possibility that if you looked ""Hispanic"" or ""Chinese"" or had a surname that matched, that one of these customs officers could use the virus an excuse to keep you out. Once again, this is just another one of Trump's ploys to selectively eliminate the types of people he doesn't like to have in America, all in the name of caring for our health...hmmm wonder if his poll ratings will go up on this?

Instead of headlining this: ""Trump Considers Banning Re-entry by Citizens Who May Have Coronavirus,"" which perhaps unintentionally but implicitly buys into a claim that the threat comes from outside our borders, it would have been more responsible to preface it with something to qualify that assumption.  Maybe:  ""Despite the fact that most other countries are doing an exponentially superior job of containing the Covid-19 virus, Trump dangles a shiny xenophobic distraction to imply the opposite.""

From George Orwell's novel ""1984."":  
“It appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank Big Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grams a week. And only yesterday […] it had been announced that the ration was to be reduced to twenty grams a week. Was it possible that they could swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? Yes, they swallowed it."
2020-08-11 19:17:35,"So the country with the most covid-19 cases INSIDE its own borders - merely because of its inability to take forceful action - now wants to have the right to arbitrarily keep out any foreigner who may still want to risk coming in, and justifies such a decision by ... a concern for American citizens' health ... ?

Obviously, this is once again the GOP's way of not caring about protecting America AT ALL, and wanting to send out a ""message"" to its racist, xenophobic base.

And as ""messages"" is all they ask from their elected officials in order for them to be eager to vote for the GOP over and over again, how long will this vicious cycle continue? Until all GOP voters have died from covid-19, blaming ""others"" ... ??

What a scam."
2020-08-11 20:07:24,I see Trump's point.  These citizens might come back and then vote by mail.  Massive FRAUD is brewing!
2020-08-11 19:32:39,Once again Trump takes it for granted that his word is law.  I hope he realizes that denying an American Citizen medical care can result in a criminal negligence charge.  If God forbid an American Citizen dies as a result of his orders he and anyone who kept the Citizen from obtaining medical care would face a charge of criminally negligent homicide.  Is he ever going to grow up?
2020-08-11 21:18:34,"This could prevent me from being able to come back to S Carolina to vote!!!!  Is that his real goal? 

I am a US citizen waiting out Covid at my second home in Mexico.  My primary and permanent  residence is in SC, where I am registered to vote.  However, SC is a state that does not allow any absentee voting.  Don't try to convince me that US citizens would be barred from reentry ""only in the rarest of circumstances,” to borrow a quote from the draft regulation as presented in this NYT article.  This is not my first rodeo.  I read several US on-line newspapers daily, including the NYT.

It is dangerous to return to the US during this pandemic, but I feel obligated to vote.  It is my right and responsibility, regardless of risk.  Americans have died for the right to vote.

Other writers have pointed out the absurdity of barring reentry to people returning from parts of the world with better control of Covid.  America, get your own house in order and stop blaming other people."
2020-08-11 20:55:11,"I can't help but think that is is a way for Border Patrol, an organization staffed with people who seem to be strong Trump supporters, to turn away American Citizens who may not look white.

There were terrible stories about American Citizens of Mexican descent who were being detained at our southern border. What better way to turn them away than to say, ""Gosh, I think you may have been exposed to Covid. Sorry, you can't come in."""
2020-08-11 21:24:16,And of course Trump and his criminal gangs will ban young and democratic leaning people from reentry until after the November election.

2020-08-10 13:42:04,"We were naive that there was anything common with the ""illegal"" communist government of mainland China. 

The real government of China resides in Taiwan. At the very least, we should have equal relations with both governments.

China doesn’t have friends, nor historical allies. It’s engraved in their culture, good or bad. China respects one thing and only one thing: leverage."
2020-08-10 13:50:38,Any chance of seeing Taiwan accept a guaranteed independence while becoming part of the Chinese mainland would seem foolish as China doubles down on its rollback of guaranteed freedoms in Hong Kong. As China continues it's genocide of the Yeagers you have to ask how long we can (or should) refuse to recognize a modern free democracy because of it's abusive big brother.
2020-08-10 14:38:12,"Trump is right to support Taiwan. However the timing and pace of his moves are clearly political.

President Tsai and her predecessors have shown the world that democracy and rule of law is in keeping with Chinese traditions - and indeed enhances rather than destroys these traditions. 
The integration of democratic institutions and rule of law into Chinese political culture makes the world a safer place. 
As is true across the world, Chinese people have no need to import foreign secretive, violent junk ideologies like Marxism, Leninism and Stalinism. These bankrupt ideologies are simply outmoded medievalism where fascist cliques fight each other in endless night. And they are antithetical to a modern Chinese culture of transparency, prosperity and seeking after true scientific advancement - such as is found in Taiwan."
2020-08-10 14:41:47,"Just a word of caution for Ms. Tasi and Taiwan.  Please keep in mind that Donald Trump has no loyalty to anyone, no sense of responsibility, and come Nov 3 he will either have 4 more years as President but will care not a wit about Taiwan.  He never develops and grows anything.  Uses, then abuses and tosses in the rubbish heap."

What a horrible country. Bad countries like that always find a bad end. If China continues to rattle sabres then it's time we and other western countries rattle ours.

They're much better sabres and, unlike the Chinese, who didn't even know how to sail the one nuclear aircraft carrier they purchased, we know how to use our weapons."
2020-08-10 14:20:53,"When it comes to China,  Mr Trump all of sudden becomes a virtue; whatever his adminstration does to China is justified, however irrational it actually is. No wonder this nation is in this sad situation."
2020-08-10 14:34:56,"Except for its abundance of cheap labor, which only benefits corporations who deny knowledge of sweat shops and child labor, I find it hard to understand why the United States continues to tolerate China and its abuses of the human rights of its citizens, theft of proprietary information from U.S. companies who want to do business in China, and its aggression in recent years including the creation of a strategic military island in the South China Sea.  

I am no fan of Trump but I do not have a problem with his China policy.  When the NBA recently bowed down to China amid threats of canceling games in China, I welcomed the uproar.  Who are we, anyway?  And why does China feel it has the might to shutdown American dissent of its human rights practices?  It is past time that America should recognize a democracy (Taiwan) over a nation that bullies and imprisons its citizens for demanding humaneness and free speech.  

While America grapples with its own problems regarding racism and inequality against Blacks and other people of color, we should strive to recognize countries that treat their citizens with respect over those who squash rebellion against unfair practices."
2020-08-10 14:03:08,"This is playing into Trump's hands.  If timed well, a sinking of Chinese owned assets in the S. China sea, as part of preventing them from conducting mischief, can assure Trump of a second term.  The only thing preventing this from happening might be if Trump, given that he is convinced about his knowledge and genius, might plan the whole thing himself.  Left to Bolton, he would be president for another four years."
2020-08-10 15:19:44,"I wonder what is the end game here.

The US backs Taiwan vs China. But when China comes calling, like they did in HK, is the US actually willing to risk a war with China over Taiwan?

We posture, we tell Taiwan we're with them. But China feels this is their land. They will act, they have acted in the past, and when they do, what then?

China is backing Biden, he is their puppet. He proved to be their puppet for 8 years, concluding with the TPTP which basically handed our economy to China. They want him in the big seat so the China duties are removed and the TPTP gets restored. 

If Biden wins, China will roll over Taiwan and Biden will do nothing because he is beholden to them.

How far are we willing to go for another land which is not our own?"
2020-08-10 14:44:23,"China has considered itself the ""Middle Kingdom"" for centuries.  Any non-Chinese presence in the region, especially Taiwan and the South China Sea, but also South Korea and Japan, is considered by the Chinese Communist Party as an affront to Chinese prerogatives."
2020-08-10 15:04:52,Trump thought he started a trade war while China played the game of world domination. Trump may still believe he won because he will probably never realize what the game was really all about.

2020-08-10 14:54:47,"It looks like the Democrats are going to win the White House in November. I really hope they don't reverse the course of confronting China that Trump has rightfully (among his numerous wrongs) taken just because they came from Trump. Obama, Bush, Clinton and Bush really failed to work with other nations to try and contain this blatant aggressiveness, but rather encouraged it by turning blind eyes.

The Chinese military leaders have all their shiny new weapons and are itching to try them out, and are convinced the world will let them run over anyway without standing up to them. And they might be right."
2020-08-10 14:30:09,The main reason the CCP cannot stand independence for Hongkong and Taiwan is they both constitute clear evidence of the system of government that Chinese people would choose if they were not held in shackles by the CCP.
2020-08-10 16:07:56,"Let us not forget that it was the US who chose to establish a diplomatic relationship with China and severed ties with Taiwan in 1978. 

What is mentioned in John Bolton's book about Trump's view of Taiwan may very well be the position of the US Government past and present.

Yet Taiwan hold hopes that US will come and protect when there is an attempt by China. But has US supported Taiwan in its effort to rejoin the United Nations? Has the US signed a petition to support Taiwan to join the WHO or any other such organizations? There is hardly evidence of such support except for a very symbolic one like Mr. Azar's visit.

Taiwan waved its mandatory 14-Day quarantine requirement for Mr. Azar! 

Taiwan's president not only personally received Mr. Azar but also listened eagerly and attentively to his speech as if Mr. Azar were some country's president. What a courtesy!

Taiwan at this point in history, unfortunately, is only a pawn for the US's convenience to upset China. This view has been reflected a lot in Taiwan's news media recently. 

There are also quite a few opinions that Trump would use Taiwan to create an October surprise for Trump. Even a little military engagement would create a ""wag-the-dog"" scenario to tilt the election.

What would Taiwan gain for being a willing participant in such a move? Being a pawn has never been a good thing! Would any player still think of a pawn after a game?"
2020-08-10 16:20:33,"Every time China does something that weakens or harms US interests should result in concessions to Taiwan; high level visits, economic cooperation, and military sales. We’ve spent enough time kowtowing to their expansionist needs."
2020-08-10 15:55:16,"If Biden comes out of his basement and manages to get elected, it will give the Chinese a wide range of options to dominate the South China Sea and the countries in the area and none of them bode well for those non-totalitarian countries esp. Taiwan.
 Biden will attempt to startup up Obama's TPP Legacy and fill the pockets of the Billionaires who dislike Trumps hard stance against the ChiComs.
 Even if Trump manages to win against the collective forces of Social Media, Democrat controlled Media and all the other forces aligned against him the last 4 years it wont be a cakewalk to hold the Dictator in Bejing at Bay."
2020-08-10 15:54:00,"It's sad that Taiwan considers a visit from US to be an honor.  In the US, sinophobia has never been higher, and the average US citizen doesn't care if someone is from Taiwan or HK or Singapore.  Its just Chinese to them.  The US doesn't care about the well-being of Taiwan at all except as a provocation to enrage China.  Taiwan is nothing but a pawn in the weiner-measuring contest between US and China."
2020-08-10 16:50:26,"You have to wonder how much blowback the PRC must receive before it starts hurting President Xi within his party.  He only governs with its approval, after all, and China's super aggressive stance towards any perceived encroachment to its territorial or political prerogatives is only going to hurt and isolate it in the end.  We have seen communist parties make abrupt changes in direction in the past; is that possible for the Chinese Communist Party?"
2020-08-10 16:50:16,"Taiwan is on its way to extinction as the population dwindles and aging, economy shrinks, wages decline, and exports depends heavily on China, as well as bankruptcies on its labor retirement funds (similar to Social Security Benefit funds) and national healthcare. 

That is the direct result of 30-years of democratic elections which put both major political parties (KMT and DPP) alternatively in governments in equal time. Yet, the country keeps going down hill. 

Sounds just like Lebanon, or United States now under Hoax Don, isn't it?  

And Taiwan also faces China with second largest economy and military forces in the world, and with the support of United States' One China Policy.

A million trips by Hoax Don's official visits to Taiwan is NOT going to change that, is it? 

Of course, a billion dollar US economic aids, few million immigrant visas would be more helpful."

-- cut taxes for the donors
-- increase defense spending
-- deregulate everything, particularly worst polluters in real world and in finance, get back a bit of these roaring 20-ies and burning rivers.
-- start a war

When the history of Trump administration is written, the history will give one positive nod to Donald Trump: he resisted implementing that last chapter of the playbook. Since he is a con artist, he blustered and allowed some hairy provocations by the military and the assorted warmongers, but always stepped back.

While MERV-13 and above filters are the only filters that are capable of capturing the smallest virus particles, they are not recommended for all systems. As you increase filter ratings you increase thickness, which naturally reduces air flow. Air flow is the most essential element in providing fresh air in an environment. Unless your system is capable of pushing air through a MERV-13 filter, you may actually do more harm then good by upgrading. I suspect that is why they are looking at UV lights in the system, it may be an easier fix than replacing all the fans and motors."

Many businesses and institutions are not providing clean, oxygenated air.  What is the CO2 level in subway cars and in your office?"
2020-08-10 12:26:13,"why do schools have lower MERV requirements than office? Density of humans in school classrooms tend to be higher than in an office, no? I wonder what the MERV filter standards are for daycare facilities, apartment buildings and dorm rooms. Are there requirements for how many apartment/dorm units share a common air circulation loop?"
2020-08-10 12:26:53,"It might have been useful to compare this to an airliner, since people are also curious about that. In both cases, the crowding while waiting  may be more dangerous than the trip itself. If one person is convinced the subway or plane is safe enough, odds are a million people are and the crowding will increase.

 Why put yourself or those who really have no choice but to use shared transportation at increased risk by increasing the density at these places?"
2020-08-10 12:30:20,"Thank you for this!  If there are no plans already in place to do it, I would love to see similar modeling for buses - including the impact of open windows and when doors open.

FWIW, I've been on so many trains where there seemed to be no airflow - how can commuters know that everything is working?"
2020-08-10 12:31:17,"MERV 7 seems to be the lowest possible quality.  At the described air flow / air exchange rate, it would seem that use of a higher quality filter (not necessarily for corona virus, though) would be advisable.  Too bad there were no photos in this article about what filters look like after 36 days (light gray, dark gray, black?  any differences between various subway lines?).  Also, I would be shocked if filters are actually replaced every 36 days.  Something to investigate, perhaps."
2020-08-10 12:35:57,"Geez -  upgrade the filters to the MERV level 13 that is recommended - or higher.

Continue to require masks.

That should help.   And not just with Covid-19."
2020-08-10 12:37:29,"You need to put the air-intake at the floor level.  As done now the first pass (before that sneeze hits a filter) is drawn up where other passengers can inhale it.  If the air intake was at floor level it would be pulled down and hit peoples pants and shoes instead.  Even though the second pass would still come down, it is much less infectious because it has been filtered and diluted."
2020-08-10 12:40:34,"They should specify which lines have the trains they are describing and which don’t. Anyone who’s taken the C train knows that thing looks like it been around for 100 years whereas the 4/5/6 lines seems to have some of the newer models. Still too many unknowns, good luck and be careful if you ride the subway, I’m staying away at all cost."
2020-08-10 12:43:14,"This is why I wear an N95 Respirator when I have to go inside an enclosed space like the supermarket.

I've taken the subway 3 times, each time there were ""STILL"" people pulling down their masks throughout the entire ride. They have their mask up on the platforms but then pull them down the minute they get inside. This article need to be shared with all media networks, because there are people who still don't understand how air and particles move around.

Japan's NHK broadcasted simulations about how particles spread based on the Diamond Princess analysis back in April, but in the US we still arguing about wearing masks. Americans should be paying attention to the research that is coming out of South Korea and Japan."
2020-08-10 12:54:47,"Thank you NYTImes for the animations.  I wish there would have been more focus on how the sneeze simulation came to be.  How did Mika Gröndahl, Christina Goldbaum, and Jeremy White come to the conclusion the animated pattern is correct.  There is no source.  I very much understand the need to protect sources but certainly in this situation the source would be happy to be mentioned. 

I did enjoy the article but it raised so many questions for me.  Such as, the aforementioned, question about source, what happens if a ventilation unit fails, how often is maintenance performed on the ventilation units, is the filter replacement every 36 days accurate, how is this information tracked.

I did notice the authors of the article responsibly mentioned virus transmission is still possible on the subway despite the ventilation which is appreciated.  Even if they didn't mention the precaution I wouldn't be getting on a subway car anytime soon."
2020-08-10 12:57:18,"Looks like we're gonna' need to develop a vaccine.

Most people are no longer comfortable sitting, standing or ambulating through a sea of other people's invisible exhaled respiratory aerosols."
2020-08-10 13:00:10,"It would be interesting to see a follow-up article comparing this with a transit bus, a highway bus,  and an airliner. 

A look at Amtrak's passenger coaches would also be useful. With upgrades to Acela service coming into use, it will be interesting to see if manufacturers start taking considerations like this into design.

Seems like trains are the way to go for mass transit at the moment, given how they work and the precautions that are being taken. 

As always, wear a mask when out in public, and stay home as much as you can. We may yet have to fall back into a major lock down, and everyone will have to take it seriously."
2020-08-10 13:01:35,"Seems some of the most important points are in the final paragraph. Returning crowds will render any improvements ineffective.

The tests with sneezing with masks: what sort of masks were used?

We should note that many wearing masks, either properly or on their chin, talk on mass transit. This is very true on the bus, but to some extent on the subway.

Too bad MTA won't simply open all the windows.

Let's certainly avoid PR for the MTA."
2020-08-10 13:03:16,It would be enlightening to see a like analysis for various rooms and hallways in a typical public school.
2020-08-10 13:08:09,"And of course the ventilation systems have to work properly to have the benefits illustrated in the article.  This involves timely maintenance of the filters and other parts of the systems.  As we all know to our sorrow, timely maintenance in general is not something on which MTA has covered itself in glory."
2020-08-10 13:08:16,"This is marvelous. Not knowing the conditions of the air outside the car leaves some question regarding the 'new' air.
In heavily air conditioned areas [hotter than NY City] schools are opening soon. That would include schools in Texas, Florida, Arizona, and more. The newer schools in those areas will be operating with 15% new air. A huge percentage of these schools were build with no opening windows. The students, faculty and other workers will be in the buildings for hours.
I would love to see the same study for those spaces."
2020-08-10 13:17:44,"Thank you for this information. Thinking ahead to more in-home time caring for my grandchild, it would be similarly helpful to have information and guidance on how to minimize potential spread within an average house. Should we leave the furnace fan running continuously? Crack open some windows when MN weather turns cold?"
2020-08-10 13:23:10,In the study of Covid transmission on trains the risk increased if you sat next to a person who was infected (perfect sense) and further increased based on the duration of the journey. Apart from this excellent article which really highlights the importance of masks would it make more sense if we create nodal points so people are forced to get off the trains at regular points?  We should  also keep doors on both sides open so fresh air can come in during stops and extend the time of station stops so that fresh air can come in longer. Just a thought.
2020-08-10 13:32:08,"Thank you, NYT! It helps a lot to allay unjustified paranoia about the subways. Thinking that passengers are in a ""cattle car"" or a ""petri dish"", terms that I have often heard, is untrue. In many cases, it would seem that you're safer in this environment than in many others. Good maintenance is SO important."
2020-08-10 13:41:05,The article minimizes the amount of trains that don’t have newer filtration systems.  Many trains are from the 1970’s and 1980’s. The article also assumes the filters  are changed/cleaned and other maintenance is done as required. This is laughable.
2020-08-10 13:46:34,"Nice explanation of how air circulates in a subway train; it reminds us that, at least in the not recent past, airlines would re-circulate the air in their airplanes, as it makes things cheaper...but a mistake, as it will only enhance a viral transmission. This, in addition to avoiding eating there...as it requires removing one's face mask."
2020-08-10 13:49:12,"Next time I get in a subway car I can’t help but imagine the air dancing around me now, thanks to these graphics.  A cough or sneeze anywhere inside it will now feel like a cannon blast.  Think I’ll walk, thanks."
2020-08-10 13:59:50,"The reason that subways/buses use this recirculating-type HVAC system is the same reason 80-90% of building HVAC systems use it: energy savings.  During a hot summer day, it is more energy efficient to filter and cool off the recirculated air rather than constantly conditioning the fresh hot air outside. 

However, it comes at the cost of re-breathing the germs, viruses, and CO2.  Even though the complete air-exchange is done every 3+ minutes, that is still an uncomfortably long time to be breathing all that recirculated stuff in.  

The solution?  Heat Recovery Ventilators or Enthalpy Recovery Ventilators (HRV or ERV) with nearly 0% air exchange and 50/50 balanced ventilation.  These are the types of systems that are installed in extremely air-tight & energy efficient buildings built to Passivhaus (PH) Standards.  In a good HRV/ERV system, there is basically no air exchange between the exhaust and supply air streams.  And some manufacturer studies have shown (take with grain of salt) that these systems will save substantial energy even within conventional construction (that is, not airtight or insulated).  

The challenge is to design this system that can be easily retrofitted into existing trains and buses.  For trains, the design is trickier because the exhausted air from front cars may travel to the supply air in rear cars.  With that said, the exhaust air mixing with the fresh air may be enough to dilute the virus load enough to be safe.  More studies need to be done."
2020-08-10 14:00:53,"Sorry, not taking the subway. Will continue walking."
2020-08-10 14:04:47,"Thanks for this very informative article!  I'd like to see a similar piece on M.T.A. buses.  I've been on many buses with the air conditioning blasting and all the windows closed.  Wouldn't riders benefit from having open windows on buses?  And shouldn't riders on all modes of public transportation be discouraged from eating, drinking and having loud conversations?"
2020-08-10 14:06:32,the illustrations are beautiful.
2020-08-10 14:12:15,Good article-thank you.  As I prepare to reenter the classroom this fall I would love to see classroom ventilation given the same treatment.
2020-08-10 14:16:21,This is a great opportunity for companies that sell air filtration systems. Do any of the sources for this interactive benefit from consulting for businesses?
2020-08-10 14:18:33,Didn't they used to have open windows on the subways during summers in the 60's and 70's ? with 2 manual clips that raised and lowered the windows? and you closed them in the winter?
2020-08-10 14:20:05,"Great article. This is theoretical and works on paper. The residents of Detroit trusted their officials on the water purity too. I walk where ever I go. If necessary, I will wear two masks and a face shield in an enclosed space. Trust but verify. A backup parachute packed by you."
2020-08-10 14:20:45,"I've been on the subway once since this started, parking my car at 33rd street stop on the 7 to go into Grand Central. In that 5-6 stop ride, there was at least one person without a mask getting on and off each stop, and several with their masks below their noses. 

In addition to figuring out better filtration and sanitization (UV light), I think the MTA could use enforcers to walk up and down the cars. I had to move around the car many times each time some clueless selfish person walked on and (a) didn't distance as much as possible (b) had no mask on and (c) wore theirs below their nose. 

Really not hard, but people don't care. And that's why the MTA is going to have an uphill climb."
2020-08-10 14:22:00,Very informative article.  The more the lay public understands about the ways this disease is transmitted and the efficacy of methods to mitigate it the better off we are.
2020-08-10 14:25:48,Useful article which unfortunately will reinforce fears about taking mass transit.   Might the MTA have been invited to comment about any efforts to mitigate the spread infection (if any)?
2020-08-10 14:26:11,"While I truly appreciate the diagrams and explanation of how the cars filter air, what about the air flow on subway platforms?  During rush hour, those platforms (typically) are packed with riders waiting for their trains, and many stations seem to have little to no active, filtered ventilation.  How will MTA address that issue?

As fall and winter approach, many of the people choosing to walk right now will be forced to return to the subways.  I would love to see a detailed plan from MTA about how they will address ventilation and safety across all aspects of the system."
2020-08-10 14:34:51,"This is a very interesting and informative feature, but I have to say, that last paragraph adds a pretty big caveat: the subway is relatively safe, as long as hardly anyone is using it."
2020-08-10 14:38:32,"As NYC is getting ready for blended education,what’s more worrisome is the fact that most students will be in room for 6 hrs,and eating lunch there.how are schools going to deal with the filtering,recirculating air.Installing UV lights and a commercial filtering system should be mandatory."
2020-08-10 14:41:32,"Amazing article with excellent animations, well done. Thank you for your effort!"
2020-08-10 14:44:48,"Ventilation or no, the subway system will not be safe as long there is not total mask compliance.
Without masks some subway riders will become infected and die.  
Many of us have have internal controls to respect the health of others. As in wearing a mask
 Some of us need an external agent of control  for acts such as mask compliance. 
The current level of mask non-compliance in subway mask use seems to indicate that the current level of external control is not sufficiently effective.
The subway rider who dies because of mask non-compliance is a victim of collateral damage.
The fear of riding the subway with its current level of control of mask non-compliance is devastating."
2020-08-10 12:28:32,Nice article! Can you please do the same for passenger aircraft?

2020-08-10 12:34:34,"Bill DeBlasio said the future of transportation is mass transit...in a subway....as a pandemic is occurring. Unbelievable. Of course, we can't have indoor dining or outdoor sporting events but people can cram into a subway car. The hypocrisy is crippling."
2020-08-10 13:12:55,"Last winter I got a good shower of water and dirt coming from a ceiling vent, any New Yorker knows exactly what I am talking about it.
The real question is not how cars are vented but how often the filtering systems is serviced.
The other problem is over crowd, during rush hour when a car is completely full of people the venting system can only move air on the ceiling.
Wear your mask and use plenty of hand sanitizer..."
2020-08-10 13:33:33,"Amazing, now show what a sneeze looks like in a crowded subway with no a/c or air circulation because THAT's my commute from Queens for 40 minutes."

2020-08-10 14:18:32,The conductor ought have the best portable air filter in that car of his/hers. That's a given.
2020-08-10 12:36:30,"""Continuous air flow through these vents helps limit viral particles from building up inside a car and infecting people as they inhale.""

No. This is what causes virus particles TO build up in the air in the car. How can you say such nonsense? It's like saying that falling is what keeps you from hitting the ground."
2020-08-10 12:40:38,"BRAVO, NYTimes!!!  This is a lesson needed by all.  Subways are not that different than open or closed rooms,  as circulating air from windows and doors circulates EVERYTHING.  

This is why masks need to be legally mandated for all, even babies, whenever possible.  I bet some clever person can design a mask for infants which will be washable, safe and protective....in adjustable sizes."
2020-08-10 13:02:55,Some train cars used to have windows.  Do these still exist?  I know the AC feels nice in the summer but that is part of the problem.  Open the windows and let the (slightly less stale) tunnel air in!!!
2020-08-10 13:11:34,This feels like the kind of reassurance i felt with the hiding under the desks drills in case of nuclear attack when I was a kid.
2020-08-10 14:22:23,no subway rides for me any time soon!!!
2020-08-10 13:07:00,"Thanks to fellow readers for many great comments. Some things here are re-assuring, more raise more questions:
1. “viral particles” I am not confident that this term is used to mean “viruses” — especially by filters primarily intended “to block large particles” and viruses are tiny (typically 1/20 the size of bacteria)
2. “fresh air” means outside air, which may include viral particles
3. viral load: Is risk of coronavirus transmission minimized if “fresh” coronavirus particles are exchanged with existing particles? Or do they add to the particles already inside?
4. location: are there better/worse places to be on a subway car?
5. filter numbers: is a higher number better? do the MTA filters even ""trap"" the virus (like N-95 masks) or are they like the masks almost all of us wear (cotton... masks)? 
6. face masks: is the MTA distributing N-95 masks (to protect the wearer) or other masks (to protect others)?
7. compliance: how is the NYS face mask requirement enforced?
8. physical distancing: is there a NYS physical distancing requirement on the MTA vehicles? if not, why not? if so, what is it and how is it enforced?
9. schools (worth repeating!): why is the standard for classrooms so much lower than for subway cars and even offices, let alone planes?! surely that means greater risk for students/teachers who are in classrooms for much longer than riders are in a subway car. do their lives matter less?"
2020-08-10 13:29:56,"Couple of important take-aways, imho:

1)  Public school HVAC systems (to the extent they exist) are not designed for such “high-volume” air removal/flow like the subways are.  Thus, if someone sneezes (or breathes) in a classroom, the airborne particles will accumulate and remain in the air far longer.

2)  Like the subway system, the HVAC systems in schools (and most buildings) were not designed to filter a deadly virus from the ambient atmosphere.  Thus, even if they are operating to spec with pristine filters, a percentage of virus particles will be re-circulated back into the building.

3)  As demonstrated by the graphics, engineering and fluid dynamics is hard.  Effective, safe and rapid purging of an airborne virus from a room -- such as a classroom – would require careful engineering analysis and solutions.  Unlike subway cars, each school and building has unique characteristics and systems, so one-size will not fit all.

4)  Ad-hoc solutions, such as “opening the windows” or employing portable fans or HEPA filters, may be counterproductive, since they can create turbulence that disburses/distributes the airborne particles throughout a room without effectively removing them.

5)  To retrofit schools and buildings with HVAC systems that address effective removal of airborne coronavirus would be astronomically expensive.  That is why it is being ignored."
2020-08-10 12:07:45,"If this is meant to be reassuring it isn't. 

Bars are closed for a reason. In every country from South Korea to the US when someone who was infected entered a bar a superspreading event occurred with many to most of the people in the bar getting infected, so telling us that a subway car is not as dangerous is meaningless.

Mask wearing is not being enforced on NYC subways, so everyone should look at the last horrific graphic and description. 

""In the simulation without a mask, many more droplets coat the floor around the rider and aerosols disperse into the air, eventually moving through the ventilation system.

Because the ventilation system pushes air across the train, rather than down into vents on the floor, those aerosols could come in contact with someone standing between the person sneezing and the ceiling vent.

""You can see how well dispersed that plume is,"" said Krystal Pollitt, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health. ""Even if you are not standing directly beside the person who coughed or sneezed, you are still in contact with that emission.""

In plain English: If you're in a subway car that's crowded, (or not crowded) and an infected person without a mask sneezes, you're going to get covered with Covid-19 as ""even if you are not standing directly beside the person who coughed or sneezed, you are still in contact with that emission.""

The graphics and explanations are chilling; based on this no one should ride subways."
2020-08-10 12:57:08,"Go back to the days being able to open windows in cars .

It is viral load multiplied by exposure time that determines illness.    We can control the viral load."
2020-08-10 13:22:57,Does the model account for the effect of occupancy on air flow?
2020-08-10 14:04:42,"An air change rate of once every 3min 20sec is on par with some cleanrooms. Of course it is the filters that provide the efficacy, and I would take a HEPA filter over ultraviolet attachments but it can't hurt. Still it is a load off to hear that the dispersion rate is so high on subways. Now do busses."
2020-08-10 14:09:47,Pretty cool.  Thanks for the info!
2020-08-10 13:05:08,How soon before the 'fresh' ouside air becomes saturated with the potentially virus laden air and at that point only bad air will be  recirculated within the car.  And would I want someone standing over me regardless of them wearing a mask.
2020-08-10 13:50:49,"Great graphics, I wonder what a school classroom looks like?  And a typical business office?"
2020-08-10 14:46:39,"A lot of sustainability-related initiatives - from reusable coffee mugs to using public transit - seem to be threatened by the desire to reduce contagion.  However, the more you look at the details, and the technologies available, the more sustainability and disease prevention initiatives go hand in hand.  
For example increased reliance of disposable, single-use items raises the requirement for custodial service, increasing the likelihood of transmission to essential workers who clean our restrooms, cafeterias, and other public spaces.
This article shows that using public transit is more safe than many might think, and also that the introduction of improved filtration, anti-microbial technology, and ventilation will reduce risks of contagion further in the future.  
Sustainability should remain a top-of-mind issue for policy-makers as well as the general public, as global warming, pollution, and resource depletion are still as great a threat to our well-being as disease."
2020-08-10 14:50:39,For the last 12 years I have taken the subway on average 2-4 times a day. I’ve been on many trains when the air conditioner is not working or is barely working. I would have more confidence in the air circulation as described in the article if it were working 100% of the time and at full capacity.
2020-08-10 14:50:48,"Good air flow is a must. Travelling in closed coaches/compartments, that too ones with AC fitted is not at all advisable. Coaches without AC and open windows can be considered for safe travel. But again with basic precautions like wearing masks, maintaining gap between co-passengers should be strictly followed while travelling."
2020-08-10 14:51:02,"Except the majority of trains in the NY subway system are from the 1980s with a far less efficient filtering system, I'm sure."
2020-08-10 14:51:08,"This is really interesting and helpful information. I'm one of the many New Yorkers who avoid the subway right now, and this article does help me feel better about some trains. BUT: This is a 6 train in the example. It's one of the subway's newer models and it always has better airflow than older models which are still being used. The 6 train runs through lower Manhattan and up into the Bronx, but so much of its ridership is made up of wealthy residents traveling between work in the financial district and home on the upper east side. My primary subway trains, the M and the J, are much older. Do they have these kinds of air filtration systems also?"
2020-08-10 14:53:34,"This is an ideal situation. How many times have I entered a subway cab with no ventilation at all? Do you not enter? Much of this simulation is best case scenario. If you are running late, find a subway car with no venting because the system is broken, what do you do?"
2020-08-10 15:01:02,"something else to also take into account is the positivity rate as in how may people being tested are positive vs. negative. If the positivity rate is low in the city, people wear masks, practice good hygiene and reduce talking, the chances are really slim to contract the virus and distancing requirements can be reduced.  This also factors in shorter trip/journey times which is what is more typical on transit."
2020-08-10 15:04:11,"It would be nice to see such a simulation for buses and also airplanes. I notice that many buses have their windows and roof vents open, even though the windows that open are tiny, I would assume that it still helps in expelling stale air. I would not be comfortable in an airplane though, how fresh can that air be?"
2020-08-10 15:05:32,"I'd be very curious to see this study performed with the windows open and how that alters the airflow in the train car.

Other curious thoughts and questions I've had include the following:

1) What subway car was being modeled?  In the graphics it looks like one of the new cars on the 4/5/7 lines, which are much smaller than train cars found on the lettered lines.

2) What happens when a window is opened on the train to provide more outside air?  Could this negatively impact the subway airflow?

3) Could the MTA install HEPA filters within their system to try and remove as many virus particles as possible before the air is sent back into the subway car?

4) Since outside air means tunnel air in most scenarios, how clean is the subway air?  Do virus particles linger in the subway tunnel air given the poor ventilation?  How safe are subway platforms?"
2020-08-10 15:07:06,While I appreciate the info this diagram is only true when the car is at a stop....if you look at your own diagram (and I dont know if it is accurate) the air leaves the car but the return air would be coming in from elsewhere if the car was moving....so what was the point of this diagram? to confuse? to make people frightened? to misinform?
2020-08-10 15:07:07,For all the detailed information in this article it still leaves a lot of unknowns.  We're still very much at the beginning of the learning curve about covid safety.  No subways for me.
2020-08-10 15:11:37,"The amount of people I see daily without masks or with their mask below their nose and/or mouth is MANY.  I think the hot weather makes it much more uncomfortable, but hopefully the cooler weather will increase mask use, a little?"
2020-08-10 15:14:15,"What about older train cars that are still in use by the city?  I'm sure the filtering technology on those older trains is less effective at filtering and recirculating cleaner air, no?"
2020-08-10 15:16:05,"The system  only works  if the filters are changed regularly ...and how often is that considering the minimal down time allowed for maintenance ?
My last adventure in NYC a few years ago involved taking the Metro on a daily basis in very ,very old HOT and poorly vented cars ...I bet that  the same cars are in use ...the illustration involved newer  model cars so the hypothesis for the whole system  is  not valid ."
2020-08-10 15:24:15,"Great article although left me feeling like I shouldn't get on the subway until there's a vaccine.   Maybe it's just the visualization, but at the 30 second mark, the difference between mask v no mask in the event of a sneeze looks minimal.   It looks as though ventilation system were somehow designed to spread particles efficiently throughout the body of the subway car."
2020-08-10 15:25:27,"That graphic and the accompanying text confirms my decision not to ride a subway car for a very long time.  
It also makes me question how safe flying is in terms of possible coronavirus exposure; an article and graphic on possible virus particle exposure while flying would be appreciated.

2020-08-10 15:30:11,This is an example of how effective online teaching can be. Great graphics!
2020-08-10 15:31:54,"And then there are those cars which one steps into and there is zero ventilation.  I quit riding the subways 12 years ago, and unless best practices of maintenance has eliminated subway cars where the ventilation is not functioning (highly doubtful) this isn't a perfect representation of risk."
2020-08-10 15:34:59,"I find it appalling that MERV 13 filters are not being used as recommended by the experts in your article. They should be used in every home and business.  MERV 7 filters remove only 50-69% of particles 3-10 microns.  MERV 13 filters remove 90% or better of particles 1-3 microns and less than 75% of  particle .3 to 1 microns.  
You can buy them on the Internet.  They can be quickly changed.  There is not time to wait for research studies on other systems."
2020-08-10 15:38:43,"From the sneezing animations, it looks like the viral particles can travel about 12-15 feet which means that 6 feet is not quite enough depending on the direction of the sneeze.  Unfortunately, I've seen passengers sitting within about 3 feet of one another.  The lesson is avoid riding crowded trains or trains in general."
2020-08-10 15:41:00,"I began riding the subway to work again on July 31st. I work either two or three days a week. Since then I've witnessed people not wearing their masks, eating on the subway, drinking from open cups and talking on the phone sans masks. I've resigned to the notion some people will not wear a mask, not worth mentioning to the offender and have to be okay with someone not wearing a mask as long there is no talking and I can change subway cars. I'm still debating if it's a good idea to go into the office knowing I can work remotely until October."
2020-08-10 15:43:28,"Almost impossible to be more than 6 feet away from each other. If one person is in a 3 seater, even skipping a seat leaves you on about 2 feet away. And if someone is in the 2 seater, forget it. Even at reduced capacity, don't know how riders can socially distance. And the one time I took the subway, there were a few people without masks. No one is policing that."
2020-08-10 15:58:50,"Interesting article. As someone else asked, I'd be curious as to what constitutes the ""fresh air"" that comes in from the outside (hopefully it's filtered on the way in). 

Also, I wonder how all this works in NYC buses."
2020-08-10 16:00:10,"Excellent article. Great way to inform the audience. Thanks NYT!!
I would like to see a similar article for aircraft."
2020-08-10 16:07:01,"When I was a young commuter in Chicago, I, too, would sometimes snooze on the subway during my trip home, but I would always wake before my stop, never missing it.
  So what's the big deal?"
2020-08-10 16:07:55,Very interesting article.  The model used in the article appears to be an R142 (one of the newer models in the system) - do the lines leveraging legacy rolling stock have the same HVAC systems?
2020-08-10 16:08:06,"Great, detailed article; thank you! Now we need the follow-up. How analogous are train cars in Chicago and other major cities? Can mass transit agencies upgrade to better filters or better entire units ? (In a comment below, Evan Osler suggests upgrading filters is not as simple as one would hope). Do car makers have units in stock? If not, how long to make and then to install them,  and what's the cost to agency per filter, per car, etc?  Overall, it seems logical to make upgrades a priority while ridership is down, but that's easy to say and no doubt harder to do."
2020-08-10 16:10:59,"I'm curious how this scheme would change if the windows were open to create a constant rush of air?  yes, it would be noisy, but..."

2020-08-10 16:12:58,"Phenomenal graphics and explanations...

I'm still not riding mass transit until there's a vaccine.

You can show all the laboratory perfect modeling you want, but the trains have always been under policed shelters for people suffering from a lack of social services.

Even if the subways/trains weren't under-policed, no one is enforcing masking rules on individual rule breakers."
2020-08-10 12:14:06,"I've ridden the subway several times in the last few weeks and they are much cleaner and far less crowded than usual. That's all positive. 

The uncertainty comes from the randomness of being seated next to a sneezer, a person who removes their mask, even temporarily during conversation, and the panhandlers and ""troubadours"" wending their way through the cars.

There are too many uncertainties or ""X"" factors for anyone to say just how safe the subways are."
2020-08-10 16:15:40,"The MTA could increase the MERV rating to 13 or higher and increase the frequency of filter changes. 3M and other manufacturers are highly experienced with filtration materials and produce filters in a variety of sizes. 
    There is space for multiple additional smaller air filtration units  (fans and filters) that could be retrofitted and positioned along the top edge of the walls which would put more units closer to the mouth and nose area of the riders. It might block the advertisments along the upper walls."
2020-08-10 15:39:58,What about the ventilation on the platforms? Most riders spend at least a few minutes on the platform waiting for the train. What is the ventilation like there?
2020-08-10 11:58:33,"Helpful information for those considering riding subways. Sounds too risky for me, but for those with no choice it still emphasizes the importance of masks and even with a mask on one should try to sneeze and cough into one's bent elbow or hand or into one's shirt or jacket and turn away from others. Also, the MBTA should constantly determine the approximate percent  the cars are filled, and rope off adjacent seats, and electronically indicate when cars are loaded to max occupancy, and when the whole train is at max recommended occupancy then no more new riders are admitted. Some people will be late for work but their employers should understand the situation. So much of this is common sense, but it takes money to carry out.
This should be done for buses and buildings.
And  for commercial air flights and the info should be EASILY available for prospective flyers. Getting safety information from airlines is like pulling teeth."
2020-08-10 12:25:19,"Fascinating use of graphics to tell the story. 

One question that comes to mind: The illustration appears to show one of the (relatively) modern subway cars, such as you'd find on the E, 7 or 4/5 lines. What about one of those old 1960s and '70s clunkers that still rumbles along the A, C or 1 lines? I can't imagine that their systems are nearly as effective. This is all the more reason that the state needs to find the money to keep funding the MTA at full strength."
2020-08-10 14:58:02,"It will be a long time before I feel comfortable getting back on the metro, even if the facts say its safe. It's hard to be rational about certain things, and a metro during a pandemic is one of them -- unfortunately."
2020-08-10 16:19:34,"Why hasn't the federal government used its authority to order companies to produce orders of magnitude more of the highly protective N95-type masks? They were common in stores before Covid-19. The government should subsidize them and direct their distribution based on epidemiological expertise.

We can do this. It's easier than vaccine R & D."
2020-08-10 15:08:02,"This doesn't really make me feel better, because there's the caveat that everyone needs to wear a mask AND that once we're at capacity, protection drops much more. There should be incentives for employers who can have employees work from home to continue doing that until there's a vaccine. That would provide better protection for in-person workers and school kids commuting."
2020-08-10 16:25:08,"Nice visualization but an important detail is missing:

""MERV filters are rated on a scale of one to 20. Experts recommend that indoor spaces upgrade their filters to a level 13 to help ward against the airborne transmission of the coronavirus""

Is higher or lower numbers better on that scale? Does MERV-7 need to be upgraded or does it exceed the requirement?"
2020-08-10 12:25:36,"Now, NYT, please investigate in how many subway cars this filtration system is broken."
2020-08-10 12:53:17,"The mask requirement is not enforced on the subway.  People get on the car and pull them down below their noses and chins, if they are wearing them at all My recent personal experience was 6 not wearing/not properly wearing masks, spread throughout a car with about 50 people on it.  

This is the second article in two weeks where The Times seems to be cheerleading for people to ride the subway.  May I suggest to the writers that the next article focus on why the mask requirement is not enforced, and that The Times use its platform to push our elected officials to do something about that."
2020-08-10 13:04:42,"Having ridden the NY subway I remember the remarkably high ventilation rate, much better than a typical hospital, which is the most important safety factor. Masks and minimizing hand contact help as well. Countries like South Korea and Japan that depend on mass transit have been able to stop the virus. If you have a fev er or are coughing or sneezing please stay home."
2020-08-10 13:23:15,"Appreciate the article, but please stop with the fear mongering of the subways. Studies in other dense cities have found no evidence of greater transmission on transit (Tokyo, Paris, Hong Kong).

2020-08-10 15:41:35,Was this supposed to make us feel more confident about taking the train? Lol. Hard pass. Do a similar article on planes please and inside cars (taxis and Ubers). Interested to see the situation there.
2020-08-10 16:12:01,"Thanks, NYT.  Just what we need.  More ad nauseum minutiae to feed people's fears.  Life is full of risks.  Should we all just lock ourselves in our homes until an effective vaccine is available?  

Again, moderation is what we need...just stick to the basics.  Mask, distance, don't touch face, wash hands."
2020-08-10 15:09:50,Sounds best to avoid the subway and office buildings.
2020-08-10 15:22:51,Perhaps a lightweight clear plastic helmet similar to a space suit may be the answer until a vaccine is developed. Unlike Japan and South Korea we simply do not have the discipline to wear masks.
2020-08-10 15:28:55,"What superb analysis and graphics, thank you! It would be amazing if you folks could create one for airplanes. I love the NYT."
2020-08-10 15:43:17,"Strange that this very detailed article makes no mention of the simple act of opening a window, especially while running the ventilation system. Anyone in an extremely hot place knows the fastest way to cool off your baking car is to open the windows and blast your AC for 30 seconds. Air flow assisted by window would be pretty essential, no?"
2020-08-10 14:43:31,"Engineering analysis is finally getting a seat at the table for mitigating the pandemic.  Hopefully soon, room ventilation and filtering should be at the top of people’s minds in regard to COVID safety."
2020-08-10 14:50:01,"Protecting people in subways, restaurants, malls, and other population aggregation sites against the Covid virus is very important.  But, the cost of installing effective, new filter systems nation and world-wide is very, very high.  The only sensible and effective solution is rapid immunization of the human population, starting with people in cities and users of travel systems."
2020-08-10 15:20:25,What about subway platforms. It seems fewer people wear masks on platforms than inside subway cars. Is there any filtration there?
2020-08-10 15:46:45,"If this piece was meant to reassure me that subway car ventilation is enough, it did not succeed."
2020-08-10 15:54:27,I don’t know.... this just confirmed that I shouldn’t ride the subway or the SFMuni light right system. Nothing works! So ima assume that the ventilation systems and filter don’t work either.
2020-08-10 16:30:52,"Subway commuters need masks that protect THEM.  The end of this article reports that as ridership increases, so does the virus count.  People need to have masks that provide virus-free air in a virus-laden environment.  The quality N95/P100 masks that protect our medical personnel will also protect you.  Remember, the N95 mask filters 95% of virus, the P100 mask filters 99.96 of virus.  
In the subway environment, where exposure is also depends on the amount of time exposed, wearing non-vented goggles is also needed.  I would also be wearing gloves.

 
Quality N95/P100 masks also have a foam inner liner that improves the fit and reduces leakage.  They also usually have 1/2"" adjustable straps to improve fit and comfort.

Unfortunately,  because of our fractured population, the ability to breathe virus-free air in a virus-laden environment is a key to opening up in the U.S.  The subway car is a good example of the many closed space challenges we face, e.g. offices, elevators, classrooms, buses.  

We won't get these quality N95/P100 masks until our experts start promoting them.  Paradoxically, our medical personnel won't have enough of these masks until everyone has them."

2020-08-10 12:35:29,"Very informative.  And your last couple of paragraphs make the best case for why the MTA and the NYPD should be handing out masks (a carrot) and issuing fines for not wearing masks (a stick) at every station and on spot checks of subway cars, since compliance now is 70-75% at best. A much better use of funds to fight the pandemic than the millions that are spent nightly on the subway COVID cleaning theater."
2020-08-10 16:40:24,"""...Many New Yorkers are avoiding the subway, fearful of jostling with strangers in crowded cars...""

I am not a New Yorker but the bit about jostling with strangers caught my eye. I am not sure there is a meaningful distinction between friend and stranger when it comes to catching the virus, although it is understandable that we tend to trust more those that we know.  I would be curious to see the results of contact tracing as to how often transmission is through someone who is known as opposed to a complete stranger."
2020-08-10 16:44:20,"Beautiful graphics -- and a lovely model of how air moves in a new and completely empty car. What happens when passengers' seated or standing bodies are in the way? Better yet -- where is the safest spot a passenger can stand? 

Meanwhile, ignorance-based self-care inspires me to hold my breath for 30 seconds whenever I hear a cough or sneeze. Even from the cat."
2020-08-10 16:46:23,"So what happens when the subway stalls in the tracks and the system is shut off?  This happens FREQUENTLY on the NYC subways due to ""electrical switch"" issues.  Sometimes you're stuck on tracks for up to 15-20 mins and the air systems are definitely not active during those times."
2020-08-10 16:50:09,"I lived in Manhattan from 1970 until 1991, and rode the subways almost daily complete with shoulder to shoulder crowds, homeless people, urine and vomit on the floors, and so on.  On average, I contracted 2-3 short incidences of a mild rhino virus  or bacterial sinus infection per year.  In the 1970s, I seemed to contract 1-2 cases of norovirus per year, perhaps due to what I ate myself.  With the subway poles and the stair rails, etc., I must have touched surfaces that had been touched by thousands of people.  Bottom line:  these viral diseases are short-lived, and I consider myself extremely lucky to have had nothing more serious.  Other bottom line:  it is very difficult to condition oneself to this new normal of masks, social distancing, and constant hand and surface sanitizing.   Instead of a night of gastro-intestinal distress or a few days of stuffy nose, this new pathogen can kill or leave permanent damage.  We need an even more intensive public health effort to educate, mandate, and enforce measures to contain the disease and save lives."
2020-08-10 16:51:31,Imagine what it's like for us Londoners stuck 58.5 meters (192 feet) below ground on the Northern Line next to some sneezing tourist in the middle of summer on trains with almost no mechanical ventilation.

2020-08-10 16:57:09,"This is a great interactive graphic, thanks. However, I'm still not comfortable with riding the subway. Just last week I had to for something mandatory, and there were at least 4 people who took off their masks. NYPD and MTA need to enforce issuing fines. There are many transit systems that do and I think it will help enforce the severity of the pandemic. It's not over, yet people are treating it like it is."
2020-08-10 17:10:05,"What? This can't be. We had a column here saying traveling on the train is safer than ever form covid. Now a simple sneeze shows it flowing all around the train. 

Seriously though, the trains are sadly too tight to maintain social distancing and preventing the spread of covid. Maybe with limited people per car with masks will be okay, but even with a mask it shows a decent spread due to the tight quarters. Same issue likely on a plane or bus as well."
2020-08-10 17:14:42,"It would, as always, be interesting and extremely useful to bring in additional sources of data of relevance.  What is empirically observed in Japan, for instance, where public transport has been widely used throughout the pandemic?  Why hasn't that fueled explosive outbreaks (or has it?)?"
2020-08-10 17:15:52,"This visualization is really cool. As an animator I really appreciate the skill it takes to make something so elegant.

That said, I have no plans to get on any public transportation for a good long time, including planes."
2020-08-10 17:16:40,"How often the filters are replaced? 

Critical for an increase of riderships are clean trains and clean stations. Visibly, trained cleaning personal should get engaged throughout the day cleaning stations and trains. That would improve the confidence of people who would like to use public transportation.

Maybe the MTA could consult the Tokyo ""MTA"" management for some advice. Tokyo has one of the cleanest public transportation systems in the world. Why not consider their experiences?"
2020-08-10 17:18:03,"Great graphics. NYT has really moved into the 21st century.  I would be curious to see the demographics of the prior year of ridership vs. those riding now.  The subway has always been the melting pot of this 5 borough community, but I suspect that it has now become the primary source of rides for the working class.  

If one looks at the cumulative components of COVID-19 exposure risk for the working class (e.g. public transportation, service jobs around other people, shared housing with less cleaning of common areas, fewer receiving confirmatory diagnoses) we should not be surprised when the analysis suggests that this pandemic is targeting the disadvantaged in much greater proportion."
2020-08-10 17:19:25,"Very important, we also need a program to upgrade filters from MERV-7 a very modest filter not of much use in this situation to MERV-13 that actually can capture most of the virus particles (not all).  The better filters need stronger fans to push the air through so the use of better filters is necessary however costly for the fan upgrades.

If you buy filters for your home by going to Home Depot or Lowes or ... The filters offered for your home start at MERV-7, the lowest quality, and go up to MERV-13 the higher quality, usually in four steps (7, 9, 11/12, 13)"
2020-08-10 17:24:49,"Someone’s probably said this on this Comment thread but I posit that not all subway travelers will be wearing masks.  And one or two coronavirus carriers can, IMO, spew an awful number of virus filled droplets in that one car.

This may partially explains that Hawaii is still one state that is less affected by SAR-CoV-2 than others (but getting worse).
What city on the mainland (in CA, FL?) had embraced similar 'indigenous' ventilation in designing their infrastructure?"
2020-08-10 17:51:46,"But what happens when we try to ride during rush hour? Will everyone stay six feet apart? How many trains will we have to let pass before it's truly safe to get on board? 

I'm a NYC public school teacher and can't imagine my teenage students following any rules regarding social distancing -- let alone mask wearing -- and even if we are rotating kids on an every-other day basis, that's still a lot of kids riding trains during rush hour."
2020-08-10 17:56:50,"Not reassuring at all. Still a huge risk. What about older trains or what happens when they stall or fail in between stops? Been on numerous trains in nyc over the last 30 years and there are plenty of times all air and ventilation stops, for whatever reason. Riding the subway is about as safe as any other enclosed space these days."
2020-08-10 17:57:39,"Wish the author had made the effort to report on what a ""MERV 7"" filter is good for.  It is a very coarse filter.  It is not intended or rated to capture any particles below 3 microns.  It is supposedly able to capture 50% to 70% of large particles (3 microns to 10 microns).  For reference a virus particle is about 100 nm (0.1 microns).   Respiratory droplets (think coughs and sneezes) are in the 5 micron to 10 micron size - so this type of filter would be expected to capture roughly half of those.    The good news is that the cars have a fairly high air exchange rate, so fresh air is constantly diluting the air inside the cars.  But, given how hot and muggy most subway cars are, I would guess that many of these ventilation units are broken - has the MTA released any information on numbers of cars in service with one or two broken ventilation units?  Would they remove a car from service for a broken ventilation unit?"

2020-08-10 17:22:07,"Great graphics as always - reinforces my decision to avoid the subway still. Most of these models and claims are based on subways running at 50% capacity or less, as they do right now since everyone is still largely working from home until labor day. 

Considering I regularly find myself wedged next to someone's armpit it's so crowded, I find it unbelievable theses cars can be made safe once it's back to running at its pre-COVID levels of over capacity. New Yorkers are pretty good at wearing masks, but I would not bet on every single rider having one once it's full up. 

I don't have an answer, I just know I'm going to pass for now."

     That work, led by Lydia Bourouiba at MIT, reveals that a cough or sneeze produces a moist, turbulent gas cloud which hurtles forward at speeds between 33 - 100 feet per second. The cloud protects its constituent droplets from evaporation and can deliver them as a 'payload' up to 25 feet away in under one second.  
      The article does not seem to describe a ventilation system designed to protect anybody against inhaling such a payload. 
      A competent mask, on the other hand, can dramatically slow down that cloud, keeping it near the head of the sneezer where it can gently join their 'thermal plume' (a chimney-like heat gradient rising around each of our heads), on its journey to the ceiling.
     Why is this crucial set of insights not represented?

2020-08-10 16:43:50,"You should have not used the example of a sneeze.  Covid-19 is a lung disease causing people to cough not sneeze.
   The MTA should up grade their filters to a higher level and change them more often.
    It is very unlikely to catch covid-19 from surfaces.  The MTA should stop spending money on cleaning surfaces and make sure everybody in the subway wears a mask."

Nice job NYT Interactive Staff in creating this!"

2020-08-10 17:59:46,"Phenomenal reporting. NYTimes at its best.

However its not just the subway ventilation system that needs scrutiny.

Our entire built environment that depends on artificial re-circulated ventilation needs to be re-scrutinized. 

All of our transportation systems need to address this issue as well. 

Thank you NYTimes for going deeper on this very important issue."
2020-08-10 18:02:38,"I was on a fairly empty (maybe 10 people) subway car last week, and most people were masked.  A couple of NYPD police officers entered the car and stood facing each other at the doors next to me.  One office wore a mask.  The other did not---his mask was under his chin.  I signalled twice to the unmasked officer to put up his mask, which he saw and ignored.  I finally spoke aloud to him and asked him to put on his mask.  He ignored that too.  If officers don't obey the regulations, they endanger others, and set a bad example."
2020-08-10 18:06:10,"The air circulation demonstrated is fine, but does not account for many factors: multiple people sneezing/coughing on crowded trains, emitted particles adhering to surfaces like seats and grab-bars, etc. Also the circulation of ""outside air"" mentioned does not account for most trains that are underground rather than outside. The ""outside air"" in these cases is air from the tunnels. I know there is ventilation in the tunnels, but honestly, how healthy and clean can that air be?"
2020-08-10 18:14:04,"Are these the old/poorly maintained trains currently in circulation, or the new ones we've been waiting years to take delivery of?

Also, are we really going to analyze subways airflow when the filtration system on most trains aren't maintained properly. Many of the interior train ceilings are covered in black mold, if you look closely."
2020-08-10 18:11:47,"The graphics show quite a bit of particulates coming out of the sides of a masked sneezer. Most masks fit loosely on the sides and under the chin allowing incoming and outgoing viral particles an easy escape route. Even worse, many people have masks with exhaust valves that almost insure sneeze droplets exit mask containment with ease.
A cylinder made from about 15 inches of one leg of a pantie hose or nylon stocking has been shown to press any mask quite tightly against the face. 
This youtube video demonstrates a no-cut no sew version of the pantie hose fix using one leg of spandex exercise shorts pulled over your head.

2020-08-10 18:19:38,"This virus could never have jumped across the entire world as fast as it did if it had to rely on coughing and sneezing people for transportation.  The frightening reality is that it has a solid two days to spread via seemingly well victims who are just breathing, talking or laughing.  And now it appears that many who never ever get symptoms at all are capable of spreading Covid.  Cleaning subway cars at night and running away from sneezers and coughers can't to stop it.  We've got a huge fight on our hands, and in order to win, we will have to do what they did in other countries, and what appears to be working in NY:  Confine everyone, then test,isolate, test, and repeat until community presence is close to zero. That's when you can open up bars, schools, mass trans, and other confined spaces while continuing to test, trace,  and isolate positives."
2020-08-10 18:26:53,"Great work from a winning team.  You delivered crucial information in a very effective combination of organization and visualization thru words, pictures and movement.  Three cheers for your work.  I am now less afraid of using the subway system.  Thank you."
2020-08-10 18:32:16,Back in the day I was one of those obnoxious teenagers hanging out between cars smoking.  So obviously the doors opened. And we'd open the windows on the trains in the summer to get a breeze - when the ac didn't work - which was always. Is their no longer a way to ventilate the cars via window?
2020-08-10 18:34:11,"MERV7, for the pandemic time is simply not good enough and change every 36 days is not good enough .
Acceptable: change filters to MERV11 minimum and sanitize them and the A/C system with ozonators daily. Using ozonators would sanitize the whole wagon."
2020-08-10 18:41:02,"Thank you so much-- the evidence so far shows that aerosols/air circulation is so much more important than we appreciated. 

Is there a similar simulation/graphic for airplane travel, maybe using the most common form of airplane that is commercially used (in US?)   With kids heading back/to schools, I keep trying to tell folks that distance btwn seats (although fewer seats occupied helps) is not as worrisome as air exchange/re-circulation.  What do commercial airlines have to do to comply with guidelines? Are they?  Thanks."
2020-08-10 18:50:43,"Great information. Only thing is that there are any number of times I have gotten on the subway, PATH train or NJ Transit and the system was not on. I was on a NJ Transit train a while ago and my car's system was not on. I was told by the conductor to move to another car if I would like.  So MTA has to make sure all of their subway cars' systems are in working order."
2020-08-10 18:53:20,Let's be real. The MTA isn't in the business of transportation. The MTA is way of creating jobs and securing votes.
2020-08-10 18:56:34,"This informative article gives all the information needed to demonstrate that unless everyone on the subway car is wearing a mask, you need to wear an N95 or higher grade mask."
2020-08-10 19:00:23,You still have to wait at the platform..where there is no circulation and the air hangs heavy.   Imagine a crowded platform 10 stories below....and taking the escalator (when it works) up to the street.  Or the elevator if it works.   No thanks!  I will avoid the subways at all costs.
2020-08-10 19:15:53,"These graphics are wonderful and I see the trains are cleaner and the air smells fresher inside the cars. However, with the graphic, they don't show what happens when a person sneezes and the train is moving. Someone sneezing in the front of the train while the train moves, by the laws of physics, the particles move much faster toward the back of the train car. Hopefully those vents and the air filtration system handles that well. Hope is more of a risk than a lot of people are willing to take during this pandemic."
2020-08-10 19:21:16,"The ventilation in airplanes use HEPA filters, which function the same way as the filters in the subway car. However, following the social distancing norms in the airplanes is quite difficult when compared to the subway car due to huge differences in the cost involved.  The biggest problem a person can step out of the car if the person beside him sneezes but that is not possible in the aircabin and thus leaving people more exposed to virus. 
More investment should be done to bring better masks in the market which can trap the big particles that are harmful to health. This will help individual to survive not only the pandemic time but also long period ahead which looks murky due to polluted air."
2020-08-10 19:24:12,"Errrr...

What about platforms and stations?

Many of them have no ventilation at all other than the whoosh of the car."
2020-08-10 19:35:04,"Nice presentation. However, as an infectious diseases physician, I think there needs to be a more widespread public awareness campaign, showing how to PROPERLY wear a mask: covering one's mouth AND NOSE, all the way up to the bridge of the nose. Not sitting hanging from an ear. Not just covering the mouth. Virus is shed from the nose, where it lives, as well as from the mouth."
2020-08-10 19:41:18,"I see ZERO enforcement and apparently the NYPD has been ordered to not enforce so what are we to do ? which agency do we call.  I would be willing to enforce on my own but, if things go wrong, I fear being accused of assault, if I am met with a violent response.  The riding public needs guidance on this issue."
2020-08-10 15:09:47,People who are participating in vaccine trials need to get exposed to the live coronavirus in order to see how effective the vaccine is . Riding in a public mass transportation container would be a good way for that to happen. Another quicker way would be to just have them breathe in the live virus in a laboratory.

2020-08-10 20:07:31,"I recently had the pleasure of riding the MTA last week for the first time in months. I counted a full third of people on my car both ways were not wearing masks, or had their masks around their chins. Fortunately no one sneezed on my rides. There was one man who decided this was the best time to sing loudly walking up and down the car... without a mask of course.

I'm happy the HVAC system helps filter particles. But without 100% mask compliance, it can only be so effective. I am concerned about the thousands of riders who have to use the system every day to commute with have no other choice."
2020-08-10 20:28:16,"Bottom line - PERSONAL responsibility (i.e. - masks) has to be expected and, if not, ENFORCED.

2020-08-10 20:53:16,"Interesting to see this today, as I just completed my first subway ride since March 12. In case you haven't ridden, let me tell you: About 90 percent of riders were wearing masks, but that's not enough to make a reasonable person feel safe. All it takes is for 1 unmasked, Covid-infected person to sneeze and put the heath of every other rider of that car in jeopardy. I will not be riding the subway again until the MTA can prove they're enforcing the mask mandate. And I don't know how on earth they would do that without employing literally thousands of officers willing to stand up to the bold and the reckless. NY better hope for a vaccine soon because I can't imagine people like me returning to the MTA without one."
2020-08-10 21:41:36,"A number of engineering studies that I have run across have indicated that in most HVAC systems, the return velocity CFM is insufficient to truly capture and return virus particulates through the return ducts.  Thus the true ability to capture particulates with higher costing MERV filters or scrubbing the return air with UV lights is negligible.  If this is true, the only conclusion I can come away with is pumping in a lot of fresh air and increasing the supply CFM to dilute any virus particulates so that it’s less concentrated, which is essentially what they are already doing on the train.  It’s still unnerving."
2020-08-10 20:44:10,"The Times is mistaking the functions of the subway crewmen. 

The conductor and other passenger trainman do not work in the control cabin. They remain in the passenger areas of the car, embarking and disbarking passengers, making sure the doors close properly, checking trackside signals, and seeing to the safety of the passengers. The conductor is the crew supervisor and is in radio or phone communication with the motorman and the subway dispatcher.

People regularly make jokes about the um,
unique aromas on the subway, so it was a surprise to see that air quality levels went up - drastically - simply by boarding the train every day. Clearly the filtration system and air flow engineering are better than people generally assume, I think that while UV treatment would be ideal, just changing the filters more often will also help.

Very informative and clearly illustrated, thanks."
2020-08-10 22:21:34,So wearing a mask and sneezing sends viral particles all though out the car until its fully refreshed at 3.20 minutes. Thats plenty of time to get sick and particles go all over! Forget riding it

2020-08-10 21:56:10,"To be honest, I haven't dared to go on the subway yet even though I respect the assurances of Governor Cuomo et. al. about how clean the cars are now.  They can disinfect the cars -- but they cannot disinfect the riders!

I have ridden on Metro North a couple of times and the ridiculous behavior on those trains by passengers would leave me petrified if also practiced on the subway.

On the commuter trains, many passengers immediately remove their masks as soon a train conductors pass by.  Only to quickly put them back on if she or he returns.  It's like being in a room full of kindergartners playing peek-a-boo!

The idea of getting onto a subway train without even the inadequate monitoring of a passing train conductor fills me with absolute dread.

I've lived in NYC all my 69 years and I'm a strong believer in urban living and mass transit etc.  But I'm not willing to die because I want to ride on a subway train.  a train filled with social malcontents and simpletons who either don't wear a mask at all or wear it like a gag with their noses hanging out.

Sorry, I'm off the trains and buses until there's a proven vaccine.  No amount of scrubbing and disinfecting the cars will change the behavior of the riders.

In fact, it is the behavior of the riders who are still on the trains that scares people like me off of them.  The trains are becoming a travel mode of last resort.  Anyone with options to get around otherwise will simply avoid the trains and buses  altogether."

2020-08-10 22:50:47,"Some riders on mass transit systems talk up a storm on their phones or otherwise for extended periods of time. In addition to requiring riders to wear masks, mass transit authorities should consider designating certain subway or commuter train cars as “quiet cars” and/or certain buses as “quiet buses”, especially during rush hours, thus reducing the amount of aerosols riders release into crowded and confined spaces."
2020-08-10 19:52:52,Where did the Times find a subway car without a homeless person sleeping in the corner amidst their posessions?
2020-08-10 22:56:12,"""MERV filters are rated on a scale of one to 20. Experts recommend that indoor spaces upgrade their filters to a level 13 to help ward against the airborne transmission of the coronavirus. Subway cars use filters that are rated MERV-7""

And AC units in the Sunbelt, where UV in the hot spaces outside icecold bars kills The Virus in 30 seconds, have similar MERV ratings if you're lucky.

HEPA filters (equivalent to MERV 17-20) which can remove well over 99% of virus particles cost more than standard subway filters that leave around 1/3 of virus particles on each pass.

But what do lost sick days, extra ICU beds and deaths cost, economically and culturally?

I've been saying here for a couple of months that ALL AC filters should be upgraded to HEPA asap.

And I've been gobsmacked to see almost nothing in MSM about this key question.

...Talk about False Economics - HEPA material is readily available and could have been fitted to all AC units in the US months ago.

If I were president I'd have mandated such replacement at federal cost...

...would have saved a LOT of money... and lives."

2020-08-10 23:12:04,"I’m the only one wearing a face shield no matter where I go, and a blue surgical mask over my cloth mask, a hat and gloves. Yeah, it’s hot and sometimes hard to breather but I wouldn’t get on the subway without call of that. I rode it once in June and in every car there was at least one person with their mask under their nose and on the platform, none. Where I live a cab or a Lyft is prohibitively expensive to midtown. The mask wearing has to be enforced or this is all meaningless. I like the term “cleaning theatre” up thread."
2020-08-10 22:56:51,Long and not that insightful. I cannot imagine writing such an article without comparing the experience to travelling on an airplane.

Perhaps what is intended is that over the course of any given minute this fraction is replaced by air from outside. ""Minute"" and ""moment"" are different. Also, it's certainly not true that the air is ever fully replaced, and  I don't know where the 3'20"" came from. You can say what the average stay of a molecule of air is, and the 75% rule leads to an estimate of 4 minutes for the average. Some molecules will stick around for much longer, and some will leave immediately."
2020-08-10 23:32:05,"As a retired aerosol scientist I am very pleased to see that there is starting to be discussion of air flow, fresh air changes per hour, and filtration efficiency and the use of air flow computer simulations.  Applying this type of information  to schools, workplaces, and social gathering is essential for controlling COVID-19.  

Isolation and distancing were appropriate were good first responses at the start, but after months of pandemic it is time to use technology."
2020-08-11 00:28:29,"I wish the fresh air intake had been elaborated better.  When the train is stopped at Grand Central stop is the ""fresh air"" being drawn in from the platform.  You would be hard pressed to find anyone describing this air as ""fresh""."
2020-08-11 01:09:32,This is really interesting. What kind of mask was used in the sneeze simulation?
2020-08-11 02:38:09,"I was on an airplane recently.  Although I think the flight attendants, and most of the other passengers were being careful, there was a group of teenagers sitting near me.  They had to be told multiple times by other passengers and the crew, including the captain, to pull their masks over their noses, and leave them on.  I felt very unsafe on that flight.  It was my return flight.  On the initial flight, I felt very safe,  I notified the airline, Southwest, that I would not be flying again soon.  Not really their fault, but there are too may irresponsible people."
2020-08-11 03:16:37,Very nice graphics indeed. How would the UV lights be deployed? Would the UV-B lights be reflective towards the filtration system and less harmful than if they were directed at the passenger compartment ?  Enquiring Times readers want to know.

At times some folks cry fake news once they think the situation is not correctly described - I think the NYT can do better. Can the article be changed to answer the following: How many different models are used? What is the % of the described subway car versus some other model? Are there models without Merv-7 filter? How often does one of the 2 air condition unit fail in average?
Who states the facts - is the manufacturer or the MTA?  When is a filter change needed? - in a way this a money question - how many got changed in the last 1/2 year and what % does that reflect - are the filters actually changed more often as planned or not. Quote ""...they may be replaced sooner if needed"". Who detemines it and how - once it is wet?  Any wishful thinking causes me to rank down the article on the quality scale. There are particle sensors that can be used to count particles of certain sizes - is there any checking that the filters are actually correctly installed? We are all human - mistakes happen.  Why do we wear often a new mask and the subway filter lasts 36 days? How often are the tunnels vented? Is the used air filltered before it is released into the tunnel? These are just some questions that came to mind."

Here are my last two experiences with public transportation in Seattle and why I only ride my bike (or walk) at this point.  I decided that rather than show up to my doctor's office in biking shorts, I would take the bus there.  The front half was completely taped off to protect the driver.  Most seats had signs saying whether you could or could not sit there but passengers chose to ignore them.  A guy in the back literally screamed at the top of his lungs the entire trip before he got off.  The whole back should have been cleaned afterwards but others loaded on and more than likely sat in his spot.  A few Metro drivers have died from COVID-19 here in Seattle.

I took a train recently and because they are not charging fares, the homeless are now camping out.  I stood a few feet away from a junkie who was drooling all over himself and the seats as he ""nodded off"".  The ventilation on that train was nowhere near as powerful as my little grow tent in the bedroom which has a 700+ CFM fan for a little 4.5'x4.5' tent.  

And don't even get me started how many times I have been physically threatened on city buses."

Not much was addressed in the article about the eviction crisis.  I see the problem in very simple terms.  Rent doesn't get paid because those funds are needed to buy food.  Eviction results in families that perhaps have food, but definitely are now homeless.  Without evictions, there are well over half a million homeless Americans.  Where in the midst of our botched reaction to the virus, can these additional homeless Americans survive?"

Trump is willing to play with the financial security of millions of families to create the pretense of being their saviour. In reality, he's done nothing to help anyone, including himself. His actions only serve to highlight the power he doesn't have, which is to change the appropriation of billions of dollars with a flick of his pen. Chaos, confusion and misunderstanding results when Trump gets involved with anything. He's like the little kid who begs to be included in the older kids projects, then makes a mess of it when they let him.

Pelosi even said the Dems would compromise if the Senate met them halfway and agreed to 2 Trillion of the 3 Trillion the House had already passed. But Trump doesn't want to compromise if that meant giving relief to Democrat-led blue states. So, instead we watch Benito Trump sign executive orders. What a farce! Obama with Congressional Dems and some Republicans saved the economy from Republican mismanagement by pouring $$$ into the system in 2009 in spite of the sin of ""deficit"" spending. The first stimulus package using deficit spending obviously saved much of the economy this spring and now Republicans are worrying about deficits again, even after the ""Trump tax cut"" which slashed corporate taxes, but didn't put much cash into the pockets of ordinary Americans who most needed it.. Trump wants now to cut payroll taxes ????? when too many millions don't even get a ""payroll"" salary. Republicans are living in a fantasy world of their own imagination.

Remember, 70 percent of GDP is consumer driven. The unemployed need help so please stop the bickering and help them
Regarding suspension of the payroll tax, it was not clear if employer share was suspended too. If so, Trump companies benefit from it. Perhaps this is why he suggested it in the first place."

Meanwhile, everyone with a job may or may not end up paying a few dollars less in taxes per paycheck, if their companies redo piles of paperwork and if they agree to it. Then we all get to pay that tax back come filing time next year, or maybe not, who knows.

found trembling from fear  in the back shed lest ogre find them and  threaten   their campaign funding. 

Good luck with that. 

Meanwhile, the urge to confess what is the real goal of this staged ""breakdown"" can be  detected herein:

“If the Democrats want to challenge us in court and hold up unemployment benefits to those hardworking Americans that are out of a job because of Covid, they’re going to have a lot of explaining to do,” Mr. Mnuchin said.

Of course, he could have also added the same thought about all the small business owners left dangling in the putrid air. But they're not supposed to be democratic party voters. 

That is, it's a consciously constructed  scenario to try and convince   a natural pool of now really suffering democratic party voters to get angry at someone other than ogre. 

Not terribly subtle, as well as quite vicious. Then again, this  can't be surprising since ogre's  thorough amorality has been on exhibit since day 1 by his sick   indifference to suffering. 
So, how could he pass on a golden opportunity to hide his bloodied hands   and do the same thing here?"

Trump is afraid of Nancy Pelosi."
2020-08-10 15:16:28,"This is just a brilliant move.  Trump has stolen the narrative directly out of the Democrat's hands and yet again they are left wondering what just happened and how they let themselves be beaten.  Dems assumed they would look like the ones trying to help ordinary Americans (see, the stingy Republicans are the ones who think the newly unemployed should only get an extra $200/week instead of the $600 we were shooting for).  Of course the Dems were more than willing to hold these ordinary Americans hostage in order to load up the emergency relief bill with pork which totalled $3 trillion +, most of which is not going to ordinary Americans.  They figured Republicans would have to cave to every demand or else face election consequences from all the unemployed people who are now in dire straits. In steps Donald J. to the rescue with a campaign line that practically writes itself!  Yet again, the Donald is underestimated and totally flummoxes his opponents."

This is right out of the dictators playbook. Create a crisis that requires action, block the action and then blame the opposition for not allowing the executive to act unilaterally (and outside the laws and constitution). 

This is all about consolidating all government powers in the hands of one individual. This is a blatant attempt to overthrow the constitution and install a dictatorship.   

Sadly, the RNC is cheering the plan, not defending the constitution. 

I remember a book titled: ""None Dare Call It Treason.""  We are living it right now at the highest levels of government.

The $600 he was receiving was too much; he had no incentive to go back to work, and when twice offered his job back he turned it down. $400 seems about right based on his situation which I think is typical of most people's. I believe Trump, at least trying to help whereas Democrats in Congress would not even approve an extension of the previous program and its $600, is now guaranteed re-election. Will even Trump haters like you people here cut their noses off to spite their faces and vote against a man who has helped them with $400 instead of nothing."

With Congress unable to arrive at its own compromise, with the public awaiting rescue while the lifeguards argue on shore as to how it is to be done, the President comes in with a number of measures that outline what the Congressional compromise should have been.

Are the President's actions to provide relief all Constitutional?   Likely not.   But it would take a lot of chutzpah on the part of Democrats to seek an injunction to take that limited relief away, while intractable negotiations go on.

The President has signaled what kind of compromise he would be willing to sign.   Add to it the $1200 relief payment, pass it through Congress, and call it a day.

At this point, the Democrats remind me of the villain  in a Perils of Pauline movie, grumbling ""Curses!!"" as Dudley Dooright saves the tied up maiden from the railroad track, as the train approaches.

The business of government has become business.  It is the age of GOPism - the belief that government is the problem and needs to be defunded.

That right, those who rail at ""defunding the police"" have been busy defunding our government for decades.  Now, good governance is nearly gone.

But the military is well funded.  Americans have recently spent trillions (and counting) on the killing of millions for no good reason.  We are taxed for the military - more than the entire rest of the planet pays for ""defense.""  

With less than 5% of the world's population, America has 25% of the world's prisoners.  We have more people in jail than any other country.

America is now the most unequal of modern democracies.  All of this has been promoted by the great majority of the nation's Christians.  They vote Republican like it was tattooed on their bottoms at baptism.

I've watched the GOP intently now for forty years.  I know, beyond any reasonable doubt, the GOP represents the wealthy alone.  Period.  The GOP has nearly destroyed the American Dream.  Now it wants to take it all the way.  The Christians are helping them."
2020-08-10 14:35:10,"Two things very clearly illustrate the depth of the concern and empathy Republicans have for the American people.  Two months ago the Republican controlled Senate received the House ""Heroes Bill"" extending the $600 a month unemployment benefits, the moratorium on evictions, and providing other measures to help the American people. After doing nothing for that two months to address the issues, the Republicans have proved by two actions what they are and where they stand when it comes to caring about the American people.  The first act is that of Steve Mnuchin saying, two months after doing nothing,  “We don’t have to get everything done at once.""  “What we should do is get things done for the American public now, come back for another bill afterward.""  The second act, is  the caring act of President  Donald J. Trump, after two months of doing nothing, signing four inadequate and legally questionable executive orders for the suffering American people, while ensconsed in comfort at his Bedminster New Jersey golf club. The only question left is whether lying, unlimited money, voter ID, undermining mail-in balloting, sabotaging the US Post Office ability to timely deliver mail, closing voting precincts, doing nothing to stop the pandemic, and preventing the restoration of voting rights to felons who have served their sentence, will be enough to extend the charade of the Trump presidency for four more years, and beyond."
2020-08-10 14:45:05,"Trump’s “executive orders” have all the hallmarks of Trump the chief executive of the Trump Organization: they are bait and switch promises that evaporate when exposed to the light of day. The Federal portion of the enhanced unemployment is funded from emergency funds which if ever provided will be exhausted in 5 weeks. The payroll tax cut is a deferral which requires Congressional action to eliminate the eventual liability. Trump promised if re-elected, he would make the payroll tax cut permanent; but Kudlow exposed the bait and switch on TV yesterday; he claimed Trump only promised to forgive the amount deferred....and of course, actual elimination of the payroll tax would be a preliminary step in defunding Social Security and Medicare. Trump’s eviction moratorium is toothless.
The Democrats enabled Trump’s B/S PR announcement by not calling his bluff publicly; they should have detailed legislation targeted at the ordinary people who need help the most as a stand alone remedy. Trump and McConnell will never provide help to local governments; the Democrats will need to win the Presidency and both houses of Congress for that aid.
But it is hard to believe that Trump can continue to get away with his bait and switch routine; just as he couldn’t wish away he pandemic, he can’t b/s money into the pockets of those who desperately need it."

After all, they're not suffering, personally.  Speaker Pelosi no doubt has plenty of food in her $24,000 refrigerators, everyone looks very comfortable at the President's golf club, and the Senators just want to go on vacation.  This was supposed to be a negotiation between the House bill passed in May, and the Senate's determination of what was needed after the last coronavirus relief bill.

1. It does not help people who need it. How is that different from the the SALT deduction?

2. It depletes the SS trust. Since we don't have money to pay for any of this ""stimulus"", why don't we just print more like we are doing for everything else and deposit in the trust.

You see, as a middle income earner I am tired of sitting by and watching everyone around me cashing in while I continue to pay for it all. During the Obama years I saw my insurance costs spiral out of control after the ACA was passed. During the Trump years I say back and watched corporations and high income earners cash in while they tossed us a few crumbs. For a family earning 150k a year a payroll tax holiday is worth about 10 grand. If we can afford to pay 64% of the workforce more in unemployment than they were making while at work, we can certainly afford to toss something to the faithful middle income earners who pay for all of this stuff."

Is the money approved or not? Holding out for approving the money seems to be the main intention of the Democrats’ resistance.

I know a lot of people who don’t even make 600 a week so their whole paycheck plus some was extra money they should have a bunch saved if not that’s their fault for blowing it all they paid their bills before on what they made so this huge pay increase to stay at home should’ve helped them get a cushion built.

Let’s face it. 

Trump’s executive order signed at his New Jersey golf club is typical of his performance and behavior. Since he doesn’t have the mental acuity to process more than two things- tie my left shoelace, tie my right shoelace, whew I’m done for the day- he leaves all of the points to underlings, some of them well educated, but highly cynical. 

It would not surprise me to learn that the $400 unemployment “benefit” was crafted by Peter Navarro. Dr. Navarro has a PhD in economics, and for some time, a professor of economics at University of California, Irvine. His views, while usually right wing, rapidly absorbed conspiracy theory, and he was quickly given Emeritus status without any course load -￼aka fired.

Anyway, the so called “benefit” requires states to contribute some percentage matching. All well and good, except that if the states can’t meet the matching criteria, in addition to what they would normally pay, the federal government would not be required to pay the $400 benefit. Neat trick, don’t you think.

And, as far as the cheering throng at his Bedminster, New Jersey resort, it was easier to applaud the spectacle, rather than huff away in righteous indignation. Neither has much meaning in the larger scheme of things."

No business can survive without paying customers, which is the American public, but that seems to escape Republican thought.

There needs to be more federal support to expand testing so that everyone who wants a test can get one, enabling our nursing homes to be opened up to family visits. The states and cities need support so that they can continue to pay unemployment benefits to US citizens and continue to prove necessary services.

That's a major economic shock (along with things such as evictions) that will have grave political consequences, and until the realities hit, at a cost to us all, the Senate Repubs will not budge. But they will.

He flailed and flapped about helping ""workers and students"" when these things will do no such thing, and will probably be slapped down in the courts. 

At one point Navarro made it clear that these were simply stunts designed to appeal to ""Republicans and Independents,"" proving once again that Trump only cares to address people who voted for him, or who he thinks will vote for him. He showed once again that Trump is not the president of the United States. He is president of the Trump cult. 

One nice point at the end of his disastrous appearance was when Chuck Todd asked him where the president was--since he was not in Washington during these negotiations. Navarro responded that Trump was ""the hardest working president in history"" and that he was working even when he was on the golf course. That is a fitting epitaph."

The best strategy for the Democrats is to go on offense.   $3.4 trillion was needed in May.  It must be more now.  Pass a $5 trillion bill in the House as a new basis for negotiation.  It will drive Republicans nuts and back them into a corner, since they will once again be put in the uncomfortable position of rejecting aid for voters in need."

2020-08-10 17:19:50,"Calling the order counterproductive is an understatement. No one is going to receive aid based on the executive order. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress will shrug and say the White House is working on it. This is a disaster.

Not an unpredictable disaster though. Everyone knew Republicans weren't serious about cutting a deal when McConnell sidelined himself. You don't send Trump to negotiate if you actually want to accomplish anything. We're back to GOP obstruction of government.

Trump and the GOP have made it harder for Americans to receive relief. We're all going to suffer the consequences. You don't think you'll notice when your state and town run out of money?

2020-08-10 17:14:56,"Let me see if I have this right. Trump has signed a 4-part Executive order to “fix” everything and prove he is an effective leader. He first attended to the payroll tax situation by halting or “deferring” it, not cutting it, leaving the employed to repay them in 2021. If not able to be repaid, that amount will be deducted from Social Security funds.(Spoiler alert!). Second, he “proposed” to grant a $400 weekly unemployment compensation, of which $300 would be Federal funds, the other $100 coming from the states, already paying an average of $330 weekly and severely cash-strapped. Third, evictions are not halted, although for Federal Housing they could be. Instead, the HHS Secretary is asked to “consider” which eviction ban is needed. The Fourth has to do with Federally-funded student loans, whose interest would be deferred until the end of the year. It’s empty of substance, and useful only to pump up the people who follow him faithfully. Vote!"
2020-08-10 17:46:32,"Mr. Navarro, the Lord has nothing to do with it – the main cause of the inability to work across the aisle is on the Republicans as they slavishly toe the line of their Supreme Commander. Trump has always chosen to promote legislation that he deems to have ‘bling’ and that will blind his followers, yet when scrutinized fails to deliver. This is no different – it is a shell game, as is so much of what he does. He will always be confrontational - a loose cannon who thinks only of himself, re-election, and feathering his own nest – in fact, I think he disdains the American public unless they are in adoration mode. His presidency is one of the most catastrophic events to ever happen to the US."

They won't agree to anything without insisting on total control of everything from state & local law enforcement priorities to what is taught in public schools. Any help will be tied to onerous right wing mandates or else states go bankrupt, close schools, void pensions & the safety net, lay off police, cut environmental oversight, etc.

I can't say this definitively enough but we are dealing with right wing GOP Fascists. Why do you think the Senate has done NOTHING except stuffing the courts with right wing ideologue judges? It has nothing to do with abortion, that's a distraction that's conned as many on the left as their Evangelical base.

Why else is no lie, no conspiracy as told by Trump, Limbaugh, Hannity, FOX, right wing radio & websites, ever the final straw?

“I’m not going to lie, I have been skeptical about kids getting it,” Ms. Wright said. “But to be a part of this pandemic, it is a real thing. It’s not fun to have to FaceTime your daughter in the other room.”

Plus, there's this school principle saying the photo of a crowded hallway was taken 'out of context.'   What?  A hallway is packed with students during a pandemic.  The 'context' is stupid principle, bad planning, no control.
Then the student is suspended for taking and releasing the photo because of policy 'no social media during school hours or taking photos without peoples permission'.   The principle knows full well that is NOT why that rule was implemented and a 'zero tolerance' policy means 'zero common sense' needs be applied. 

""The school’s principal could not immediately be reached for comment, but the district’s superintendent defended its reopening plans, saying the photos had been taken out of context."""

When I was in grad school I attended a double summer session and thereby made up a half-year of study. I graduated a half-year early. 

I say keep the schools shut until we have a cure and a vaccination. Do video classes as necessary. Put everything live on hold. When this is all over make up the lost time by having summer sessions or longer school days. It may take a  couple of years to completely catch up but I'd rather see schools open in the summertime and after-hours than sick and dead kids and teachers. If everyone is doing this then no one will fall behind. It's not a competition, it's survival. 

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures!

In NYC our mayor said he'd keep schools open if the infection rate stayed below 3%. Our schools have over a million kids. 3% is 30,000 kids. 30,000 infected kids is acceptable? How is this man not impeached?"

It is an infectious disease."

By that time, a student may have already contracted and recovered from COVID, with only mild symptoms, if any.
 
The larger problem is with the  asymptomatic students who pass it on to other students. They may never be tested.  Those students pass it on to  parents, etc.  .

And those who are over 65, especially those with underlying conditions can only watch and wonder if the number of cases and deaths rise, while  trying to stay home as much as possible. 

It didn’t have to be this way."

How about calling them what they really are: causalities in the corporate quest for profits. Students aren't going back to school because its in their best interest. Corporations and their political lackeys want things as ""normal"" as possible because its better for their bottom lines. 

Corporate profits were the motive behind the premature push to reopen. Corporate profits are the motive behind their news networks pushing misinformation on matters of safety, so people will go out and spend. Corporate profits are the reason Congress doesn't want to pay people unemployment. Corporate profits are the reason millions are without healthcare during a pandemic. Corporate profits are why testing is dysfunctional. Corporate profits are why don't have sufficient PPE. Corporate profits are why half of Americans can't afford a $400 emergency, and will be pushed over the cliff into eviction. Corporate profits are why they got a $4.5 trillion bailout of taxpayer money. Corporate profits are why the Fed is pouring trillions more into the stock market. 

In America, we talk so little about the man behind the curtain. Why? Because its bad for corporate profits."

And, while little kids can't really be blamed for making poor decisions, the high school aged kids described in this article who are neither wearing masks nor keeping their distance from others are also stunningly obtuse--either that or stunningly selfish. Perhaps both.

Maybe a reminder is needed: the recent and very large Korean study found that kids aged 10-18 spread the virus just as much as do adults. And kids 14-18 spread it even *more* than adults.

And yet, teachers at Alcoa High are expected to sit in rooms with these maskless kids? The kids are required to keep their masks on in the hallways (where the teachers generally aren't) but can take them off in the classrooms (where the teachers generally are)? Those poor teachers. 

Clearly, total idiocy reigns in every one of the districts described here. 

Here, let me help you out. Everyone in schools needs to keep a mask on at all times and be spaced at least 6+ feet apart. Both the mask wearing and the spacing need to be mandatory. Anything else and we are pretty much guaranteed to have significant community spread, along with all of the associated harmful effects--not only just to people's physical health but also to the economy, people's mental health, employment, mortgages, etc.

Naturally, these brave young people were suspended because that’s what we do to truth-tellers in this country. Just ask Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindeman.

2020-08-07 14:53:36,"If it's about the economy and childcare, you wouldn't open high schools until numbers are very low. You would open for preschool and elementary students, but spread them across all of the district buildings and employ workers, likely out of work now, to supervise small groups of them, when/where teachers can't be spread that thin.

If it's about feeding kids and physical safety, you simply use the buildings as check-in places for staggered meals, maybe with a nurse or social worker at each meal line. The summer food program guidelines can be implementing following the CDC recommendations.

But, if it's about education, real education, you realize that you have to address Maslow before you can do Blooms. It isn't physically safe in many places to be back in school---often even with extensive measures like Alcoa, TN took---so you find ways to provide instruction safely in situ and make plans to address gaps once it is safe. 

In many places it simply isn't safe right now. Notice how many in this article, those healthy teens who should be just fine per certain leaders, either tested positive or quarantined within days of opening. In my own state, a 7 year old has died of COVID without any known comorbidities. It's one now, but will it be more once more schools open? And their parents, grandparents, teachers, etc?"

If a mask is working, then any aerosol virus trapped by the mask will be on the outside of the mask. Tucking the mask under your nose exposes your nostrils as you breathe to any virus on the outside of the mask. Whenever I see people doing that, I am perplexed, but do not scold them. Perhaps if a statistic emerges showing that people who do that are becoming infected at a higher rate than those that don't, then maybe we could discourage the practice. I wear a cloth cover over another mask, and change the outer cover more often, treating it as contaminated whenever I've been anywhere crowded."

Instead of spending my meager ‘back-to-school’ savings on items for my students, I’m spending it on PPE and creating an isolation chamber in the trunk of my car. Instead of training that helps me become a better teacher, I have been in meeting after meeting with district ‘I don’t know’ and ‘I’m so sorry you have to do this’ and ‘follow CDC guidelines’ and ‘we’re not talking about that today,’ they offer no practical solutions for logistics. Instead being in my classroom excited for a new year, I’m hiding in a storage closet having a panic attack ... I’m a teacher, not a health care worker, and whatever I do, it will not be enough. Instead of enjoying the last few weeks of summer with my child at home, I’m viewing every moment we have through the lens of ‘what if this is his last summer with his mom?’ Instead of listening to my school board talk about how community spread will impact opening, I had to watch 10 hours of school board meetings where the only decision they made was that we should follow CDC mask guidelines.

As I read this article I was continually reminded of a NY Times article about a meat cutter in a South Dakota meat packing plant. He came from Nigeria and was proud of the fact that he was able to build a life here in America and support his family. Yet after the virus overtook his plant and he was forced back to work quickly realized ""When they say you are an essential worker what they mean is that you are on the death track."" Students both elementary and high school may have a better rate of survival from the virus but what about the teachers and family members they will come in contact with? In my mind their fate seems very similar to that meat cutter and his description of being on the death track."

Maybe if Georgia’s high schools spent less time suspending students who are worried about COVID & trying to be safe, and more time suspending students that don’t wear masks, GA students would be able to go to school!"
2020-08-07 16:31:35,"A teacher who was skeptical 'of the whole thing' ... until her daughter came down with it. What is wrong with Americans that so many of us refuse to believe expert epidemiologists?

Maybe it has something to do with their age. 40 years ago, after throwing all of California's mentally onto the streets to become our 'homeless,' Ronald Reagan (another TV 'personality') was elected President and in his inaugural speech intoned  ""Government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem."" 

Since then, too many Americans have continued to put people in office who want to destroy our government institutions and TELL us that. Just look at what Trump is doing to the Post Office.

Some of us remember being inspired instead to ""Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country."" But age and Covid-19 are reducing our numbers day by day. From 'one for all and all for one,' we've gone to 'I've got mine, Jack.' And have the hubris to call themselves 'Christian.'

Sad."
2020-08-07 16:35:15,"Opening schools at this time is either the height of idiocy, arrogance, or malevolence. Possibly all three.

Schools children have always been the main vector for seasonal cold, flu, and norovirus. Now we have a virus that is spreading faster than when we shut down schools in March. It has mutated into something that (at bare minimum) makes it more transmissible. We still don't know if recovering from infection incurs immunity. We also have no unified plan for testing and contact tracing. So how can opening schools possibly be a good idea?

To those of you pushing to reopen schools because ""we can't afford to lose a year of learning"", why can't kids in grades 3 - 12 learn online? My son is 9 and figured out how to beat the newest Zelda game in 3 months, without the internet. He can figure out how to print a PDF and scan it to send it back to his teacher. He can also follow along with a zoom meeting for the class. I get that everyone's situation is different, but this is the best solution if we are to stop the spread.

Of course, none of this would have been necessary had we done a nation wide lock down as soon as we saw that the virus was spreading within our borders. We could have deployed testing and contact tracing as soon as Korea did and we'd be done with the first wave. 

The good news is that we don't need to wait for a vaccine to reopen society. We need another quarantine, rapid (almost instant) testing, and good social practices. Can we get there though?"
2020-08-07 16:37:32,"Just a comment from someone who has minimal contact with folks in this age group: WOW! What an impressive group of thoughtful and articulate people. I am pleased to see they are taking the virus seriously and planning for their futures.

The teacher doesn't understand how to use the technology any better than the second-graders, so it's been nothing but technical difficulties the entire school day.  Neither my husband nor I can work full time with the amount of assistance we have to lend our second grader.  It's just an impossible situation with no good answers."

The experience of these first schools that are opening can be invaluable to the rest of us if we receive objective information that provides appropriate perspective."
2020-08-07 20:21:46,"There is no perfectly safe way to reopen schools but I would insist on the following high school protocols at a minimum: 1) the state MUST have a low and dropping rate of virus transmission, 2) classes MUST be held outside or at the very least in rooms with massive windows wide open, 3) all students MUST wear masks and be socially distanced at all times except for lunch, 4) Lunch MUST be outside with separation between students, 5) schools MUST stagger times when students are in the halls (those photos of crowded hallways were chilling. 6) teachers MUST be given the option of teaching from home and students MUST have the option of online learning. And even with all of the above, the risk may just be too high until we have actual national leadership and the entire country has a minimal rate of viral transmission."

We live in a time of very scary adult values."
2020-08-07 19:47:10,"The situation with the schools is beyond frustrating. After sending everyone home last March and it was widely stated that until we have a vaccine we are not safe, why did schools across the country not throw all available resources, brain power, and innovation into how to provide accessible, quality online learning to every US child? Instead, here in Indianapolis, we saw the same complete lack of leadership and buck passing as we’ve seen on the federal level. No long-term planning, no strategic thinking, no input requested from stakeholders (specifically, teachers). We aren’t holding school board meetings in person but we’re going to send 3000  kids into a high school building where they typically can’t even keep the soap dispensers filled?? Then you have state and federal lawmakers threatening to withhold funding if students aren’t physically in school?? It is truly mind boggling. Bottom line, if we’d all done a better job, back in the spring, of wearing masks and social distancing instead of rushing out to restaurants and bars and beaches, the kids could be back in school, the parents could be back at work, and we would be on the road to a new normal. Instead, we’re faced with a virus run amuck, tens of thousands of lives lost—and it’s nowhere near over. Wake up folks, winter is coming."

But the way things are unfolding across the United States, it's abundantly clear that the people pushing for this don't care one iota about children, their education, or their safety. They don't care about the teachers or the school staff. They don't care about the communities that will inevitably see higher COVID infection numbers and deaths. What, then, do they truly care about? Is it just ""owning the libs""? Is it getting workers back into wage-slave jobs that force them to require childcare or full school days? It's so frightening and dismaying that a plurality, if not the majority, of Americans simply don't care about other people, even to the point of avoidable death."

Where is the Department of Health? Who is protecting the larger environment? All children and all people. 

Also, when the weather is reasonable, how difficult is it to conduct classes out-of-doors. Maybe classes will have to move more slowly but sure is worth good heath.

Trump and DeVos Continue to Undermine Public Education with Their Proposed Fiscal Year 2019 Budget [AmericanProgress]

On the heels of that widely criticized proposal, the Trump administration has doubled down this year with a $7.1 billion cut to the Department of Education’s funding—a 10.5 percent decrease from 2017 levels. And while an unusual addendum—released on the same day as the original proposal—seems to restore $3.3 billion to the education budget, Trump and DeVos have made their priorities clear: Starve public schools to fund private school schemes that benefit the wealthy.

Last year, Congress ultimately maintained funding for the programs the Trump administration tried to cut. However, DeVos strived to overcome this clear rejection of her agenda by spending her first year in office trying to fulfill Trump’s campaign promise to eliminate the Department of Education. 

DeVos rescinded Obama-era guidance and protections for vulnerable students, downsized the department’s workforce, and pushed for the expansion of tax incentives that benefit private school parents rather than students in public schools. Through their proposed budget for the upcoming year, Trump and DeVos are taking another swing at the department and public education by proposing to gut funding specifically for supporting the teaching workforce and providing after-school programs."
2020-08-07 22:02:12,"During a pandemic, there are very few perfect choices for education.  
Naive optimism will only spread Covid.  Schools must: limit their numbers to ensure social distancing, enforce masks, temp checks, and regular hand washing.  Sanitize desks after every class session and/or keep kids in the same room and have teachers switch rooms.  No teacher should be forced into a classroom. Any teacher should have the option to teach on-line. 

And any student should have the choice to return to school.  Some students need structure, internet connections, a stable environment, and two meals that schools provide.  They might not always have a “live” teacher, but distance education may be also part of in-school education right now.  

I am very concerned about the rise of segregated little “pods” among the wealthy.  Their children are missing out on learning to appreciate diversity.  I am so enjoying the “Nice White Parents” pod cast which has such important lessons for all of us, pandemic or no."

Hard reality: Covid testing, Covid cases, Covid survivors, and Covid deaths will need to increase, which means Covid *must* move into the smaller and isolated counties across the states in order for most Americans to realize the pandemic is real (including “skeptical” parents waiting for their children to contract Covid). (Un)fortunately, Covid is finally threatening smaller counties, so it’s just a matter of time that we’ll be at that mark where the majority of Americans will know someone or have been that someone who got Covid. If you’re a survivor, that’s critical. Which means you may or may not follow basic protocols for a pandemic. For instance, July 24 marked mandatory masks for a grocery store in Placer County (we’re one county over from Sacramento, the state capital in California, and a very red county). July 24! July 24!

It's ridiculous that we're pushing so hard to move these children through the education system; we need to acknowledge the pain, disruption and loss of learning that will happen because of the pandemic. Teachers are an incredible resource to our communities and our nation. We should not put them in peril because we are in denial of our national crisis. We do not have the social and economic foundation to support students, families and teachers  so they can achieve the same academic goals we once might have had. We need to use this moment to emotionally and socially support our students, to make sure they don't lose skills and to give them the opportunity to reflect on and integrate this moment. We can not expect that students will achieve on the same level as they might have in another moment. We can encourage the reading of books, the writing of papers, the practicing of instruments but many aspects of school from science labs to in-person discussions to studio art to drama class will simply not be accessible. We should not force students and teachers into a pre-pandemic educational paradigm. We need to support one another and get through this year with a minimal amount of added stress and a maximum amount of compassion."

2020-08-07 14:00:51,"A group of four professors from Harvard's School of Public Health - all with school-aged children - published a piece in the Boston Globe with this advice:

* Listen to the science
* Ignore Trump
* Re-Open the schools

""Prolonged time away from schools has led to months of lost learning and widened gaps in educational achievement, especially for some students of color and those in lower income households. Adding months more to this toll will be an educational disaster that some children may never recover from. School closures also threaten some children’s safety, due to increased child neglect, hurt children’s mental health, and keep many from getting enough to eat.""

The piece is buttressed by no fewer than twenty-five hyperlinks to supporting evidence.  It's troubling that the Times is relentlessly fearmongering rather than conveying expert opinions that justify reopening.

Young people are the least vulnerable to Covid's wrath;  here in North Carolina there have only been three deaths under the age of 25 in a state of 10.5 million residents.  And a teacher at the front of the classroom is sufficiently ""distanced"" to avoid contact.

The well off, elite in this country were already overly obsessive about their health prior to the COVID pandemic. Now their irrational fear of illness has been been taken to a level of psychosis and hysteria that is driving this nation to its demise. And to those who retort 'but I don't want to die!', well 1) the death rate from COVID is still extremely low for most healthy people and 2) death is waiting for all of us, so deal with it. 

Humanity has made it through any number of pandemics. In our modern time, we should be able to manage through COVID via the simple steps that have already proven effective - face masks, social distancing and isolating the most vulnerable.

We need to open up 95 percent of our country.  The headline of this article belies the actual truth which is mentioned only in passing: the most infected children in general don't get very sick from the virus. The median age of those who have died from the virus is 78.  80 percent of those who have died were above the age of 64.  In other words, the working population under that age are not in much danger and treatments are improving rapidly as more is learned from experience.  

According to the CDC, only 270 young people under the age of 24 have died from the virus, which has claimed more than 160,000 lives.  

We need to open up the economy and the schools in 95% of the country.  Even if you get covid19, your chances of dying from it if you are under the age of 65 are small.

Now, I took my own SATs, so I’m both intelligent and educated, and it’s pretty obvious to me that nobody should listen to or believe a word he says. He will be out of our lives after the election, and he can then go and build hotels in Moscow, North Korea, or anywhere out of our sight. By the way, everyone but Trump knows that children ARE NOT immune and that they may transmit the virus to adults at home as well as, in some cases, developing a severe toxic shock syndrome after the viral infection has resolved.

2020-08-10 14:25:32,"In late March when schools initially closed in order to get things under control, the US had about 16,000 cases. 

Now the schools open back up when the US has 5,000,000 cases and the virus is out of control. 

Does this make sense?"
2020-08-10 14:46:42,"This notion that the virus isn't real because ""I don't know anyone who's had it"" needs to be combatted. Right now, something like 1 of every 66 Americans has tested positive, but it's not evenly spread. If you live in a community that's still in the early stages, it's entirely possible that only 1 in several hundred is known to be infected in that area, and so it's very likely you wouldn't know one of them."
2020-08-10 14:58:53,"Trump's stated intend is to get reelected, it would seem, at any cost.
The ignorance he shows in understanding of the role of tests for example is misleading:
He counts the #'s but ignores the delays in delivering the outcomes, which more or less negates the effort in the first place when it takes up to a week for the results and their response.
Missing in his understanding of actions is the tracing then isolation, critical next steps.
His lack of clarity and participation by example more or less  everywhere adds to the confusion.
Then there are, almost everywhere else in countries who have done a better job, traceable and enforceable actions to quarantine those who have contracted or are suspect (Americans returning from other countries  for example).

Lastly, and probably the most reprehensible, is his firm commitment to get all kids back to school, more or less what ever it takes.............clearly in his mind I submit is the brag that on his watch this was achieved.
It turns out that all age groups are at risk of contracting the disease, this including children who may or may not exhibit symptoms, but are capable of transmitting to more vulnerable others with whom they associate, (e.g. older family and friends).

As a wind up, those Republican politicians who are complicit by going along and staying silent on these critical matters might act like a flock of penguins, rather than as officials elected to serve their constituents."

2020-08-10 12:10:57,"Schools will open, the dense congregation of children will prove the illness to be more dangerous than predicted, some children will become critically ill ir worse, staff will. Schools will close within six weeks of opening.

Schools should have remained closed until January, during which time there might be advances in the way we test, treat and, perhaps, inoculate people.  The rush to return is highly inadvisable. 

This return will also ratchet up the spread of illness in the wider community as millions of children, who have been sequestered from school, are now also taken by parents to venues such as shopping, church, gyms, family parties. 

Millions of potential vectors are being added back into the wider social scene,  a concern for everyone out in public."
2020-08-10 12:25:43,"Approx. 100,000 children tested positive in just the last 2 weeks of July; almost definitely a massive underestimate of the actual infection rate among children. Now the plan is to open the schools. 

My wife has taught in Harlem for over 25 years. Children will have to be masked, social distance, and never touch. Students will touch each other, take off their masks, and sneeze and cough all over other students and teachers, (my wife lost count of all the times children sneezed in her face long ago). 

Students will be unable to distance even if they could remember to, which they won't. (Consider how often your children forget to listen to you after 5 seconds. Multiply it by millions).

My wife's students live almost entirely in packed apartments in projects in multi-generational families. There's barely room for everyone to move. It's common for a grandparent to share a bed with a grandchild. If these children return to school they'll go home and infect their mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, and grandparents. 

We've all seen massive death in meat-packing plants forced to reopen. Teachers and students' families will die if NYC schools reopen.

Why are we running ""an experiment"" which we know will lead to the death of teachers, parents, and grandparents?

When growing up the corner near my home had no light or stop sign. Several people had almost been killed and everyone begged for a light. Only after 3 people were killed was a traffic light installed. 

This is like that times ten-thousand."

For every fact and truth about the devastation of Covid-19, the MAGA family has a rebuttal, whether it be off-topic, a diversion, a distraction, or alternative facts based on what is found on the internet or heard on Fox News. I see it within my own extended family, within my neighborhood, within my city and county.  Then I read these updates daily, sometimes hourly, and my horror continues.  ""At least 97,000 children were recently infected.""  This is what I awoke to this morning.  Where does it end?  When on earth will someone stand-up to Trump's total ineptitude and total failure?  And there is a good chance that this man may be reelected?  We have to do more to support medical science; we have to do more to support leaders who are on the right side of justice and compassion.

If nearly 100,000 children tested positive during just two weeks in July, when most schools were NOT in session, what will happen in September? North Paulding High School, in Georgia, reveals what may be the tip of the iceberg, with nearly 10 positive cases in just a few days. The school was forced to close, and potentially 100s of classmates and colleagues of those infected must quarantine for two more weeks. This scenario will repeat itself across the country until (or if?) common sense prevails. I fully support infectious disease expert, Michael Osterholm, and his plea for a ""real"" six-week shutdown to thwart the inevitable explosion of -- and needless deaths from -- COVID-19."

He has induced a national nosedive, a decline that is precipitous, dangerous and humiliating. American soldiers are hunted like animals by Taliban killers who are paid bounties by Russian killers and Trump does nothing. Trump has divided the country and pitted Americans against each other. Trump stokes fear to abuse his power and press forward with his assaults on the rule of law. This is the most shameful time in 243 years of America. Trump undermines the coming election with no regard for the consequences. If he could cancel the election, lock up his political opponents, enrich his friends and remain in power for life, he would do so. Trump is the greatest failure in American History. No American has failed history’s test in a more spectacular fashion. His stoking of racial tensions and a cold civil war in our land will live in infamy. His disgrace will be eternal."

A word to a woman I deeply admire: Speaker Pelosi, you and Chuck Schumer have to work harder to talk sense into your counterparts on the other side of the proverbial aisle.  This is no game.

Even given that, the payroll tax cut is a true con man’s act of desperation. 

It isn’t a tax cut, but a loan to the end of the year, for people who are already working.

Trump again fails to understand or respect institutions and Constitutional law. 

Rather than work with Congress to hammer out a deal everyone can live with lawfully, he wants people to believe he has more power than he does while showboating a pre-election plan full of smoke and mirrors.

2020-08-10 16:57:56,"It’s clear that Trump and his Senate Republican enablers will not agree to continue the expanded unemployment benefits of $600/month. In fact, he has the nerve to offer only half that amount requiring the states already in dire fiscal straits to pay another $100!  He also refuses to “bail out the Democratic states” even suggesting at one point they “declare bankruptcy.”  Instead, those states like California and New York which are major “donor states” that pay more in federal taxes than they receive back should consider taking legal action by refusing to pay any federal taxes on the grounds that they were asked to pay for the nonexistent federal aid to combat the COVID-19 epidemic and this money should be seen both as repayment for the debt they incurred and to be used to fund the $600/month extended unemployment benefits needed to keep unemployed workers from eviction, homelessness and poverty and to sustain the local economy."

Instead, unwisely, a national policy bearing some similarity to the economic policy of laissez-faire has been applied to a pandemic health crisis, with our President repeatedly saying, ""It will go away; it will disappear.""    Someday it might.  Science allows for possibilities, and the president is adept at slipping those into his comments. But science and a reality check say it isn't going away now, and it isn't going away any time soon. 

Apparently, political brinkmanship played out to America's worst fears.  Political parties and constituent elected party representatives involved, are sacrificing the nation's real-time well being,  have abandoned their ideals and hypnotically adhere to an ends-justify-the-means lock-step loyalty to party ""principles"" rather than the country's needs, that's taken the country over the edge, and we are hanging on by our fingertips.

Now, Trump has signed a hodge-podge of worthless, kingly proclamations, which he calls ""Executive Orders"".  They do nothing substantial for the people.  The GOP acknowledges these EOs are ""unconstitutional slop"".

The omissions, or at best passing mentions, by the corporate press of certain phenomena these days should be alarming to more more people.  Outlets like the NYT will report on trump rallies, but then ignore any follow up investigation into how many people at these rallies got ill or spread the disease to their communities.  Are these White people just not getting ill?  Yet, there's hardly a single NYT coverage of the pandemic that doesn't mention the disproportionality of suffering and deaths among people of color, like some ""mission accomplished"" signal. 

These omissions are not unlike the near lack of corporate media coverage on the increasing violence against people of color and BLM protestors in the last few months.

It's not just the Presidency, he's done this his entire life.  Apparently, if you have money, you can live without learning or growing.  

You can be a boy-King like a Prince Joffrey Baratheon:

""He has an uncontrollable temper not unlike his mother, Queen Cersei Lannister, and an unchecked sadistic streak. 

He has little sense of right or wrong, which often leads him to trouble, especially when he loses his temper.  When things go wrong, Joffrey blames the problems on others. 

Despite being willful he is reckless, vicious, cruel and not particularly intelligent, all of which combine to make him prone to irrational and bad judgements."""

I know this goes against what our country was built on and stands for but it’s the reality. Please help those on Election Day who can’t get to a polling station on their own.

He would stay in DC and call on members of Congress personally as needed to broker a deal. He would make this his top priority, and postpone everything else until a dead got done.

Here's what Trump did: he left town, went golfing, played no role in the negotiations. He issued executive orders that are not only so muddled that even his staff can't explain exactly what they would do, but also almost certainly unconstitutional (assuming we still have that whole ""separation of powers"" thing).

My party is unwilling to come to an agreement on just a continuation of unemployment and one time checks, leaving the other more difficult issues for ongoing discussion.  The President, who I would never vote for, wants to at least make payments, however shaky the ground is under his idea.  My party mocks the idea and seems willing to challenge this in court.  I am concerned about the number of people that may lose their homes or be unable to pay their bills.

We are, regarding Covid and the economy, the worst country on Earth.

Whatever drivel flows from our President, he can't deny his outrageous failure as a leader and a man.

We could be opening now.  Our economy could be in better shape.  Schools could resume without massive anxiety and the threat of life-changing illness.

Everything the man claims to want was here for the taking.  Instead, this.

It's not going to stop, no matter how we dither and watch people die.

As others move to recovery we'll be dealing with disintegrated families, hollowed out communities, local business dead and gone.

More shocking than dunderheaded incompetence, at least to those who know Trump, is the ""not one more dollar"" intransigence of his completely cowed Senate.  

Stern old men of little brain and a commitment to Victorian economics, since disproved in thousands of studies (I know...science), find the idea that people living on Senators' pocket change have  too much and will never get in harness for the good of stockholders again, appealing.  They'll destroy the national economy to prove it, and quote God to assert their righteousness.

We're in exactly where Republicans want us.  The masks=freedom, ""everybody gotta die"", ""its all a fake"" (but where did they get all those 'dead' actors and how much is it costing us?) dullards are accessories to this crime.  May they be the first to go."

Hence he pulls stunts like near-worthless Executive Orders, in lieu of pushing for legislation that actually helps real people. One EO sounds like a tax cut but sets the stage for defunding Social Security; he apparently hopes his older voters don’t notice.  

As millions more suffer, Trump will direct his energies to propagating a tsunami of lies and dirty tricks, some likely involving treasonous chats with Putin and other foreign leaders.

He will be aided and abetted by an army of enablers: Republicans in Congress, his donor pal who is dismantling the Post Office, Russian government cyber criminals, the far right and its toxic media, Vichy Facebook, GOP operatives cynically pushing Kanye West onto swing state ballots, and many among the ultra wealthy.  

There is every reason to assume Trump/GOP/Trump allies can win the election, or at least create enough chaos the Supreme Court pulls another Bush v. Gore. 40 percent of Americans still worship at Trump’s alter. He’s their golden calf.

2020-08-10 19:30:28,"When reviewing all the information as well as misinformation, you must come to the conclusion that the debacle has been so seriously misgoverned from January 2020 when Trump and his administration were made aware.  As much as everyone continues to blame China the only given is that we can track it to that country, but there is still uncertainty if this was the actual originating source of the disease. Now is not the time to continue the blame as to where it came from, it is time to aggressively contain this virus and that begins with the understanding that science, physicians evolve with both diagnosis and treatment as the understanding of the disease becomes clearer, it is unfortunate that politics has played too much of a role front and center in the media.
We now understand that the few schools that have re-opened without proper retrofit and health guidelines have confused parents even more. How can you make a determination about the most precious entity in your life, your child/children if on a daily basis you are being bombarded by Government Lackies intent on re-electing the same President who has honestly left American Citizens to deal with everything on their own and have been actively undermining infection control physicians.

Teachers have done their best, but it’s so difficult to socially distance with children.

I am trying to be cheerful and supportive of my teacher and parent friends who are braving going back in person. (It’s unkind to criticize people who may be stuck in an impossible situation.) I want to scream, “It’s not safe!!” I really don’t think it is. But, here we are..."

The very first clause in our Constitution reads ""All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, "".  That means  the President has no legislative power.

Later the Constitution defines an executive power ""he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.""  The ehanced unemployment benefit legislation has an end date an amount, each of which I believe are to be faithfully executed.

That said, the Constitution has been misinterpreted beyond believe finding a right to abortion, a right for the Federal government to spend outside of its enumerated powers, and a right to regulate interstate commerce well beyond  the actual comment.  With those precedents, why shouldn't Trump be able to claim he is faithfully executing Congress's laws in that they arguably did not intend the benefits to lapse imposing a hard ship on the people.

With years of contorted interpretations to the Constitution's clauses, why stop now.

Congress needs Trump's approval of whatever deal they make because the legislation will not be veto-proof.  So Trump stalls to stymie them while he appears to be a man of action.

Could the USA have done the same at the very beginning along with travel restrictions and border closings and only allowing back those who were negative or were cured. Trump administration so far has been very lenient with Americans returning from overseas trips on unofficial business abroad. People returning from overseas are currently just asked to self isolate without monitoring whether they comply or not. There has to be stricter quarantine for one week. India has a strict quarantine for 7 days. As soon as one lands temperature is checked and the traveler is escorted to designated quarantine hotels around the airport  and then locked up in the room and food is delivered to the room and no cleaning service or laundry. On the 3rd day a swab is taken for testing and if by the 7th day the person is found negative then the person is asked to quarantine themselves in their home or continues in a quarantine in a hotel.

Using ""new immigration regulations"" allowing ICE to block American citizens from returning to the US from abroad if authorities ""believe"" they may be infected with the Covid-19.

Trump says the US does too much testing, and that Covid-19 will just disappear, especially if we don't test, (just like cancer will disappear if we stopped testing for it.) Trump now wants to block Americans from returning to the US if he suspects they may have Covid-19 while he won't do anything to help Americans within the US who are becoming infected with the disease and dying. 

You can't make this stuff up. 

It is well worth remembering that it is Trump's paramilitary ICE goons which he and Barr used to invade Oregon and illegally abduct Americans on American soil who will now be used by Trump to illegally detain Americans trying to return home from abroad under the pretense that they may be infected. Of course, no one will even know if they are infected, as they won't be tested.

Over 5 million infections and over 165,000 Americans dead, and Trump's big idea is to block Americans, supposedly infected abroad, where infection rates are much lower. 

ICE is now Trump's personal paramilitary force. His using them against Americans in Oregon, and threatening to use them in Illinois, New York, and Washington State failed miserably, so now he plans to use them against Americans trying to return home."

It could be that because a citizen was in a country with known cases?  Could it be that the citizen traveled by some form of mass transport (bus, airplane, train, ship)?  

And what’s with the claim of existing CDC legal authority?  During a fairly recent phone call to CDC, the CDC infectious disease information representative on the phone said that the CDC “has no legal authority or ability to enforce laws or mandates.”  This was in response to concerns about COVID19-related violations on federal lands.  How, then, does the CDC have any authority to abrogate the rights of citizens to enter their own country?

Since one is probably more likely to be exposed to COVID19 by being on a grocery store check out line with someone without a properly-fitted mask right here in the U.S.A., with our 5  million cases, this move by certain people in the WH administration seems more like an attempt to keep out, or cause suffering to, citizens who might vote the current administration out of office.

2020-08-11 00:13:47,"This evening I learned something astounding and at the same time extremely disturbing and I wonder if this will be what the second wave will resemble. I listened to a young 21-year-old man who in May thought he might have a simple cold, mild COVID symptoms, he had no underlying health issues yet spent time in the hospital, he obviously recovered but just how well as he needed a return hospitalization was due to both cardiac failure as well as lung failure, Presently he is home awaiting results to see just how damaged his young heart may be.  After his interview, a very experienced cardiologist began to discuss how his specialty does not know the total effects of COVID on the heart, he stated autopsy studies and they are quite concerning.
There has also been discussion about young children and COVID, it has increased, they are now 9% of COVID cases, they expect to see more infections in children as most of the studies regarding children were done while children were mainly isolated or social distancing with parents, there is no guarantee how children will be affected once they return during school re-openings where mainly there will be no classroom retrofits, no masks, no social distancing.
My question is a basic one, how can a failed President tell the American people and the international community during his news conference that the United States is doing well, they are managing over 60million tests, there is over 5 million infected, 163,000+ deaths, yet all is stabilized!"

There is no analysis here of whether the central allegation leveled by the GOP against the Pelosi/Schumer Wall of No - that the trillions(s) in their proposal would be earmarked for their Democratic allies in Democratic states heading towards bankruptcy- is true or not. And making this more surreal is that Trump the Negotiator is clearly signaling he wants to make a deal - for example, he started at 200/week, the Dems held to 600/week for unemployment subsidies, and by fiat Trump is trying to impose 400 - that’s called meeting in the middle.

It’s a recipe for an economic death spiral that will force states to cut more jobs increasing unemployment. It’s time to stop using the words “bail out” and “stimulus” and recognize that the very “survival” of the economy is at stake. If the Republicans continue to view this through the myopia of bailing out the poor and those unwilling to work when jobs are scarce and “bailing out Democratic states” like California and New York which are “donor states” that keep the federal government afloat along with the majority of poor, Republican red states, then, as they’ve done with their colossal mismanagement of the coronavirus epidemic, they will be taking the economy off of life support."

Someone said the US is an ""un-developing nation,"" and I think this is an apt description. The US is sliding backward and can no longer call itself ""first world."" Our dismal Covid response and infection rate, the inability of our government to agree on a second desperately needed stimulus package, our culture wars, etc., are due to the fact that the systems, institutions, and social fabric of the US are in dire need of repair and reinvention."
2020-08-11 01:31:39,"I marvel at Trump's expertise in avoiding responsibility for things that go wrong. He is neither expert enough to solve major crises nor does he even try to solve them.  Always he arranges for""others"" to be totally responsible for the crises,  asserting at the same time that his own actions were perfect, the best that could have be done. 
With regard to the spreading and increasingly more harmful pandemic, he has set up China as the sole cause . China released this ""China Virus"" on the world, possibly, he has intimated, intentionally, to wrack havoc on all others.  China did it and China alone is responsible for its spread.  Trump is totally innocent.  This nonsense is accepted by his base, who will still vote for him. As far as the crumbling economy is concerned, it is because of the Democrats are unwilling to make a deal , which should take only a moment of their time. Trump asserts that only his party is totally concerned with public welfare and the Democrats are not --only interested in getting rid of police protection and the free markets of capitalism.  Only Trump stands in the way of America becoming a Communist-Socialist state.  No deal to help the jobless because the Democrats will not permit Capitalism to determine the rules of the economy.  Trump says that he has been fighting  for the impoverished with his executive actions. They  will not prove effective in keeping want and hunger away, but  the Democrats alone are to blame .

Over 165,000 American fatalities from the Coronavirus and STILL no national response from his administration.

A news report of continued Russian meddling in the upcoming presidential election but no talk of sanctions from the White House concerning this threat.

Trump's continued undermining of the security and validity of election mail-in ballots, his constant drumbeat of voter fraud where none exists, and the lack of visible support for enabling people to vote in our country.

The performance of Larry Kudlow on CNN on Sunday morning was an embarrassment to the nation. At one point he spoke of $1200 of relief, then it was $800, then another time it was $400. One would expect the president's economic advisor to at least be able to answer the basic questions but that was not the case.

However, if you have COVID-19 and you happen to be outside the U.S.A., Trump is now proposing a new regulation that would bar you from returning to your home and family in the U.S.A..

Right now only people traveling from 8 countries such as Oman, Kuwait, Panama, Chili, Qatar, etc have higher per capita infection rates than we do. This rule serves no overriding health purpose and is likely illegal.

If a US citizen reentering the country tests positive, they need to quarantine and seek medical attention if they become ill. All travelers from hotspots should quarantine for 14 days. But oh sorry, the MAGA president hasn’t actually put together the ability to monitor people and carry that plan out.

I will add, how do you treat and contain a virus that seems to change day to day, though it falls under corona, which is the name given to a grouping of similar viruses whose cells are basically spiked when viewed under a microscope. Is this cell unique or is it a mutated cell that has gone rogue. If so, what chances do we have with a preliminary vaccine that seems to be created for one cell, and two days later that cell is altered.

The child will still test positive for over a week, and not be a threat to spread the disease. There are also T cell theories that children can get the covid virus, and not spread the disease, similar to treated strep. Why not directly infect a hundred adults with a child’s contaminated swab, and see what happens?  There are obviously other variables, but any study of child transmissions needs something beyond could, may, or possibly in its conclusions.  The study is garbage.

Yes, the payments discourage work for those 
eligible for them when that work exists but does not pay well. That is ok. Some work can pay better, people who are not eligible will take lower paying jobs, and some will ignore the incentives because they see a path to a career. 

If a low-paying job carries significant health risk or increased crowding, it is likely creating, on average, a net cost for the economy. It takes at least as much money and medical staff to treat a minimum-wage worker as a software engineer, and neither is inexpensive.

In a pandemic, the first goal is to minimize illness, death and suffering. The second goal is to minimize fraud in the massive business handouts while protecting key industries with significant domestic capital investments.

That means that not only would the value of housing collapse with a disasterous decline in rental prices income for landlords, but so too would their overall income, sometimes marginal and definitely seriously reduced if they evicted many, and beyond, banks and other lenders would collapse all of which would lead to a full blown depression and likely social chaos and widespread violence. Even Trump's real estate empire would collapse leaving him destitute. There is a real personal interest in this for absolutely all Americans. No one would be unaffected. Think of this; Frankiln Roosevelt's Social Security was an idea beyond accolades. In the end, it kept America at peace internally for 90 years. That should be a lesson for all.

It is the age of GOPism - the belief that government is the problem and needs to be defunded.

That right, those who rail at ""defunding the police"" have been busy defunding our government for decades.  Now, good governance is nearly gone.

But the military is well funded.  Americans have recently spent trillions (and counting) on the killing of millions for no good reason.  We are taxed for the military - more than the entire rest of the planet pays for ""defense.""  

With less than 5% of the world's population, America has 25% of the world's prisoners.  We have more people in jail than any other country.

America is now the most unequal of modern democracies.  All of this has been promoted by the great majority of the nation's Christians.  They vote Republican like it was tattooed on their bottoms at baptism.

McConnell will never permit a vote on financial help for states and municipalities; the Democrats will need to pull a hat trick of Presidential, Senate  and House majorities in order to provide that needed assistance. 
The Democratic leadership should have taken Trump up on his support for unemployment and eviction relief apart from the other issues. The fact that during negotiations they must peel off and cut back on other demands highlights  that Democrats were holding those most impacted economically hostage to expendable demands. As it stands, Trump is claiming the high ground as protector of the vulnerable.
The negotiations should have focused in getting the best possible benefit for those in he worst financial shape at this time, calling Trumps bluff. 
Sure, the Democrats have reasonably crafted a bill which addresses the exigency of the moment; but by now they should have learned that Trump and his party do not act in good faith. For Donny and Mitch it’s all politics; they must be beat at their own game."

this in any of the discussions.

Moreover, an effort should be made to broaden the class of 
victims to include those closer to ogre's base, that is, the 
white working poor. Whites need to have it made clear to them that their group too will include real victims of ogre
manipulated cruelty.

But why the cruelty in the first place? My guess is that 
by circumventing congress and using executive actions, 
ogre creates the narrative of the big boss making decisions
that others can't or refuse to make. In this way he exudes sole  authority that he would have had to share were the Senate to have bargained in good faith. 

Moreover, were there to be a suit, presumably by Democrats,  opposing the spending not  voted upon by congress, then he puts the onus on Democrats for opposing funding for their 
base. He can then use that for political propaganda during
the campaign to turn off those who would normally be
expected to vote Democratic. 

The main obstacle seemed to have been   aid to states which got labelled as aid for corrupt democratically run states. At that point it would have been useful for there to be
a national survey of which states' budgets were seriously in
trouble and why (especially).  How stressed, if at all,  are

Time and time again, I saw evidence of that broken framework in this article. As Ms. Oseko said, how can someone work from home if they have no home? How can people get to work when cars are so expensive and there is no public transportation framework? How can people plan for their lives when landlords can sell their place of residence on a whim? Why is debt such a necessary component of life in the modern U.S.? 

The “bootstraps” crowd and the most staunch social conservatives should join forces with the “left” to help create a framework in which these people who want to work and take care of their families can actually do so.

But the article ends with a vignette about Mr. Guzman, who clearly chose to return to work only when the $600 bonus benefit expired. This contradicts the earlier claim that the higher benefit doesn't discourage job seeking, or at least taking.

Mr. Guzman is not a bad guy. His behavior is very rational. That's why some of us have questioned the wisdom of continuing a flat $600 weekly bonus benefit: the rational actor should choose not to work if it pays more not to do so. 

A percentage of lost wages is reasonable and threads the needle between offering support and not disincentivizing work."

They have continued to drag down the negotiations to such a degree that now, the President is posturing to “swoop in and save the day” with executive powers that he may - or may not - legally have. Make no mistake:  is part of his election strategy. He is seeking to be the savior for millions of Americans in a boat any effort to buy votes via unemployment extension. 

What is incredibly disheartening is that many people who are not just struggling but actively suffering as a result of the bungled response to the pandemic will not be clear-headed enough to see that the same man and party who helped get them into this mess aren’t saviors. The seek only to enrich themselves and their corporate friends and supporters. 

Watch for the President to pass that payroll tax cut that is not supported by either party; it’s only favored by his corporate raider cronies. Also look for the $1.75B for the shiny new FBI building which is another pet project. Those are key pieces of the proposed stimulus bill that the Democrats are holding firm against. I’m sure he also wants to be able to sign the next round of $1200 checks himself to show what an amazing guy he is......Anyone with a remaining thought in their head can see where the GOP priorities lie, and it’s not with the people, but with their own pockets and glory."

2020-08-08 15:42:12,"Congress has a responsibility to ensure Americans are treated fairly in terms of Federal benefits. Having already passed a provision providing $600 a week in supplemental benefits, isn’t it only right that Congress should ensure all newly unemployed Americans have access to that same benefit for at least the same number of weeks as the initial recipients have received? How is any other approach right or fair at this point?  In my opinion, Congress should pass a bill extending the $600 a week supplemental benefit to a limit of 26 weeks per recipient. This supplement should be available throughout the time of the virus - until such time unemployment falls below a target figure (say 5-7%).  Congress should also mandate that, beginning 1 October 2021, unemployment compensation shall be set nationally at 70% of salary, with a 26 week minimum benefit.  This would provide the various states, and the Federal government, time to prepare and establish appropriate tax rates.  I’m finding it difficult to understand how any congressional member finds it appropriate to have extended a supplemental benefit to some victims of the virus but not continue and extend that benefit to all victims as the virus continues to wreak havoc."

- There is no standard for worker safety, especially with regard to workers being harassed about mask wearing.

- There's no national guidance on safe reopening, and there are a lot of negligent state leaders who I wouldn't trust with my life.

- Studies show people are no less likely to collect unemployment if they can than to seek work. Most people want the interaction, the steady income, the skill building and more.

- There's also no coordinated testing and contact tracing effort, which impacts how safe people feel resuming work.

- You can't be offered work and still stay on unemployment.

Lastly, no one mentions self-employed people, many of whom have a lot invested in materials, tools, work space, staff, training, customer base and more. For many, depending on the work, it won't resume as normal for a long time."

If people don't have enough money to pay rent or buy even basic groceries, there's a lot else that they are not going to be able to afford either.  The bankruptcies and closures we've been seeing over the last few months were merely a small preview of what is coming down the road, and every single one will add to the number of people who no longer have a single extra cent to spend.

He will be the lone wolf, trying desperately to help those in need, while being sued by Congress for illegal actions.

Who wins then? Trump and the Republicans of course.  You can’t believe the R’s are negotiating in good faith.  They WANT a stalemate and for Trump to have to act alone.

Prior to that, I was in a job I loved, that I intended to keep until retirement. Now, the owner of the company has let me know that my job has been combined with another, so I will not be called back. Unemployment is so high where I live, and so many businesses have closed for good or gone bankrupt that I don't see how my city will ever recover. I have applied for work, but about a hundred other people have been applying for the same jobs, so no luck.

I am so angry about this I could scream. The only reason I am in this position is because the government took away my opportunity to work. I did nothing wrong, and yet I find myself without a job and with slim chance of finding another one. having to rely on the small savings I managed to put aside during this debacle (my unemployment having been reduced to $173/week), and criticized and demeaned as being a worthless, tax-dollar-grabbing parasite.

My ability to earn my living has been set back, maybe permanently, and all because our inept, incompetent, inefficient government, led by the idiot, Trump, could not, did not and would not control this virus. My future earning potential has been reduced, I am trying to cover my mortgage and bills and still save some, and I worry every day about my inability to find other work.

Better to exploit the crisis and gobble up real estate at bargain basement prices (sic).

Trump has proven incapable of feeling the pain of others so the only solution is his removal and that requires massive protests that make Portland look like a walk in the park. But that can't happen because too many people will refuse to attend fearing the disease.

This is known as a ""deadly embrace"" because it has no solution. The result will be the massive destruction of the country's wealth and standing. In four short years Trump and his corrupt sycophants have destroyed the American dream for millions. 

Timothy said it best. In the last days there will be very difficult times. For people will love only themselves and their money. They will be boastful and proud, scoffing at God, disobedient, and ungrateful. They will consider nothing sacred.

Yes, the Dems had a plan a few months ago, and it's on the Republicans big time that that they did nothing about it until the last minute.  But the Dems have yet to learn that they lose every time they try to play chicken.  And so do we.  They already lost the presidency and the Senate the last time they tried to play that game in '16.

Can't remember which female Dem lawmaker said they rejected the 1-week extension to stick it to the Republicans. I fail to see how this is in any way helpful.

McConnell, ever the obstructionist in favor of multimillionaires, big businesses and especially donors replied that he was going to call a pause in any legislation for additional relief. See you later this summer. I have a mint julep waiting for me on the plantation porch.
No bill had to be passed and signed into law in May or June. But anyone who really cared about working class Americans would have started the deliberation right then, in May. Drill it down to a lower dollar value through good faith bargaining.

I have a very specific job. Or had. It all went away on March 13 in a series of emails that cancelled all my work. There are millions of people in my industry. We are all now trying to figure out what we can do. 
As someone who made 2/3 of my income from freelance work and 1/3 from W2 work, it took weeks to figure out how to get unemployment set up. The system in Illinois crashed and that did not help. Hours were spent on the phone just to get a human to talk to. Once I reached someone (it took emailing my state representative) they told me I had to file for my W2 income. I was approved, but my allotment is tiny since it is only based on 1/3 of my income.
For the last while the $600 was enough to keep from financially bleeding out. It wasn't anywhere near what I can make in the summer when I usually work music festivals, but it kept the roof over my head. Now that is gone and I am somehow going to have to live on $200 per week.
My industry will not return until there is a cure. I have applied for many jobs, but since my experience is 100% with live events I have no work history or references in any other industry. No skills that I can ""pivot"" to. 
$600 per week is equivalent to $15 per hour for a 40 hour week. People are not making too much from UI, they are making too little for work. Make $15 the minimum wage."

2020-08-08 16:18:01,"Unemployment insurance goes back to 1935.  It has always provided a small cushion for the unemployed. That was true during the Depression, when unemployment was higher, as well as 99 weeks of the Great Recession, when unemployment was similar. 

I am not against renewing the $600 payments.  But we need perspective. The money was appropriated for four months only. It is not an entrenched entitlement. 

 The $600 supplements were approved unanimously by Congress, with Trump signing.  They were as forward looking as any Progressive program. The parties found common ground on Democrat territory. 

This month, 1.8 million returned to work and the present unemployment rate is at 10.2%, down from over 16%. 

 The real story is that we provided unprecedented benefits in March, going where we have never gone. The $2 trillion CARES Act was a landmark bill, drawn from TARP and expanding upon it. For Republicans, it was a move light years forward.   

The decision to renew the payments is now controversial. Republicans have wavered.  And the Democrats’ response has been partisan, self-righteous, and self-defeating.  

The reasonable goal is to extend the payments temporarily at the same rate or something comparable. Instead, Democrats have argued all or nothing, and have demonized Republicans. The strategy is nakedly political.  Democrats are risking a sound compromise for political sound bytes.  It’s time for the smoke-filled room, not the bleeding heart."

Because the government would lose hands down. there is NO question these people are being deprived of something of value.

Not to mention how much for green initiatives? or perhaps we should mention nearly a Trillion for State & Local governments, much of which State & local  governments will use to bail out failing and broke  pension plans( State of Illinois or Chicago teachers pension fund anyone?) And not do a single thing for the vast majority of the working people who have NO pensions.

But they drone on and on how they are victims of society, they just cannot continue to promote low wages, favoritisms and cronyism abound in the workplace, and they themselves barely lift a finger to improve the lot of employees beyond fealty to business fiefdoms.

Bailouts help, but they exacerbate our national debt and will debase the value of our dollar meaning a solution to COVID is far superior to a bailout.

if the Canadian aluminum companies in Canada add any value - for example fabricating the ingots and slabs into intermediate parts like shape, the tariff does not apply.

The richest fifth of Americans received nearly two-thirds of total benefits in 2018 and the richest 1 percent alone will receive 83 percent of the total benefits in 2027. This tax cut was put in place so that the federal government would have less resources to help those most venerable in an unforeseen crisis...Especially one that they helped to create.  The ""Left Wing"" business publication Forbes reports that the 400 richest Americans hold more wealth than “all Black households, plus a quarter of Latino households [combined].”  So why would the GOP want to change course during the pandemic and help America's most venerable?  This is really just ""Promises made and Promises kept."""

There are thousands of eligible self employed and gig workers that qualify for Federal PUA funding that have not received a single dime. Some 18 weeks into this program and most eligible Illinoisans have received nothing. They can’t even reach someone on the phone to inquire. I know people that would make hundreds of calls per day and never reach anyone. The alleged fix was an auto-callback feature. I know people that requested a call back 3 weeks ago and still no call. Pritzker inherited his billions. He has never had to worry about bills. He knows nothing of the anxiety that accompanies unemployment. In this crisis he has been an abject failure.

They don't seem to be too concerned that Kodak just got a very lucrative Coronavirus contract to work on developing a virus vaccine without any Vaccine background. 

Oh and what a coincidence that the Kodak CEO was given a large stock option which was trading at $2-$3 per share then 'coincidentally', became worth $59 million dollars the day after the contract was announced...hmm.

The Republicans don't (and didn't) seem to be too concerned about the 'wonderful' 2017 Tax Bill they passed which gave millions to the wealthy and an average $1,200 to  82% of the middle class...according to a 2019 report from H&R Block.

Senators and House members bitterly complained about being confined to their Congressional offices until they come up with a relief package. One of them said, ""This is worse than the COVID-19 quarantine I went through earlier. At least I was home.""

Another said, ""I'm worried about getting the virus in the Congressional shower room.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, sporting a two-day growth of beard stubble, blamed the Democrats for ""refusing to negotiate."" House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, also looking a little worse for wear, said, ""This is not making it any easier.""

When asked for comment, Donald Streetman, recently evicted from his apartment and now living in a shelter, said, ""When this is over, they'll go home. I won't; I lost mine. And I know I'm not the only one. They can order takeout. I can't. They have someone who cleans their shower. I don't. These people have a job. I don't. On the side, they make more money for giving a single speech than I make in a year when I -do- have a job. So I don't have much sympathy.

While I know he won't, he should read this excellent article. Because it vividly presents what indeed others ""have to go through"" because of his ineptitude.  He decided to spend three days golfing while others must decide how to pay for their next meal.

There is excess as well as hardship.

Having said this, I am always struck by a key element in most of these stories. People are on their own. Do they have no sisters, parents, brothers, aunts, or best friends who might help them? I am fortunate to have a guest bedroom, and any relative or friend down on their luck is welcome to it. If I didn't have this bedroom, they'd be welcome to the couch, and if I didn't have the couch, they could sleep on the floor in sleeping bags. Where is everybody?

It's exhausting watching America shoot itself in the foot again and again and then look around for someone to blame.

And what about all of the people who no longer had any child care costs.    I feel like the government should have offered a sliding scale of benefits.  If someone was earning $40,000/year, why should they earn the equivalent of $50,000/year being unemployed?  But if someone earned $60,000/year, maybe the extra $600/week is justified."
2020-08-08 17:19:01,"I think the stalemate is mostly over class interests. There is a certain kind of business interest -- by no means all business -- that depends for its existence and comfort on a steady supply of cheap labor. There are also many Americans -- by no means all -- who depend on or desire a steady stream of cheap services to sustain their pampered lifestyles. When people stuck in dead end jobs are given resources that allow them to stay home, the cheap labor that provides all that isn't there anymore, and it's a shock to the overclass's system. Businesses and people who feel entitled to this cheap resource have to pay more or do without, and they don't like either because, among other things, having to pay a lot for a service rep or a mani/pedi threatens the class identity structure -- the sense of self-importance and superiority that some relatively moneyed people feel. Many of the Republican senators -- by no means all, but most of those who are standing resolutely in the way of continued support at a reasonable level -- are in the pockets of this overclass and its assumed access to a pliable underclass. Giving people a taste of a living wage and some spare time jeopardizes that relationship because wage slaves get a taste of freedom and maybe a sense of possibility. And the longer the payments go on, the less pliable that cheap labor is likely to be after the pandemic. Better to force them into homelessness, right? That way they'll see the benefits that mere poverty provided."

I don't have much from a material standpoint but I am grateful for the ability to do what I do. Our schools cannot open as planned this fall. It is too risky and there is no money available for the amount of testing that would be required nor is there sufficient contact-tracing available to reach the hundreds of people a day who would need to be contacted because, every scenario points to a disaster. As a result I will not be paid this quarter. So for those who think this is  just about people who don't want to work, let me tell you this....there are plenty of people just like me out there. We are not lazy or looking for a handout or taking money that we have not paid dearly into the system for more years that most of you have lived.

And after 99 weeks of unemployment (with the unemployment rate still sky high) I said, ""You can't shut off the unemployment. I still can't find a job. No one is hiring.""
And all I got was lectures. Barely civil, eye-rolled lectures about how I need to be responsible and how I need to look harder or ""downsize"" -- at that point I was sleeping on a friend's couch -- or ""go back to school"" (I already had three degrees at that point). I got told, repeatedly, that I needed to stop being so negative and stop blaming others because Obama is great and he's doing a great job and we didn't elect a king, we elected a president, etc.
When all those bloviators start pointing out the free pass they gave to Obama, maybe I'll listen to their complaints about the current Oaf in the Oval Office. 
But, frankly? Obama deserved just as much criticism as Trump is getting now. And until I start seeing some review of the defective mainstream media narrative from a dozen years ago?

I didn’t know a pandemic was coming, but I knew a major setback to the economy was coming and I got prepared.  I knew, because it felt like nearly every business I patronized didn’t care about me.  When businesses and their workers become arrogant towards their customers, something is brewing.  I was in Las Vegas.  The hotels were totally rude towards the customers.  They didn’t care if I stayed or left.  That’s not how capitalism works.  When capitalism seems like it’s broken, things are about to change."

2020-08-08 18:00:03,"People are abusing the system, and quite often those people are not white.   That is the logic that politicians funded by the uncaring rich use to convince middle and lower-middle class white people to oppose all programs that help the poor.

In one sense they're right.  Abuse will occur in any program where a lot of money changes hands, not because of the program but because there's money changing hands.  It doesn't mean the program should be eliminated.  The government documents billions of dollars of Medicare fraud each year, but I have yet to see any 65+ year old white people arguing for the elimination of Medicare.

Some glimmers of hope - I've seen comments from Trump supporters who have been receiving the $600 and are arguing for its continuance even thought there is some abuse.   They're coming around to the fact that programs that help people in need are good, even though there is always some abuse when money changes hands.  This might be why the Republicans seem so intent on stopping further help."
2020-08-08 16:08:43,"How To Tank The Economy In a Pandemic 

1.  Let people become impoverished so they cannot purchase goods or pay bills.  The economic ripple effect will spread rapidly.

2.  Open the economy irresponsibly as cases of infection are increasing, creating economic instability as the economy slams shut repeatedly as the pandemic waxes and wanes in waves.

3.  Deconstruct the postal service, which is a lifeline for selling goods and services when in person shopping is risky. 

4.  Allow hospitals to suffer economically while trying to respond to increasing numbers of patients without health insurance.

5.  Send children to poorly ventilated classrooms to commingle and facilitate the spread of disease."

The trump party are trying to force a square peg into an immutable round hole, and they would rather break the American dream than accept the reality.  Part of that reality is that our system, which fosters an obscene gap between a wealthy micro-minority and the vast majority, between corporate CEO salaries and worker's wages, has to be dismantled and redesigned. 

Their approach to our economy is exactly like their approach to racial and social discord: deny and dig in their heels.  One or the other, or both, are going to accelerate the demise of the U.S., and it is the trump party, the party of Russia, that are steering us toward that disaster."

But  the fact is in this type of government where Capitalism (greed) feeds the wealthy and leaves the rest of society to fend for itself is evidence of total failure of our democracy. Mention socialism and every hard nosed nationalist would deem you a traitor to America. But I can't help but look at other free societies that have a form of socialism and see their people not suffering as hard as American workers. Could it be that we aren't as exceptional as trumpers believe? 

I don't advocate for workers taking up arms against the one per centers. But I have a feeling that if this two party government doesn't get off their derriere and start watching out for workers instead of corporations and the rich, hungry people will revolt. History backs my assertion on that. 

For those that think the government is responsible for this and that they should just open up the economy, think again. Dead people don't drive an economy. Without a healthy society there will be no economy. I don't have the answers. Apparently neither do our government representatives either. Perhaps if they went hungry or lose their health insurance, they might see what it's like and then start representing the people. But I doubt it."

2020-08-08 18:11:34,"Ms. Oseko was making $15/hour, or $600/40hr. week, before the pandemic.  How do you pay for a child and a boyfriend making less than $600/week?  If they were making $1100 per week before the pandemic, they were barely getting by, if that.  With the state and $600 enhanced federal Cares Act payments, they would have received far more than the $1100 before the pandemic.

In regard to the Depretis's, I assume both he and his fiancee were receiving the enhanced unemployment of $600 each plus their state unemployment payment.  They should have been getting at least $1600/week, yet they could not pay their bills?

Mr. Guzman has asthma, he definitely is at high risk of complications if he gets Covid-19.  But the mother's age of 51 does not make her vulnerable according to many reports I have seen, so I wonder why this article says she is vulnerable.  According to the CDC on 7/30/2020, 136 people out of 100,000 in the age group 50-65 years old were at risk of being hospitalized due to Covid-19.  Mr. Gunzman's mother is only 51, so her chances  would be far less than a 136/100,000 chance that she would be in danger of being hospitalized.  Probably around 100/100,000 or  1/1,000 chance or .1%."

That friend is a Wal-Mart cashier now; another pal, a former admin at a white shoe law firm, now toils as a home health aide. These folks, nominally employed, have just about burned thru savings meant to last decades. What's next for them?

2020-08-08 18:13:21,"This appears to be about over- or under-stimulating the economy. It would seem the solution is to include ""circuit breakers"" that will end or lower various components based on benchmarks. For example, if unemployment were to drop or the number of jobs created might go up by certain amounts (with allowances for subsequent regression), the $600 (or so) amount might either get reduced or be eliminated.

Similarly, this could be done for support of the states (which is also potentially needed to PREVENT additional unemployment of -- for example -- police and firefighters).

Frankly , the ‘American Dream’ is beyond the reach of possibly most Americans especially those that find themselves sitting at the bottom of the fifth economic quintile. At this point for the lower quintiles it’s virtually impossible to rise fir the better. Something has gone terribly wrong in the ‘economics’ of our country where the spread between the upper and lower income groups has increased greatly in the past few years. The chasm shows those with much lower incomes just can’t get out from under their circumstances. They have hundred pound gorillas on top of them. First class economic management is needed here.

2020-08-08 20:04:58,"Make no mistake the executive order that Donald Trump is about to sign may not be legal, however, was this his re-election ploy, to have Steve Mnuchin and Mark Meadows negotiate with the Democrats in bad faith than have him sign an executive order to make Trump look like a Hero and the Democrats look like the villains.  It is to be noted that the Democrats had a stimulus package in May, yet the Republicans refused to have it come in front of the Senate since they felt it would cause the deficit to rise too strongly. It also is to be noted that the Democrats during yesterday's negotiations compromised from a 3+trillion dollar package to 2trillion dollar package, what game is Trump playing and at the end of the day when will he be able to provide this money and if it is an illegal act, will citizens have to return full monies to the Government.  Trump works for Trump or there would not be as many COVID infections and Deaths."
2020-08-08 20:05:16,"Once again, Donald Trump has been badly served by Mark Meadows. the Dr. NO of Republican politics.  

The first time, readers should recall, is when Meadows, head of the UnFreedom Caucus, got the President to close down the government for several weeks, a move that began Trump's slide to a 2018 debacle in House elections.  Now, Meadows, who never wanted a deal, persuaded Trump to stonewall any compromise (Pelosi and Schumer offered an ""each give a trillion"" meet you half way framework which Trump should have grabbed) in order to expand his executive powers through executive orders of questionable legality.  

Why?  So Trump gets public credit for doing something while blaming Pelosi for doing so little. The problem with that, in addition to undermining the solvency of Social Security (if he illegally cuts the Payroll Tax) is that Trump's measures will be at best (an unlikely event) no more than a half a loaf for tens of millions of out of work, newly uninsured voters. 

Way to go Big Mark!"

2. Issue an executive order anytime between now and mid-October to give aid to millions of Americans.
3. Blast the airwaves with ads showing, they are getting the relief checks because of him. The Dems did not do anything.
4. Unemployed workers will appreciate President Trump’s miracle and vote for him."

They do not mention that the $600 is on top of state unemployment.  I make $600 per week, and I've worked all the way through the pandemic.  I know lots of ""essential workers"" who make less.

For those of us still going to work, it's simply unfair to pay people MORE to not go to work than we are making by going.  Failure to acknowledge this is patently offensive.  The term in economics is ""Moral Hazard"".

There is no reason to pay anyone on unemployment more than they earned at their job, period.  And anyone who says they can't live on less than $50K per year, when they made less than that before pandemic, is full of it."

Therefore, it's the President's responsibility to give a lifeline with a sense of urgency right NOW for these people. The rampant spread of a virus that was treated with arrogant indifference is what is keeping people from work, not their entitled lifestyle. Conservatives think all of these people are sipping martinis on their yacht or something- it's maddening. People can't go back to their jobs when there ARE NO JOBS."

But a large percentage of the other party and its voters doesn't believe in social democracy either. And well off liberals keep voting for people like Clinton and Biden in the primaries, because they can assuage themselves that they're doing the right thing by voting for social justice rhetoric while not actually having to redistribute any wealth or power. (Obviously Biden and Clinton are a million times better than Trump and I hope Biden wins the general election regardless).

Most Americans including Democrats will never give up their bootstrapping meritocratic mentality that the successful and the well off are those who are truly deserving due to their talent and hard work.  Many Democratic voters don't seem to want universal healthcare ever because they have their insurance and they like it and that's all that matters.  They don't want to pay for ""someone with diabetes who got it through their own fault"" etc.

What I'm saying is if you didn't vote for Bernie in the primary why are you complaining now, this is basically what you asked for.  Yes, Biden would (will, hopefully) be marginally better and less cruel but the fundamental cruelty and lack of care for the poor will remain entrenched and once things return to normal and the well off liberals get their jobs back they will go back to not caring and voting status quo."

Congress has failed, so has the POTUS. Something they do consistently, is to place blame on each other. As elected representatives, their most important function is to take care of the people.

Government policy is promoting it by making it financially attractive, even promoting procreation by the unemployed (who have little else to do) by providing support for children of people out of work, and providing now even more benefits so they won't have to pay their rent.  It also penalizes productive people by taxing them to pay for benefits for the unproductive--that's backwards economics; if you have too much of something and you want to reduce the supply you should stop encouraging production of more of it.  At a minimum we should be encouraging emigration to Canada and Mexico--watch how fast those countries build walls to keep us out!  BTW, what ever happened to the illegal Mexican immigration debate?"

He did not want to work?  That’s not a problem government should help with.

Bmi > 30, hypertension, and age are also higher risk of corona virus complications.  So using his logic, almost everyone should be afraid and go home to try to collect government handouts.  

Being afraid of the virus is no reason to live off the system.  We all want a vacation.  Go to work if you can.  

It is different if you don’t actually have a job. That’s a real big bad problem.  

And it’s not any asthma’s but moderate to severe asthma that has higher, undefined, “risk” of complications.  So he appears to be misinformed."

He tells me he has twice been offered his job back but turned it down because he was taking in much more each month with first stimulus federal and state benefits than he would make working. The executive action stimulus President Trump enacted this afternoon is very cleverly designed to help the unemployed yet not incentivize people like my son to not work. This stimulus guarantees Trump's re-election as it should. I think most Americans are not so stupid to cut their noses off to spite their faces and vote contrary to their pocketbooks. I know some hate him so much they will vote against their economic best interests; some will be that stupid as well as put a man in the office who does not know where he is part of the time, VERY dangerous to the U.S. and nuclear world."

2020-08-07 19:16:23,"This article could be written about so many aspects of our society. It's like no one is proactive we are permanently playing catch up. I don't know if it's something to do with the structure of US institutions or if it's something to do with the American psyche. I suspect a little (or a lot) of both. Education should be a strategic national priority, not based on how much money a school district collects. Every child should have a laptop - whether rich or poor and access to the internet. We are now entering a global knowledge economy where the competition is much more intense. ""local control of education is a centuries old american tradition"" Again part of the problem which ensures patchwork responses and solutions. Even without the pandemic, education should've moving into a more digital environment. Of course we are now playing catch up again."
2020-08-07 19:20:21,"Shoulda, woulda, coulda. We are living in unprecedented times and a lot of us are learning on the fly. So while I appreciate the discussion about how we can do better, the tsk, tsk tone of the article is not helpful."
2020-08-07 19:22:14,"I know a teacher who just spent two months preparing online lessons for the fall. She also attended an excellent workshop where teachers exchanged online learning methods. 

While districts might have faltered, some teachers have been working away the summer to do the best they can."
2020-08-07 19:25:34,"The lack of preparation by many school districts is simple inexcusable. I've heard district leaders say ""Nobody could have predicted this pandemic!"" as a defense. First, let's ignore the fact that MANY people have been warning for years about the potential for a global pandemic. Putting that aside, many districts are located in areas which are prone to natural disasters. Here in Seattle we sit in a major seismic zone. Our district was utterly unprepared for remote learning and one has to wonder what would they have done if there was an earthquake which would have rendered school buildings unsafe to enter? A major quake is simply a matter of when, not if. Other communities are no different be it due to floods, hurricanes, etc."
2020-08-07 19:25:37,"With many businesses announcing early, and very publicly, that remote work would be the way of the near-to-midterm future, it's unconscionable that school systems didn't prepare to do likewise and improve the online experience for both teachers and students.

Even if the virus had been adequately controlled nationwide over the summer, it was no secret that flu season could bring a second wave of infections, necessitating a return to remote learning. The summer months constitute a huge opportunity squandered. 

My 10 year-old niece, an avid student, has no love for the way online education is conducted. But as much as she misses her teachers and peers, she also has no desire to return to the classroom until there's a vaccine. Our state has made in-person education voluntary this fall, and she (and her parents) is delighted to have a remote option. But she's not alone in wishing for her new academic year to be more immersive and engaging (in her words ""less boring"") than the end of her last year.

As for Trump and DeVos conditioning school funding on in-person learning, sounds like his typical shakedown strategy. Sorry students and teachers -- to him the educational system is just another Ukraine."

As soon as students start sneezing and coughing schools will shut down. Teachers were doing their heroic best to shift to remote learning with interactive lessons and family outreach. However, many still struggled. If we spend time providing quality professional development and investing in the latest interactive technology instead of convincing parents that live instruction once a week is some sort panacea, we would be in a much better place."
2020-08-07 19:13:38,Good plan for off-site learning must incorporate arrangements for child supervision for parents who are working. Whole notion of what school is could change as a result of this experience.

2020-08-07 19:20:16,"As an instructional designer, I know how hard our faculty has worked to create quality online courses for our students and how well they’ve succeeded under a period of great duress. This reporter darn near throws educators under the bus and absolutely ignores brilliant work done by teachers to do the best they can in the face of uncertainty with little to no financial support for overtime hours and their investments in hardware, applications, and Internet connectivity."
2020-08-07 19:22:52,"The folly of opening schools in a country that is so ill prepared to do so is astounding. For starters, efficient testing and tracing would be a precondition in any place to reliable generate the data required to keep schools open or track eventual outbreaks. Add to that old buildings with no proper ventilation and the lack of universal healthcare you can truly only talk about wishful thinking when actually flirting with disaster."
2020-08-07 19:52:07,"The list of people who should be charged with criminal neglect keeps on growing.  At the very least, whether there is more in-person teaching or online learning, there should have been a provision for every student to have a computer and access to the internet.  Also, massive investment in broadband, which, as others have noted, is an area that t he tech industry, in its own interest could have sorted."
2020-08-07 19:54:54,I have no dog in this fight but I get the sense that maybe remote learning is inherently flawed and the best way address that problem is to *try* to use remote learning as little as possible.
2020-08-07 19:56:06,We need to do remote/virtual instruction right before we can determine its effectiveness. Sitting in school five days per week for seven hours a day is an antiquated model. It's time to do away with school as day care.
2020-08-07 20:00:06,"Each case is remarkably different.  In NY, the mayor wants the students back in school because it's how they get fed.  Higher income students adapt to remote learning more easily and likely have all the tools needed at their disposal.  Older districts have unsafe, crumbling buildings.  Lots of districts are flat broke.  The great hue and cry of this year's online learning was how most teachers were absent or apathetic.  In retrospect, it would have been better for all schools to reopen remotely for the rest of 2020 and prepare for a 2021 classroom experience."
2020-08-07 20:08:19,"@ NYTimes:  I'd like to learn a bit more about what is actually known about best practices of online learning and teaching, especially for students in different age groups and  different needs.  Online teaching and learning for motivated high school students from middle class families with plenty of parental support and encouragement must certainly differ a lot from trying to deal with Kindergarten students from severely disadvantaged backgrounds.  So, what is actually known about ""best practices"" in those situations, and where has it been implemented?  
I would welcome a deeper dive in form of an article or even a series of articles that allow us to have an informed discussion which scenarios might be a way to make the best out of a bad situation."
2020-08-07 20:26:29,"This may be true for K-12, but I can add that at Boise State University nearly all professors are taking an arduous three week Institute course to understand and improve our translating the classroom to online. From the readings we've done (college and university papers across the country) it ""feels"" as if ""higher education"" is laser focused on improvement over the spring semester of 2020."
2020-08-07 19:33:34,"I am a NYC  teacher and parent and I agree completely with this article.  The idea that NYC will be able to open safely is ludicrous.  The hybrid plan is the worst of all worlds--an unsafe and attenuated version of earning that neither resolves any child-care concerns nor promises a consistent, rigorous, and engaging education across classrooms.  The benefits of in-person learning will be canceled out by the constraints and stress of social distancing, and teachers who struggled with technology last year will face the same hurdles.  It has also been so difficult to plan with so much uncertainty.

Teaching remotely was difficult. I worked late into the night every evening.  I was torn between work and my children's needs.  My experience with remote learning as a parent was very inconsistent--I had one child who had a lovely experience that kept her engaged and socially connected.  My other child's teacher was negligent aside from a 10-minute daily meeting and some disconnected worksheets.  The school administration claimed that they were powerless to ensure a consistent experience across classrooms and believed that they should ""support teachers.""

While teachers have been vilified for last year's experience, there has been very little conversation about the role of school administration.  Yes, they have to work within UFT constraints, but strong administrators give teachers the tools that they need and  set the tone for a culture that motivates teachers to do their best."
2020-08-07 19:32:16,"I remain hopeful, but I am just not clear on how schools can “fix” remote learning for the K-2 set who can’t read or operate electronics by themselves. It’s really just a matter of parents figuring out homeschooling or else getting comfortable with leaving some kids behind."
2020-08-07 19:35:36,"10000000% this headline captures my rage & bafflement as a mom of an elementary & middle aged kid.  Lack of leadership again has made this a catastrophic example of wasted energy and systemic absurdity.  Like our healthcare system disaster, our school systems do not have the money nor incentive structure to make this work.

We have to admit & then do:
- onsite education like 'normal' will NOT happen this academic year
- kids need to see other kids and outdoor activities that enable interaction w/social distancing need to be developed ASAP
- school districts should use established online courses that keep kids engaged and train the teachers immediately in providing social emotional support at distance. This should be their primary job not trying to do zoom classes.
- vouchers for broadband, laptops & earphones for every family ASAP!

And, where is the rapid testing? We can't go back until we get testing that we can trust and has an immediate turn-around. Shame on the US for our pathetic less-than-3rd world testing capacity. 2 week wait time is USELESS. In HK you land, you test yourself & get results before you can leave the airport. Right now the US seems we're under emotional torture designed to make us implode. This is a recipe for madness."
2020-08-07 19:41:10,"This is just a cog in the wheel of a case study on how not to run a pandemic!

Just about every step taken in the battle with corona has been approached with much folly,

Akin to every other facet of society and the economy, school opening plans should have been made anticipating the worst, which could have been adjusted if not needed.

As already demonstrated, the virus is not predictable.

Bad advice from government and medical officials, combined with impatience on the part of parents and the general population, have created an uncertain environment; one that potentiates dire consequences for, at the very least, our young.

A society that cannot protect it's young and elderly is not a civilized society."

2020-08-07 19:51:55,"With so many kids having to do remote learning, the US should do like Mexico and have instruction provided on TV that’s done right.  As now a retired LAUSD teacher who after school closures and lockdown here in Los Angeles went into effect back in March, took all the preparatory online training webinars for remote learning the district offered, entitled Future Ready.  It struck me as something the district had already planned to provide generally to address digital citizenship and appropriate internet behavior that students are already normally confronted with, as well as hybrid learning using technology which was going to happen anyway.  There was a great deal of jargon but not really fundamentals like setting up a home classroom studio, equipment, special effects, props, makeup and content production.  This is the stuff Hollywood does everyday and are good at which is which is why they should be asked to pitch in.

2020-08-07 19:30:26,"Our school just sent out their plan for reopening, it seems like the system is so gun shy that reopening will be essentially a waste of time. Classes and/or the whole school will be sent home as soon as thresholds are met, and those thresholds are exceedingly low. Two kids in one class show Covid ""symptoms"" (runny nose? A cough? A rash??) and the class goes home for a certain amount of time. A few kids in the school show the same indeterminate ""symptoms"" and the school shuts down. 

This, from a population of probably 1000 kids who have  been in biological bubbles for the past six months and will suddenly be intermixing with other people's germs.

I would estimate there close to a 100% chance the school will be closed within the first month. The conversation will rapidly change to what the value of in-person learning is when the schedules are constantly being disrupted."
2020-08-07 19:41:23,"What is this article trying to say? That teachers and school administrators — like everyone else — don’t know when the virus will end? That training to teach online can only come from district workshops, not teachers educating themselves on new technology and best practices? That teachers have somehow failed their students despite the school year not even starting yet in most of the country?

This is an article in search of a thesis statement. Fortunately, I have one: Teachers, like everyone else, are struggling. Some are trying their best to learn how to maintain pedagogy via new delivery methods. Some are exhausted from not only the stresses of 2020 that affect most people, but also from school districts and a President that treat them as disposable. A national database of online learning best practices could help, but the Department of Education is more interested in maintaining old ways that are dangerous in the current environment. 

Next time you write about education, please don’t equate a spring in which the pivot to online learning was an emergency to a fall in which the need for online learning has been clear to many teachers for a long time — even if their districts don’t support them."

2020-08-07 19:59:25,"Schools chose the wrong road on planning. They shut down in March and turned to remote learning, not by choice but by need. The quality of remote learning was largely substandard but schools squandered five months where they could have vastly improved remote learning, so here we are, with several schools that have already opened dealing with infections. Many school districts have slapdash plans that will inevitably lead to outbreaks. We are placing children at risk, exacerbated by Trump's assertion that kids don't get sick from this virus. One video showed high school students in Georgia walking through the hall unmasked, shoulder-to-shoulder. There may be some school districts that have taken proper precautions, but more will look like that high school in Georgia. Our grandchildren in Charlotte were originally scheduled to attend school three of the first ten days of school, then return to remote learning. Thankfully, the district realized that plan caused needless risk, and the school year will begin with remote instruction. That makes more sense than opening schools, experiencing infections of students and faculty, and returning to remote learning, which could have been much more effective had schools devoted the energy and resourcefulness of teachers toward that than opening schools with inconsistent plans for checking temperatures, isolating infected students, contact tracing, social distancing, hand sanitizing and mask-wearing. Goal #1: Do no harm to our children."

When faced with a hundred-year challenge (which, let us remember, is not the black swan event so many allege COVID to be), the response of our schools, businesses and society at large was: let's just hope we can keep doing what we were doing as best as we can. In this way, our schooling system has succeeded, and our graduates are working hard to keep doing what they've been doing. Meanwhile, we needed dynamic, creative, and adaptable thinking to both see the situation for what it truly was (that is, long-lasting) and develop plans for a changing situation. The lack of preparation by schools for continued and extended remote/distance learning is indicative of the lack of vision that has thoroughly truncated our ability to navigate uncertainty and develop novel pathways forward. This will be a lost year."
2020-08-07 20:39:04,"Educating children to be responsible citizens in this country is so far behind how it is prioritized in other parts of the world, I fear we will not catch up in my lifetime. This pause engendered by the pandemic over the spring and summer was an opportunity to realign and consider changing priorities so they actually benefit the people who do the work by providing affordable childcare, healthcare, equitable education, and opportunities for all. After more than 50 years of Republicans prioritizing the military, corporations prioritizing shareholders and CEOs, and all of them lining their own pockets, we are faced with a worldwide pandemic that we have been woefully prepared to meet on nearly every level. Our infrastructure has suffered under the GOP commitment to ""no new taxes."" Roads, bridges and sewage systems are in such disrepair it will take decades of concentrated investment to upgrade them. At the same time the GOP have touted their ""family values,"" they have refused to adequately address a crumbling educational infrastructure, buildings that are barely habitable, and teachers who are overburdened and taken advantage of by a system that never has considered them to be the professionals they actually are. It is not surprising that no one knows how (or perhaps is willing) to prioritize education now."
2020-08-07 20:43:50,"*Disclaimer, I work in a school district*
While I appreciate the article highlighting a critical issue both for the U.S. and the world at large I find myself a little frustrated to say there is an issue and failure without offering some ideas of what could/should be done.  
I think there are numerous issues on this topic of remote learning that are, unfortunately, not easily answered.  Issues that I would list and need answers to are:
-Who/how will childcare be provided for students if parents aren't available?  Who will pay for it?
-Should broadband be available to everyone and should it be a utility?  Related, how do we ensure every student has access/use of a device to take place in remote learning and who pays for it?
-How do we address the needs of various student groups; young children who aren't easily tied to a classroom on a computer.  Special needs students who may have limitations of existing tech at home and/or need additional services beyond a computer?  Students with language barriers.
-What resources/curriculum exists that is known to work with different groups via remote learning?  What are the known challenges and what are the recommendations to overcome?

There is much more that could be said and identified.  I think many schools/school districts are working to do the best they have with the existing resources, especially in the absence of federal leadership and resources.  There are no easy answers but it would be nice if the article tried to provide some."
2020-08-07 20:43:56,"Dana Goldstein for the win! The way school leaders spun their wheels and wasted precious time this summer is a microcosm of how the larger society and our leaders have been dealing with the pandemic from the start. It's all short-sighted, short-term magical thinking, instead of really pouring resources into serious planning that face up to the long term realities of the situation. Not that I blame schools for being no better than the society in which they function, but it's going to be one four-star mess come September."
2020-08-07 20:45:36,"Thanks for the article Ms Goldstein. 
Rather than curse the darkness of Washington DC, I think I can offer at least one thing I found to be helpful. If the class sizes are say less than 20 children, it is good to have a TA and any size over 25 children  2 TA's . It worked for me, BUT, and a big but, is that we were teaching grad students and adults learners, which I know is a different modality/theory for learning. However, it could work when teachers are taught to use the ed-tech.

Of course, the TA's have to be qualified / vetted and paid. We prob can get grad students, college seniors and former teachers. 

The tech has to be well understood. Zoom, for example,  can host 49 students and it has zoom rooms to which the teacher and TA's can apportion students and attend to groups of students - faster learners and slower ones, the room can be made for 1 on 1 for private issues. TA's can be co - hosts. Chat rooms can be monitored and puzzled looks can be viewed for extra help.

I feel that last year we were all thrown into the mix with little support, but the tech can help out a lot more than has been reported. I've been using a lot of remote learning tech for 3 years now.  
I can affirm that on line teaching is much more of an intense experience requiring more time than in class with breaks and active learning not withstanding

I am not a stock holder of zoom or any ed - tech, but I wish I were. :("
2020-08-07 20:32:27,"My NYC HS plan is for teachers returning full time w/ student groups in person 1 day a week for shortened classes w/ masks & social distancing.  Why are my students 1 day a week? My school is at 190% capacity. That's not a typo. 4,700 students & nearly 400 staff.

Each day I will be simultaneously responsible for 0-7 in person & 27-34 at home for each of my 5 classes. No one has explained how any of this will work or why it is more effective than remote learning. It's a logistical nightmare and tremendous waste of time & resources. Students are essentially showing up once a week to wear masks all day and do in person remote learning. No assemblies, field trips, concerts, sports, plays, field days, lunch off periods, clubs, or anything else that allows for socializing. Teachers, already demoralized before Labor Day, will be burnt out before Columbus Day.

All of this is on top of the fact that people will die as a result of a meaningless effort to regain some sense of normalcy by incompetent leadership that cannot accept the reality of a pandemic."

2020-08-07 20:33:28,"Very disappointed to watch my 4th grader just get 1 hr a day with his teacher and be left to his own devices the rest of the day. It seems like the teaching profession has had a 9-month vacation, and leadership still don't have a clue despite all the thinking time."
2020-08-07 20:39:40,"Our traditional schools have consistently produced passive students motivated only by extrinsic objectives.  It comes as no surprise that distance learning is so difficult for them. When combined with many parents who view school as little more the necessary daycare, we have a serious problem.  Also, lets not kid ourselves, many students who are not engaged with online learning were probably not doing much in brick and mortar schools either.  Dropout rates are rigged to the point of being meaningless.  Just as the corona virus reveals the shocking reality of our healthcare system, it lays bare the truth about our schools."
2020-08-07 20:43:49,"This is a painful experience, Covid-19 and all of the changes that go with it.  But we're adapting.

I was initially inclined to send my kids back to school in the fall.  However, given the choices our system provided, I chose to keep them at home learning by laptop.

I think that given the level of precaution necessary to keep the virus at bay, the daily trepidation kids will feel as some are shuffled out and quarantined, is going to be too disruptive to learning.

We'll keep our children engaged with friends, which is really all that matters.  Ours are in the 'junior high' years, in which I think most kids would want to stay home anyway.  These years are like the movie, ""Lord of the Flies"".  They're socially terrible.  Why put them through that and Covid on top of it?

We need to provide internet as a right to every household in America so that anyone and everyone can learn online at their own will.  This will pay massive dividends as an investment for our nation."
2020-08-07 20:43:59,"The obvious reason why this did not happen is that teachers are not paid in the summer. Even with a plan for distance learning, my district couldn'tt train teachers until a week before class started...."
2020-08-07 20:48:28,The unions have been a major impediment to returning to face to face instruction. They also do not want for school administrators to train their teachers in effective online teaching. You cannot have both. Private schools have been more innovative and preemptive in training and preparing for BOTH online and face to face or hybrid instruction.
2020-08-07 19:34:12,It would be lovely to immerse myself in top notch PD to help prepare for virtual teaching.  Should I have taken these courses between district wide committee meetings preparing for a return to the classroom? Or maybe after zoom interviews for hiring new staff? Or maybe between organizing grocery runs for family members and the many other covid related struggles many of us were dealing with?  Perhaps you could have researched some really great virtual programs or recommendations that were successful and listed them in your article. There is no shortage of “professional” development online but much of it is either very basic or a waste of time. Please share anything you have because many of us are working hard to be ready for a hybrid model and every little bit helps!!
2020-08-07 19:47:35,"News flash - districts, at least in NJ, wanted to prepare for full remote learning once the last school year ended and we were able to think and when we had the time to do so. The governor had other plans. We were told we must open and must come up with hybrid solutions, pulling efforts in a million directions.  And please remember that school administration, the
people tasked with inventing these plans, have their regular duties to attend to in addition to all of this chaos. Circumstances are ever-changing right now, and schools are doing the best they can to accommodate everyone. We’re aware that the return model is a waste of time, because everyone will likely end up back at home shortly after reopening. Unfortunately, school districts don’t get to decide certain things. I love how everyone has something to say, yet likely very few of the commenters have actually worked in education. What, you pay taxes so you should have a say? Or you’re familiar with school because you attended one? Hire a plumber, try telling him how to do his job because you’re paying him, so you should get to decide how he works, because you know, you’ve been using bathrooms all your life so you know all about plumbing. Let me know how that works for you. And parents complaining, please do us a favor and home school your little darlings."
2020-08-07 19:53:39,"Wife is a middle school teacher and daughter in elementary in same school district but different schools in Scottsdale, Az. Significant differences in technology, schedules, and general operations exist from schools three miles apart.

The middle school is a mess. They (and Susd) bought a program from FL a few weeks ago to roll out an online system. Good luck there...lol. 

My wife is scrambling to identify any standards that exist. Which video tool? Which email? Ms teams or google meets? As usual, grossly underpaid teachers are forced to step way outside the box to patch together a program for their students while leadership bickers politics or buries their heads in the sand."
2020-08-07 20:07:21,"Everything Trump touches turns to junk. He installed a wrecking crew in every government office - all hostile to the agencies they were entrusted to run. Now it’s all blowing up. FDA. CDC. State Dept. Department of Education. 

We cannot act “surprised” when these things all fall apart - this was the design, this was the plan. It was an anarchy strategy that was foreshadowed by Trump’s “American Carnage” speech in 2016."
2020-08-07 19:49:56,I am so happy that Betsy De Vos led the way in offering grant money to assist teachers in planning for distance education this semester.  Right?
2020-08-07 20:51:42,"My child is a serious musician and with the cancellation of in-person lessons, classes, youth orchestras, competitions, recitals and concerts, virtually all has been moved online these past months and it has worked surprisingly well. (Musicians, are, quite a resourceful and creative lot, I have found). Based on the positive experiences, I have found that online learning and gathering only works with 1) incredible teachers/communicators 2) great technology 2) engaged kids and 3) well-thought out curricula in the form of discussions, private lessons, small groups, accessiblity of teachers 4) administrators who are accessible and on top of streamlining the process. 

With this combination of factors, it has worked very well. Without even one of these, it's quite terrible. Simply missing something as simple as a fast internet connection ruins the entire formula. So, as usual, it boils down to money and resources."
2020-08-07 20:53:34,"I agree with this article, and sadly I see nothing in Cuomo’s reopening requirements released today that speak to any standards or requirements for the quality of remote education, only how to open safety. VERY disappointed in Cuomo this time around. Not ok."
2020-08-07 20:58:01,"Let's just call a spade, a spade. Live in person learning is best. Online learning, when necessary, should try and be as close to live in person learning as possible. Teachers and schools could have and should have prepared for both. Teachers Unions spent all of their time and energy over the last few months advocating for schools to stay closed and none of it on optimizing online learning. Who doesn't prepare for multiple options and just closes their eyes and sticks their head in the sand? Teachers getting paid a full salary to teach for an hour online per week is absurd. It is likely that Teachers Unions don't want online learning to succeed as we may discover we need less teachers. The veil covering our public education system has been ripped away and we see the vested interests for what they are: special interest groups playing politics and power games with our children's futures. School, for the teacher's unions, is about the adults, their salaries and pensions. It is not about the kids. I used to be a strong supporter of the public school system but now see the advantages of private institutions and charter schools. I recommend watching ""Waiting For Superman"". In addition, to talking about defunding the police, perhaps we should be talking about defunding the public schools which are monopolies with no incentive to improve and spending this money on vouchers to give parents a choice and support private schools and charters."
2020-08-07 21:05:40,"Online learning in the form it’s done now cannot work for elementary school and kindergarten, and can barely work for higher grades. It may work for college but only if administrators are willing to accept a high rate of dropouts. However, small-group teaching, learning pods and other creative solutions could help but only if teachers were willing to experiment and think outside the box. Unfortunately, teachers in the US are demonstrating exactly why the country is so far below all the rest of the civilized world in test scores. They are reacting as if going into the classroom is a death sentence, while coming up with no innovative solutions for their students. I keep hearing from my friends with small kids how frustrated and angry they are at the lackadaisical attitude of teachers who are only concerned about their physical safety and have no idea how to utilize online tools to at least keep their students interested and engaged. Parents who can afford it should pull their kids out of public schools altogether and invest in learning pods, private schools or some combination of daycare and tutoring that will enable them to work from home. For the rest, with the public school teachers showing their true mettle, parents should accept that their kids will learn nothing, whether during the pandemic or afterwards."
2020-08-07 21:09:12,Districts need to step up to the plate on remote learning or backlash will be fierce if we’re required to return to all remote learning. Board of Ed members will be voted out and Superintendents will need to account for the failures.
2020-08-07 21:20:38,"My school leaders worked astonishingly hard all summer and still are. I can't believe what an endurance race this has been for them to prepare for every possible eventuality. Yet when presenting the recommendations to the school board, they were met with -- how can I describe it? Passivity? Some members seemed so uninformed. They clearly hadn't done their homework. Or on the other end of the spectrum, some came with an agenda and an axe to grind, with no interest in listening and learning. And these are the people who get the last word. Great."
2020-08-07 21:34:29,"This is the best article yet on the state of remote learning. There is a lot of finger-pointing on why remote learning was not effective in NYC. While I can sympathize with teachers to a certain degree, I think it is important for them to acknowledge their union UTF is a major factor in how education is delivered. It is simply disingenuous to put this on the administrators without accepting some responsibility. 

While agreeing that remote learning requires additional training, it does not take much effort turn on your webcam and greet your students everyday- as messy as that may be. Maybe in a perfect world, we will have the funds and resources to deliver a broadcast quality on-line instruction, but until we do, teachers need to make the effort with the tools they have. 

Students won't mind one bit if things are less than perfect. They will laugh at the gaffes and will adore you for a lifetime. If teachers give up the student-teacher bond by staying 'too remote', you will regret it forever."
2020-08-07 21:35:52,"So many parents have been saying this to our district for months now and yet they have just gone full steam ahead with opening schools at full capacity. I watched, just last week, as the school board sat in their homes and held a zoom meeting about getting the kids back in school. They actually think in a few weeks it will be safe enough to send students and teachers back with only masks, no distancing and no reduction in class size. Yet it’s not safe for them to hold a meeting in person.  
Something no one seems to want to talk about is holding teachers accountable for their distance learning instruction. In the Spring we had teachers who did live instruction each day and we had a teacher who didn’t even show up to “class” and left 20 kids waiting. Another teacher whose assignment consisted of keeping a pandemic journal, period. We have been told by our district how the teachers worked so hard and That they deserve our thanks.  When in truth, teachers true colors showed and many didn’t even try. I am a former teacher who switched careers and I know it can be a challenging profession."
2020-08-07 21:46:31,"Understood. But it's sort of a sequel -- how is it that over the past 50 years of educational reform and renewal we emerge with a populace that seems largely willing to discard principles that have formed the foundation of our democracy: pluralism, secularism, respect for law, science, and civil rights. For all the efforts that were made, we seem to have regressed from where we stood in 1970."
2020-08-07 21:54:00,"This will be my 22nd year of teacher high school.  We had all summer to do training but that means the calls to be virtual/remote/distance had to be made two months ago (the data was there, it wasn't getting any better). However, districts, States, Feds didn't want make that call.  Also, the same entities did not want to pay for training.  There all the folks who would teachers should be doing it for free because they love their students.  Teachers often work 2nd jobs in the summer because teachers aren't payed in the summer (when they are it is because they have districts  accounting normalize their 10-month Salary into 12 installments). 
   Even now I have witnessed much rhetoric that seems to view teachers as indentured servants who have to get back to the classroom (or else).  Well, teachers might just leave teaching then. I would gather many teachers wouldn't have trouble finding another job - saying you have handled a room full of kids/teens is a pretty good marketing point."
2020-08-07 22:15:22,"Dana Goldstein, thank you for this column. 

Sadly, it's not a prescription for schools to follow, it's a report that we're on the verge of widespread failure, and a coronavirus explosion.  

I work for a major university, managing a department that supports course content delivery. Classes start August 10. We have been ""welcoming"" students back to dorms for a week. There will be students in classrooms. 

We too have been working diligently on prepping the campus for students in the classroom, which seems to me an exercise in futility. Every school in the country should have been prepping for online instruction, with serious federal funding to support it. 

Instead Tump & DeVos (and others, like the governor of Ariz) are threatening to cut funding, which is like pulling IV's out of a patient on life support. 

We also have hybrid courses that offer the worst of both worlds. What could be workable and even innovative absent the coronavirus, will instead be a disaster. 

K-12 schools have it worse than Higher Education. We at least know how to deliver online courses. K-12 schools will be hotbeds for coronavirus infection. I fear we'll see numbers of cases and deaths that will dwarf what we're seeing now. 

I give it 4 - 8 weeks before the majority of schools are overrun with coronavirus.

Believe me, I don't want this to happen! But I cannot see how it will be otherwise.  

I will be heartbroken to be proven right."
2020-08-07 22:23:39,"I teach at a private school, where we have been doing a typical bell schedule online. This means live classes for an entire school day. Kids were engaged, and we got great reviews from parents. 

I still face the possibility of going into work during a pandemic. For schools that successfully implemented a full day online school schedule in the Spring, it makes little sense to go back until it’s actually safe to do so."
2020-08-07 22:24:55,"I wish my local school district would have beefed up distance learning instead of trying to scramble at the last minute to open back up. Temperature checks will be based on an honor code where parents are responsible for checking for a fever. Ever try to get multiple kids ready along with yourself in the morning and now tacking on a temperature check along  with it? Also, what’s stopping parents from lying on the daily questionnaire about a fever and giving their child Tylenol? Nothing. My local school district is also allowing masks to come off during instruction time, excuse me? Instruction time is a major chunk of the day. Are we are just going to leave children exposed for hours mask less with hopefully an open window? Not to mention going back shortly after Labor Day. What a perfect way to expose the school community with families having BBQs a week before school starts. Then there’s also getting hundreds of kids to school on the bus. The school district has suggested walking or dropping off. Being in a low income district, it will be almost impossible. This is like watching a train wreck, we know schools will be closed before they even get their feet of the ground but yes let’s gamble everyone’s lives in the school community. At least they can say they tried? Right?"
2020-08-07 22:31:13,"NO. I believe the ultimate responsibility for the breakdown of our educational system, which is essentially what is happening, lies with our federal government. If, early on such as March or April, our country had realistically acknowledge the seriousness of the pandemic, not ignored it or pretended it would go away, educators could and should have been planning for this. Instead of supporting our educators, politicians are threatening to reduce funding to schools that do not reopen in person instead of providing them with the additional funding they need. The push to reopen in person schooling was motivated by politics and economics. Schools should not take the blame."
2020-08-07 21:06:19,"I spent a brief amount of time teaching HS Math. It was a miserable and frustrating experience. The kids were great. I think they all wanted to learn, but the administration was just horrendous. They failed to order textbooks; they ignored problems and poo-pooed any all complaints and concerns I had a as teacher. It does not surprise me that this summer was wasted. I think it's due to a lack of any real leadership and ability in most school districts. We have a serious issue with school admins (at least in Southern California), Principles and Vice-principles for the most part are career administrators with little teaching experience. They are top-heavy and not really interested in solving problems. Like many things, COVID is bringing out the weakness in this system also. Getting rid of the incompetent De Vos would be good, but it will not solve the real problems."
2020-08-07 21:07:21,"First fix the virus. I told my kids they should prepare for online though our school system said it would open all the way until last week. When states can reduce infections to under a hundred and eliminate community spread, we can try it, until then they should try to stop the virus. Forget the economy. Until you stop the virus pretending there is an economy is denying reality."
2020-08-07 21:09:39,"I have spent the entire summer on these pages advocating for exactly what Goldstein is calling for here. In probably close to a hundred letters, I have pointed out that there is no safe reopening or guarantee that numbers will remain low in places like NYC. 

A group of pediatricians who have zero knowledge of how schools work advocated for opening (and one later admitted it was driven by his own need for daycare) and this journal's editors also pushed reopening; as a direct result, our students and teachers have been hung out to dry. 

We are now in full-blown crisis mode because no school knows what to do, most do not have the resources, time, or money to do anything to safeguard anyone, from the kids, to the janitor (at very high risk) to staff and teachers. And now, surprise surprise, we're out of time.

Even those that have spent a fortune, like my school, are chasing a myth. This is a VIRUS. It does not respect zip codes, religions, race, geography. It seeks hosts. Period. Lots of them. Our schools, by definition, are the perfect breeding ground. 

Every school that has reopened has not even managed a day before kids and teachers start testing positive. 

I'm sorry if I sound fed up, but what I want to say isn't printable. Because I'm done with the death dealers and the suicide cult in this country.

 Go ahead. If our stated intent is to kill as many people as we can before year's end, open. Online learning saves lives and offers enriched learning. So which is it?"
2020-08-07 22:35:05,"Governors, not schools-and certainly not teachers, are responsible for the failure to commit to virtual learning months ago. In many states, teachers are still fighting district by district to get their schools to switch to virtual learning. Maybe Dana Goldstein's anti-teacher and anti-union articles played a part. Or maybe it was the fantasy pieces she wrote, lying to parents about how in-person school was safe (all those safety precautions that they don't have the space or money for). 

We need our elected officials to actually lead and protect our students, teachers, and their families. We need education reporters to cover education issues fairly. Why has Dana Goldstein repeatedly failed to report on districts that do not require masks? Why has she failed to report on how eating lunch at school will contribute to the spread of COVID? Why has she failed to report on a teacher shortage that means there will not be enough subs for when teachers get sick and/or die? I expected better from the Times."
2020-08-07 22:26:38,"As the pandemic raged nationwide Teachers in Chicago waited all summer for Chicago Public Schools to send digital training, instruction on improving digital platforms, a plan, any plan for us to follow.  There was no way teachers would be going into dirty, poorly ventilated, poorly staffed schools with this pandemic still out of control.  We saw summer camps open and shut down. We saw bars open and shut down. We saw the district hold webinar meetings because it was unsafe to meet in person.  This summer should have been spent either purchasing or creating digital standard based curriculum.  This is not the time to leave teachers to create their own online unit plans.  The discussion for that is over.  Here we are one week into August and while elearning in Chicago will continue we still don’t have schedules, class lists, requirements, nothing except for links to review our “synchronous and asynchronous instruction”  ... must be the new catch phrases for the school year.  Principals have been left to figure it it all out.  Twenty-seven years at this and every year is more difficult then the last.  For me this experience has reinforced what I know and what I teach my 8th graders everyday every year; rely on you, be ready for anything and prepared for everything, and don’t wait for this world to give you anything even if you’ve earned it.  This pandemic has shown us the inefficiency of our government and the pe our school system and the value as a country of its people.  So sad."
2020-08-07 20:49:11,"Covid is actually a huge educational gift if we would only recognize it: it could spur a whole generation to become little Abraham Lincolns who know how the teach themselves. There is, and has always been, only one assignment: learn as much about the world as you can, until your curiosity is sated. Even in his log cabin, impoverished Abraham Lincoln could find a copy of Shakespeare. Nothing holds back a motivated kid with a library card. Looking to teachers is not the way."
2020-08-07 22:07:25,"NYC is wasting valuable time. Like Chicago, they should abandon hybrid learning plans and face reality as to where this is going. New York is not an island, it will be coming back. Students and teachers benefit more from optimized online learning processes than clever hybrid plans that will not survive a month."
2020-08-07 21:11:06,"""Lessons were often passive, revolving around online videos and worksheets.""

Rather than an instructor explaining, and a worksheet? 

How, Ms. Goldstein, would you define ""active"" learning? Throwing paper darts at the ceiling, texting your friends secretly, asking questions until the instructor gives you the answer. splitting into groups and just chatting? 

Nothing about this time contributes to anyone's ""social and emotional well-being.""

There is a group from whom we need to demand more.  And that is students themselves.  I enjoyed working on line with students who did their reading and submitted written work. This would be high school Modern World History, ninth grade ELA, and AP Language and Composition. While the teaching of writing works well in writing, I can appreciate the difficulty with art, science experiments, music, and elementary. 

Let's stop treating all subjects the same.  Some have infinitely more homework than others, for one thing.  Some lend themselves to online interaction well.

And H/T to Dina Herrity who said so few articles about teaching ever contact teachers. In fact, virtually none of them do. 

Cut excessive administrative constructs and hire more classroom teachers."
2020-08-07 22:38:03,"I have high schoolers in one district and gradeschoolers in another district; both districts chose a different approach to the problem.  The high schoolers will be split into two cohorts and alternate in person and remote learning; the grade schoolers will go to school in person until after lunch and everyone will have a one hour period of elearning after they get home. All elementary students will get a mask free recess despite the governors declaration about wearing masks in public.  In both cases, one can opt out and learn at home.  We have chosen to opt in for the high schoolers and opt out of for the grade schoolers.  Watching our nations leaders deal with this pandemic on a national and local level regardless of party affiliation has saddened me and my family.  I served 20 years in the Army, I worked for the US Senate when I was in college, I worked for the DOJ, my grandfather was a union organizer, I count a 
Governor amongst my relatives; I have politics and public service in my blood.  But I’m done.  The people running this show and the reporters presenting it are all too much about themselves and too little about the commons."
2020-08-07 22:06:59,"""...time was lost,"" said the professor of education.  Perhaps he should add, ""mistakes were made.""
Hybrid learning can be done, if a massive amount of time and effort is invested in designing and funding programs for it; some of the investment would have to involve huge amounts of money, of course, because there aren't enough hours in the day for one individual teacher to do the work of three, and all those extra teachers have to be recruited and trained.
But not to worry - all over the country, school districts have invested in hand sanitizer.
Epic failure.  
Epic."
2020-08-07 21:16:10,"In just about every other profession or industry, the basic choices have come down to these three: 1. Do your job in person, but with added protections and processes to prevent disease transmission. 2. Figure out how to do the job remotely as well or nearly as well as you could do it in person 3. Shut down and shed workers, either temporarily or permanently. 

I don’t see why it should be any different in education."
2020-08-07 21:17:16,Online learning is never going to equal the classroom experience.  Let's not pretend it will.  We are in the middle of a pandemic - the education response is not ideal; it's just what has to be done to protect everyone's health right now.  Let's all grow up and deal with it.
2020-08-07 23:00:40,"A lot of the comments below express frustration with schools, teachers, and the educational leaders who have been busily strategizing all summer to get kids back in buildings. Which is what the vast majority of parents say they want. 

Superintendents have been consumed all summer with concerns about space, staffing, cleaning, testing, and ventilation, not just because teachers and staff want safe working conditions, but because it's pretty terrible to have a student outbreak of COVID happen on one's watch. High-quality curricular planning, by necessity, has had to take a back seat to these basic safety questions. Can you imagine what parents would say if schools put content/instruction ahead of the careful adherence to public health guidelines? What I think we'll see this fall is that most teachers used the summer to learn more about remote learning and refine their practice — whether or not the district paid for them to do so."
2020-08-07 20:59:56,"It never ceases to amaze me how people who are not in education think there are simple solutions to educational problems, and that those of us who actually work in the profession are just too stupid to solve them.

Very few teachers lecture anymore.  The vast majority of us have group projects, activities and active learning.  Switching from that to self-directed learning was difficult for both students and teachers. And to be fair, so much emphasis has been placed on reaching and motivating students that we seem to think that a student being bored is the worst possible scenario. It's not ideal, but maybe there was something to be learned in that everything in life won't be entertaining.  I often wonder how my students will deal with the workplace- for every job has tasks that are ""boring.""

On-line teaching is also not as simple as suggested.  Issues came up as to student and teacher privacy concerns (would someone record our students?), people hacked into online classrooms with inappropriate material.  My own district had to figure out where our kids living in homeless shelters could access the internet safely. 

What has happened is not the fault of teachers or administrators.  We've been working as hard as we can.  We told you in person education would be impossible this year and no one listened- in fact, the NY Times published two editorials on how schools must open. The federal government has failed us.  I've accepted spending $1000 on my PPE, I'm not accepting blame."
2020-08-07 22:18:59,"Lots of thoughts on this huge problem. I'll comment on the one that jumped out immediately. Some district somewhere is kicking around the idea of hiring school bus drivers to check and make sure that children that haven't logged on to participate in the sessions will do so in the future.......where are the ""concerned"" parents who should be checking on their own children to make sure the join meeting button is clicked?"
2020-08-07 20:50:34,"On-line learning needs to be viewed as a multi-faceted tool for education and educators; almost all the current discussion views it as simply a teacher using the Internet to get in front of a class. While there may be situations where ""remote learning"" (or better ""remote teaching"") is the only direct alternative to traditional in-classroom teaching, on-line learning has a range of present and future modes, some more independent than others including MOOCs. Students and teachers need to be enabled now to apply all of them as appropriate to subject and student. This should be a normal component of continuous improvement of both value delivered and cost management.
In addition as long as this pandemic lasts, delivery needs to be altered to recognize several factors including teachers and students becoming ill, the absolute need to minimize, even eliminate infection spread, the existing uneven access to computing equipment and communication links based on student location and economic circumstances, and even varied circumstances within students' homes such as parents working. The education system should, for example, now be establishing on-line learning ""study halls"" where students can work, during (and perhaps after) school hours with minimal supervision and with all necessary resources. Such facilities can be in  temporary facilities now and part of school buildings"
2020-08-07 21:52:29,"Maybe the headline should read ""How Americans Missed the Chance to Fix Our Broken Nation."" Schools and families are nothing more than another casualty of this nation's failed leadership at every level, leadership that failed because too many elected officials value partisanship over the American people because hyperpartisanship is padding their bank accounts while the rest of us starve. 

Schools don't have the funding to fix much, and they also didn't have the support of their communities. Imagine if school systems had worked tirelessly to develop robust remote learning plans this summer. Word would have leaked and any progress would have gotten lost in the maelstrom of negativity from both politicians and the press. The message to schools was clear: you better open your doors. And so schools tried. Who of you tried to help them?

How many families stayed home? How many Americans masked up every time they went out and only went out when they needed to? How many parents told their teenagers ""No"" when it came to attending parties and playing sports? The answers lie in the number of infections raging through our country.

So what will happen? Teachers will again rise to the occasion and work beyond the level anyone thought possible. In Georgia, hundreds of teachers who returned are now sick or quarantined or both. Schools in Indiana are already shut down. And yet Americans refuse to mask, refuse to stay home, and busy themselves by raging at the schools. Nonsense."
2020-08-07 22:08:06,"Plan for the worst and hope for the best. I do hope the voters will throw any school board that missed this opportunity to plan for online courses this summer out of office. Let's replace them with teachers that have the welfare of the students and staff as a goal.

Online classes will not be engaging unless educators put in the effort to make them engaging.  If the community gets the virus under control and can open physically,  nothing is lost."
2020-08-07 21:54:00,"I take issue with the article's headline. I don't fault the district for whom I work, nor the sup't at my own children's school for this ""lost summer."" 

A) Where does the funding for a summer's worth of remote ed. training come from? Every district is expected to conjure it up? 

B) The *nation's* leaders had 5-6 months to coordinate the containment of COVID-19 and make schools safe. It is absurd to put all the pressure on individual school districts to send kids and staff into poorly ventilated buildings with no guarantee of air quality or testing. 

Meanwhile, the president made a mockery of mask-wearing until mid-July, sullying the credibility of public health officials and safeguards like a kid burning ants with a magnifying glass. I lay this absolute debacle and national tragedy at his feet."
2020-08-07 20:44:16,"And there was this editorial from the Editorial Board of the New York Times just a month ago: Reopening Schools Will Be a Huge Undertaking.

Everyone is doing the best they can under extraordinary conditions, including educators. That we, the people, cannot, would not, did not (choose the verb of your choice) wear masks from the beginning puts this squarely on our shoulders. Yes, it would have helped if our federal and state leaders had done a better job. But, let's not be children about this and blame others. As one of my educator friend's would say to children who blamed others for their mistakes, ""Point your finger at your chest. You are the one who made the mistake."""
2020-08-07 23:22:21,"How naive. The NYT is under the impression that there is much going on in a school district over the summer? By union contract, in California, teachers only have to return to their classes a couple of days before the first day of school. And many administrators essentially take the same summer vacation as the teachers.

The teachers unions have taken ""professionals"" who are paid a salary, and made them think just like an hourly auto worker: ""you didn't pay me for that hour, so I'm not working that hour."" Of course they wasted the summer. No one paid them extra for it."
2020-08-07 21:30:26,"Let's be honest. School has never been about education, rather it has always been about babysitting. If kids got educated it was be chance rather than design.

Doubt my argument? Ask yourself why American school age kids preform so poorly, on a consistent basis, compared to their OECD counterparts.

COVID-19 is shining the spotlight on America's failed education system. What' the solution.

1) Don't try to deliver on-line education in the same manner as face-to-face instruction. They are fundamentally different, school boards and teachers need to buck-up and stop being lazy: redesign the course curriculum.

2) All Parents, rich or poor, need to take responsibility for their children. It starts with disciple, something in acute absence in most families. 

3) School boards need to guarantee that all children get the hardware to participate in the new delivery model. Full top no excuses. Re-allocate your budgets and coming Federal Funds.

4) Finally, school boards need to stop trying to re-invent the wheel. On-line education has been delivered successfully for decades. 

Consider the facts, America's largest university as measures in annual graduates delivers virtually all of its programs on-line? Who do you ask is this? The much maligned, with 45 years of continues delivery of education, with a curriculum developed and supported by Harvard University,....you guessed it the University of Phoenix!

Parents, educators, school boards need to stop whining! Do your jobs!"

2020-08-07 23:18:06,"If dodging responsibility were an Olympic sport, teachers and their unions would be gold medalists many times over. The staggering number of excuse after excuse for why distance teaching is failing is disgusting and appalling. 

I've heard the breathless hyperbole that schools should be closed ""because if they're open even with precautions, everybody's going to die; children are filthy disease-ridden creatures"". 
Ok, then, let's do quality distance teaching until the virus numbers go down. 
Why have public school teachers and their unions fallen down so badly with distance teaching? So many excuses: ""Well, we only had one day to transition to online teaching in March. My contract doesn't allow for live teaching. It's the families' fault. Working parents are to blame. I'm a teacher, I don't care for children. Let's blame Trump or Betty Devos because nobody likes them anyway. Kids don't pay attention on Zoom. Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter didn't give us enough tech. I want a higher salary to teach online. It's a pandemic, so who cares if children get an education or not."" And so on and so on. 
Small wonder that many parents are abandoning the public school system for alternatives. The propaganda being spread by the unions is unsustainable. Even left wing voters who've long supported teachers unions are turning against them. You as a public employees union can only bribe politicians for so long before the people fight back."

2020-08-07 23:53:52,"I’m a little confused by the choice to say that “educators” should have been preparing for online learning for the last several months. If educators includes administrators and school board members then maybe I can accept it better. I’ve been waiting for our district to announce whether we would be teaching remotely or online for months. They finally announced we would teach in person last week. School is scheduled to start on the 17th. I completely agree that this time should’ve been spent investing in quality distance education solutions. I wish all of my professional development required by my district would’ve been about flipping the classroom and providing creative, rigorous content via the internet. But it wasn’t. It wasn’t even discussed. Teachers have had no say. And now we are being forced to come back with a pandemic that hasn’t slowed down and all our PD is focused on how to get kids not to touch each other or any surfaces and how to disinfect our rooms when we have time. Just as it would’ve been great to have national leadership for this pandemic, it would’ve been great to have a more centralized school leadership helping us to provide the best online instruction possible while keeping us safe."
2020-08-07 23:58:08,"The Friday prior to the school's in NYC shutting down we were told that the school's would not close and we should prepare our lessons for students to use both in and out of class. I spent the next 2 day signing up for Zoom, learning how to use it and adapting my lessons for in and outside of class. I worked about 20 hours on this. 5pm on Sunday - school's were shut down but teachers needed to come into the schools for training.  Training was a joke, there was no training.  
I am thankful for the peers who helped each other try to figure out platforms for learning.  I taught live, but also needed to provide recordings of my classes, so students didn't have to show up, could hand in work any time and, while some remained diligent, many of my seniors largely checked out. I was also tasked with following up trying to contact students who were not showing up or doing work.  Students and parents didn't respond (not ill!) More than one student honestly told me they stayed up nights playing computer games and just couldn't wake up for my class.
We didn't even have days off for our religious holidays!
I have spent this summer taking online classes, trying to hone my skills and about 40 unpaid hours per week redesigning my curriculum for remote and blended options.
I am so annoyed at non-teachers who think they know what we do, who treat us with zero respect and say that we had a ""holiday"" for the Spring months.  NOBODY I know at my school worked less."
2020-08-07 23:25:09,"The teachers’ union is NOT separate from regulars teachers. We believe that we deserve a place to work without a threat to our lives. Is that so much to ask in these pandemic times? Nowhere in this column was there a honest to god public school teacher’s opinion. What does TNTP and CRPE know about the realities of most of students’ schooling this upcoming academic year? They’re consultants. If you’re going to write a column purporting the realities of the reopening schools in the fall, at least have the temerity to ask a representative from the MAJORITY of the teaching force in this country. Again, the “union“ is not a separate entity from regular teachers. Stop reporting as if there’s a greater power dictating teacher actions and policy beliefs."

We’ll be more prepared than the spring when we had a weekend to figure it out."
2020-08-08 00:24:59,"It is beyond worrisome when ""experts"" come out with broad recommendations and guidances that ultimately leave the hard task of making them happen to the presumably NON-experts.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, this happened first with the idea that the federal government shouldn't take charge of the obvious emergency response needed.

Then the advice about the absolute need to bring school children and staff together this fall.

Coming down the pike we are going to have to deal with the major question of evaluating and reviewing the efficacy and safety data of a number of preventive vaccines.  Hopefully, as senior staff at the FDA stated today in an article in JAMA, there routine safeguards will be maintained and the independent vaccine advisory group will be able to review the data and offer their opinion before any are approved.

We desperately need a ""sea change"" in the way our nation deals with critical issues.

Facts and logic delivered broadly to the U.S. public for mass consideration is vitally needed in order for our nation to begin its rehabilitation from its current malaise."
2020-08-08 01:16:11,"This article varies greatly from my own experiences both in its history of the past 6 months and predictions of how this year will be. In California 
1. The state, not local districts, made the decision last spring to hold kids harmless for grades, meaning they could not receive a lower grade than the day a district dismissed. Teachers wanted more ability to get kids in distance learning by using grades as motivation. We were not given that tool. Clearly a healthy percentage of kids checked out if they were happy with their grades. 
2. The state developed clear guidance for how to hold in person classes. It certainly brings a lot more clarity and safety to the situation and allowed districts like mine to adopt solid plans to avoid constant opening and closing of schools. 
3. Every district that I am familiar with never limited their thoughts about this year to the hybrid model. That was the hoped for solution, but the plans always included full distance learning, independent study, and normal school with precautions. 
4. Teachers have tirelessly worked this summer, mostly unpaid, to create virtual education that is not only much better for students but also for the teachers. Major investments in technology and online infrastructure have been supported by the state and districts. Teachers collaborated across the country to figure out much better ways to do virtual learning. At least in my district it will be much better and as close to normal as possible."
2020-08-08 01:22:01,"As teachers, we are frequently told and rated on how well we teach kids the ability to use logic, be consistent, and work together to solve problems instead of just being told. Our lesson plans are sometimes critiqued on how much we plan for every minute of class. It is frustratingly ironic that the supposed hallmarks of good education are not being used by those in charge. 

What is logical about teaching 8 kids in school and 24 at home at the same time without new tech? Why are kids coming to school if they can't touch any materials? How could another on-line teacher work with most of our students while we work with the few who show up in our aging classrooms? How can we plan, when the most carefully thought out curriculum map made over the summer might not work with what is demanded from us at the last second? Why, after years of being told our lessons should be no more than five minutes, is 45-minutes of live instruction the only way to teach? 

When parents complain--as they will in the fall--remember that in most places we have not been given a seat at the table for planning and figuring out any of this. Whereas I can figure out how to create an on-line and secure survey for my students in minutes, even our own union has said that teachers voting on school year issues is too complicated, so they are deciding without us. Thus, we will have to do our best implementing deeply flawed and vague top-down planning. 

Like students have to do when they have a bad teacher."
2020-08-07 19:22:23,Every teacher I know spent all summer learning more about online programs and preparing for remote learning. So many articles about teaching never consult actual teachers!!
2020-08-07 19:16:41,"As a high school science teacher, I've been incredibly disappointed in the lack of foresight our school leaders have brought to the conversation. This is an incredible opportunity to reinvent schools with imagination and ingenuity. Instead, my state and my district are pushing a one size fits all mentality when we know students don't learn in a one size fits all environment. 

Provide options for students and their families! Provide options for teachers! Encourage teachers to design curriculum that can be done outside of the classroom! Discover new best practices to teach and learn in person, from a distance, under a tent, in a baseball field, on a tennis court or anywhere an imagination allows. 

And don't stop providing services to students! My school has a health clinic where students might get their only healthcare. We also provide meals and mental healthcare. We also have a large English Language Learner population and a significant amount of special ed students who have languished in distance learning last spring and will continue to do so this next year. 

The lack of imagination from a community who prides themselves as forward thinkers is astounding. We need leaders to bring new ideas and our leaders that recycle old ones should get out of the way."

Once again,let's blame it on the teacher. This article should be rewritten to say school districts and politians refused to look at facts and data. They waited until the last minute to make decisions that could have been made months ago. Now educators have to clean up the mess and do it with a smile. This article insinuates that somehow teachers(that are usually prepared for anything) should have been better prepared a pandemic. It's easy to point fingers, but point them at the right people. Stop throwing teachers/educators under the bus. They did not do this."

2020-08-07 23:40:14,This is not accurate.  Teachers have been working on improving their remote learning/teaching knowledge throughout the summer.  WHO ARE YOU to make such broad-reaching conclusions about educators and schools?
2020-08-08 00:45:56,"Considering that most of the world engaged in some form of remote learning for K-12 schools this past spring, the lack of professional leadership is shockingly pathetic. Usually teachers are inundated with expert advice on how to teach curriculum whether solicited by school boards or corporations. We have heard other professional fields share observations and studies that were compiled during the spring shut downs--reports on environment, animal behavior, weather, air, water, psychology, health, etc. Where did remote learning work best, and why? Why haven't the differences between effective teaching in remote/digital delivery vs. traditional in school/hard copy delivery been defined? How do teachers demonstrate their caring, nurturing and affective domain  humanity in Zoom, Google Meet and other formats? How do schools create and project positive digital classroom environments? What does engagement look like in remote? 

After 50 years of tech ed corporations bilking trillions of money from public schools, what do they have to offer beyond digital chalk boards and emojis? Why does technology mimic print media delivery and teaching strategies instead of using its brain impact capacities to its advantage? This could be a time of innovation and progress instead of calamity and disaster if the experts started collaborating to make the most of a real life necessity and opportunity. Other professions are continuing to learn. What's wrong with the educational leadership?"
2020-08-07 23:48:50,"The whole idea of reopening schools is just going through the motions to appease  parents and Trump Republicans who haven't learned a single thing about Covid in the last 6 months.  

Administrators who know that schools cannot reopen are forced to open schools anyway and create outbreaks so that they can then show that ""we tried.""

I guarantee this will end by October with a massive outbreak and another complete shutdown that will permeate not only the schools but the entire country. 

This is like the World War I generals who blew the whistle and ordered their soldiers out of the trenches, knowing that they would be gunned down in a futile charge, just to prove that they ""did something."""
2020-08-08 00:27:05,"Teaching online can be done in a way that allows for students to achieve in a big way.
I would know.
I’ve taught gifted students online for years.
When kids are given structure, opportunities to engage in similar digitized activities as they would in-person, has a open line of communication with a teacher, and given flexibility (all of which they have in-person), you get the same results...success in the form a student seeks out from their perspective.

2020-08-08 00:31:06,"Remember that we are all facing an unprecedented challenge and doing the best we can at a difficult time.  Patience is required.

I have been teaching high school as a second career for 20 years.  Unequivocally, the most difficult and exhausting portion of my entire teaching experience occurred last year.  Teaching and learning are successful only when both parties are willing participants, regardless of the venue.  Remote learning is further complicated by inequitable internet access.

I spent much time contacting students and families repeatedly for missing work during last year's remote learning experience.  Parents admitted on more than one occasion that their child 'had ben playing video games' or they 'just couldn't get him/her to exert any effort for school'.  My story is not unique, and I work in a small school, in a pleasant community with nice people that exhibits nome of the problems common to large urban centers.

 In The Culture Code, Rapaille says that the US is focused on adolescence.  His conclusion is strengthened by the irresponsibility demonstrated by too many students thrust into the  distance learning challenge, and the way our nation has mishandled the pandemic.  

Before you castigate school districts, teachers, and unions, join us, and show us how to do the job better.  If you can't do that, then please just remember to be responsible and wear your mask."

I don't dispute that they're learning and will continue to improve, but - at least here - I'll suggest a round of applause for our teachers and administration and Board leadership, and hope other school systems have experienced something similar."
2020-08-08 01:46:31,"I am an Oxford trained educator with 35 years of teaching experience in high schools in the the UK, Spain and California.  It is obvious to me that whatever online training that a whole school decides to adopt, every teacher will be essentially delivering the same format of lesson.  For example, a school adopting the training program delivered by the Global Online Academy, will offer all its students five minutes of ""getting to know you"" activities, followed by a half hour of content and then followed by exit tickets (five minutes of summary). Students with questions will then send in emails.  The obvious result will be student boredom with the lack of variation in the teaching method and format."
2020-08-08 02:18:29,"I am a teacher at a fancy private school that had a full day of online classes this spring. We got great reviews from students, parents, and admin.

I have learned that even in a setting with plenty of resources and as successful an online program as one can get, teachers are seen as servants rather than professionals. I am considering taking my Ivy league education to a field where I am treated as a professional."
2020-08-08 02:36:06,"Remote Learning did give us insight into the quality of education our children are receiving. Until this past spring, what goes on in the classroom was fairly opaque and inaccessible to the parent. All that has changed. The UFT (Teachers Union) should be concerned, from a business perspective, of the call for vouchers that will escalate as parents start demanding options."
2020-08-08 02:38:11,"I work in the central office for a school district of about 22,000 students. To say that we have missed the opportunity is quite frustrating to read.  Myself, our superintendent, the entire team have never worked harder or as many hours to reinvent remote instruction and ensure it is of high quality, consistent and improved from the spring. I wish Dana has reached out to more district leadership teams to get a complete understanding of  what we have been doing this summer."
2020-08-08 03:46:12,"No one has yet mentioned the single most effective way to improve online learning, at least for the kids on the wrong side of the ever increasing achievement gap: enforcing student accountability for learning.  

We have provided all our low income students with free computers AND free internet.  Now all we need is for more than half of them to be motivated to log into class on a regular basis and to do the assignments.  I propose that we should stop automatic grade level promotion.  Instead, we should require kindergarten and first grade students to demonstrate grade level reading skills or make them repeat.  Older kids should be held to a more effort and growth based standard simply because so many are already more than a year behind.  Still, counterintuitive as it may seem, this would help very disadvantaged communities, like the one I teach in, the most.  It would give parents an incentive to log their little ones into class and a metaphorical stick to force their older ones to actually bother trying to learn.  As matters stand now, there is effectively no penalty for playing all day.  (At least, no immediate penalty - the future penalty for current laziness is very high.)

My kindergarten students who logged in two hours a day last spring actually learned much of what they would have learned in class.  Unfortunately, most didn’t have the family support needed to do so regularly.  Parents need to be held accountable too."
2020-08-08 03:46:20,"Letting the summer go by without better preparing for the likelihood that remote learning would remain necessary for 
 a good portion or all of this next academic year is unconscionable.  It reveals a lack of vision and leadership on national, state, and local levels, a failure of imagination, a lack of foresight, a failure to plan and prepare for something we could have anticipated, going back to the early spring.  We all had to Macgyver our way as best we could, with duct tape, paper clips, and a Swiss army knife, if this is all we had, through the end of school in June,  but there is no good reason that we should not have much better programs and systems in place by now for remote learning this fall."
2020-08-08 10:19:36,"I don't understand why individual teachers are being left to figure it out on there own.

Wasn't PBS originally an educational channel? 
How hard would it to be to have a dedicated TV channel or channels or youtube videos covering certain core curricula, at different grade levels that all students can watch and study, and that teachers can then fine tune with their individual classes. 

I believe Mexico is trying that approach. 

New York may be one of the safest places in the country now, pandemic wise at least, but in other places it would be foolhardy to risk the lives of students and teachers in a quest for ""normality"".

We don't have a new normal yet, so we must be safe and creative."
2020-08-08 13:12:01,Notwithstanding the current struggles incorporating online instruction there may be some long term benefit to students as they improve their online learning skills (and students require training to be become effective and efficient online learners). Many of the employee training opportunities proved by major companies are online and self-paced. The better students become as online learners the more successful they are likely to be in accessing training opportunities during their work careers.
2020-08-08 13:19:26,"I completely agree that time has been wasted. Leaders are too afraid to tell parents the truth. Until we can reliably and easily test every student and staff member, we should not go back to buildings that facilitate the spreading of the virus. My district has provided direct instruction via Zoom that continues for some students during the summer. It was and continues to be successful for small groups of students, and in many respects, to lessen the time needed on managing attention and bodies on transitions every fifteen or so minutes from desk to rug to lining up to go here and there throughout the day. For the ELL students I teach, students actually got more specific language and reading practice without other distractions. I've even been able to develop more individualized bilingual lessons for students who need this. However, creating content and effective lessons with technology is much more time consuming than creating in-person lessons. Students also cannot and should not have their eyeballs glued to a screen for eight hours a day. Online for young students probably shouldn't be more than two-three hours a day up to grade five. Older students can probably do four or five hours a day, but expect eye strain. The warehousing function that schools serve is not available now. Schools can and should provide food and ideally the testing that will allow us to go back to school probably next spring."
2020-08-08 17:07:39,"As a public high school teacher who made the decision to retire early last month, I could have written this headline and subhead about my former district in the SF Bay Area. Administrators had this summer to learn from the mistakes they made in the precipitous transition to online learning last March, but they didn’t.

There’s a structural problem at work, which is that administrators had a BIG stake in seeing physical schools reopen because physical schools give them a place to continue their business-as-usual and, in many cases, to hide.

Will this be discovered by people outside the school system?

Online education doesn’t need administrators of the kind that run many of our districts: inexperienced in classroom instruction; professionally oriented towards learning the latest jargon and generating reports rather than supporting teachers and students; incapable of foresight and vision, and therefore, of leadership; overpaid and proliferating to the point of unaccountability."
2020-08-08 18:58:39,"Our district was all ready to return to school with a well planned hybrid model. Infection rates are low and local resident are diligent about mask wearing and social distancing.

2020-08-08 19:15:55,"I would have have to disagree to some extent with the context of this article from a personal standpoint as a middle school physical education teacher and team leader.  I have observed countless other educators spend a great deal of the summer preparing for virtual and hybrid teaching this fall. Since mid-July our public  school district has teams of teachers working on a Return to Learn Plan which would align with 3 different types of scenarios based on which phase our Governor had us in. I have been involved in Zoom and Google meets, multiple times per week with our encore group and my middle school colleagues. all of this has been without any additional pay or compensation. Through many of the social media outlets I use such as Twitter, LinkedIn and several Facebook PE groups, I have noted literally hundreds of educators working diligently to do something better, because they care. I feel that when kids are not able to return to school this fall, parents will be pleasantly surprised how much more prepared we are for this than we were in the spring and that if you give us a little more credit, some really great virtual learning is about to go down."

Shame on them.  We have a group of over educated superintendents that just do not have the skills to be leaders in these times.
2020-08-08 16:15:55,"The funny thing is: the New York Times led the charge in publishing articles obsessing on reopening schools, no matter what. This is the same thing they do after they back coups: they publish articles talking about how it actually didn't turn out so well - like in Bolivia. Also this article quotes several pro-charter front groups without identifying them as such. They're treated as independent experts. Of course it favorably reports on KIPP which is one of the worst charter chains there is. 

I've been saying this: a lot of districts wasted months deluding themselves into thinking they could reopen in person. If they started planning in May or June for distance learning, they could have spent that time making it as good as it possibly can be. And of course this article doesn't say one word about poverty and that's the reason some kids don't have access to internet at home and why they struggled on distance learning. The government should be supporting these families and giving them cash payments and providing free internet and computers. They need to be permanently lifted out of poverty. It's so strange to me, on limited budgets, schools are expected to provide all these things which are not its responsibility. Schools cannot solve poverty. We have decades of research which prove that."
2020-08-08 17:36:25,"I will be reading the whole article, but the title of this article is misleading; I spent my ENTIRE summer teaching summer school online and my admin for it spent since the closing of our schools in March to June working on policy, curriculum, special needs, schedules, and so much more in preparation for virtual learning every day. Maybe the title should include how little direction school leaders from the top did to steer conversations for reopening schools. Or maybe include something how this pandemic is highlighting the digital divide and inequities among our population. Not the title that it is now."
2020-08-08 18:14:13,"I agree with your title.  This has indeed been a ""Lost Summer."" But I have to say, you lost me a bit on the subtitle, ""How Schools Missed a Chance to Fix Remote Learning.""  

You seem to put the blame on the schools; implicated in that, of course, are teachers.  As a teacher with a pretty clear-eyed view of my limitations, I agree that teachers are imperfect beings and that online learning this past spring was a less than ideal experience for many of our students, particularly the most vulnerable.  And I agree our time could have been better spent this summer.

But if our time was indeed ""lost"", it was because teachers were wracked by anxiety, uncertainty, dishonesty, manipulation.  Not from our schools or our administrators, but from the highest level of government.  We were told children were ""almost immune"" to the virus, then told they were ""stoppers"" of the virus.  We were tweeted at regularly (i.e., ""Open the Schools!"").  

As we have watched in horror and panic as camp after camp--now school after school--have been unable to contain COVID outbreaks, is it any wonder that our summers were ""lost""? 

Believe me, almost any administrator or teacher would rather be back in schools this fall.  And everyone I know would rather be planning curriculum instead of wondering if they should shop for hospital-grade scrubs.  But when your very existence becomes nothing less than a political football, it is pretty darn hard to feel anything but ""lost."""
2020-08-08 02:04:46,"I work at a fancy private school and our full day of online classes got great reviews from students, parents, and admin. 

How were we rewarded? Parents making it super clear they'd like to risk teachers' health to get their kids out of the house. 

Even when one is in a setting with lots of resources, and online goes we well as it can, teachers are disrespected/treated as servants instead of professionals. I am seriously considering taking my Ivy league education to another profession. My eyes are wide open to hoe valued I am."
2020-08-08 05:04:08,"This has been an anxiety laden time for everyone, but teachers have been on the front lines of this pandemic.  Our initial feelings of apprehension at in-person learning have escalated into downright fear as virus numbers grew, misinformation ran rampant, and indoor bars prioritized over open classrooms. 

Instead of leadership from the top allaying fears and bringing coherence to a tragic situation, the federal government has alternately demonized teachers as indoctrinators and slackers-- while simultaneously praising us as economic engines and panaceas for societal ills.  This has sowed more chaos, distrust, and discord.

The teacher roller coaster of public opinion is not new.  But what's been forgotten in this debate is that we, too, are taxpayers and many of us parents.  We, too, know it is better when students are in school; we know it is hard to juggle work while helping your child learn a subject you don't really remember.  

We get it--we are you.

Believe me, we would have rather spent the summer learning, preparing, and accepting, that schools will be remote for awhile.  Instead, we have been manically reading about contact tracing, PPE, HVAC systems, and the latest lie spewed by Betsy DeVos.  As our school-based trauma training tells us, it is rather hard to learn when you are anxious. 

We well know the Back to School jitters; we get them every year, too.  But on the teacher martyrdom continuum, asking teachers to risk lives for Trump's lies is a bridge too far."
2020-08-08 16:08:54,"This needs to be said first: journalists need to stop citing studies on the school closure for a few obvious reasons. First, in such a short time how could a quality study be carried out? Secondly, beyond attendance records, the closures generated virtually no data. Most schools did not issue grades and there were no standardized tests this spring. In addition, while most districts falsely assumed that they would return to instruction before the end of the spring, attendance was not mandatory early in the closure and plans to compel attendance were only beginning to form.

To those who claim that 3 months of school closure led to great educational inequity based on class and race, I would say how could educational outcomes, based on those factors be significantly greater than they already were pre-closure? Our inequality in education mirrors all other inequities in our society. It was laid bare by the crisis, the crisis didn't create it.

To hear the media say now that schools should have been planning all summer to go virtual is infuriating, because all summer long, our parents have been reading articles from journalists who cited studies that convinced them that 1) their kids would be scared for life and would suffer life-long learning deficiencies if schools didn't reopen 2) Kids don't get the virus, so going to school is no threat.

Now that 1,000 people are dying a day the Times wished we'd planned for distance learning all along...Maybe stop advising and just report..."
2020-08-08 16:43:22,"I am a NYC public high school teacher and what astounds me is that administrators and the DOE just privately huddled over the summer to plan for the Fall without consulting a single teacher (on our staff, at least).  I find it mind-boggling that Admin and the DOE believes themselves to have a monopoly on good ideas when teachers on our staff, many with Masters degrees and a few with Phd’s, are quite intelligent and capable of creative thought.  

Riddle me this: if students travel in a small group from class to class, or a group remains in one room each day and teachers cycle through, how are the teachers being protected?  The kids will have minimal contact with kids outside their “pods” but the teachers, more susceptible to the virus, will see several pods in a single day no matter how you peel it.  And what happens when a teacher calls in sick and has to quarantine for 2 weeks? Who’s the sub going to be?  And if I need to make my first period class by 8am, what happens when the train is full and I can’t get on?  The days of cramming myself into a packed train are over.  And what about my classroom?  The windows were bolted shut ages ago and there’s no air filter system in the building, let alone an HVAC system that completely changes out the air a few times an hour, nor even a fan. Am I supposed to buy all of this equipment?  And what happens when a student refuses to wear her mask or does the thing where they pull it down so it’s it’s not covering the nose? Consequences?"
2020-08-08 02:33:09,"As a teacher, I made this exact argument in early July and wrote a piece with a number of innovative ideas to improve Remote Learning. In mid-July I emailed a number of NYTimes journalists asking them to please find a way to make this point and spread ideas for improving Remote Learning before it was too late. It seems the NYTimes wasn't interested then but is now.

2020-08-08 12:09:06,Replace “educators” with “politicians and administrators.” Don’t blame teachers.
2020-08-08 12:25:17,"The author needs to be replacing the word “educators” with “politicians and administrators.” she is blaming teachers in an article that should be pro-teacher. If the author had followed anything of what is happening in the country with teachers and teacher unions this summer (which her other articles suggest she has been), that would be enough to truly understand that teachers have not been spending all summer hoping to be back in the classroom. I have spent the past two months in writing and calling insisting that we focus on our online plan. I have spent the past months tutoring online while in four PDs totally 100 hours. My colleagues have been doing the same. 

Do. Not. Blame. Teachers. Blame politicians and administrators."
2020-08-07 11:21:20,Let us praise and encourage her new found voice. It will become stronger as she knows the degree to which she is supported by the public she serves. Save your ire for the vicious do-nothing Republicans who seek to undermine and destroy our republic by using this public health issue as a political wedge issue.
2020-08-07 11:19:46,Placating the ego of the president has been shown over and over as ineffective at getting him to do the right thing.  It just makes him less mean.  I think smart people would have realized this by now.
2020-08-07 11:27:33,"The premise of this article  is prima facie absurd
Anyone who actually believes for a moment that Tr-mp counts as an ally on ANYTHING is delusional"
2020-08-07 12:10:10,"Recent history would suggest that the responsible adults in the room with Donald Trump do not linger long.  They either weary of his erratic, unmanageable behavior and leave, or they are driven out for attempting to speak up.  It's a no-win situation, as Dr. Birx is experiencing firsthand.

What must she now think of the Faustian bargain she made with the president, offering up her integrity and humanity in exchange for access to power and the possibility of influence?  As with the others who sold out, it will likely take a revealing post-administration memoir for us to find out."
2020-08-07 12:18:53,"I was very supportive of Dr. Birx for a long time, even when she sat verbally silent but visibly screaming during the bleach and light treatment horror. Even when she criticized the CDC with blanket statements and no other explanation. Even when she stood next to Trump and nodded in agreement when he blamed Obama for leaving him a mess. But that is when I decided that something was wrong. I know what institutional politics is like, and it is miserable when people’s lives are at stake. But...if she wants to make a difference here, she will need to step out of the hunger games pit and lead. She is old enough to retire and volunteer her services in one of many institutions who would be happy to have her knowledge and experience. But her voice within the Trump admin is losing or has lost important credibility.   I feel I cannot trust her public statements because I no longer know if she is speaking out of her Trump mouthpiece or her own science-based. It has been painful to watch this happen. But, like Fauci, she has to decide how to decide what to do. I wish her well but I am saddened by...well...pretty much all of this."
2020-08-07 11:30:22,"She’s a political appointee.

That’s all you need to know.

Just like trump - she’s more interested in keeping her job than doing her job. 

Watch out for shifting winds."
2020-08-07 12:09:34,"She has sold her soul: “He’s been so attentive to the scientific literature and the details and the data. I think his ability to analyse and integrate data that comes out of his long history in business has really been a real benefit during these discussions about medical issues.”  She was lying to the public during a health calamity.  The only ethical response would be to rage quit at a microphone. 
The federal pandemic response has been a disaster.   Anyone associated with it will go down in history as complicit in murder."
2020-08-07 12:34:31,"To quote a line from a movie: Birx is “between a rock and the deep blue sea”. As a scientist, I am deeply disappointed at how the administration handled the pandemic. That also includes anyone from any of the government organizations that are supposed to provide a sane response to these types of problems. Their job was to have our backs, not make Trump and Pence feel good. Instead, Birx and others chose politics: their responses were often ambiguous and lacked courage. Only now are they showing a marginal amount of compassion for those of us who want the real story. Unfortunately, they took the path of least resistance and they will be remembered in history as the people who allowed this pandemic to get out of control."
2020-08-07 12:37:33,Dr. Birx is essentially a talented scientist physician who migrated to administrative positions that required coordinating the positions of both competitive and cooperating agencies. Sometime during the Obama era Dr Birx also accepted and carried out tasks that involved a large amount of public relation functions. She was and is a respecter of chain of command and did and does her best to present hope to the people she works for.
2020-08-07 12:27:17,"She’s in a tough spot with Trump. But she really blew it in April, putting too much faith in a model that predicted infections would go down. Problem was, her model assumed that everyone would follow the guidelines and wear masks, and that didn’t happen. Trump pushed Fauci aside in April because Birx was telling him what he wanted to hear, but Fauci was right and Birx was wrong."
2020-08-07 11:48:30,Why aren't these people wearing masks? She's supposed to be a leader of health. No mask shows her to be unreliable do as I say not what I do kind of leader.
2020-08-07 11:45:23,"A physician/adviser/spokesperson in Dr. Birx's position should know she can't be everything to everyone, plus feed her own ambition at the same time. You have to draw a line. It was obvious what Trump is and the impact his ignorance and malice would have, but Dr. Birx still chose the cuddly approach. Someone as intelligent as her should have understood the cost. She'll be viewed as a biased and untrustworthy scientist for the rest of her career."
2020-08-07 11:25:40,"None of this surprises me.  

I remember Birx's first day on the job, and how she gushed over how efficient the Trump administration was in setting her up with an office.  It was something to the effect of ""never in my professional life have things gone so smoothly in moving to a new office and getting a computer ...""  

I thought at the time that she must have asked Trump what he wanted her to say and he had written it down for her.  Greatest White House ever, etc.  

It's sad, really.  Medical professionals have lost their credibility, including the head of the CDC who goes all Nancy Reagan in Trump's presence, as they try to tiptoe around the president and his strange and dangerous ideas about the nation's health and a virus that is killing us by the thousands.  

Or the head of the FDA who assures us that the Trump administration would _never_ approve a vaccine that hasn't been thoroughly vetted, as if we would believe him either.

And when someone does consistently try to give good medical and public health advice, like Dr. Fauci, they are sidelined and effectively silenced.  

Americans really are on their own out here, watching our families, friends, and neighbors sicken and die needlessly from a disease that Trump did not cause, but one he could have controlled if he had been capable of good leadership.  And had provided the nation with sound medical advice from the beginning.  

Sadly, everything this Midas president touches seems to die."
2020-08-07 11:43:46,"I would think there are other professionals in government who had to remained silent when their boss decide to make a decision that they disagree with. If professionals in government resign their position because of leadership mistakes who would be left to offer sound advise ? Additionally, the  American people have a big role in ignoring the recommendations of the doctors and spreading this virus."
2020-08-07 12:44:38,"I have read all the comments that come before mine and noticed most are very negative and angry toward Dr. Birx.  They make some good points, such as illuminating her silence during Trump's science free diatribes, which makes its easy, and perhaps correct, to agree with them.  However, I should like to point out no one in this audience can get in her head or know what her goals are.  If her thoughts run along the line of 'its better to fight from the inside than the outside ' than she is accomplishing that goal.  If this is the case we can argue which is better: a) fight from the inside b) stand up to an obviously ill equipped president and point out his obviously incorrect statements."
2020-08-07 12:08:18,"I hope the follow up article is about the failings at the CDC and its leader, which have been epic."
2020-08-07 12:44:51,"Who made Mr. Gonsalves the arbiter of Birx's, or anyone's, integrity? What do we know about his? Based on his remarks in this article, I'm rather suspect. 

Now that Covid has replaced Russia as the Democrats #1 talking point, is it any wonder Birx is being attacked both by the White House and Speaker Pelosi? Fauci is playing the role of Mueller, and presumably Birx is playing Michael Cohen; while a host of academic entrepreneurs in the nation's largely incompetent public health establishment play Clapper and the intelligence community.

It's the same plot with a different script, including the same tidal wave of overheated rhetoric about our failed state democracy. As far as I'm concerned, I'd rather have Birx than Jared at the helm."
2020-08-07 12:28:19,Story buried the lede.  Fauci is a civil servant.  Trump can’t directly fire him.  Birx is a political appointee.   I’m sure her calculus is if she is pushed out she would only be replaced by someone less willing to privately push back.
2020-08-07 11:30:11,"I have no sympathy for Dr. Birx.

She could have, long ago, told the president behind closed doors that she could not, in good conscience, support his unhinged approach to Covid-19 pandemic.

She could have told him, before he suggested bleach and household cleaners, that these agents are killers, not healers.

She has gone out of her way to placate her boss. Dr. Anthony Fauci is the horse that broke down the fencing at the Trump Corral and bolted. His first steps of freedom may have been tentative, but he then took off at a gallop. Dr. Birx, by contrast, has mostly been an ornament at the press ""briefings"" that have become the three-ring circus that Barnum and Bailey would have ignored.

In these disastrous times, she could have played an heroic and informative role. She (presumably) doesn't need the money. She could have broken with the president and remained faithful to her true constituents--the American people--a demographic that seems to have no traction with the president. 

A doctor's first duty is to heal. Dr. Birx, by her timid silence, has harmed not only the nation she ""serves,"" but her professional reputation. Countless millions of small girls, who may have looked up to her as an authority figure for standing up for what is right and healthy and wholesome, now understand why their gender find so many doors locked to them: the cowardly withdrawal from rectitude because to challenge an angry man is simply unthinkable.

Dr. Birx let us all down, not just Trump."
2020-08-07 12:31:36,"Too passive! She lost me when she said that she didn't know young people would gather in groups, not socially distancing, when bars, restaurants,  etc. opened up."
2020-08-07 12:16:11,"Every person who stands next to Trump supports him and enables him just by being there.  

It’s way past the time to step away and speak up. This president has no intention to govern at all and he never has."
2020-08-07 12:01:33,"It bears repeating that she has to keep on top of all the coronavirus statistics and developments nationwide, and then advise on response and policy in 50 states with 50 different governors and covid protocols, all while dealing with Trump.

And then she gets to read about herself in the press to see how's she's doing with all that."
2020-08-07 12:28:21,"I was really surprised that Deborah Birx became so easily coopted by Trump, becoming fixating with pleasing him instead of doing her job.

It's a dangerous road when scientists accept the politicizationof science.  Dr. Birx may think she's just trying to survive to help  the American people, but if she thinks she's doing that by hiding the nature of this virus and its spread, she's wrong.  What's with all these secret calls to governors out of earshot of Donald Trump?

Dr. Fauci is the only one who walks that fine line between never lying about basic science because of his stature and his personality.  He can't be muzzled, because he's in such great demand.

I believe every scientist should speak truth to power or resign.  Dr. Birx, in my book, has been almost as dangerous as Trump in allowing this virus to spiral out of control."
2020-08-07 12:06:06,"Her body language is very bad. Dr. Birx has allowed herself to be used as a TV prop by Trump and Pence. Standing with them as they lie and distort facts about this grave crisis isn't what a terrified citizen expects from a health and medical professional. Her solo appearances on Sunday TV network news shows have been disasters. 
Double-talk and evasive answers come across as cover for her boss who has from day one, mismanaged and bungled the pandemic response.
If she's unhappy and has a bruised ego, perhaps she should seek a comfy position at Liberty University."
2020-08-07 11:58:38,"Imagine if Dr Birx had been working for Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden as president.  In my mind, there is no question she would have far higher regard from both sides than she does now."
2020-08-07 12:11:31,"When I watched the first Corona press conference, I was concerned about how Dr. Birx positioned herself as more loyal to trump than the American people. She will not go down as the woman who got the pandemic under control. She will go down as the woman who couldn't stand up to the president and therefore let his lies result in the deaths of Americans. She was complicit. The virus isn't under control.Americans are still dying at higher rates than in many third world countries. She can't get a national mask mandate for the president, the only thing she could do right now to redeem herself although I'm not sure even that would be enough to make up for the tens of thousands of preventable deaths she is responsible for — along with trump. Dr. Birx doesn't have the intestinal fortitude to stand up to the liar and con man that trump is."
2020-08-07 12:21:15,"I lost faith in Birx long ago.  

One day she spoke about an old female relative which had nothing to do with the onset of COVID.  It was so irrelevant and so removed from the seriousness of what was to come.  It really made me wonder.  She was up front in the days when Trump was promoting hydroxychloroquine.  She let him go to it. She smiled at little petty jokes of Trump’s when the ice cold semis were being loaded up with dead bodies.  

As a healthcare provider, an RN, who has worked with hundreds of families in hospital case management, for many years, my job has always been twofold - figure things out quickly based on facts and disease, and advocate for the patients and caregivers.  I felt that Birx did neither.  The charts and model talk just never cut it.  

And then Trump, who had a friend in Birx, one of the few, goes and cuts her down publicly.  Mike Pence stood by dumbfounded in his “leadership” - way over his realm.  

The mental sickness of Trump has just added fuel to the COVID fire.  Fauci is the only dependable trust.  The only one."
2020-08-07 11:51:36,"People can be so naive sometimes. If she doesn’t walk this tightrope with extreme care, she’ll be fired and unable to help at all. Fauci stood up to Trump and he’s out. Nobody can combat Trump’s lunacy while under him and remain there. Nobody. I feel sorry for her."
2020-08-07 12:32:36,"Even though Dr. Birx continues to serve at the pleasure of the president, I find Dr. Fauci's endorsement of her skillset, dedication and determination incredible.  For him to go on record and that “She’s one of the hardest workers, and she’s devoted to trying to get this pandemic under control"" says a lot about HIS character as well as hers.

Dr. Fauci's high praise of her is more meaningful and important than Trump's view of her being ""pathetic."""
2020-08-07 12:12:05,"Indeed, Trump is King Midas in reverse. But those who serve him must be aware that they will be tainted forever for their collaboration. There are no innocents here."
2020-08-07 12:45:38,"Once the rule is ""politics and spin over science and medicine"" I have trouble taking her seriously. And the CDC too for that matter."
2020-08-07 12:44:30,"Trump will fire her shortly . It will signal that she is to blame for the failed response. He’ll appoint someone else - it doesn’t matter - who we will never see or hear from. 

We’re on our own."
2020-08-07 12:53:22,Dr. Brix is simply in an impossible position and doing her best for her fractured nation.  Perhaps the fact that neither side is happy with her is a sign that she is actually doing her job well.  Reuniting of the nation requires compromise and the ability to work with both sides.  Good luck Dr. Brix.
2020-08-07 12:51:41,"Clearly her job is tough and she's walking a tight rope.  We should all thank her for what she has tried to do.  But we are past the point where's there's any doubt about what's gone wrong in the US response-- we don't have a coherent national strategy, even as it has become more and more clear what that strategy should be. If she starts making that point clearly and calmly in public and in private, she will bolster her credibility and might still make a difference.

A Voice from the Swamp"
2020-08-07 12:42:18,Trump and the Republicans have placed profits over people. Dr. Birx works for Trump. That says it all.
2020-08-07 12:49:11,"Just going to state the obvious, anyone who takes a job in the Trump Administration and wants to do a credible job is in a difficult position."
2020-08-07 12:32:30,"It is always difficult for civil servants if the boss doesn't act like a normal human being.
If Dr. Birx walks away from this mess nothing really changes for the better. She would be replaced with a sycophant.
If she stays her reputation goes to the bin.
There are no good options for her."
2020-08-07 11:44:28,"It’s the oldest story in the book. She thought she was making a deal with the devil, but instead she sold her soul."
2020-08-07 12:53:45,"When a learned credible person of science compromises their objectivity and even tacitly pays homage to dogma, they are relegated to the same rank as the blind and negligent."
2020-08-07 12:55:22,"Data (driven) Deb? No one can serve two masters. Either Dr. Birx is true to President Trump or true to science. Easy choice for a person with integrity, very hard for those who wobble."
2020-08-07 12:54:55,"Dr. Birx's dilemma  is that of being a hard-nosed data-driven scientist, on one hand, and a pleaser, on the other.  She will  need to make a firm decision as to where her priorities lie if she wishes to maintain her credibility.  It is all but impossible to be scrupulously honest with the public while simultaneously trying to placate an irrational boss.  So long as she tries to walk that tightrope, her reputation  will continue to erode."
2020-08-07 12:58:41,I will always baffled why any legitimate and well respected doctor/scientist would risk their career and reputation by even considering a position in Trump's world of science denial and debunk.
2020-08-07 12:57:01,I don't understand why she is being dragged through the mud and Fauci is being touted as a hero. I see only one difference here....
2020-08-07 12:59:17,"From the moment Dr. Birx stood behind Trump at the first task force meeting, I said she is a prop for Trump.  She is now trying to salvage her reputation, but she is too tainted by Trump.  Trump being Trump is now throwing her to the wolves.  And Dr. Birx is shocked. She sold her soul to the devil and there is no going back.  

Maybe it's time to take off the scarf and separate herself from Trump and his minions."
2020-08-07 13:03:52,Can you name any Trump political appointee doing a great job?  That she's an extremely well-qualified woman and in the crosshairs of just about everyone is no surprise.
2020-08-07 12:11:05,Unfortunately for Dr. Birx she is perceived as a trump apologist. She gave several interviews in which she tried to legitimize what trump was saying by rephrasing his nonsensical rants into something halfway intelligent. She wouldn’t publicly challenge the insanity pouring from the WH. She probably had her own good reasons-hoping that by not antagonizing trump she could gain some positive influence over him. She badly miscalculated trump’s psychopathy and is now paying for that.
2020-08-07 12:09:29,"Dr. Birx, Let's distill this down to essentials: Trump or Truth?"
2020-08-07 13:14:44,"Back in March I heard an interview with Dr Birx on NPR.  This was when governors & mayors were begging for help getting protective gear & tests, and Trump was saying that protective gear & tests were plentiful & available.  The interviewer pressed the doctor repeatedly on the issue, and she just kept dodging & repeating boilerplate about empowering the private sector to deal with the problem.  She was obviously more concerned with the president’s political interests than with the nation’s health."
2020-08-07 13:14:26,"Maybe she's decided to sacrifice her reputation to save lives.  Unfortunately, I don't think we will know the truth about her efficacy, or her altruism, until this emergency is in the past."
2020-08-07 13:16:49,"The heavy blasting of Dr. Birx is somewhat unfair. She is working under impossible conditions. She could have been less accommodating to Trump but as it is evident now that would have led to her dismissal early on. On her mind there was question of whether it would be more helpful to stay in than to move out. I don't believe for a minute that her decision to stay in was for personal reasons, with her credentials getting a position outside government is practically guaranteed. I think she overestimated her ability to influence this administrations response to the virus but I doubt that she would have made more of a difference if she very publicly confronted Trump. It would have made her more popular but even less influential. As it is, her recent candor makes it likely that she will not to be able keep her position much longer."
2020-08-07 13:12:27,"Given that that the Democrats, Republicans, media, and Trump are questioning and upset at some of things she is doing, it probably means she is striking a delicate balance between all the hyperbole, anger, outrage, and fear that is surrounding this situation.  Here in California, our failure to address this public health emergency is less from any “mistakes” from Dr. Birx and more a failings of state and local governments who for years have diverted resources away from health agencies."
2020-08-07 13:08:59,"I've questioned some of her past rosy statements, too, but very interested in the comment you quote where she told Pence to put on the mask.   Birx is not responsible for the mess from the White House.  And I have a new question about masks.  Obviously we need a mandate.  But what else should the US be doing?  New model says we save 70,000 lives wearing masks till 2021.  What about the other tens of thousands who will still die?  Masks are not enough.  We need to face lockdowns in some places and no doubt other strategies.  ""Wear a mask"" and ""wash your hands"" doesn't absolve our institutions from taking action."
2020-08-07 13:15:38,"Dr. Birx tried to parse her position, offering sound medical advice to the public but also stating that the president read everything and understood science well, assertions that were clearly absurd and likely made to gain a place on the president's good girl list. As a result, Dr. Birx has now learned what others have before her:  everybody that the president gets involved with is tainted in the process. She may have had a distinguished career but her sometimes groveling service to this monumental failure of a president has completely undermined her reputation. Nice scarves though!"
2020-08-07 13:18:44,Dr. Birx is yet another example of what happens to any man or woman who accepts a position in the Trump administration. The soul becomes compromised. There are always two questions that are necessary to ask ourselves concerning a Trump appointment. The first is what led Trump and his advisors to offer this position working for him. The second consideration is why this person accepted to begin with.
2020-08-07 13:10:41,"As a physician, the question arises. “What are your obligations to your patients, in this case the American public, if you’ve taken the Hippocratic oath”? Let’s get the obvious out of the way as stated in the article. Almost everyone’s reputation in Trump’s orbit gets tainted. 
  So, when must you preserve your integrity and speak truth to power at the risk of being fired or try to work quietly on the inside to effect change? I ask that of every member of the Task Force. Not an easy decision however neither is working.
  Dr. Fauci made an obvious statement. “ “IF” everyone in this country followed all the recommended guidelines, we could get control of the virus” in several weeks which I totally agree with. However, the caveat in Dr. Fauci’s statement is “IF”. Unfortunately there are still too many people ignoring the guidelines especially younger people. Therefore, in my opinion, unless there is a mandated nationwide lockdown with mask mandates, a massive push for increased  testing and tracing and lowering of the case positivity rate, not only will we not get the virus under control but the economy will continue to worsen."
2020-08-07 13:08:42,"What happened to the notion we should believe the scientists? She is a top scientist on the team. Apparently now one wants to listen to her? I think people are looking for perfection. In medicine, there is no perfection. That is why it is called ""practicing medicine"". You are a fool if you think everything will be perfect in a pandemic. We can go back to everyone's talks during the last 6 months and find opinions that are drastically different from the current reality. That does not mean that these people were not genuine at that time when they aired their opinion. This is what happens in a pandemic. If you compare to the original prediction of 2.2 million deaths, we are in pretty good shape. But that is not an argument we can make to the relatives and friends of the 155,000 who died - I know. But we are not being honest to ourselves. In the United States, around 3 million people die every year. Death is part of life. We forget this number when we get upset at 155,000 deaths. So we blame each other. We are all doing the best we can. Dr.Brix is a phenomenal person. She is doing her best. She may not be doing the way you think you would do. But if you were put in her position, most likely you would do the same thing she does today."
2020-08-07 13:15:14,"Like other Trump appointees who should have resigned in protest of his incompetence, she has preferred to hang on for dear life, apparently out of a combination of believing she can make a difference despite Trump and a burning opportunism to serve herself.

From the beginning she has contorted the general policy implications of her medical advice to conform to Trump’s ignorance and it should be no surprise she has lost credibility in all directions.

The support that a range of Governors show her in this article imply she has contributed some good work and is not all bad. But quietly sitting by while the President advocated that people ingest disinfectant sums up her most important impact in a nutshell."
2020-08-07 13:20:01,"The government and the nation as a whole should have been consistent with a clear message, buttressed by clever phrasing: When you breath out, you could be infecting others; when you breathe in, you could be infecting yourself. Be safe; stay safe. Protect yourself and others."
2020-08-07 13:16:35,"When you work for trump - no matter your discipline or expertise - your career and reputation decline.

trump is the universal catabolic force."
2020-08-07 13:21:49,"“Old allies and public health experts have expressed disgust at her [Dr. Birx’s] accommodations to Mr. Trump and, more so, at the performance of the federal response she is supposed to be leading against the most devastating public health crisis in a century.”

By making accommodations to Trump, Dr. Birx has been part of the problem and not part of the solution. 

She’s part of the problem because she has identified herself so much with Trump.  And Trump is the main cause of the Covid 19 problem, the most devastating problem in a century!"
2020-08-07 13:09:02,"That's so funny: the expression ""attentive to the scientific literature"" is fully outside the spehere of Trump's being. He's not attentive, he has no idea what science is, and literature, I know that in the expression ""scientific literature"" literature means just ""texts,"" but there ought to be a law against uttering the word ""literature"" with respect to the sack in the White House."
2020-08-07 13:25:25,"It is simply fascinating to watch accomplished people in all sorts of careers destroy their reputations by caving to the allure of fame, particularly of the tv persuasion. I expect that in a politician, they are for the most part so vain to begin with, but I would have thought that an infectious disease expert like Dr. Birx, who has spent her entire life  studying and fighting off pandemics to have a bit  more moral fiber and not say  things to simply appease Trump and to put the health of the general public above all other personal issues. I have lost all respect for her."
2020-08-07 13:27:58,"Good heavens, what did she expect. You lay down with dogs with fleas and you also get them. She bought the t-Rump line and sold her soul. I don't feel sorry for her. Fauci is the only one who hasn't bought the party line. He is not for sale."
2020-08-07 13:35:26,"Dr. Birx lost all credibility on the day she sat unresponsive during the infamous Trump attempt to solve the epidemic by injecting bleach into infected people's lungs.
If you condone - by your inaction an ignorant and frankly insane proposition like that, you are no longer anything but a protector of anti-science and ignorance."
2020-08-07 13:39:56,"Trump will drive Brix out s he has done to everyone else in this feckless administration that has darted to tell the truth. His hand-picked ""good on TV scarf doc"" is showing up his lies, and he hates this. SHE is working for the American people, trying to protect them; HE is not working for anyone but himself and is desperate to cover up his abject ignorance and incompetence and TREASON.

Nothing more need be said - the FACTS are obvious and undeniable. There are no legitimate adults left in the White House day care center, only a disparate, lying group of traitors committed to deceiving and bilking America.

DO SOMETHING!"
2020-08-07 14:25:07,"Dr. Birx is a mealy-mouthed citizen who, unlike Dr. Fauci, got really excited about being on stage with the president. She liked being on camera, being serious, being influential. 

When she didn't stand up to trump on 'disinfectant day', but just wormed her mealy mouth around in shame, that was the day I started calling her 'Dr. Scarf Lady'.

The Betsy DeVos (without the money) of COVID."
2020-08-07 14:29:17,"I don't think Trump called her pathetic, I think Trump called what she did pathetic.

To be clear, he is the pathetic one a thousand times over. But it is a stretch of journalism to state as fact something that could easily be taken another way."
2020-08-07 14:35:05,I wish the Times would put dates on pictures.  Hard to tell when these things happened.
2020-08-07 12:18:38,"The president's non-medical advisors are dead wrong. Literally they have been dead wrong. More than 150,000 times dead wrong. 

The president is ignoring this basic fact: ""It's Quell the Virus, Stupid!""  Effectively lead that effort with a short term draconian national strategy and lockdown focused on masking, social distancing, testing, tracing, quarantining and treating, and the economy can begin to recover and the schools safely open. 

Mr. President, anything less personally led by you virtually guarantees  more needless deaths of Americans, many of them your supporters. Make no mistake, those deaths will be on you. 

We're begging you: listen to Doctors Fauci, Birk, and Redfield, change course, and don't look back."
2020-08-07 11:48:24,"So long as what she says is the truth, she can't go wrong.

Anyone working in this white house has a tough job working for the greatest liar going."
2020-08-07 11:52:37,"She's tried to appease both sides of the street. While it's understandable that she cannot elbow trumpy off the podium when he spews out nonsense, she's also been saying different things to different people. Perhaps, she's alone in a difficult spot, especially when Fauci (the man) has been knocked off the dais. Rushing to defend her simply because she's a 'woman' is absurd. Perhaps, she's retained her job simply because she's a woman."
2020-08-07 12:59:15,"First, Kudos to Dr. Birx for her toughness in dealing with the pandemic and the stupidity which the Trump White is noted for.
More frightening is the thought is who will take her place, Vankie or Jared maybe Kelly Ann Conway. Now there is a thought Conway can wear her Minute Man getup to the briefings!"
2020-08-07 13:48:07,"As the old saying goes ""When one sups with the devil one best use a long spoon.""

I think both Fauci and Birx stuck with their jobs because they thought they could do a better job for the American public than whatever labradoodle breeder Trump would have replaced them with.

But I think Fauci has played his hand better than Birx and will come out of this less tarnished."
2020-08-07 12:31:17,"Sadly, despite her well-respected career, Birx will be remembered as an asterisk along the lines of ""Debbie, you're doing a heckuva job."""
2020-08-07 14:33:18,"In the old Peanuts comic strip, there was a character called Pigpen, who was surrounded by a cloud of dust and dirt. The president is like a modern-day Pigpen, giving off a cloud of filth and stench that eventually dirties anyone who gets close to him. The likes of Mark Meadows and Bill Barr don't seem to mind.  Fauci has wisely kept a distance. Birx has sacrificed her reputation, it seems, to stay within the orbit of offal."
2020-08-07 11:28:52,"“Do no harm.”

It’s that simple.

When you are the so-called expert in the room standing next to a carnival barker spewing conspiracy theories about injecting yourself with bleach and you remain silent, you are doing harm. Grave harm.

I am glad the governors of America have been aided by Dr. Birx behind closed doors. But from where I am standing, when she seems forced to choose between placating The Mad King and forcibly defending science, she chooses the former time and time again."
2020-08-07 11:43:21,"Appointed to her position by the administration, with an office in the West Wing, it was clear from the start that Dr. Birx was just another toady of the president. Either you toe his line or are soon thrown under the bus."
2020-08-07 11:47:59,Simple question to ask Dr Birx that will justify her competence.  Does HIV cause AIDS??
2020-08-07 12:14:20,"She and other experts can also quit being lap dogs that get abused daily by their owner and launch a full on public media attack against this administration and drown it in its own tub of lies and misinformation.

Would you put up with that nonsense from an employer? I know I wouldn’t. 

Somebody needs to put a stop to this nonsense. There is no changing Trump and his WH from the inside or any other method."
2020-08-07 12:56:09,Dr. Birx’s critics may want to ask who would replace her if she’s removed?  This administration thrives on removing the most competent. Deborah Birx is not the problem.
2020-08-07 11:42:13,"Why am I not surprised that she has behaved no differently than Fauci, Pence and a good many other men and is now deemed ""pathetic"" by our president and is being roasted by public opinion."
2020-08-07 12:07:54,"Dr. Deborah L. Birx has a very tough job .

Donald trump has no loyalty towards anyone, we see how soon he gets rid of his people until they start saying "" yes sir"". 
That is a dangerous game trump and his peons play.

Dr. Birk is no exception, her initial mild response playing along with trump was so wrong when the Country was going through such critical times.

Presidents come and go but Dr. Birk need to be true to science, just like Dr. Fauci, who refused to play trunp`s game."
2020-08-07 13:13:03,If Dr. Birx wants to try to help this country she needs to stop fussing around with being diplomatic about Trump’s ignorant claims and falsehoods. She needs to get the truth out there in a blaze of glory before she loses her pulpit.
2020-08-07 11:27:38,"In April, Dr. Birx stated that is was just fine that the moronic Georgia governor opened massage parlors, barbers and tattoo studios, as long as they maintain a safe 6 foot social distance while performing their services.  That was the moment when she lost all reasonable, non- trumpcult members forever.  It's a permanent stain on her reputation and she will never get it back."
2020-08-07 12:09:07,"Anyone who works with this toxic man and thinks that ""my relationship with him is different"" (I'm looking at you, Ivanka) isn't thinking clearly.

If they all understood how quickly or easily they can be tossed out with the garbage, perhaps they would stop fooling themselves and  ditch this guy."
2020-08-07 12:44:32,"You either lie for Trump or you get burned. That is the model. It is personal loyalty to him, not service to the people to whom you took an oath.

2020-08-07 12:54:56,"This is “leadership” under “boy bankruptcy”; 

What makes her particularly disappointing, unlike Barr for example, is that she seems like a better and more knowledgeable person, but she’s in a place of fear with Trump and now has lost credibility.

But unlike Fauci, who has finally rejected Trump and his lies, she tried to soften the madness with a smile and positive words,  That is where she got into trouble because she could never do enough to cover for her derelict boss,"
2020-08-07 11:59:22,"To be somewhat fair to Dr. Birx, very few have lived long in the Trump administration unless they acquiesce to his crazy statements and foolish ego-serving behaviors.  Even now the blatherer-in-chief calls her ""pathetic"" as she tries to get him and Pence to take it seriously.  

One has to ask what she would have said and done in a white house run by an adult who respected experts.  

One might also ask if anyone else could have done any better under this so-called leadership."

2020-08-07 11:17:21,"If Birx would ""step in"" and ""call out"" and ""not cover"" for Trump she would be more respected. She should have immediately set him straight on using bleach for the virus, in public. She should had never lied to us about admiring Trump reading and absorbing everything on the virus. And she should immediately tell America when he is dead wrong on things, like hydroxoqunine and the virus will ""go away"" and he has rated his response as a ""ten"". Otherwise all her appearances just look like she's trying not to get unemployed."
2020-08-07 11:59:54,"We’ve heard that DRs. Birx  and Fauci have stayed on and tried to placate and guide Trump from the inside. That reminds of similar talk at the beginning of Trump’s presidency: that the adults in the room, the wiser heads would control him, rein him in.  That doesn’t seem to have worked ever in Trump’s entire life.

He believes that he’s the smartest person in the room, no matter what the subject. It’s beyond his conception that he might be the dumbest person in the room."
2020-08-07 13:20:26,"My question is this: Why are so many people afraid of Trump? Is it his temper tantrums, his Twitter feed, his vindictive anger?  After watching for almost 4 years this maniac’s revolving door of an administration, why would ANYONE ... and I mean ANYONE want to work for him, much less stand behind him nodding approval and being used by him, ground into dust beneath his well-shod bone spur heels? Just taking a job within this administration signals you are willing to do whatever he requires ... making a deal with the devil. As far as Dr. Brix is concerned, she should have seen it coming ... the fact that she has been thrown under the bus as pathetic ... and will be blamed by this monster for Trump’s response to this pandememic.

That, though, is a fool's errand as Trump is a toxic narcissist who demands loyalty and the spotlight independent of facts or science."
2020-08-07 13:47:14,"Birx, in a foolish and naive strategy, attempted to “split the baby”, simultaneously remaining objectively “scientific” and devotedly “Trump-pleasing”, only inevitably ending up with a deeply damaged reputation. Apparently, she grossly failed to absorb the tragic, public fates of many disgraced former Administration employees who thought that they could both preserve their integrity, objectivity, and professional statuses while loyally serving the authoritarian, narcissistic, sociopathic Trump. So intelligent yet so incredibly blind to the human wreckage that preceded her, flashing complete avoidance of this amoral man at all costs."
2020-08-07 11:50:49,Haven't people learned by now that to get in bed with Trump means you will never recover your good reputation?  The dirt clings to you forever. Dr. Birx means well but she has made a fateful error. Perhaps this is the Peter Principle at work.

Thus the problem with many appointees, particularly those appointed by Donny Trump.
They report to the president, but, serve the country and people.

But, the President* must be kept pleased, his fragile ego stroked and one should never correct him regardless of how blatant the lie is.

Dr. Birx possibly has credentials that would bring much to the table and she should never have waffled in stating the science regardless of Trump’s lack of understanding basic science or listening to the scientists.

Trump and his merry band of court jesters possibly cause many to die needlessly, and contrary to what he, Trump, would have us believe, our country is in dire straits with covid-19.

Trump is, and always has been, on a path of destruction of America's altruistic and noble values, aided and abetted by too many self-serving politicians and others who were deluded into thinking they could make him do what they thought they could somehow persuade him to do. Dr Birx is just one more casualty of Donald Trump's evil trajectory."

If you are being asked or forced to betray your duties, resign, go public, get another job, or retire.   There are many options open to her and others.

This is how you take the bully's power from him.  Now she has been left in no-mans land.  For what?  Trump?  He use people like disposable rags and then tosses them aside.  He just threw her away, like so many others."

She repeatedly stated that the CDC’s numbers were too high, when literally everyone knew they were grossly underreported! Often deliberately (looking at you DeSantos & Kemp).

Birx and Kushner then followed up that outrageous breach by championing outsourcing Coronavirus data to a private agency to the tune of 10.5 million dollars!

Surprise, surprise! That contract went to Trump crony and GOP donor Zamagios!! ok no surprise

Hospitals were given no notice when this change went into effect. The desired result (chaos/data loss) was immediate.

The long term consequences... Trump’s crony, with a deliberate assist by Birx, will permanently and irrevocably scrub and corrupt the data (and get an enormous personal info dump for gratis). what did they promise you deb

This miserable excuse for a public health official has much to answer for... I sincerely hope she does."

What IS pathetic is his horrific denial of this virus from the very beginning. His decisions and actions have done nothing but made this entire pandemic worse for the entire country. 

I was never a fan of Dr. Birx because she did seem to placate towards the wishes of the president. But I was also never a fan of publicly humiliating nor chastising a subordinate. 

If Trump has issues with anyone on his staff, discussing, even ranting about them behind closed doors is the appropriate and professional way in which to handle things. 

This kind of Trump treatment has been known and witnessed by countless others for almost 4 years. Why anyone still remains loyal to him now or even in the future is beyond me.

2020-08-07 12:13:43,"Dr. Birx has a difficult job. As per the article, ""Everybody who is in his (Trump's) orbit, if they’ve had any integrity, it gets leeched away from them like some parasite.” On one side there is the unprincipled president doing his best to gain reelection by opening everything before the pandemic subsides. On the other there is Birx trying to get Trump to see reason and failing. It's a tough job."
2020-08-07 12:39:25,"I think the article and comments are unfairly harsh. When the president was talking about bleach and made a comment to her on the side of the stage she didn’t concur or agree or shake her head in approval. The whole thing played out as it should, Trump was lambasted and ridiculed worldwide."

2020-08-07 13:27:46,"Everything and everyone that The Donald touches becomes a failure,  a laughing stock,  or is in someway diminished and eventually cast aside.

Some people say that The Donald has shown no leadership in this crisis.   That implies that he has done nothing.

The truth is that every turn The Donald has worked to undermine and hinder the people who  are trying to  deal with the virus.    Watch him,  he is actively working to foul up and disrupt the response.

Most people agree that wearing masks in public would help fight the virus.    But The Donald has made masks a political issue.    If he had simply put on a mask and worn it for a day or two,  then all of his followers would wear them.

He has done the same with many other issues.

Does Dr. Birx hang on to  help fight the virus or does she save her reputation?   Is it too late to save her reputation?

Anyone who thinks that they can work with The Donald and maintain any integrity and self-respect is delusional.
Is Dr. Fauci the exception?"
2020-08-07 13:27:56,"Dr. Bix illustrates that old pesky conundrum; staying in a position of influence in order to do the job/good one intended and intends to do and compromising in order to remain in that position.  If she had quit or quits she reduces her potential influence.  To stay she has to navigate Trump's idiocy.  In the end, it all comes down to how much good done in exchange for how much compromise or damage.  Trump, himself, is undeniably responsible for a minimum of half the deaths and economic damage done thus far during this pandemic.  The numbers prove this without need for discussion.  Without Faucet and Bix would the damage have been worse?  Given the statements made by Trump during these past six months, one cannot deny that the death toll would probably be higher and the economic impact far worse without those doctors and scientists that chose to remain in the conditions that existed and exist next to this disgrace of a President."
2020-08-07 11:53:06,"At some point, personal pride and strong ethics  must overcome one's desire to hold onto a job. She, and thousands of others in government, should have stormed away in loud and righteous protest when Trump was ""elected"". Making a pact with Satan rarely ends well."
2020-08-07 13:34:17,"This is classic example of writing a glass-half-empty rather than a glass-half-full story. Anyone following the news is aware that Birx has been attacked by an increasingly nasty Nancy Pelosi and run over by the bus that is Donald Trump. What was new was that governors of all stripes were praising her for helping them make difficult choices. Why not lead story with that, which is arguably a more accurate assessment of her performance?"
2020-08-07 13:57:45,"Yeah, Dr. Birx is persistent  and present at the side of Trump enabling him to under cut the true seriousness of the COVID-19, nodding her head in agreement to the lies Trump puts out on COVID-19 and generally painting a much rosier picture than what it is, similar to Trump. You are not a scientist if you do not follow science which Dr. Birx conveniently chose to ignore for 15 minutes of fame (and fortune)."
2020-08-07 12:14:31,"Birx = good cop and Fauci = bad cop, until Fauci was sidelined.

From the start of the pandemic, Anthony Fauci was the truth-teller.  Although he studiously avoided saying that Trump was wrong, by telling the truth, he often contradicted the liar-in-chief.  Deborah Birx could play the good cop, frustrating many observers by not calling out Trump's distortions and lies.

With Fauci pushed into the background, there was no truth teller.  That's a crucial job and, since no one was doing it, Birx could no longer play the good cop and had to become our source of scientific information.

Trump likes happy talk that suits his political interests.  He thought that he'd solved his science problem by sidelining Fauci but he didn't anticipate that Birx would take that role.

Now Trump is giving the COVID-19 briefings on his own, even though he has zero scientific qualifications, but at least the media is seeking out comments from Fauci and Birx."
2020-08-07 12:19:05,What she will be most remembered for sad to say is her expression while Trump was asking her if she had looked into injecting disinfects and maybe UV light inside the body. That is burned into my memory.

The fact that the Times portrays Dr. Birx to be standing alone in this article has inherent sexist undertones, and I am worried by the insinuation that Dr. Birx is the problem because she is not openly contradicting this president while voices like Peter Navarro’s peddle deadly fake news, and officials like the governor of Mississippi (whom this article makes a hero because he was one of the last governors to issue a mask order) and other governors and senators, have been beyond hostile to efforts designs to save lives. 

An fair criticism would have examined her efforts more, and speculated on her perceived failures with greater accuracy."
2020-08-07 14:04:36,"“If she has to praise the president to get him to do the right thing, I can live with that,’” Dr. Jha said. 

Well I can’t. And I am not willing to try. It doesn’t even work anyway!"
2020-08-07 12:24:53,"Why does this article linger on the front page of the digital edition?  Dr. Birx is just another ineffective talking head playing irrelevant court politics for a corrupt king.  Perhaps she did manage to eke out minuscule measures of progress as a result of her pandering to Trump, but the sum effect is the same.  The U.S. is a hot mess.  She and her team have failed U.S. citizens.  She does not deserve to be considered a leader in public health."
2020-08-07 13:23:57,Dr. Birx lost any credibility she had when she sat poker-faced as Donald Trump suggested the use of disinfectants to fight Coronavirus. Not exactly a profile in courage. She just wanted to keep her position.
2020-08-07 13:32:32,"This was the biggest test of her career. She may have done many things well, but the ways she got it wrong over rode them in my opinion.  What her specific weaknesses were, are ultimately hers to evaluate. I suspect it had something to do with fear, and a lack of inner strength in advocating on the side of the science or truly, strongky taking a stand when it mattered, early on,  when her political colleagues had a different agenda. Whatever her errors they were profound, because they involved her integrity. I suspect she knows it. And yes, whatever Trump touches does indeed die, as we saw here."
2020-08-07 14:23:13,"Birx makes the same mistake as General Mattis and General Kelly, both of whom were members of Trump's cabinet. Both men were silent, neither man put their allegiance to country over their purported respect for the office of president. Birx has been inside the White House long enough to have heard the most imbecilic comments from Trump and witnessed the most inane policies ever foisted on the American public. America is dead last compared to the rest of the developed world with its handling of this crisis. Birx should provide the reasons for that failure so we can remove Trump from office via the 25th amendment, impeachment, or public acclaim demanding resignation. Birx should be out there on a daily basis disclosing the insanity we suffer. It's called Duty, something everyone who swears an oath understands and that includes the Hippocratic Oath."
2020-08-07 12:04:56,"While I am not fond of anyone who chooses to work for this monster, Dr. Birx occupies a vital job. 

Perhaps she and other similar people caught in the middle are more professional than I am. I would’ve long ago snapped and screamed at the man during a public event. I would’ve said how pathetic he is in his denial of science, his tantrums, his putting his ego ahead of the public good and, indeed, the lives of others.

Someone close to him just needs to scream at this point about that beast, so it will go viral and help defeat this evil creature who has been wrecking our country since early 2017."
2020-08-07 13:49:57,"The shame is that doctors are caught in the crossfire between the Democrats and Trump.  To say anything that is perceived as overly accommodating to the other side, or that does not follow the narrative one side wishes portrayed, is to get hit, often hard.  And to say something that seeks to be diplomatic or middle-of-the road, well, it reminds me of the Civil War soldier who, hoping to avoid getting shot, put on a pair of Union pants and a Confederate jacket.  He got shot at by both sides!

Dr. Birx has tried, I think, to be honest and fair, but without ruffling too many feathers.  Dr. Fauci, another very good leader, has more or less come down, I think, on the anti-Trump side--perhaps because he figured if Trump was going to slap at him anyway, then in for a penny, in for a pound.

I noticed how Dr. Fauci did everything in his power to NOT say that the protesters should not gather together due to COVID-19 concerns.  I lost some respect for him after that.  

The result is that even the doctors are becoming politicized in this matter.  Dr. Birx, trying to NOT be political, is getting hit for that.  Fauci, apparently not caring whether Trump has anything negative to say about him or not, is seemingly offering a pass to protesters, while the other side of his mouth is letting us know we shouldn't be in large crowds.

I voted for Trump, but if he were a young man, I fear that I'd have to challenge him to a wrestling match for being so unnecessarily ungracious and buffoonish."

2020-08-07 14:19:44,"Dr. Birx should be commended for her expertise as an infectious disease specialist and her dogged resilience in working for the present administration; however, I was appalled when she remained silent while President Trump ranted on about treatments involving disinfectants and ultraviolet light to combat the virus. Sure it was a difficult position to watch him from the sidelines, but it was disappointing to not hear a rebuttal from Dr. Birx for such absurdities."
2020-08-07 14:28:58,"She stood behind Trump when he was prescribing ""medicine"" for the virus. People died. 

Any honorable person would have resigned."
2020-08-07 13:32:45,"The problem is not Dr. Birx.  It is President Trump.

With an increasingly erratic boss, like Trump, knowing which battles to fight and which to leave for another day is essential.

Dr. Fauci has been adept at not only choosing his battles but determining best how to wage them.  Dr. Birx is less adept.  But this is a but a sideshow to the real issue.

Perhaps the pivotal national moment for Dr. Birx and  for the news media was when she sat idly by as Trump proposed the dangerous notion of ingesting disinfectant.  Of course, the WH Press Corps didn’t think to ask Dr. Birx for her opinion on ingesting bleach.   But she didn’t rise to the occasion, either.

The focus, of course, should not be on Dr. Birx.  She is a bit player in Trump’s sound and fury. He uses her as a stage prop, nothing more, nothing less.  That her moral compass may be awry is not the story.  The story is that Trump and his own medical experts are often contradicting each other.

The question the news media should be asking Trump at every briefing is whether Americans should follow the advice of the  government medical experts or him.  Until the news media stops giving Trump a forum for spreading dangerous medical misinformation, the country will continue to struggle with mixed messages in the middle of a Pandemic."
2020-08-07 13:31:57,"She may be “data driven” but she misinterpreted the data and the US response has been an epic fail. She’s lost all credibility, the American people are confused and everyone does whatever they want while the virus continues to run rampant after six months. While all of this is not her fault, she’s a vital cog in this dysfunctional wheel and she needs to go long with the rest of the Trump administration if we are have any hope of ever returning to any semblance of normal life."
2020-08-07 14:02:46,"I suggest only this: judge her not by opinions, but by the consequences of her actions.

Also, what is going on with those scarves?"
2020-08-07 14:19:33,Birx lost the confidence of those in this country that can actually think. She sold herself to be a mouthpiece for Trump and now she wants to reverse course.  Too late. The damage is done. She made her bed and now she'll have to sleep in it.
2020-08-07 14:31:24,"Even though Birx seems to have finally found a conscience lurking underneath those scarves, she sold her soul to Trump months ago and the nation suffers in large part because she chose Trump over truth.  She can't redeem herself now."
2020-08-07 13:50:44,"I am not pleased with much of Dr. Birx’s performance, yet I am glad that she has decided to stay in the position. Why? Because of what we have seen in other sectors of the Trump administration. Just as at State, Defense, and Homeland Security, Trump would go through several acting heads of departments until he found a lackey who would do his bidding without even the possibility of devising credible and effective measures in the day-to-day administration of their departments. Whether competent people stay or go, there is no good solution to the situation in which we find ourselves. Well, there is one, but it’s still 89 days away."
2020-08-07 13:31:05,While Birx blundered badly by relying on models to predict a decline in the virus attacks by Democrats are counterproductive.  We are still learning many things about the virus and experts have been wrong on a number of issues.  That does not mean their motives are suspect or that they have a political agenda.  The Republicans have done enormous damage that has caused tens of thousands of lives by attacking experts.  The Democrats do not need to pile on and further erode credibility of experts because they made mistakes.
2020-08-07 14:05:34,"By all reports Dr. Birx is dedicated, intelligent and highly competent.  Her failing, however, is wanting to be reappointed to her Executive Branch position as Global AIDS Ambassador.  While political positions do involve a degree of politics, she was in a position to decide what was more important - the political or the medical/scientific aspects.  In trying to balance both, she has short-changed each and facilitated the harm to the health of all Americans caused by trump's mismanagement of the pandemic.  In my opinion, no job is so important to lose one's integrity over.  She should have had enough confidence in her abilities and competence to realize that there are other non-governmental organizations that would welcome her expertise if she were fired from her governmental position.  Quoting the aged knight protecting the Holy Grail in 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade', she ""chose poorly'!"
2020-08-07 11:08:46,"I don’t doubt that Dr. Birx is a dedicated hard working doctor and has to work for an incompetent self serving president, but either she agrees with Dr. Fauci or she doesn’t. I fault her for not publicly supporting him if her decisions are truly data driven. She has publicly stood back while Trump and his administration have publicly and privately besmirched Dr. Fauci’s remarks and his reputation while offering no better responses to this pandemic. 
Dr. Birx has to make a decision. Is her presidential appointment more important to her than serving the public or does she follow the science and tell the public what it needs to know even if it costs her job? She has s good reputation in the infectious disease study and treatment, so it’s not like she can’t get a job outside of the Trump administration if she wants one, but she has to decide is politics more important than science. Thousands of lives hang in the balance of how she handles Trump and his dangerous incompetence."
2020-08-07 11:41:54,"Anyone who understands organizational politics knows what Dr. Birx is going through. She has to serve many masters and work through many competing priorities. She cannot dictate, or overrule, or publicly battle. Her focus has been on keeping the train on the tracks and moving in the right direction, leading through conflict, all while in the public eye. In that light, she has done quite well."
2020-08-07 12:20:27,"Blaming Dr. Birx for not calling out her boss, President Trump, on political or science points is very unfair. She's quite capable in her position and has been doing an excellent job in a most demanding situation. Give her all the credit."
2020-08-07 11:55:09,"Dr. Birx  is a capable scientist and should be admired for persisting in trying to ameliorate the effects of the Covid pandemic. However she must have a bit of a masochistic streak to keep putting up with incompetent leadership at the national and state levels. That is further compounded by the American public, which really is not concerned enough with its own welfare  and that of the country to hold its leadership's ( a term I use with tongue in cheek) feet to the fire The public's motto is self gratification at all costs.

Give her an A for achieving what ever amount she has in the face of such adversity."

2020-08-07 15:04:03,"Dr Birx is in an uncomfortable position. She sees both the science and the effects on a population that has stalled in a state of fear. 
She and Fauci lost popularity over their original comments on masks. We in the healthcare community knew from day one that we all needed to wear face coverings. That was a given.  Yet she stood there explaining in some ridiculous fashion why masks could be a bad idea. Really??
I think it’s fine to hear scientists and medical professionals talk about this disease but the problem is they don’t agree. There are renowned experts from Stanford, Harvard etc who have disagreed from day one. 
And still, you all want to blame Trump. He’s relying on their recommendations! And he has the economy to consider. I think no one could have done it better. No one had any more insights. He rushed to get corporate America to make PPEs, he built hospitals, he mobilized government medical workers. Many governors didn’t even take advantage of what he supplied and yet they are considered the saviors. The media has continued to talk about the stupid issues, the politics like this article about Dr Birx. Really grow up and present Facts!"
2020-08-07 15:21:34,"Everything Trump touches dies, including (and especially) professional reputation and integrity. Birx showed her true colors in the CBN interview, it was totally unsolicited and set the tone for her ignoring his many obvious lies and misinformation about the virus. She is tainted and needs to step aside and allow real medical leadership to take the helm."
2020-08-07 15:25:07,"Dr. Birx should have thrown up in public when Trump mentioned disinfectant injections and ingestions. It's okay for soldiers, which she was, to show fear and revulsion.  I have since cauterized Dr. Birx from my consciousness."

2020-08-07 14:50:18,"How wonderful to live in a black and white world where every choice is obvious, where there is no complexity or ambiguity, where no one makes mistakes or reverses course and where the perfect is not the enemy of the good.  That is not the world that women ""in the arena,"" who have to solve problems and make compromises live in.  It's not the world adults live in.  It's not the world Dr. Birx lives in.  But it does seem to be the world that most NYT readers live in."
2020-08-07 15:32:33,"The expression on Dr. Birx's face in the accompanying photo seems to say it all.  It's almost as if she is thinking ""Are you serious?  What the heck are you talking about?""  I cannot help but think she is looking directly at the president.

I see Dr. Birx has having only two choices to make - either stand up to Trump and continue to tell the truth of what the facts really are rather than Trump's treated view of how he insists the story must be told (deceiving the public in other words) or she can resign from her appointment and hope she can regain and/or restore her credibility within the medical field and family.

No doubt she is extremely intelligent and sharp.  Perhaps she thought she could change Trump's perspective regarding how serious and deadly this virus is.  Only she knows what her inner motives were, but in the end, she is finally feeling the full brunt of the Trump treatment by his rude, unprofessional and sarcastic nature.

I don't feel bad for her.  I am merely puzzled by her motives in taking that appointment in the first place.

What WAS she thinking?"
2020-08-07 15:30:13,"We haven't seen much of either Dr. Birx OR Dr. Fauci this week.  An ill-educated snake-oil salesman who does not trust science and data should not be speaking at the Coronavirus Task Force ""briefings."""
2020-08-07 14:35:59,"It is disturbing to read the judgements of the critics of Dr. Brix, many of which are negative, depicting the doctor as a sycophant.  In watching the White House briefings on the pandemic, I found myself  reaching an emotional judgement of the doctor as being a ""prop"" for the administration, appearing silent while President Trump made inane suggestions about drinking disinfectants etc.  But I must check this intuition and admit that secondary actors in face of powerful men and women often opt to remain silent out of fear of losing face or being punished.  Furthermore, ""the good that men and womendo if oft interred with their bones, the good they do is forgotten.""   I paraphrase!  I am simply saying that I and others who would judge without ample investigation of the life and doings of people such as Dr. Brix have no right to judge.
    Too many decent and accomplished people have been crucified by the Trump administration.      Let Dr. Brix not join their ranks!"
2020-08-07 15:02:00,"Perhaps one should consider that since she is disliked by both Pelosi and Trump then she’s actually doing a terrific job.  She is appointed not elected, and since both parties have mishandled the pandemic, then by default they must blame a non elected bureaucrat.  Grow up dear readers, is classic politics in action."
2020-08-07 14:57:05,"It's fair to ask whether Dr. Birx believes that she can be more effective in her current position than she can be on the sidelines. I think the answer to that question is self-evident. She's in the awful spot of having to kowtow to an ignoramus in order to keep her job. Even Dr. Fauci has to hold his tongue, and his position is more secure. We should give her a break and factor in the politics of her position before we judge her by some litmus test that doesn't exist in the real world.

It's impossible to be overly honest in Trumplandia without being sacked. Dr. Birx cannot be the tailor of the Emperor's new clothes."

Maybe I’m wrong but my gut feeling is the longer politicians linger at the microphones the worse the outcomes for the people they represent. Some analysis of the data would be greatly and gratefully appreciated."
2020-08-07 15:33:12,"'“He’s been so attentive to the scientific literature and the details and the data,” she said then.'

I'm sorry but that's more than innocent praise of the president to ""get him to do the right thing.""  It's likely a lie, but more than that it's reassuring his supporters that this man is dedicated to and interested in science. That, in turn, gives legitimacy to all his crazy pronouncements including those about hydroxychloroquine and other treatments as well as his claims that kids are immune etc. I'd call the doctor's statement irresponsible."

She obviously wants to please but she cannot be ""a servant with two masters"", not to mention a hero, for the people and for Trump. Trump is not for the people but for himself. She has served attempt to prop Trump up when he has failed spectacularly. Perhaps she felt she could do some good such as making Trump wear a mask. But Trump turned on her as she begins to be ""disloyal"" by stating the obvious, a ""new phase"" it seems we have been in for awhile now. Trump needs his denial, his rosy picture. The Jonathan Swan interview makes that plain.

""From her office in the West Wing, Dr. Birx serves as a link between federal agencies — the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and others — engaged in the response."" 

These are all agencies that Trump controls, has cleaned at the top. So Birx is in a terrible position trying to sit on the fence. She can do more good, and could still do more good by leaving, working for the American people. Staying she has politicized herself and lost credibility."
2020-08-07 14:45:16,"She traded her reputation that she had for the one she has.  Shushing reporters for using data interpretations she  (and donald)  disagreed with, sitting silently and attentively while donald proposed lethal interventions for Americans to use to fight the virus.  It was a Faustian bargain, to promote herself, and those sort of bargains never work out.  I reserve my sympathy for those affected by the coronavirus because of her deflection, dismissive attitude, and platitudes she served up on behalf of donald."
2020-08-07 14:53:03,"Like others who have found themselves working in an administration that promotes irresponsible actions, Dr. Birx may think that she is helping to mitigate their worst effects. So far few, if any, such persons have found the ability to both accomplish this goal and protect their reputations."
2020-08-07 15:39:29,"I am a retired physician with 37 years of community practice.
I’m writing in response to today’s article about Dr. Brix.

The last act of every graduating medical student is to take an oath whose first rule is: above all do no harm.
By keeping silent when Trump recommenced that people drink poisons, Dr. Brix violated this fundamental guiding principle.  
By actively, publicly spreading optimistic fantasies about the pandemic she did even worse violence to the health and welfare of the American people.
I do not know her motives, but I can imagine none that does not violate the fundamental principles that a physician is sworn to follow."
2020-08-07 15:46:47,Birx may have a firm grip on the science but she is clueless as to the art of leadership.
2020-08-07 15:46:37,"IF Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci are the best and brightest minds we have in the United States to guide us through this COVID-19 pandemic, then so be it. Their leadership and effectiveness or lack thereof, in the COVD-19 battle, speak for itself.

I simply find it hard to believe that we, as the most medically-advanced research country on earth, can't assemble a more competent team out of the thousands of virologists, epidemiologists, and brilliant medical researchers in the United States."
2020-08-07 15:49:01,"Had Dr. Deborah L. Birx resigned her position under protest of Trump's incompetence earlier, perhaps directly after Trump's questionable statements about disinfectants? 
Maybe, Dr. Deborah L. Birx credibility would have been sustainable and Trump would have been left with a huge political mess to clean up. 
Instead Trump had the focus put right on Birx, in that conversation.  
It would seem none of his panel of experts jumped ship to a safe distance with the exception of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci."
2020-08-07 15:53:43,"The Times piece which dissected what went wrong  with U.S. virus response was a scathing indictment of Dr. Birx, who predicted a quick flattening and gradual reduction in cases based on what happened in Italy.  This gave the Trump Administration cover for minimizing the risks of the virus and undercutting State efforts to shut down, isolate and mask their populations.
        Did Birx ever qualify her advice when it became clear that Americans were not taking the same steps Italy did and would not follow the Italian model?  Most recently, she claims that she was not interviewed by the NYT before the piece ran.  Is that because they did not seek an interview (unlikely) or because she declined to comment?"
2020-08-07 13:27:16,"How pathetic that Dr. Birx has been reduced to pleading with governors and the WH to institute mandatory masks. Now with the virus raging she is being scapegoated. What a collection of bozos we have running our country, on both sides of the aisle."

2020-08-07 14:20:57,"I'm the same age as Dr. Birx, and see her demeanor as a throwback to my mother's day. She played the feminine game of trying to appease the male ego. Very retro and very unattractive, not to mention irresponsible."

Dr. Birx was well aware of Trump’s “Midas touch” in reverse. 

Most Likely Dr. Birx thought she would be untouched. Her gamble backfired & Trump’s parasitic “Midas touch” destroyed her integrity!"
2020-08-07 16:16:08,"I applaud Dr. Birx for her professionalism and persistence in juggling the dangers of the pandemic and the petulant 2-year old she works for. The easy thing would have been to totally capitulate or to throw up her hands and resign. I believe that she and Dr. Fauci are both doing the best they can under extremely trying circumstances.

If you need someone to blame, try McConnell and Barr for enabling the great destroyer."

2020-08-07 16:23:52,"I'm never going to stop being astounded by the lengths the media and seemingly everyone is going to defend, deflect, underplay the massive, unprecedented, unmitigated disaster that has been made of the response by this administration and nearly everyone in it.  I can't believe we just sit by while experts in the field of disease control mealy mouth about to appease one man's ego. Dr. Birx has shown time and time again by her public statements what she is most concerned about - Trump's wrath. It's absolutely pathetic."
2020-08-07 17:15:25,"Why does it ""require a lot of guts"" to tell Mike Pence to wear a mask? I cannot understand the fear that seems to be felt by people working in this administration. What is frightening about Mike Pence, the most benign of men? What motivates the awesome fear that people working for Trump apparently experience? So what if he doesn't like what you say? So what if he tweets something mean about you? Is Birx so delicate that she cannot withstand a tweet or two? What's the worst that Trump can do to her, or anyone? Fire them? So what? Birx would have another position in minutes. The fear and trembling that seems to come from administration officials is baffling and it's a big problem in this administration. Trump would have been cut down to size early on if people had been willing to speak up and stopped their quaking."
2020-08-07 17:24:06,"When there is no easy ""right"" answer, everyone can criticize. Every decision related to covid-19 is a compromise. Destroy the economy? Save lives? Save the economy? Cost lives? How much is too much and how much is too little?

There are no good answers with Covid-19 and lots of so-called experts and scientists who are happy enough guessing along with the rest of us as to the future path of the pandemic. 

This is NOT science, it is fortune telling."

Politics over truth.
Politics over the health and well being of all Americans.

The world's richest country led by a bozo and team and we have thee worst statistics!

And, finally, after almost SEVEN months of virus spreading and death and tragedy, someone is finally waking up to the sham of  the briefings when we had them.

Dr. Birx has been  hiding behind her scarves which in and of itself was to me inappropriate - did she think she was on a fashion runway?  And what about the coy silent  smirk when POTUS was talking about drinking disinfectant to ward off the deadly virus?

Sad truth, despite her data driven charts, which like her scarves, didn't mean much to most Americans, she is a political person who wants to keep her job and the rest of us be damned."

2020-08-07 19:02:11,"The complexity of Covid-19 situation in the US is very high.  Birx, like Fauci, know a lot about pandemics, but the situation that unrolled in the US was bound to undermine them with: the President, other scientists; so they had to chose how to cope with this.  Birx has slowly worked to push Trump's COC team to a sensible position, but the virus is always ahead and the data behind.  Fauci moved away from Trump and appears more credible to the scientists, but can he influence Trump much now?  

Trump's close team are not disease experts and had bad experiences with the early public health advice and support.  So they acted, [what they are experienced at in operating hotels] and we all got into trouble :("
2020-08-07 19:11:48,"Birx lost my confidence during the press conference in which Trump turned to her as he recommended ingesting poison. At that moment she should have stood up, regardless of enraging Trump, and said NO, do not listen to those recommendations, they will have fatal consequences. Unlike Dr. Fauci, who has endured death threats because of his courageous will to tell the truth, Birx has too often danced around the truth for fear of incurring Trump's ire."

That she was painting the balance of working for this man and his erratic behavior and doing the public good. But as time wore on it showed my friend was correct. Dr Birx appears more concerned about her ambition than science. The past week or so she's been on an 'apology' tour because she realizes that the public sentiment is very much against her. 
I really wanted to believe that she was for the pubic good first and foremost, but th evidence says otherwise. 
Its sad, another person destroys themselves in the service to Trump. It's hard to fathom how he gets them to do it."
2020-08-07 19:58:51,"I think she'll sell her reputaiton to get governors to work with her. I think she's looking at what she has to do to keep her funding which no one mentions, and continue to get all the medical needs of the military fulfilled. It's the one area from which Trump hasn't really stolen to buy more big guns, send troops to demoralize at our southern border, and build a wall for which Mexico was going to pay.
Devil's bargain, 100%. And yes, she prevaricated to say the least so red staters would listen to her when she spoke about social distancing, hand washing, and later mask wearing. I'm unwilling to judge her, and I wonder if men would have taken the same hit on ""management style."""

Birx is most likely the opposite--like so many others of Trump's appointees, she has not been willing to take more than half-measures in countering the maniac-in-charge.  She has thus betrayed her learning and her experience.  The result is 158,000 deaths and counting and an economy in ruins.

I was deeply disturbed that she would do this and I concluded that she was just another of Trump's puppets. It was appalling because thousands of American  lives were and still are at stake. Dr. Bobblehead, on full display, supporting this con job of a president-I could hardly contain my emotions. Then there was a picture of her and Sen.Corwyn on a plane (1st class. of course) either before or after the Texas meeting, yucking it up-SANS  FACE MASKS!

That's a ridiculous complaint. Administration officials do not contradict the President at his own press briefing. They can do it later in private.

As for Trump's ""disinfectant"" suggestion, the simple reply is that when it was tried on rats, say, the rats all died. So the side-effects would include death. No sneering at Trump is even required."

Check out rapidtests.org and consider sending a letter to your governor (and representatives). With cheap, rapid testing, opening schools could actually be feasible before a vaccine."
2020-08-06 14:06:27,"Maybe the best idea on this that I've heard is the one proposed by Dr. Birx --- ""Group testing.""  She said that batches of as many as 25 cultures can be tested at once; if a given batch shows a positive test result, the cultures must be retested singly, but if it returns negative, that indicates that all 25 testees are negative.  That kind of procedure would speed up results by at least an order of magnitude, it seems."
2020-08-06 14:11:52,"The technology for fast, cheap, at-home, spit-on-paper COVID-19 antigen tests exists. Millions of tests can easily be manufactured for as little as $1 per test. Such a test allows for frequent testing of a large percentage of the population and  solves many problems of safely reopening schools and businesses.

The mechanism of ""good enough"" testing is a no-brainer. Such a low tech-tool increases several fold our power to reduce speading (R factor) till a vaccine becomes available.
 
Please insist that the FDA immediately license RAPID TESTS and that the government fund manufacture and distribution of the test."
2020-08-06 14:36:16,"The testing we already have is not particularly great - per IDSA (Infectious Disease Society of America) data, the sensitivity of PCR testing is only about 0.71, meaning that roughly 1 in 4 tests will be a false negative (patient has COVID-19, but tests negative). This meshes with my own clinical ER practice, where plenty of symptomatic patients have 'negative' tests. Giving people false security with a negative result that is not accurate is probably not a great public health plan. 

Furthermore, our testing infrastructure is still woefully inadequate. Although a faster test would help with some delays, a large part of the problem is the sheer number of tests that need to be collected, processed, results given, etc. The time to run the test is just one step in that chain. 

Pooled testing may help, but only in areas where the prevalence of disease is low, which counts out many 'hot spots' where samples in the pool are likely to be positive, requiring the whole set to be run again individually. 

We certainly need better testing, and in the meantime we all need to pitch in to do the hard work of masking, staying away from large gatherings, etc"
2020-08-06 14:47:35,"Testing symptomatic people is better than nothing.
Ongoing surveillance testing is better than that.
And frequent surveillance testing is best.

Think of it this way: roughly 50% of those who contract COVID-19 are infectious but asymptomatic. They unknowingly spread disease.

Daily surveillance testing, even if it has a 50% false negative rate,
will catch 50% of these people the first day, 75% by the second, 88% by the third, 94% by the fourth, and 97% the fifth.

Catching 97% of those asymptomatic folks in 5 days is a whole lot better than missing them completely."

Test every child and every teacher and staff member at the beginning of every week of school and again halfway through the week.  Test every ticket purchaser before every event held with a live audience.  If people can pass through security lines and metal detectors at airports, concerts, courthouses and even school doors, then they can line up, spit in a cup, wait ten minutes and show the little paper to the security guard at the door.

And still wear a mask, because the tests are not perfect."

2020-08-06 15:05:16,"The antigen tests that many experts are advocating are less sensitive than the PCR tests that are more commonly available today.  However, they are sufficiently sensitive to identify the vast majority of people who are spreading the virus, particularly when administered frequently.  It is misleading to describe them as “less accurate”, they are “less sensitive”. But plenty sensitive to control (together with tracing and isolation) the spread of virus.  PCR tests that do not provide a result for several or many days are worthless for pandemic control."
2020-08-06 15:32:54,"Couldn't the FDA create a category of ""screening"" tests with an acceptable lower level of sensitivity as opposed to diagnostic PCR tests? The tests could come with different recommended parameters for use such as by employers, schools, and other institutions with a recommended minimum frequency interval for testing of each individual like every other day or twice a week. Yes, it wouldn't stop all spread, but it couldn't definitely curtail it. If the government is willing to send everyone a $1200 stimulus check, it should be willing to spend $365 on a daily one dollar test for each person - which in controlling the virus would do a lot more for the economy."
2020-08-06 15:35:18,"Home pregnancy tests are a familiar example of an antigen test. In such testing, tagged antibodies are mixed with a specimen. A portion of the antibodies will bind with matching antigens in the specimen forming antigen/antibody complexes. The specimen is then washed and the tagged antibody/antigen complexes are measured. The reliability of the test is determined by the quality of the antibody used and the level set to determine a positive result. Even with high quality antibodies, there will usually be some complexes formed whether or not the person is infected. 

Ideally the test should identify only proteins associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but many proteins are shared by different viruses and usually there will be some complexes formed even if the person is not infected. Setting a high level for positivity results in a highly specific test where all positive results will be persons who are infected, but some persons who are shedding little virus will be negative. Setting a low level will result in a highly sensitive test where all infected persons are identified, but many identified persons will not have SARS-CoV-2.

Sensitive tests are good screening tests. They would reduce the need for PCR testing by screening out negative results. Specific tests identify those with high viral shedding but miss those shedding little virus. Each type of test has a potential role.

2020-08-06 15:44:08,"Sadly, the article on speedy testing completely missed key points.  Where is the data?  There is important and useful data on the sensitivity of these potentially home use test strips.  Please listen to This Week in Virology #648 where Dr. Daniel Griffin gives some data (first 15 minutes).  Calling these tests the kitchen sink and focusing on their presumed ""insensitivity"" slant the story, and may kill these valuable tools in the same way the ""insensitivity"" criticism did in May when these paper strip tests were coming out.  Why not describe these paper strip at-home tests a valuable complementary TOOL in the toolkit of testing for Sars Cov2 outbreak and spread?  These can be a very important tool to help schools and businesses open safely and operate safely CONTINUOUSLY.  The current wildly expensive PCR swab tests (involving medical personnel) are absolutely not working to stem outbreaks.  To the average person, the logistics of getting a PCR test are so daunting and plagued with bother, delay, obstacle and anxiety -- most people aren't going to get tested, even when they think they might have been exposed.  Where's the data on repeat testing with rt PCR with respect to non in-hospital testing?  People tend to seek testing, if at all, after an outbreak has occurred and community spread is known or well suspected.  Arguably, in reality, the single-point PCR system of testing could be called highly insensitive when viewed in that frame."
2020-08-06 17:33:22,"This article goes a long way to making us think outside the box. The word accuracy is not correct - sensitivity is the correct term they are looking for. A test that is too sensitive such as PCR may detect a few viable virus particles that are insufficient to cause infection. It may pick up defective particles that are insignificant. It takes too long to achieve a result. Theses things make it less useful for controlling the virus in a population. On the other hand, a less sensitive test that is detecting larger numbers of particles in an individual more likely to infect may have more value, especially if it is rapid and can be done in a home setting. It may be a more important test than a PCR based test. Test every day with a cheap rapid test and it may help control this mess, even if less sensitive."
2020-08-06 19:26:04,"The important concept here is that there are two distinct jobs required for testing.  The one we are used to seeing is for diagnosis, which requires an accurate result to help determine treatment.  But the critical one during a raging pandemic is for identifying those with the virus who are infectious.  In that case, you get no additional points for also detecting people carrying the virus who are not infectious, and paying the extra costs in time and dollars to flag the infected-but-not-infectious is counterproductive.

When the folks who tested positive in Vermont were retested within two days using PCR tests only a small fraction of them had positive results. Since antigen tests are known to yield greater numbers of false negative results but had no history of large numbers of false positives these outcomes raised a lot of questions. The CDC, FDA and manufacturer are now investigating but so far there has been no finding. Apparently the FDA approval for this specific antigen test system and posdibly others stated it should not be used on asymptomatic individuals but that was ignored."

2020-08-06 15:38:02,"Don’t get too worried about the phrase “less accurate”. The viral load of someone who is actually contagious is literally one million times higher than someone who is in recovery and has residual viral RNA fragments. Rapid testing is designed to catch people who are infectious and a danger to others —  it’s not designed to diagnose a paying customer, it’s designed as a firewall to keep our children and elderly safe.

Our current system is catching only a fraction of viral cases and for those it is returning results too late to take action. Diagnostic tests must only be done if you can take action based on their results. The current tests are useful only for historical understanding. Rapid widespread tests could actually keep people healthy.

As a former public health officer, I have no doubts that this public health (as opposed to diagnostic laboratory) approach to controlling the virus is the silver bullet we have been looking for until a vaccine arrives and is distributed.

The technology is here now to print hundreds of millions of monoclonal antibody paper strips ($1 per). The challenge is regulatory. FDA and CLIA prevent companies from proceeding because their rules require companies to meet strict standards for tests used for “professional” diagnostic purposes.

However, the paper strips wouldn’t be that. They would be a public health screening device, arguably no different (but much much more accurate) than taking a temperature.

What we need is for the media to pick up on this and create a loud outcry for regulatory waivers.

If this doesn’t occur, our failure to capitalize on this ground breaking solution will make CDC’s initial mistaken call to not wear masks pale in comparison. We’re talking tens of thousands or more lives lost."

In the USA, lab companies (LabCorp, etc.) and lab equipment makers (Abbott, etc.) have huge influence over govt/FDA policies about testing.  They have ZERO interest in enabling cheap, point-of-care rapid tests.  This would 'kill their golden goose.'  

FDA validated (and EUA authorized) rapid antibody tests need only a pin-prick of blood to reveal results in 15 minutes at a cost of $10 per test.  They are widely produced in Korea, USA, China and many other countries.  Yet, the FDA still requires the blood to be drawn from a vein by a professional and the use of the kit in a 'high complexity CLIA certified lab'.  

Imagine: no drawing blood, no flying vials of blood samples around the country, no waiting for results to be emailed 2-10 days later, no use of lab resources that are needed for other tests, etc.

These rapid tests are not inaccurate or insensitive. They are APPROPRIATELY sensitive for how they're to be used. If everyone in a COVID hotspot were tested for contagiousness every day before work or school or even just running errands, it would almost immediately crush the reproductive number in that area (the number of people a sick person infects).
Imagine how much safer air travel would feel if you knew that everyone that went through a TSA checkpoint or got off an international flight had been checked for contagiousness."
2020-08-06 19:55:08,"Not sure of the context in this article; but in the clinical laboratory setting ""Sink Testing"" refers to pouring the specimens down the drain and guessing the results.   <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sink_testing"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sink_testing</a>"
2020-08-06 15:28:11,"Rapid Antigen Tests are not less accurate than PCR tests, they're less sensitive.  The reason this is important:

- infectious people have millions of virus particles in their mucous samples

- PCR test can detect accurately down to 80 virus particles

- Rapid Antigen tests can detect down to 50,000 virus particles accurately.
From a public health standpoint, we should not care if there's a person out there with 81 virions in their nasal passages.  Rapid Antigen testing is the most cost effective way to know if a person has enough viral particles to be infectious - period.  

Using a PCR test to detect if a kid is infectious is like using mosquito net instead of chain link fence to keep dogs out of your yard.   Or like swatting mosquitoes with a sledge hammer.  

If we want to keep kids and teachers as safe as possible but get them back in school we NEED the appropriate test.  We need to test a lot of people fast and accurately know whether they are infectious now.  Rapid antigen testing (RAT) costs less than a Starbucks and is near perfect for this application.

In many cases, it could make things worse by giving those infected a false sense of security only to have them take less precaution and spread the virus further.  It really speaks to the desperation and lack of resources we have to fight this pandemic. 

Surely it's not for a lack of funding given that the Democratic National Committee entered July with $238.5 million and the Republican National Committee had $296 million.

I know I’m going to get trashed for saying this, but it seems to me that testing of any kind is basically useless at this point unless you’re already sick and in the hospital. For all the money being spent on these dubious and inadequate testing programs - and for that matter all the money being spent on helping businesses and schools reopen - we could instead be spending all that money paying people to stay home and providing every citizen with hospital-grade PPE. The only way to stop this thing is to stop the spread. 

Widespread testing would have been great if we had the infrastructure to support it but we don’t and it’s too late. We chose a crude path and now must commit to it; it’s time to face the reality that we can’t respond to this crisis the way that South Korea and Germany did because our country is no longer in the same league as they are. Through their intransigence, vindictiveness, greed and short-sightedness, Republican policies on health care and the social safety net over the course of the last forty years have successfully led us to this point. In a society where the only thing that matters is money we might as well use it to solve this problem by giving enough to everyone that they can shelter properly."

2020-08-06 21:23:50,"I see rapid, frequent antigen testing as the only way to detect (and quarantine) asymptomatic spreaders, and thus open up the economy again safely.  These tests are sensitive enough to detect cases in the 3-to 4-day window when infected people are shedding the most virus. (It appears that people are most contagious in the 1-2 days before symptoms start, for those who eventually develop symptoms.) Expensive PCR tests are useless in the cases where people are waiting days or weeks for results, and given the continuing shortages in the supply change for PCR testing, there is zero chance for widespread, frequent screening of asymptomatic people."

It wasted everyone's time and probably gave an excuse people to legit patients to leave.  If you flood the country with false positives, you can do a lot more damage.  I think the problem is the lack of guidance on who should be tested and why.  Around here, nursing homes and assisted living places are regularly testing symptomless residents who aren't going anywhere and have no reason to believe they've been in contact with people who have it.  That's a lot of tests for a lab to process.  I'm 65 and am the opposite of the ""they're old and sick so let them die"" crowd.

Paper Covid19 tests similar to pregnancy tests are already in the prototype stage. The accuracy must be much higher than 50%, but even at 90% accuracy, these cheap paper antigen tests will be a game changer.

We will be able to go to a movie theater knowing that everyone in the theater has tested negative on this cheap paper test they took at the door to the theater. Gyms and sports arenas can do the same thing. Everyone will still have to wear masks and be physically distant from one another, but it will make normal human experiences, like eating in a restaurant or attending a theater production or going to school much safer.

The Federal government should be ramping up the development of these tests rather than pouring billions into  vaccines that can't possibly be proven safe and effective for years, most likely.

These cheap antigen tests will be available much sooner, allowing most of us to return to our normal lives long before a vaccine (or vaccines) for covid19 have been proven safe and distributed nationwide."

I was horrified to learn that back in February CDC refused to certify in-house Sars-Cov2 test developed in my home state's University of Washington. Why?  Apparently UW researchers had failed to prove that it won't give false positives for SARS-2003 or MERS.  You must be kidding me, in the middle of a pandemic, when the first priority should be to detect-and-isolate ANY suspected cases, CDC was mainly interested in fool proof accuracy to exclude to other not-in-circulation viruses.

Another was when Dr. Birx was asked back in March -  Why didnt the CDC simply take the WHO virus test when theirs had  failed?  Dr. Birx response - We found it was not always accurate - false positives. Just imagine telling someone they may have covid when they dont?  - Jesus, its not a death sentence that you cant tell people. Tell them its not 100 pct accurate, isolate them ASAP and then conduct a more precise test that may take longer.  

If the goal is to stop a raging pandemic by isolating all suspected cases ASAP, false positives are NOT the problem. 

The reason we find ourselves this huge mess is because there have been so many missteps by ""so called experts"", to talk nothing of the well known ignoramuses."
2020-08-07 01:07:43,"We have the highly accurate tests we need. What we lack is the political will to scale them nationally. Throwing a kitchen sink full of inaccurate tests onto the market is exactly the wrong answer. The FDA removed a bunch of tests from the market which had terrible sensitivity (ability to detect the virus in small amounts) and terrible specificity (detecting COVID-19 and not something else). Do you want your parent or grandparent taking a test that has a good chance of providing a false negative? Or contact tracers wasting time on a bunch of false positives. I didn’t think so. Let’s instead militate for what every developed economy in the world has except us — ample, timely, and accurate testing."
2020-08-07 01:09:48,"Instituting a testing regime with much higher numbers of false negatives is a problematic solution to the shortage of resources for more precise testing.  

There is a considerable moral hazard here: people who get a negative result on an antigen test are quite likely to think, and behave, as though they have dodged the Covid bullet, at least for today or this week.  They are therefore more likely to head for the movie theater, or the church, or the beach, believing that they cannot spread what they believe they don't have.  Of course, some of them will be mistaken, to the misfortune of others with whom they come into contact.

In an attempt to assist public health through increasing numbers of tests administered, then, this approach has substantial risk of undermining more important public measures, like compliance with precautions like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing."

And that's what they got.  The epitome of American business: cheap, chiseling, corrupt to the core, dishonest, prone to thievery and greasing his personal wheels with public money, dismissive of, well, small business (as evidenced by his perversion of the former small business program, the one running out of time and always short of money because so many recipients were not, well, small or even business).

I am so sorry for small business employees, now doubly shafted by the death of this program and the refusal of Republicans to offer even minimal support, but there is no sympathy for the ""alarm"" of owners who chose to abuse their fellow citizens to put the man in office to swist the game in their favor even more.

May be time to stop responding reflexively to labels and outlandish lies and do what citizens are supposed to do: study the candidates and their policies, maybe ask a question or two, make a point of listening to all the viewpoints, and get priorities straight.

So, they insult the working class by calling them lazy, and prefer the alternative which is tens of millions of people could possibly be homeless very soon.  Then, like good Republicans, they'll complain about how the Democrats created the new homeless problem."

I also don't believe that the Democratic Party is not trying to gain brownie points, but will it backfire when people have had enough. Interestingly, Trump spouted that he would sign an order most likely today, and ironically that is when the new jobs report is released, I do have concerns regarding how the Trump Administration is actually counting and posting the jobs report, my concern, are they true jobs that have been created or is it more people returning to the positions they held previous to COVID and the shutdown, if that is the case then the Trump Administration is doing what Trump Organization has always done and that is to promote false positives. Whatever the reason for what is happening, it is shameful that both parties are allowing the suffering of their citizens to continue, rent, mortgages, food, shelter, utilities, clothing, should be forefront and not the coming election.

If, hypothetically, all such interactions ceased immediately for 14 days, the Covid-19 spread will stop. That cannot happen because people are needed to provide food, shelter, and basic services to support life, and this takes people meeting people.  But most families need a wage earner to get by.  To the extent that this work is not needed during the height of a pandemic, those workers should stay home.  If congress pays them to stay home, everyone benefits because the nation is healthier, and the funding can be made up later when the economy recovers. It does not matter if the benefits temporarily are more than they were paid.  The benefits will go away eventually, so that the recipients will then be incentivized to return to work.  The alternative is frightening. Those without benefits who can work will do so, thereby continuing the spread of the virus.  Those who cannot work will suffer.  They may lose their homes and go hungry. Eventually, their losses will extend to their creditors who will also suffer.  There is no upside to letting the benefits run out, and there is a considerable impact on stopping the virus if the benefits continue."

So with tourism ebbing with the end of summer vacations so too will come an end to any improvements in the restaurant industry. More nails in the economic coffin.

Clearly the reproduction rate, or R0, is a function of social factors like masks, distancing, etc. Those social factors are going to be different within a school than they were while the kids were at home. If social factors change, R0 changes, and when that changes, the rate of infection will change. So the community at large may stay below, say 5%, but the school may go way up.

So I hope there is a program to monitor the infection rate of just the kids in school."

I am not a betting man but I would wager that the jobs lost have an average higher salary range as the ones created.

We need to provide every economic lifeboat we can summon to those folks who by no fault of their own are unemployed and potentially homeless. It will cost the government more monies to ""house"" the homeless than by helping them to remain in their own homes. This is not rocket science but practical application. But we need to have an adult in the WH to lead the country and administrative aides with chutzpah to lead with compassion and competence. We cannot wait until November 3. We must demand action now.

Not long enough to grieve. My first wife died in at age 31. Almost all people I have ever loved are dead. Girlfriends, closest friends, co-workers. Again: This is a very foolish decision, if followed through. Frankly, I do not think it will occur; at least, not fully. Even if it is not stopped by legal means, many will stay home: Staff, teachers, and students. I know my daughter can be home schooled for as long as it takes.

My partner was furloughed from a full-time job and has been back working only three days a week since June, and there is no indication that he will return to full-time employment at any point in the foreseeable future. Yet, despite these types of situations being widespread, Republicans thought it was a good idea to reject the HEROES act the House passed in May and then sit on their hands for two months before hastily cobbling together a thoroughly inadequate proposal that does not take into account the reality of many thousands. Their willful ignorance and deliberate inaction is malicious and harmful. None of them deserve the salaries we are paying them."

This looks like Cuomo now has an out where he can close any and all schools for failing to meet this requirement.

New York is certainly not the only place, urban or rural, where a large percentage of parents cannot work from home and face the prospect of having to leave small children unsupervised to go to work or stop working and lose a paycheck to stay home with them if in-person school isn't available. Consider also that many of the same households may not have the equipment or access to cell or wifi service to make online instruction easy.

Note the other viral photo from Cherokee County Georgia where dozens of students posed together (maskless) outside of the school. Obviously this photo was taken for yearbook. I’m sure you can find MANY such “back to school” photos posted to social media. Yet Hannah Watters was suspended. Will the school suspend every student who took back-to-school photos on school property? Sounds like a good way to empty out the school for social distancing!

Paulding County will get sued and rightly so. The chairman of their school board, Jeff Fuller, should lessen the blow by resigning immediately and apologizing for the ignorant things he has posted on social media. Watch the video of what he said at a board meeting in May — called the CDC guidelines “complete crap” — and you’ll understand what is wrong with this school system. He also posted a crazy rant on Facebook Wednesday in which he ironically calls other people crazy. Touché.

This is a top-down issue, like 99% of all issues in ANY good ol’ boy school system. Hannah Watters, I would have been proud to teach you, and I am sure that many of your teachers feel the same. They just can’t speak out because of men like Fuller."

2020-08-07 19:30:22,"Cuomo continually insists that he has the final say over school openings but now tosses the ball into the courts of the districts. Clearly, Cuomo is pulling a Trump.

In New York City the mayor and his education commissar Carranza said they can tolerate up to a 3% infection rate. New York City has a million school kids. Do the math. They're willing to sacrifice 30,000 kids plus teachers and staff? Are they nuts?

Inevitably, if schools are opened people will get sick and die. It's not worth it. So this is what we do:

When I was in grad school I attended a double summer session and thereby made up a half-year of study. I graduated a half-year early. 

I say keep the schools shut until we have a cure and a vaccination. Do video classes as necessary. Put everything live on hold. When this is all over make up the lost time by having summer sessions or longer school days. It may take a  couple of years to completely catch up but I'd rather see schools open in the summertime and after-hours than sick and dead kids and teachers. If everyone is doing this then no one will fall behind. It's not a competition, it's survival. 

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures!"

2020-08-07 20:38:23,"It is mind boggling that opening schools and the rest of the country decisions have been based on magical thinking.

Trump did a show and tell strut of “his” 4/16/2020 Opening Up America Again Guidelines that were measurable and scientifically defensible.  Of course within a day of the announcement he either forgot about them or just decided it wasn’t necessary to promote them because they didn’t catapult his TV ratings.

Such is the fate of all the science based guidelines issued during this unnecessarily deadly pandemic in the US.

Opening Up American Again was based on phasing and gating criteria.  Schools, bars, visits to senior care, elective surgeries, etc. could open if states and regions had no evidence of a rebound and that satisfied the criteria listed below a second time.

Instead openings have been as random as pin the tail on the donkey, spin the bottle and twister.  No wonder covid 19 continues to be out of control.

Over 23,000 NYC residents already died of Covid-19, yet de Blasio, as incompetent as Trump, pretends he can open the largest, most densely packed school district in the US. (It has approx. 1 million students).

De Blasio is guaranteed to blow it. Most NYC schools are underfunded/overcrowded with packed classrooms. We have no national healthcare.

My wife has taught in Harlem for over 25 years. Children will have to be masked, social distance, and never touch. Students will touch each other, take off their masks, and sneeze and cough all over other students and teachers, (my wife lost count of all the times children sneezed in her face long ago). 

Students will be unable to distance even if they could remember to, which they won't. (Consider how often your children forget to listen to you after 5 seconds. Multiply it by millions).

My wife's students live almost entirely in packed apartments in projects in multi-generational families. There's barely room for everyone to move. It's common for a grandparent to share a bed with a grandchild. If these children return to school they'll go home and infect their mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, and grandparents. 

We've all seen massive death in meat-packing plants forced to reopen. De Blasio will kill teachers and students' families if he reopen our schools."
2020-08-07 17:23:31,"I don't see how extending unemployment benefits through executive order is legal. Congress allocated money for unemployment benefits through July. Without a new act from Congress, that money is gone. Trump doesn't have the power to create more money. That means his executive order must steal funds from somewhere else.

The idea Republicans are currently floating is taking the unspent state and local money in the CARES Act and repurposing it toward unemployment. The White House hasn't generated any new aid money though. Trump is robbing Peter to pay Paul. Who loses out? The state and local governments who are struggling to meet their annual budgets even with the CARES Act.

Leaving aside the forced layoffs Trump's proposal would cause. Leaving aside the punitive and self-serving nature of the action. The executive order sounds an awful lot like a certain wall Trump wanted built. The Supreme Court already ruled that order illegal. You can't teach an old dog new tricks. I feel like I'm watching a bad rerun.

However, let's suppose for a minute Trump could legally extend unemployment through executive action. Would you want him to? Unilaterally interrupting the legislative process to undermine the opposition and bolster your own reelection prospects sounds a lot like something a dictator would do. Trump's fascist side is showing again."

There’s an election coming up and no one wants to look like they don’t care about the American people.  But, let’s be real.

If I remember correctly, Trump was among them. I'm not an advocate of frequent executive action, but in President Obama's defense he had a Congress united against giving him any victory no matter how much the US would have benefited. They did so out of spite. (Unlike Trump, he wasn't corrupt and he was competent.) Trump has no excuse. He doesn't attempt to accomplish anything through the proper channels.

The stark alternative is the reality of a major economic collapse on the scale of a depression. We have an unchecked COVID-19 calamity due to Republican mismanagement that now is about to create an economic catastrophe due to their unwillingness to compromise. Barack Obama handed Donald Trump an economy painfully restored to health after its gross mismanagement under George W. Bush with a wasteful, unnecessary war, multiple tax cuts for the rich, irresponsible deregulation of the banking industry. And, as with Obama then, Republican blocked additional stimulus funding just as they’re doing now.

These folks have made their careers being in government, something I don’t think was intended by the founders but then they were white privileged men who were not servers or bartenders. We must stop electing people who are entrenched in ideas that do not reflect the needs of modern society just because it’s easy to mark a ballot containing a name that we know. These representatives of the people do not represent us: communities across the nation are together helping each other as best they can with food, clothing, money, medical and psychological help.

2020-08-07 20:18:14,"Governor Cuomo's announcement today was simply an official confirmation of what he noted during his presser earlier this week.

Based on the data, a case can certainly be made to allow schools to reopen for in-person instruction.  Albeit with the proviso that if contagion rates rise above the ""trigger"" they will have to move on-line.

However, what the Governor also made clear is that this now passes the final decision over to both the individual school districts and the various stakeholders including teachers and parents.

As he so strongly pointed out the other day, the ultimate decision will actually be made by the parents.  If parents don't want the schools to open -- they won't.

What the Governor is doing is shifting the decision point over to the parties most directly affected.  In many ways, this is an exercise in true, basic democracy.

That has risks, as well as benefits, so it will be interesting to see how this plays out in various school districts throughout New York State.  It may give us a glorious mosaic of experimentation.  Or it may result in a hodge-podge of community dissension and dysfunction.

Trump and his  toadies refused out of hand, sending the message to millions of Americans that their lives and their communities do not matter!
A majority of economists, the Fed Chairmen, governors, mayors, medical & social service organizations have all called for more aid like that included in the Heroes Act.

2020-08-07 23:03:09,"This is being misreported on CBS as Congress not being able to agree.  Actually, Senate Republicans gave their role away to Trump's chief of staff to negotiate.  So, if there is no agreement, then it is the President who cannot agree with the House of Representatives.  Therefore, it is misleading to say Trump comes in and rescues the day by Executive order after Legislators cannot agree. Trump was part of the original problem. In the same article where saving unemployment payments is discussed, the NYT needs to analyze what it means that state and city governments are not also supported by a rescue, since that is the main sticking point. How many people will lose their jobs if states and cities are not supported? How many citizens will not be supported by state and city government functions if they are not supported? Trump's Executive Order, by excluding State and City support, will cause this. And it is part of the same  story, NYT."

Yes, republicans conceded their negotiation role to White House staff but that does not negate their responsibility as members of Congress to draft and vote on the passage of any bill.

Trump and company keep making excuse after excuse but does not combine common-sense to this, now the States need funding in order to continue essential services and hopefully retrofit schools for a safe return. It would be honorable for Trump to at least extend legislation regarding evictions and mortgages, but then he is not known as a gentleman.

The Trump playbook is based on taking the negatives of the Trump approach and accusing the Democrats of them.  Second, the Democratic negotiators, Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer were recognizing the two dangerous crises that face the American people:  the Covid 19 Pandemic and the fragile and sinking US economy, despite the jobs report today.

All the wealthy Republican donors have to do is just convince the senate to keep on doing nothing, and the plum properties across the once-great US will be theirs for the picking.

The rich get richer, and the poor...well, a surprising number of them will still continue to vote for the Republicans, but whether they do or not, it's not likely that the rich will care about them one way or the other.

In Canada, by the way, we have universal health coverage if we get sick, and our government is sending everyone who isn't working a whack of money to keep them in their homes with enough to eat while the crisis passes. Our understanding is that this is the type of service and response a responsible government should take.

This modern day Hoover will do too little, too late.  The White House negotiator, Meadows knows how to blow things up and destroy, but he has never built or created anything that helped real people. How sad that he and Trump want to score political points rather than help struggling, hard working Americans.

Trump is totally useless and dangerous. He provides no safety guidelines by saying send everybody back to school, now.
Dr. Fauci is much better than Trump, but he doesn't provide a clear-cut numerical threshold, he only recommends to try to reopen schools within the context of the level of infection, but he doesn't say what a safe level of infection is, which can cause confusion, turmoil and faulty judgment.

They will increase the odds of adults in the community encountering covid, cause a greater number of serious complications....in other words kids become the pangolin carriers of this virus. 

This virus is being studied by so many scientists around the world, it is now known to be a virus that primarily attacks the endothelium. The fact that there are clots in every organ seems a secondary effect. Why not be cautious about reopening and start slow. Why kids first? Are they not the future of our nation? Why not make masks mandatory for all. After all reducing any dosage of covid would be more advantageous to your health than a meaningless freedom of rights being touted by Republicans."

So why is America dead last in job recovery? The answer can be summarized in one word: TRUMP. This inane, unsuccessful businessman who filed bankruptcy six times is the leader of the republican party which OPPOSED reasonable measures to contain COVID. When science advocated the use of masks, Trump discouraged the use and instead advocated a malaria drug that did nothing to address COVID. The bailout legislation Trump signed lacked oversight and failed to achieve its goal of job recovery.

It is way past time for reporters in this country to get to the damn truth. To be partisan for the objective truth when it comes to who is doing what for who's interest.

It is clear that the Republican plan was to ignore the Democrats' proposal since May, refuse to negotiate anything close to a compromise position and then have Trump come in as the anti-hero, who will no doubt be acting to initiate a payroll tax cut for the purpose of gutting the funding of Social Security and Medicaid. 

It has been a plan for months now by Republicans to take advantage of this pandemic to not come to the assistance of the States having to spend funds on this emergency to then leave the States without any choice but to further cut spending for the collective good of the citizenry, which of course sets the stage once again to criticize government for not being able to efficiently operate as further rationale to push private takeover of utilities, etc."

First - even the PCR test has relatively high rates of false negatives depending on numerous factors including when the test is administered and that leads to my second major problem - accessibility to tests.

This article is written as if people can easily get tested and re tested.  What if you live in rural America - which much of America is or live in a place that simply does not offer testing or the closest testing site is hours away and it takes weeks for the result.

Public health departments should be collecting data on symptoms, especially when there has been a  doctor visit.  I drove 3 hours each way for  a test which came back negative even though I had been identified by my physician through a virtual visit and subsequent contact as probable CoVid.  

But there was no way to report or contact trace.  I clearly had the virus and was very very sick.  False negatives are common but I couldn't just re-test because of where I live and my doctor didn't see the point.  

Because of over reliance on testing and not symptoms first, it was hard to convince people that indeed it was CoVid even though it clearly was not the flu (I am 63 and know what flu is and isn't). I had to invoke my physician.  I had to invoke a NYT article about a man who was hospitalized and tested negative 3 times before he tested positive.

Stay home and isolated till you get results , it took me 48 hours to learn the results 

Wear a mask when in public places 

Wipe down shopping carts with disinfectant wipes 

Use gloves during shopping or use hand sanitizer immediately after 

Wear goggles 

Stay informed 

Trust in science 

Eat healthy to boost your immune system 

Walk for at least an hour a day 

Wash your hands 

Don’t touch your face

Remdesivir 
Steroids 
Blood plasma therapy

Sixty-three millions Americans thought that candidate Trump's ""Mexican rapists and drug dealers"" would cure everything. He would take us back to that glorious past. 
He doubled down on his racism: ""You have good people--on both sides."" Millions loved it. But something happened on that journey: real life and unforeseen events. Their president wasn't ready for it. We are now paying the price.

Dr. Anthony Fauci says one thing. Dr. Deborah Birx says another. Dr. Robert Redfield said this and then backtracked. Dr. Alex Azar dodged the heavy artillery. There was no top-down national response because there wasn't a plan outside of golfing and rallies. The president blamed his two go-to bêtes noires, China and President Obama. Neither one is coming to save us; that's this president job.

When a president says ""I don't take responsibility at all"" and ""We'll have to live with it"" and ""It it what it is,"" all that he's communicated to 330-million Americans is his complete boredom with actually working to fix a problem that one day, said, ""Hello!""

And yet, there are many false negatives from the standard test for COVID-19.

No test result seems to be 100% so I guess the real question is which test is more reliable - the antigen testing for the testing done in a physician's office?"
2020-08-06 14:41:27,"The Dutch finding of airborne viral aerosol transmission simply adds to the rather large pool of evidence that the droplet nature of viral spread is wrong, or at least grossly incomplete. The airborne nature of the virus has been in the popular press ever since the mid-March Wuhan bus incident was reported. MIT researchers followed in early April with their video of each breath emitting aerosol particles and a sneeze sending particles up to 27 feet. Even the Chinese implored America to regard the virus as airborne in their April 3 video, ""Once upon a virus..."". 
Yet, Drs. Fauci, Adams and Redfield discounted that research publicly, and maintained over and over again that a mask will not protect the wearer and that 6 ft. is the magic number for safely distancing (a distance based on Well's 1934 research). 
Why the Dutch government kept their June airborne transmission findings secret is puzzling and disconcerting, but due to the staunchly defended (and apparently incorrect) droplet theory of the administration's corona-virus task force, earlier news of that report would have had little impact on mask usage in the USA, simply being added to the list of airborne studies to ignore. 
Until the president's corona virus task force acknowledges that wearing masks capable of filtering 5 micron viral particles is the ONLY efficient and viable method of stopping the spread, especially indoors, the reopening of the nation to indoor activities is doomed to failure."
2020-08-06 13:29:55,"How can they be any more inaccurate than they are now?   The first batches if you could get your hands on one, back in March seem to have the result “inconclusive” as the result for most of the tests.  The next batches in April, May, and June seemed to go back and forth.  One batch most everyone was positive the next batch of tests, most people were negative.  Now our state, Albuquerque, is low on tests, so the local newspaper, the Albuquerque Journal, reports there are enough tests to test only if you are showing  symptoms.  So I guess we should get the “positive test” result tests back out!"

""Prof. Christian Drosten from the Charité Berlin is primarily responsible for the false claim that there is a reliable virus test"". 

""With his test [Drosten PCR test] only very short gene sequences can be detected. However, a virus is defined as a long strand of genetic material that can only develop its claimed ability to infect as a whole. These facts alone prove that Prof. Drosten's globally effective claim that he had developed a reliable test for the supposedly new virus not only violates the laws of thought and logic of virology, but that he acted with intent and is still acting."""

We've all suspected that this same reasoning also played a role in trump's indifference to a virus that didn't hit red states first. 

Turns out that it was even more malevolent ....

According to a new report, Jared Kushner and others in the administration stupidly believed that the virus wouldn't spread beyond blue states like New York and California; and therefore, thought it would be a good political strategy to scrap a nationwide testing & contact tracing plan in the hopes of making Democratic governors and elected officials look bad.

2020-08-06 19:32:19,"I’m thrilled that Trump (I can’t bring myself to refer to him as “president” even in fake quotes) is focusing on messaging to his base — his base doesn’t decide elections, just as progressives don’t. 

I bet they don’t know who does. 

Even if they figure it out, he’s done too much damage to convince the deciding vote to believe in him."
2020-08-06 19:40:07,"Looking at recent data over the past two weeks has shown a fall in cases across the United States, precipitously in states such as Florida, Texas, Arizona and California. Which seems like a good thing, however, it appears that Trump's new policy surrounding COVID data collection may be to blame. 

Sun Belt states were seeing rises in cases that did not seem to be abating and so many state governments began the closing of restaurants and bars as well as face mask orders in some parts of the states. But, we have not seen such a large drop in cases similar to what we're seeing in these states since lockdowns were initiated in late March, so could these measures truly be having this large of an effect?

At the end of July, Trump ordered that hospitals should route their data around the CDC and send this info straight to his administration in the WH. A week after he did this (enough time for the backlog of tests to come back positive), cases began leveling out and then falling in states with major outbreaks. Not only this, but hospitalizations are falling as well (hospital confirmed infections are the ones no longer being sent to the CDC) which would indicate the virus spread is slowing. However, it seems like this has all happened in conjunction with Trump's rerouting of the data. 

This begs the question, are positive cases truly dropping or is our President just taking control of the narrative by feeding us faulty data?"

It actually isn't personal choice.  The laws around public health powers of states and local governments is quite clear.  That's why Typhoid Mary kept getting locked up, legally.  That's why tens of thousands of people are compelled to be in TB directly observed therapy programs.  To stop the spread of deadly diseases."
2020-08-06 20:05:57,I wholeheartedly recommend that testing be reduced - everywhere. Maybe then the problem really would go away because those who come in contact with the president would no longer be tested. Win win?

The answer is that the tests are in short supply and are probably expensive so only Trump is entitled to them.We are an ailing country and getting sicker and the government has no interest in providing the supplies to test and treat.Millions have been set aside for a vaccine but at the rate of the spread there will be fewer of us left to take advantage of the vaccine.Hope for a cure is cold comfort-we need testing and tracing done NOW!"

2020-08-06 19:19:42,"The situation in Paulding County Georgia is a disgrace. 

The audio of the principal of North Paulding High School threatening students over the intercom about posting photos and videos to social media without permission from the administration should warrant an investigation. I’m sure that students post the token “school pride” photos and videos all the time without the administration’s permission. What’s the difference? 

Having taught in a good ol’ boy school system in Georgia (not that one), I’m not surprised by any of this. It breaks my heart for the kids who have no choice but to be in this environment, and I know that this school is far from the only one with such conditions.

As Trump would say, “It is what it is.”  The state needs to intervene to help kids who are on the waiting list for the virtual school. If maskless kids are bullying kids who are wearing masks, walking up to them and tearing the masks off of their faces as alleged by a parent in a Facebook post, intervention is necessary. 

Unfortunately, this kind of behavior in a principal has always been a leading cause of teachers leaving the profession. I feel sorry for the teachers who are being threatened to keep their mouths shut. But that’s how it goes. Teachers are but cogs in a wheel."

And it’s not just President Trump’s fault. Yes, his leadership in this virus is sorely lacking and a national response most certainly should have been organized. But what really disappoints me are Americans themselves. The bickering & fighting over masks. The conspiracy theory nonsense that has now become normal in the internet world. The lack of civic responsibility by my fellow citizens. The ultra spoiled ‘me’ generation that keeps violating health protocols just to party. What really bothers me is the fact that most Americans accepted the loss of their civil liberties after 9/11 when only a few thousand people died. Yet here we have almost 160,000 Americans dead and folks are fighting about their civic right to wear a mask. If you wrote this as a novel no one would’ve believed it."

For example, students cannot wear clothing with threatening or inappropriate language, teachers cannot wear jeans, staff must park in numbered parking spaces, no one can carry firearms or use drugs on school grounds, all visitors must check in at the front office, etc., etc., etc. Schools can and do unilaterally require the community to uphold any number of rules and regulations to protect its members. If we can require kids to carry hall passes and parents to sign field trip permission forms, we can certainly make everyone wear masks..."

I'm sure this won't be posted but I hope it will be circulated to all editors. The examples included here are from this series of articles. Grammatical errors cause me to pause often and question the veracity of the articles when authors cannot be bothered to be grammatically correct. (1) ""a ubiquitous"" should be written as ""an ubiquitous."" There are very few exceptions to the rule that words beginning with a vowel should be preceded by the word ""an."" This by the way applies to the words ""history,"" ""historic,"" ""historical,"" etc., because, in most of the English-speaking world  and virtually all other languages that use the consonant ""h,"" the ""h"" is silent, therefore, ""history"" (and all its derivatives) is pronounced as ""istory."" (2) ""an political"" should be written ""a political"" (not to be confused with the word ""apolitical"" which indicates a person's avoidance of politics in decision making). There are very few exceptions to the rule that words beginning with consonants are preceded by ""a,"" the word ""history,"" as discussed above, is one of those exceptions. (3) Commas, semicolons, colons, dashes, and even periods are consistently misused. Punctuations provide breaks in grammatical writing to highlight or explain statements.

That faded quickly once Trump got a hold of old Mike, and now the real aggression is DeWine's cruel and authoritarian decision to threaten his own citizens with the loss of all their benefits if they did not return to work when asked.  And the permanent loss of their jobs.

Their was no debate, their was no consideration for health or other risk issues (short of confirmed coronavirus exposure), no thought to family members at risk, none whatsoever for emotional trauma and outright fear.

In the drive to open schools and please his DC master, DeWine will brook no concern for teachers, staff or students.

In fact, in the face of expensive requirements for safe opening (ventilation, special schedules, PPE and other supplies) beyond the reach of all but wealthiest schools, old Mike cut state funding for education.

Class of thirty three (teacher included) what's the odds that all 33 are uninflected?   50 50?   Wrong.   It's really only about 1 in 3.   Two out of three classes can be expected to have AT LEAST ONE infection.   Who said only one infected?  There can can be 2, 3, 4, ... 33 cases in a class. 

Ok, now that we've established an expectation that only one in three classes are infection free, if there are 20 classes in the school what's the likelihood on day one all twenty classes are uninflected?   Expectation that ALL classes are uninfected, 1 in 100,000.

2020-08-07 07:26:06,"Good for DeWine that he’s going into self-quarantine. 

I’m a medical microbiologist.  Rapid antigen tests for viruses are both less sensitive and less specific than PCRs. DeWine’s discordant results aren’t particularly surprising (although the more usual scenario would be a negative antigen assay paired with a positive PCR).  Assuming adequate collection of his PCR sample, the likelihood is that he does not have COVID-19.  Still, that’s a likelihood, not a certainty, so I respect his doing the responsible thing and isolating himself. 

Also, the lower accuracy of rapid antigen tests doesn’t mean they aren’t very useful in managing the pandemic, likely even more useful than PCR and other nucleic acid tests. Not only are they simple, fast and cheep, their lower sensitivity means that in most cases, unlike DeWine’s, a positive CoV antigen test correlates better with infectivity than a positive PCR, which can remain positive for weeks after an infected patient is no longer capable of passing the virus to others."

This is our 3rd corona virus that could have been pandemic: SARS, MERS, and now COVID. Experts warned this could happen, so we shouldn't be surprised. Pandemics have occurred throughout human history -- there will be another. A federal response team was in place, but Trump dismantled it. We must pay attention going forward so we can respond to the next one. I doubt that will happen if Trump is reelected. 

I am sad that some Americans won't wear a mask. It is particularly sad because schools will soon open without protection for teachers & other staff. Without funding, schools cannot protect staff. In my opinion, it is unconscienceable to ask them to open without tools to do it safely. The federal department of education has much to answer for. 

Some people absurdly babble on about their right to not wear a mask. There is nothing in the constitution that gives people rights without attendant responsibilities. Clearly we need more education about civic responsibility. 

I've seen young folk congregating who shouldn't, but I tend to cut them slack because initial news stories said they were low risk. Without a strong federal public health campaign to explain that they will pass the virus to older contacts, that's hard to pull back. I've seen elderly obese men with oxygen tanks and no mask in box stores, so I don't think it's fair to throw blame at a particular demographic."

HIs lack of empathy and concern for the suffering of unemployed workers and  for distressed state and local governments is mind boggling. He needs to retire from politics and be repudiated by the voters of Kentucky  since he no longer deserves the position and the honor of serving the public. Sometimes the interests of the nation, especially during a raging pandemic,  take precedence over ideology and political calculations."
2020-08-06 13:12:34,The article doesn’t mention the simple idea that the majority leader could get a package passed if he would simply bring it to the floor for a vote. With demo rates and desperate republicans there certainly would be 51 and likely a filibuster proof majority. Yet over his tenure he will only bring a bill forward if it has major support of his caucus. So much for two party government.
2020-08-06 13:16:32,"This just reinforces the importance of Democrats getting a majority in the Senate in this election cycle.
Without that majority Mitch will, if Biden is President, do all he can to undermine the President even if it means creating a second great depression."
2020-08-06 13:02:13,"The staggering incompetence of the Trump playbook continues. The GOP needs to show it ""cares"" by passing more aid to the people and economy. The GOP and Trump needs a positive bill to stimulate some good news before the election in November. So what do they do? Insist on immunity for business and employers. The inane leading the insane. 

The Blue Wave will be a tsunami."
2020-08-06 13:25:24,McConnell and his GOP minions are incapable of governing.  All  they do is obstruct and deny.  I hope the Kentucky voters have finally realized that they are getting played by McConnell.  It's time for McConnell to go back to Kentucky and stay there.
2020-08-06 12:42:55,Mitch needs a strong dose of the spotlight.
2020-08-06 13:06:53,I am not sure Mr. McConnell fully grasps the powder keg that he is sitting on right now.
2020-08-06 13:20:11,"“This is not play money,” McConnell says.

Right. It’s not like we’re spending it on something important... like a $2 trillion tax cut for Fortune 500 corporations and vulture capitalists."
2020-08-06 13:02:11,"The Republican party has proven time and again, it is not fit to govern. Tax cuts and conservative, i.e. business friendly, judges is not a platform, it's just their marching orders from the plutocrats who fund their campaigns and reward their fealty with a cushy ""retirement plan"" of a job in the GOP Industrial Complex. Any challenge outside of this narrow purview, and they are at a complete loss. With millions on the point of financial ruin, even starvation, they reflexively resurrect their fears about the debt, and of rewarding slackers. The slackers in this case however are not their usual scapegoats of minorities and urbanites, they're their own voters. Even McConnell has enough awareness to realize this is going to come back and bite them in November, as opposed to many of his less gifted comrades, who are men of such deliberately low caliber that they remain cheerfully oblivious."
2020-08-06 13:26:05,McConnell is committed to teh principle of government of the people; by the rich and for the rich.  He learned this view from William McKinley and has never seen a need to modify it.
2020-08-06 13:24:31,"Why isn’t the money McConnell and Republicans say has yet to be spent not being spent now? There is a need and yet the money just sits there? 

Please explain Leader McConnell."
2020-08-06 13:32:03,McConnell sat on the bill that was passed by the House for over two months.  He did nothing.  The Republican's in the Senate did nothing.  McConnell has quashed many bills that were passed by House over the current congressional term. These included raising the minimum wage; and expanding and protecting voting rights - just to name two.  McConnell is a leader whenever a tax cut for corporations or the rich are on the table.  He is a leader when it comes to abolishing regulations for clean water and clean air.  He is a champion for the de-funding of social security and Medicare.  McConnell isn't in the room by design.  He will blame Democrats and the administration for inflating the national debt while absolving himself and his party for the three rounds of tax reform over the course of thirty years that have bankrupted the country.
2020-08-06 12:58:11,"Who are the 20 or so Republicans that oppose any second relief package? What states are they from? How many people live in those states? 

The answer may show the total dysfunctional nature of the structure of the US Senate - an institution designed to preserve the political power of the slavery/Jim Crow states.

It is time to restructure the Senate as well as end the Electoral College."
2020-08-06 13:01:56,"So called ‘stimulus’ money for corporations aside, the mere notion that it is even up for discussion whether or not to provide unemployment benefits to people who have been ordered out of work by the government is an incomprehensible disgrace that looks more like Stalinist Russia than modern America. I never thought I would live to see the day that this government would literally be starving its own citizens deliberately. I am disgusted beyond words."

2020-08-06 13:22:48,"After all that he and his Republican members did to President Obama, this is what he gets and rightly deserves.  We need a working government that will work for the all citizens.  We need a working government to get us out of this health and economic crises.   Vote McConnell, other Republicans and Trump out of office come this November.  Let’s vote those into Congress who want to work to for us, not the powerful few.  Then maybe the days of the good ole boys running the show will end."

2020-08-06 13:24:16,"The fact of the matter is that the only thing that will help the Republican senators now at risk is the House’s plan, or 90% of it at least.  Those Republicans not now at risk will BE at risk if they vote for the House’s plan, or so they think.

If nothing gets done, things will keep getting worse and worse on the run up to the election.

Economic and pandemic devastation is now hitting the red states, and the Republicans can seem to do nothing about it."
2020-08-06 12:58:47,"The reason the Republicans have succeeded in the past is that the Democrats have generally caved, thinking that something is better than nothing.  This time, like the shutdown of the government by Trump, is different.  This time the Republicans are truly offering nothing, cutting unemployment benefits so the 1% can have expensive lunches and businesses can escape liability.  The challenge for the Democrats is to overcome the media reporting and their own lack of good messaging to make the American public understand that the Democrats are fighting for them.  Maybe they should ask for help from the Lincoln Project."
2020-08-06 13:01:17,"McConnell never allows a vote unless it is part of a bipartisan package with the House or if he has 51 votes in his own caucus.

The one time he miscalculated, the late John McCain turned thumbs down on repeal of the ACA.

He is not in the room because on this occasion he cannot enter it with 51 votes in his pocket.

He knows the only way a new relief bill will pass is with Democratic votes - a lot of them, maybe all of them and very likely far more of them than Senate Republican votes.

He is going to need anywhere from six to a couple of dozen Democratic votes in the Senate to pass a bill.

For McConnell, this is lose lose and the only way the country wins is with that loss."
2020-08-06 13:06:05,"McConnell and the GOP don't legislate. They obstruct. As a fun game, I like to ask Republicans to name one major piece of legislation the GOP has passed in the last 30 years. Of course they can't. What I want to know is: How can a guy like McConnell with a 25% approval rating in his own state get elected over and over again? So sketchy.

I really hope his constituents finally wake up and VOTE HIM OUT!"
2020-08-06 13:11:45,"It is hard to negotiate with Democrats who promise everything plus the kitchen sink to Americans. They are willing to financially devastate our future to ensure that they defeat Trump. And, with a too often complicit media, their attempts to use this legislation to accomplish their far left goals that have nothing to do with the virus are not reported. If the federal bonus disappears, a large number of the unemployed will miraculously return to work—that bonus is driving unemployment and has been for 4 months. Just look at how the Blue Governor of my State used that program by laying off State employees for one day so they could receive the entire $600 plus 80% of their pay and State unemployment benefits. Now that the $600 is ending, Gov Whitmer just called all those government employees back to work. It’s a miracle."

2020-08-06 13:21:18,"Of course it was prudent to see how the money would be spent. The problem is the GOP washed their hands of ""the problem"" and did nothing while they were supposedly ""evaluating."" They patted themselves on the back and took more vacation. That's what the Senate does. They, like the President, refused to listen to science to see that the virus was not going away. Our country is in crisis and the GOP's biggest concern is ""ObamaGate.""

Senator Cornyn: Your leader isn't a magician. You can't pass the responsibility for a solution to party leadership when you yourself failed to build a foundation for it by failing to inform your constituency about the problem. Acknowledge that you've misled them. Acknowledge that you've proselytized nonsense White House conspiracy theories about the pandemic. Admit that you and your party gutted the national healthcare system to aid and abet a grudge the President has against his predecessor. State that you do not have a workable replacement for it.

And once you've come clean, get busy working the occupants of the Russell Building to convince the 20-30 members who, like Trump, still believe it will simply and miraculously ""just go away."" Do your job."

2020-08-06 13:30:10,"There’s politics and there’s leadership both lacking in the White House and Republican leadership especially Mitch McConnell. How disingenuous it is for Senate Republicans to balk at helping Americans get food on their tables and rent paid but no hesitation to pass a massive tax break. They’re now claiming to be worrying about the deficit.
   It’s time to stop blaming Trump for his disastrous presidency and hold the Republican leadership responsible for enabling his behavior. They have been so cowardly to speak up and we’re all suffering as a result. If Congress doesn’t take control of overseeing the pandemic response, we are all in for a long healtn and economic crisis."

Having realized that no bill will appeal to all his caucus and their narrow majority, he's got to avoid taking the blame for whatever gets cobbled together. He hasn't remained in the Republican leadership for so long by going against the more hardcore members of his party."
2020-08-06 13:28:22,"Republicans have stood by quietly for 4 years as federal deficits and debt skyrocketed on their reckless tax cuts, and as the trump administration doled out endless aid to farmers struggling due to trump policies, and now they can't get their act together when America actually needs them for a change.

Last time he was up for re-election against Alison Lundergan Grimes, I worked on her campaign with one of my daughters. At debates and rallies when McConnell would show up, there were no supporters carrying signs or any real people from Kentucky there. It was just a bunch of young, hair-slicked back white guys wearing starched  jeans with overly-formal brown leather shoes. I know this may be TMI, but it was weird, like they'd been dropped in from the Beltway to be fake ""supporters,"" when they were clearly working for him. Fast forward to just before the election - there were bumper stickers, signs on people's lawns, on busy intersections, etc., for Grimes, but we could not find 1 for McConnell. On election day, out of the blue, there were signs along all major roads & intersections, appearing literally overnight, spaced closely together (lots of manpower needed) for McConnell. Those signs, all identical, popped up like weeds overnight.He ended up winning, & those signs disappeared just as fast. He is not ""of"" this state, & doesn't interact at all with the people of Kentucky. We'd be better off having one of those flimsy signs represent the people here, instead of Mitch. He deliberately chose not to advance the HEROES Act, and he has waited until the last minute, pretending to care about Kentuckians, which he does not."

But, the package rammed through the House - a $3 trillion boondoggle for cities, states, and even for those states imposing the highest income taxes on their richest citizens - is a non-starter. 

The Senate Republicans put together a good package focused on the pandemic and its economic fallout. 

Anything over and above that package will be as wasteful as the previous pork-filled bailouts and will be fatal for Senate Republicans.

Senator McConnell should hold his ground. Members of his Republican caucus need to wise up and support him before the final label of 'irrelevant' is tattooed on each of them."

2020-08-06 13:36:47,"The hallmark of McConnell's tenure as senate majority leader has been the turtle-esque behavior of the Republican Party. In any crisis, they hide in their shells, avoiding tough decisions. They pretend that the pandemic will magically disappear, hope that children magically will not spread the virus, pray that the president will become more presidential, pray harder that the president has learned his lesson from being impeached, ignore that the Russians are interfering in our elections and placing bounties on the lives of our soldiers, ignore climate change, hide behind the 2nd Amendment, and fail to bring hundreds of bills passed by the House up for a vote in the Senate. 

The only proactive steps they take are to maintain their power: gerrymandering, voter suppression, manipulation of the census to undercount minorities, stacking the courts with under-qualified conservatives, and reducing taxes on their donors. There has never been a more self-serving and cowardly bunch of politicians in our history."
2020-08-06 13:51:24,"It’s always republican obstruction.   

McConnell is not outside the room. The problem is that he wants to do a deal that all republicans vote yes on.  Since many are not up for re-election, they have decided they don’t care.  So, no deal.  

McConnell could get a deal if he worked with democrats and he won’t and that is the problem."

There aren't ""two sides"" to this debate.  You are either with the American people or you are against them.  You are either willing to save American families from a disaster not of their own making or you are willing to see them suffer and take the economy with them as they can no longer pay bills or make purchases. 

Either the need to mete out punitive measures against individuals outweighs the need to keep the economy moving or it does not. 

You can't throw a quarter of a life saving ring to someone and expect them to float.

And if there is no bottom beneath them you can't tell then just to stand up."
2020-08-06 13:42:03,"This situation is a perfect demonstration of how the Republican Party blind obeisance to Newt Gingrich's playbook over the past 20 years has destroyed all functionality of our federal government.

Gingrich's playbook (which McConnell faithfully abides by) demands that all Republicans must obey their party leadership on every issue, the goal of which is to create a monolithic bloc by which the party can retain its power.

Individual Republican legislators are not ""allowed"" to vote their conscience nor vote in the best interests of their particular constituents.  McConnell won't even allow legislation to come to the floor for a vote unless ""he has the votes.""

In fact, it's so rare for any Republican to vote ""against their party"" that when one does so on a piece of significant legislation, it becomes a newsworthy event; i.e. the press speculates with bated breath for many days before the vote whether any of the handful of ""renegades"" will dare to vote ""with the Democrats.""

Sure, the Dem leadershipped corrals their team on many issues.  But it's not at all uncommon to find individual Dems voting differently than the majority of their party (especially in the House), and it's rarely a newsworty event.

In other words, the Republicans care more about the power of their party than about voting for legislation which addresses the needs of their constituents (or the country as a whole).

Hopefully, their ""Let them eat cake"" will finally exorcise the demons of Gingrichism."

2020-08-06 14:26:52,"Things won't get better with McConnell, the man who once was forced to filibuster his own bill, running the Senate. His expertise is in blowing legislation up, not really passing things. 

Hit the pause button? For him to think that taking initial steps -- the first aid package -- and long-range planning -- what should or must come next -- are mutually exclusive is to consign America to failure. It's also an abdication of responsibility. And salt in the wounds of people Republicans want to deny enhanced unemployment benefits because the money isn't what would conventionally be regarded as earned. (Imagine: A congress that does little to no work and gets paid trying to shame working people for taking money they didn't punch a time clock for. Say that out loud on the phone to your senators and reps.)

Right now, Republicans' failures are a big part of our many crises, crises that won't be brought under control with them at the helm. Period."
2020-08-06 14:29:34,"Mr. Cornyn, the ears are not the only fuzzy thing about Mr. McConnell. Integrity comes to mind. There are so many bills from the House sitting idle on his desk, that perhaps he has forgotten how to negotiate because he is so out of practice. Last week he excused the Senate from even working on Friday with this disaster looming. Congress has a four week summer recess beginning the day after tomorrow. What are the chances he will keep the Senate open to solve this problem if it is not resolved before the break?

""We found out the virus didn't magically disappear."" Was he seriously considering it would? Wouldn't it be prudent to map out a plan just in case? If this is an attempt at humor, tell that to the unemployed folks who just lost their supplement checks and wondering where to find rent and grocery money.

This man has been acting in bad faith for years. I hope Kentucky voters will see the light and send him packing in November."
2020-08-06 13:35:17,"Ten years ago, when the economy was in shambles and Republicans were in the minority, they did their level best to stonewall any recovery aid. Now Democrats are in the minority, and they offer more robust plans than the majority party. They could let the country burn and be rewarded in November, as Republicans were in 2010.

Only one of these parties acts like a governing party at any given time, and it's not Republicans."

Look who is in the room—Mark Meadows—known for his disastrous government shutdown in the past.

Toss in Trump’s trivial pursuits like money for redecorating the West Wing and FBI building that will not do anything to help in the worst economic and pandemic crises in a century.

So basically except for the May bill by House Democrats, there’s nothing.  

Two closing walls like steel dumpster walls closing on the part of Republicans and the White House with tens of millions of Americans caught in the squeeze about to lose their homes, health, businesses, and lives.

As effective as Murdoch's Fox, and the other right wing media (OANN, Brietbart, Sinclair) have been in distracting a significant percentage of voters with their fictional narratives of racism, xenophobia, religious ideology, and libertarian fantasy (?), a very real world of this pandemic and broken economy has impinged on their world view.  Now, suddenly, we all desperately need that ""awful ole big government"" republicans have so successfully trashed since Reagan. Increasingly we see those ""deep state"" bureaucrats, you know as the CDC, and other health related functions, actually contain talented and necessary elites to our national health and well being. Well what do you know!!"
2020-08-06 13:19:40,"This is all Mr. McConnell knows how to do. He's an obstructionist by nature. His modus operandi is to wait until the last minute for legislation of national importance and hope to use the pain and suffering of Americans as leverage to cow the Democratic contingent to concede some irresponsible policy on the GOP's wish list. We saw it aplenty during the Obama years, particularly with the Bush tax cuts and badly needed economic relief funds. 

Thankfully, Mrs. Pelosi is having none of it. She should not give an inch. No ridiculous liability coverage, no payroll tax cut, no more acts of Republican fiscal irresponsibility. Mr. Trump is president, Mr. McConnell runs the senate -- this is the GOP's government. If they cannot pass responsible legislation, then they should feel the wrath of the evicted and the unemployed in November. 

These men do not know how to govern. Mr. McConnell has no coherent plan for this country. Trillions in tax cuts have shown absolutely no promise of the economic growth that they promised would offset lost revenue (always a fantasy to anyone with a brain). Now, he quibbles over much smaller amounts because suddenly he has become cognizant of too much spending! Meanwhile, the Republican senators and Republican White House have gone on a spending splurge of mammoth proportions for the past 3.5 years. They are stealing from the future of this country.

These men build nothing. They are the true looters. Their only coherent policy is to loot our treasury."
2020-08-06 13:38:21,"Well, Mitch McConnell is now finding out that he's boxed himself in. He's spent his entire career in Washington bowing and scraping before the coal barons, the lords of the fossil fuel industry, the right-wing banksters and the huge family fortunes in the shadows that have a vested interest in perpetuating racism and gerrymandering and other forms of voter suppression.

The ""leader"" is now beginning to understand that his beggared state, third in line at the national trough, actually has (white) people who have lost their jobs to the virus; who have lost what health insurance they had to the virus; who have perhaps lost relatives and friends to the virus, and now want answers. They have blindly blackened McConnell's name in on their ballots since 1984, content with his anti-progressive stances. His inherited racism dovetailed nicely with their us vs. them approach to life.

McConnell has railed, all his political life, against ""moochers"" and ""freeloaders"" and ""those others"" who hog the public benefits, those (blacks and minorities) who would laze the day away and live off the tax money that is paid by all those hard-working (white) people. It's always worked in Kentucky (and elsewhere); but now, folks are finding out that he doesn't care for them much at all outside of an election cycle.

The sum of $600.00 per week isn't a great deal of money to the Republicans on The Hill, especially in the Senate, but it's the difference, for Kentuckians, between a home and the street."

His legislative record as Leader is tactical; he does not loom as an important figure but ultimately a footnote in American history. Frankly McConnell may have a more significant role in Russian history by squashing protests against its  interference in our elections. 

McConnell knows the Senate is lost so he must decide if there is more money for him and the party by acquiescing to the Democrats,  or appeasing the wealthy hard right and walking away. The latter fuels campaigns in 2022. 

Whatever decision McConnell makes  has nothing to do with the state of the nation."
2020-08-06 14:48:55,"Pelosi is teaching Trump and McConnell a harsh lesson in power politics. When 30 million people are unemployed, when our economy has plummeted, and when tens of millions Americans are hungry, you don’t quibble over nickels and dimes. Instead, you do what component economists unanimously recommend, in keeping with J. M. Keynes: PUMP MASSIVE MONEY INTO THE ECONOMY.
While Pelosi with the HEROS act in May, has set the standard, Trump has blathered about a new FBI building, replacing Pentagon money that to took for the wall, and a nonsensical pause in the payroll tax.

Meanwhile, McConnell has been sidelined and can’t obtain Republican consensus on anything. Pelosi’ s hard ball fight for the American unemployed will Trump McConnell’s pathetic efforts to claim legislative victory. This kerfuffle will heighten the prospects for a Democratic Senate in November."

2020-08-06 14:58:27,"Mitch McConnell has successfully been in control of the Senate - and our government - by implementing a policy of non-governance, i.e. one of doing nothing. He has squandered all the opportunities senate Republicans had to address immigration reform, health care reform, DACA, income tax reform and more by refusing to actually lead. His approach has always been to sit back, do nothing, let Democrats develop and pass legislation, and then torpedo that legislation at the last minute. McConnell and his Republican peers have had over a DECADE to present a comprehensive health care plan. And have done NOTHING. 

Perhaps this time it will come back to bite them all, since this inaction doesn’t only hurt “the other folks.” It hurts ALL Americans, including the Republican base of voters and moderates."

By any measure, Kentucky is a mess*. It is poor, unhealthy, under-employed, non-competitive, poorly educated, addicted, and despairing. While Mitch has been off playing tactician, his state has continued to sink. McConnell is a heartless, cold, ruthless man who is out for himself. Maybe the chickens are finally coming home to roost.

The prevailing media narrative blames the delay on ""Congress'""  rather than on Republican Senators. As usual the media lets the Republicans off lightly here because of its penchant for false equivalence and ""both siderism."" 

The Times tells the story but not in the headline or in the lead, making readers work to find it. Other outlets do much worse!

It's our money. And the vast majority of us...need it. Now.

Duh. The Democrats anticipated this outcome back in May, as did anyone else with a functioning brain & an observant eye. Those of us stuck in red states watching our state governments flip-flop, flounder, & argue with our Democratic mayors over restrictions & mask-wearing, while covidiots opened their businesses in defiance of local authorities, to the applause of assault-weapon-toting fools—we also saw the resurgence coming. We wrote our Republican Senators & begged them to participate in the legislation process, & they ignored us. 

We are in this situation because Republicans ignore the people they don’t feel like representing, & pay attention only to those with whom they are in ideological agreement. They have to learn to listen. As Senator Maisie Hirono pointed out to Ted Cruz, when she left his grandstanding anti-left-wing hearing yesterday, “You don’t listen.” Her experience with him mirrors mine. Ted Cruz does not listen. He is incapable of paying attention to anyone he doesn’t agree with, & therefore incapable of fairly representing a large, diverse constituency such as the state of Texas. Too bad he is not up for re-election this year, but we have a chance to get rid of Cornyn — another man who doesn’t listen in non-election years, but who is currently putting on a big show in which he pretends to sympathize with the “little” people."

Both of these brakes on inflation can take effect without further Congressional action.  The alternative is a long, slow return to full employment, destroying trillions in future productive capacity."

This is one of those ""War is peace,"" ""Ignorance is strength"" moments. Double-speak isn't usually so direct. Point blank: McConnell is outside the ""room where it happens.""

However, I do believe McConnell when he says every move is calculated. If you want a deal though, you don't send Trump and team into negotiate. It's like asking Godzilla to manage Tokyo's urban revitalization. If anything but rubble comes out of that room, I'll be shocked.

Obviously getting a deal done isn't Mitch's primary concern then. No, I think McConnell is attempting to abdicate blame to the White House. Deal or no deal, Republicans are just following in Trump's footsteps. If Mr. ""Art of the Deal"" couldn't get it done, the failure somehow belongs to the Democrats. That's what they'll tell you anyway."
2020-08-06 15:19:38,"I never thought I’d say this, but am I seeing an iota of a heart and soul inside of McConnell? Does he genuinely have SOME empathy, where the president has none of? Or is he putting on a show, because of the election of his senate position is probably in jeopardy. Sorry, but still, not sorry if he feels pressured. He’s caught between a rock and a hard place, which he helped create by supporting and covering for the president. He spent almost 4 years pushing through whatever trump wanted, while disregarding the lives of the people living in the US! He actually said something that contradicts what the president said, “it’s still here.” While trump says it’s disappearing, the majority is beginning to see the truth, it’s not disappearing. Now with flu season around the corner, what will happen if people come down with the flu, will that lower their resistance (if any) to Covid-19? How will they fight both at once?"

The financial, physicial and emotional health of millions of Americans like me comes down to whether or not McConnell has “fuzzy ears” about a deal?!?! Do his “fuzzy ears” pop out before or after he injects the disinfectant and enjoys a private moment with his “healing” light?

I’m a self-employed freelancer who at least had some money in the bank before the coronavirus hit. My son is an adult and I no longer have to support him. So I’ve been doing OK financially with help from unemployment and the bit of work I’ve managed to find. But the stress is taking its toll. I cannot imaging the stress of families with kids at home, especially single parents, trying to juggle work, school and survival.

And Republicans are waiting for “fuzzy ears.” I guess disease, death, food insecurity, eviction and decimation of the U.S. economy aren’t big enough signs that they need to do something NOW to help us “little people” survive."

And now his fellow Republicans are worried about having to face their constituents desperate for Federal aid.

But honestly, I could only laugh out loud to read that these same Republicans are now worried that Trump will drag them down in November's election.  That's something they should have been worried about for the past three-and-a-half years."

He said he was fully apprised of the substance of the bargaining.""

Let me restate that for you.

Moscow Mitch is taking the position that whatever Speaker Pelosi negotiates with the White House is good enough for him.  I hope Speaker Pelosi gives only 1/16 of an inch, and only after she gets miles from the Republicans.

His job is to find 13 Republicans who will sign on to get the bill past a possible filibuster.  He must think that is a tough job, considering that Collins, McSally, Gardner and Tillis are probably jumping through hoops to get this bill done, and Mitt Romney is probably guided by his Mormon faith to ""do the right thing.""

I imagine that Moscow Mitch needs to find 7 more Republicans if he votes in favor.  7 out of 47 other Republicans. 

Can you do that job, Moscow Mitch?"

The $600 was also a major reason the economy did not completely crumble, it was a stimulus for millions.

Millions of of children are hungry as are their families.  Food his is important. States have millions of vital service employees that need aid, Money to these states is urgent,

The inflation should be 25% but we all, the government first, pretend that all is hunky-dory and happily live in fantasy corona-world.  Just look at th stock market, flying high, enriching already rich, and spitting in the face of those losing jobs.
McConnell is not guilty for any of that but he is dragging his feet and is not having an idea (what the Dems deal is not an idea at all, it's a buying-votes activity).

It is really an abdication of his role as a political leader.  

He needs to make the hard decisions along with everyone else and then collectively take responsibility for them.  I do not think any politicians pulled stunts like this back in the day.  I could be wrong, but I am thinking about someone like LBJ with civil rights bills.  He took tremendous political risk, but he stood by his decisions.

McConnell's state of Kentucky is among the states in the worst shape, and he has a viable contender for his seat. It would be poetic justice if this was the hill that he would die his political death upon. 

But back to blaming the Democrats. If Democratic leaders don't make the situation crystal clear to voters, the Republicans might just get away with shifting the blame. The GOP failure of leadership should be trumpeted to the skies by Democrats (or better, the Lincoln Project or other Republican opponents of Trump).

Reduce PAC money influence
Reduce corruption

Look beyond the politicians and go deeper. There are very separate ideas on how we should function as a country! Trumpers are showing this to be true!

The GDP has cratered as a result. More than a million people filed for unemployment last week bringing the total to more than 20,000,000 Americans. The let the relief deadline date pass, meaning there will be an unconscionable and catastrophic wave of homelessness in our country.

Let Democrats come up with the solution to good governance, stonewall, then begrudgingly accept a portion of their plans as the demand mounts after long inaction. McConnell has turned the Senate into a sleepy, dysfunctional institution incapable of performing the most basic tasks."

That one sentence sums up why we are where we are today. I always thought McConnell was an intelligent fellow (albeit with beliefs and positions that I sometimes oppose), but that statement left me flabbergasted. It's something I would expect from the dystopian and delusional world our Orange president lives in, but not from the ranking Republican in Congress who has shown himself to be adept at handing crises in the past. How do you just expect a virus to disappear? Which virus in the history of the world has just disappeared without a vaccine?

Any manager in a corporation will tell you that you hope for the best but plan for the worst. There is no harm in seeing how the previous stimulus plays out, especially since it is future taxpayer money (aka debt) they are spending. However, while hoping the virus goes away, Republicans should have developed Plans B, C, D, and E in the case of a surge of cases.  They had 2 months to do this and they sat around twiddling their thumbs hoping for the virus to ""disappear"", and now they have been caught flat-footed. It's a shame that developing nations like India and China can muster a better response for their citizens and handling the virus than the U.S."

They went home instead of figuring out how to get more and better relief to those actually in need.

These are 3 distinct (by no means consistent) political & moral logics, all rolled into one scheme boiling down to paying regular UI (the most, but by by no means completely, non-charitable aspect), then giving those entitled to (a), while CRUELLY  **excluding others**, $600 weekly bonus that can only be understood as (b) & (c), which are subsidized by everybody who paid taxes in the past, will pay taxes now, & will in the future, including the *poorest of the poor*. Yes, those $600 payments for middle class recipients are subsidized by those too poor (deemed by the gov't unworthy) to receive them. 

In brief: (b) & (c) are ""charity"" by the standard practical contemporary meaning: money given to those not transactionally doing/providing anything in exchange, received from parties similarly not getting anything in exchange.

(a), despite what many people say, also is ""substantially"" charitable in nature. Gov't compels employers to subsidize charity for the unemployed:

""The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), w/ state unemployment systems, provides for payments of unemployment compensation to workers who have lost their jobs. Most employers pay both a Federal & a state unemployment tax.""

$600 weekly gifts to already compensated unemployment recipients, ignoring those much more direly in heed, is obscenely cruel and inequitable."

If either bill were to pass it would be a step in the right direction and would challenge Trump to veto it, something I think he would dare not do in and election year.

For the recent past, people have been patching together a living by working multiple part-time jobs. The fastest growing sector for many years has been service/retail, which no one disputes pays little and has irregular hours. Now these workers are enduring even more disruption.

I don't see ""Help Wanted"" signs on every street, I see darkened storefronts. I know too many people who've lost their jobs and are continually getting their hours cut when they do have jobs.

How is it we keep getting distracted through misplaced loyalty to these fantasies of workers lolling about when people even have contrary evidence? Even the ones ""unjustly"" getting the temporary payouts will spend the money, which will barely balance those of us hesitating to spend. Someone shouts out the allegation and everyone just group hallucinates.

McConnell is on the wrong side of the payments equation - his state pays for no one - no other state and least of all its own citizens. He should be ashamed of himself for his hypocrisy and stinginess. And typical - Trump just sees an opportunity to further profit for himself. You're completely accurate that Moscow Mitch has himself in a bind between his disloyal, greedy Master and his ill will towards his constituents and his country.

He has immeasurably damaged our court system, tilted the balance of power to the haves and have-nots in a way never before experienced in the US. His racist roots and sympathies come from his home state of AL. He allowed Trump free reign on weakening regulations which protect Americans, like the dismantlement of the CDC. He cared nothing for the health of people in his own state, fighting every attempt to get better health insurance for the working poor. His record on just about everything is abysmal. He failed to hold hearings on a moderate but highly respected Judge (Merrick Garland) and instead supported the appointment of a misogynistic, beer guzzling, credibly accused rapist.

Trump takes no responsibility for  the most basic function of our government - taking care of our people in a crisis.

And McConnell is doing everything he can to avoid responsibility for whatever ends up in the relief bill, and for any pain it causes to voters.  It's a continuation of his utter abdication of the Legislative Branch's duties to the Executive Branch, which has allowed Trump to essentially become a dictator.

McConnell does not work for Trump.  His job description contains nothing about oversight by the POTUS.  He heads an entirely co-equal branch of government - sitting in the same position in the Senate as Trump sits in the White House.

But craven cowardice never works as a leadership quality.  And so we, The People, are stuck  with whatever crumbs our Banana Republic Dictator decide are essential to keep him in office.

2020-08-06 18:42:08,"OK.  Latest data is that first time unemployment claims came in at 1.2 Million.  This proves that the economy is still contracting sharply.  Given this, additional stimulus is required.  And, according to 80% of economists, this stimulus should be ROBUST, erring on the side of too much rather than too little.  This is not a difficult concept.

If the current HEROES bill stipulated that the additional stimulus should go only to the top 1% of wage earners, this bill would sail through the senate.  But the more important fact is that this stimulus is absolutely necessary, and is desperately needed.  So, to you senate republicans facing re-election, hold your nose and approve the bill.  We only need a handful of you to join the senate democrats to get this done.  America is on its knees, and your jobs are on the line.   Do the right thing!!!"

One, McConnell has learned Never offer anything until he has  an iron clad agreement from Trump to sign the bill. That's why is more than happy to let Meadows and Mnuchin do the negotiating because they are in fact doing Trump's bidding. Only then will he get involved and strong arm his Republican members to vote for it or face the wrath of Trump and his twitter fingers.

Second, he and his GOP conference are losing faith by the hour that Trump will be re-elected. So the hardliners , the 15-20 Senators who have already decided not to vote for any additional stimulus money or looking to the future,  are not interested in any deals for any reason.
In the Purity first and never Compromise GOP not voting for a stimulus is how they see themselves surviving attacks from the right in their own primaries. And of course seizing power when Trump departs.

Important to remember in today's Republican Party the Public Good is never taken into consideration. Power accumulation to dispense favors and advantage. Combined with the ability to wage Culture Wars to keep the Republican Base in line are all that matters.

""Public policy designed to help workers who lose their jobs can lead to structural unemployment as an unintended side effect. . . .  In other countries, particularly in Europe, benefits are more generous and last longer.  The drawback to this generosity is that it reduces a worker’s incentive to quickly find a new job.  Generous unemployment benefits in some European countries are widely believed to be one of the main causes of “Eurosclerosis,” the persistent high unemployment that affects a number of European countries.”

McConnell doesn’t want to risk advancing legislation the president may balk at signing, so he steps back to let the president’s henchmen work out something they hope the boss will approve.

Wake up!  Every day and every hour, Trump, his toadies, and the whole Republican Party gives you countless reasons to vote them out.  Wolves in sheep’s clothing, they are the enemies of everyone but the richest and most racist Americans.  Their every action BEGS to get them voted out."

There are about 15-20 Republican senators who really, for ideological reasons,  don’t want to spend much more money on the 30 million unemployed Americans. There are also some who object to the $600 per week extra unemployment compensation, because it can incentivize some to avoid working.

Trump and the Trump sycophants in the Senate could not care less about the ideology relating to the $600 per week extra unemployment compensation. The Trumpists have  only one objective in the negotiations regarding the new Covid-19 legislation. Their sole objective is to be able to say, over and over again, to the 30 million unemployed Americans that: Trump and the Republicans wanted to keep giving you the $600 per week extra unemployment compensation, but the Democrats took that money away from you, to subsidize the big Democratic controlled cities.

The 2008 financial crisis demonstrates that when a substantial number of people stop paying their mortgages and other debts, there can be very serious ramifications for the financial system and thus for the entire economy.

McConnell knew this virus was coming in January when President Trump spoke of it at the State of the Union Address. Yet did nothing, absolutely nothing!! Meanwhile countries such as Germany and New Zealand had financial assistance ready and waiting. Testing and contact tracing available and these countries and their citizens are thriving. The USA is like a 3rd world country in so many ways right now. McConnell, Cornyn and all Republicans have had months, MONTHS to fix this issue! Here we are almost 8 months later after that State of Union Address and in worse shape than in March. Instead Moscow Mitch acts like the mayor from JAWS, forcing people back into the water. This virus is not going away. As a country Americans do not like to be told what to do like stay at home and wear a mask. McConnell could have helped. The result is the virus is rampant in our country. Other countries are moving forward and reopening. But McConnell and Cornyn have put their party before their country.

2020-08-06 21:57:40,"Again reiterating the gist of my many comments: dividing $2.2 trillion (CARES) among 331 million Americans averages $6,700 each, a staggering figure. The basc moral baseline (below which is sheer moral  DEPRAVITY) is to give each adult below the poverty line a MINIMUM of HALF that average.

Instead, the poor have been getting crumbs (at best, a mere $1,200) so the middle class can be protected first, many enjoying increased (over their pre-pandemic earnings) so they can enjoy a ""staycation"", many having taken about $13,000 - plus the $1,200 the poor got, those that zctually received it-- for these 20 weeks of the CARES Act. 

No adult should get more than 3 times the amount of subsidy than the least-receiving adult living below the poverty line gets. Now, many in the middle class are getting 15x the amount the poor get, the poor getting 1/15 what the middle class gets. 

In pure unemployment compensation, the middle class should get the 60% (or whatever it is) they normally get from unemployment insurance. Beyond that, stimulus funds must be distributed equitably, or if anything favoring the poor. Not the poor getting 1/15 what the middle class gets."

And he needn't worry about being evicted from his comfy den or Elaine from her sewing room, as will millions after the moratorium on evictions ran out.

Or have to be concerned of their Covid testing schedule as the folks who lost their healthcare thanks to his lack of insight and cowtowing to 45.

2020-08-05 18:37:56,"when they run ads on the radio about insurance fraud, ask yourself this question- who commits fraud more often, claimants or insurers? Always remember that the people who sell you the insurance are not the people who pay off claims."
2020-08-05 18:41:45,"With language specifically excluding damages from disease, there no chance of a claim being paid. Also, I doubt any insurer would issue a policy that did cover pandemic disruption. Even if they did, nobody would want to pay that premium. It's a new world and we have to figure this out together."
2020-08-05 18:44:29,"The problem is that the exposure (pandemic loss) was not priced into the cost of the policy.  
Business Interruption is priced based on a physical impairment / exposures to the business e.g. fire, flood, winter storm, etc... 
Reinterpreting the coverage of the policy is
contrary to contract law."
2020-08-05 18:44:30,"One has to wonder how many business owners, who have paid thousands for business interruption insurance, really know what their policy says. Many business owners, and others, rely on the agents of these companies to meet their insurance needs, but the agents are primarily interested in selling a policy (and earning their commission). Most insurers, though, refuse to be bound by their agents' representations, so regardless of what was said, the printed policy controls. Policy language is so convoluted and obtuse, though, that even lawyers can have trouble deciding what is covered.

Logically one would think that business interruption insurance covers interruptions to business. The limitations and exclusions, though, seem to make many policies woefully ineffective for doing just that. 

Insurers complain that virus claims would hurt their bottom line and profitability. Loss of business, hurting the bottom line and profitability, is exactly why their insureds bought policies. In my opinion, unless business closures required by law are specifically excluded, policyholders should be covered. The reason for these mandated closures should not matter."
2020-08-05 18:45:22,"Insurance companies are not bottomless money pits.

It is easy to empathize with the pain of these business owners. But pandemic related business interruption losses are explicitly excluded from standard policies for very good reason. When SARS made its rounds years ago, insurers recognized that they were exposed to trillions of dollars worth of risk. The total amount of losses that would be incurred in this situation would put the entire industry in dire straits. The United States government has the ability to issue debt on an unparalleled scale and still is struggling to fund relief for its citizens. In what universe does a private enterprise have more access to capital than Uncle Sam?

If you retroactively change contract terms and rule against the insurance industry here, you also rule against homeowners, car owners, and all other users of insurance. Why? Because the industry will be bankrupted. And since the route taken to bankrupt it was by undermining contract law, don't expect it to come back either."
2020-08-05 18:45:26,This article highlights a very important point.  If insurers are looking retroactively at policies and claiming that it’s impossible to insure against a pandemic then they are effectively saying they cannot and therefore will not insure going forward.  This has seismic repercussions for the economy going forward.  What business would go forward in September or anytime if they can not obtain an insurance policy for virus coverage?   It’s basically saying jump at your own risk until there’s a vaccine.  This will hold back the economy far more than potential liability from employee safety.
2020-08-05 19:08:49,Flood coverage is written almost exclusively by the federal government due to the nature of the exposure. Coverage for pandemic loss would best be managed in a similar fashion and could be funded in part by assessing the insurance companies to hold down policy cost.
2020-08-05 19:19:28,"U.S. Gov't flood insurance premiums are driven by politics, NOT math. 

Flood insurance policies are dramatically under-priced relative to the risk, so the program is nearing insolvency. 

Who thinks the government's pandemic insurance would be any different?"
2020-08-05 19:24:56,"Insurers don't decide whether to pay or not based on what policies say.  First they ask, what will it cost the company to pay all possible claims under such policies? And will my reinsurers reimburse me? (See Asbestos, Superfund, Hurricane Katrina).  If they decide the loss is too great (premiums plus investment income minus claims paid = profit) and will not be reimbursed, they decide to deny.  Then they ask the lawyers to look at the policy and find reasons for denying.  And they say such losses are ""uninsurable."""
2020-08-05 19:26:59,"Strictly speaking, these are not “business interruption policies,” as they are referred to in the article, and therein lies the heart of the disconnect between what these policies provide, and the expectations of these business owners. The policies are property policies, which also provide business income coverage to cover business losses after a property loss."

2020-08-05 19:51:03,"I feel for business owners; I really do. But I've had a number of small business, homeowners', and umbrella liability policies over the years, and they've all excluded losses due to diseases. I read my insurance policies. If you buy a policy, don't read it, and then find that it doesn't cover something you thought it did... that's too bad, but hardly the insurer's fault."
2020-08-05 19:52:07,"I'm no fan of insurers ducking coverage with contorted policy interpretations. But it seems both grossly unfair, and unconstitutional, to demand any insurer pay for coronavirus losses when most policies have a specific virus or pandemic exclusion clause. Many of these policies were written up and priced, in part, on the basis of these exclusions. The judges denying these claims appear to be correctly applying the law to the facts, as well as ensuring economic fairness."
2020-08-05 20:03:49,This is really straight forward. Where a business interruption policy excludes losses from a viral epidemic the unfortunate business owner will lose in court.One can have great compassion for the victim of the virus but the language is clear. And the pain and loss suffered by the business owner play no role in the court room.  Follow the clear language of the policy.
2020-08-05 20:04:02,"A friend of mine has multiple restaurants, and has paid more than $1.7 million (million!) in premiums the last 15 years. She knows one isn’t covered - it specifically mentions virus that must be within 10 miles(?) of the location. No one has it within ten miles. 

HOWEVER - one doesn’t mention virus or disease being excluded. The insurance company isn’t paying. This is fraud, in my opinion (I used to have an insurance license). 

I’m hoping she survives long enough to be able to afford suing.

2020-08-05 20:04:28,"If the insurance policies specifically exclude coverage of these types of disaster then the insureds do not have much of a leg to stand on despite wishful thinking and sympathy.

2020-08-05 20:22:09,"With so much at stake, will some insurers deny even legit claims, gambling that stressed businesses can't afford to sue?"
2020-08-05 20:33:41,"The way to deal with pandemics should be a combination of government policy and private insurance.  We should learn from successful government programs around the world, like Germany's Kurzarbeit, in which the government simply took over paying the salaries of affected workers, which avoided layoffs and allowed businesses to get back up and running quickly when the crisis abated.  That would relieve small business owners (not only restaurateurs) of one of their biggest expenses, which is labor.  Second, the government should institute a mandatory moratorium on many types of debt payment during periods of government-mandated shutdown due to public health emergencies, such as mortgage, rent, and lease payments for durable equipment or company vehicles.  The missed payments would then be added on at the end of the lease, rent, etc. with no additional interest accrued.  With those big expenses dealt with, insurance companies would be looking at much smaller, more manageable losses to cover in the event of a pandemic, chiefly lost perishable inventory and owner's income.  That would make such policies viable and affordable since the risk to the insurance company is much smaller (remember, they're not paying out for property damage!).  As long as the loss is less than would typically be expected due to a fire, tornado, etc. they should be able to deal with it."
2020-08-05 20:34:20,"Insurers love raising premiums. They love getting your money. They don't like keeping their investments growing for that rainy day. When the rainy day comes, they cry ""poor"" and refuse to pay. The idea of insurance from the early days of Lloyds of London was to spread the liability and undergird the ability to pay claims with valuable investments. The insurers can't pay because they don't take care of their investments and rely on premiums for far too much of their worth.

Nope. They can't afford to pay every business that has been interrupted. But they will gladly charge even higher premiums next year."
2020-08-05 20:51:20,"Whoops. Too many business owners buy the insurance and don't read the policy or understand what they bought. They are not being properly served if they don't have an agent who explains the limits of their policies before purchase. We've been through numerous interruptions over the years, including physical damage to our premises due to storms, fires and floods. Flood coverage is part of our FEMA policy. No biz interruption coverage there. For the others, damage that stops operations is not enough, either. The evidence for a claim is loss of revenue tied to actual damage. As a manufacturing firm, if we make repairs and find a way to continue to ship product to keep our customers - something we really want to do - according to the policy, there is no interruption of revenue, therefore no claim for interruption, only for actual physical damages. Unhappiness from acting in ignorance is not really a legit excuse, folks. If you can prove you were mislead you might have a case, but not likely. Create a law to make those bad old insurance Companies pay up? Yeah. Everyone wants to be entitled to blame someone else for their incompetence. Sort of like our current POTUS."

The fact that our federal government has done such an appalling job in responding to the pandemic, in preserving jobs and business operations, continues to be the real story - and those affected should campaign, vote, and remember that this is how it happened."
2020-08-05 21:35:00,"Anyone who actually takes the time to read a standard property insurance policy will see that there is no intent to cover business interruption losses from a pandemic in a standard policy, nor digging a little deeper, was there ever any specific premium charged for this real risk.   Separate cover for the peril of pandemic has been available for years.  Problem is, very few businesses bought that cover.  Notwithstanding the fact that people are really suffering, putting this problem on insurers is misdirected and ultimately, shortsighted."
2020-08-05 21:55:38,Insurers cover and exclude certain defined perils. That is the whole point of the contract. The premium charged is related to the risk underwritten. Caveat emptor. Businesses have executives who should know enough.

Insurance companies invest your premiums in the dirtiest and most harmful industries--coal and oil, mining, chemicals, airlines--whatever pays. 

The entire concept of insurance is immoral. Paying others to take responsibility for your failures of foresight and dangerous actions was described in the Aramaic-language bible, along with paying or charging interest, as sins against god (not that I believe in that nonsense). It was a moral stricture in western cultures until the King James bible elided those passage at the behest of the growing merchant class.

2020-08-05 11:04:17,"I live in Montgomery County and have worked in both public and private schools here. What we are seeing in this case is a community of very wealthy and influential parents who are pushing for schools to open for their own convenience, not because they have to work essential jobs or put food on the table. And they are used to getting what they want. But you can’t negotiate with a virus. When schools open, students and teachers and staff members will bring the virus home and spread it far and wide."
2020-08-05 11:05:10,"This will come to the forefront as a major issue between the wealthy and to rest; if schools are allowed to open by almost being a  mandatory order by the government, will parents also be a mandatory to go back to work by the employers? And this is a major concern over possible lawsuits over safety/health concerns which are currently a major contention in Washington. Will those who can/do work from home who still receive a pay check in full with benefits, go back to work? Will they be allowed to choose? Will the employer be allowed to fire an employee on the grounds of health concerns? The unemployed or the 'no longer have a job worker', will they receive less earning power to help with their expenses due to the pandemic, creating more poverty? This rift in both these areas of schools and workers is definitely going to become a major fall out in America. 

Is the government going to choose who gets to work and who gets schooled? or the employer over the worker?

This is not an either or situation happening, but a separation of further divide between the wealth and the rest of America. If you open the school sector then open the employment sector as well and accept the test results. 

We can't have it both ways. We can't open the schools and leave employment as it is, or vice versa. We are all in this together, remember? Force one, force US all, but Washington et al., be fair in our policy."
2020-08-05 11:16:40,"It’s a risk based assessment.  The first level of consideration is the community.  A school being public or private has no bearing.  If there is a reasonable consideration to divide private from public, then yes, consider it.  The only compelling reason I can imagine is that the parents of the private students sign secured promissory notes to defray/absorb 100% of the cost of spreading infection, agree to contact tracing and testing, and provide data to public health officials through third party auditors.  Then opening private schools might make sense.  Otherwise, private school students, parents and institutions need to be part of an public solution."

Glad to be retired now as the stress that I see those still teaching or sending kids to school seems overwhelming. It seems that when schools open, in Indiana or Israel the virus is there.

There is a political side to this. Our governor sees himself as a possible GOP president in 2024 and he jumped at an opportunity to differentiate himself from ""liberal"" Montgomery County. He's on a book tour now trying to present himself as a sober headed non partisan but still partisan non politician politician.

He is a big supporter of Catholic schools and managed to get state funding to Catholic schools. In his statement on the order from the Montgomery County Health Department he said that the decisions should be made by parents and the schools and not by politicians. Apparently in his mind health officials are politicians and governors are not.

Some of the schools mentioned here have resources and by the way many of their students come from wealthy parts of Virginia. The virus won't care, some of these schools may be able to do a better job preventing spread but there will be cases in some or all private schools. It will add to community spread.

It's all fun and games til someone gets hurt. The governor should allow health officials to make health decisions not influenced by money or political donations."

If communities can’t bring themselves to consider the well-being of adults working in schools, they should at least consider the long term well-being of children.  Children are at the mercy of their parents, who may be at the mercy of financial concerns or plain ill-informed, and we are sending these children into situations where they will, innocently, be vectors of disease and death to their family and may suffer lifelong health issues personally.

For private schools, parents of children come first. In addition, it's easier to focus on coming up with protective strategies ( whether outside classes, plexiglass dividers, phased class schedules, clear testing guidelines, etc) when it's a smaller organization with fewer competing voices. 
What does make the situation a class divide, is that lack of prioritization to provide school as a relatively ( not completely) safe space so that children can learn and their parents can go to work.   On-line schooling has been a mess."

Yes, of course, your elite private schools have a lot more bells and whistles than public schools, but, the design of the buildings and the instructional systems are pretty much the same.  Large groups of students are housed in small classrooms, narrow hallways, and undersized commons areas---a perfect storm for an airborne virus to take hold. Even the most elite schools, do not have the resources to maintain the levels of social distancing and plant cleanliness to guarantee staff and student safety. Where real differences will arise is when sickness hits---the care of staff and students in elite environments will be far different than public schools health responses. But be clear, no matter what school you attend, if it is a traditional schooling model, there will be no stopping the virus at the school house doors."

Change the system to be like Medicare, where students and their parents choose the school and the funds follow the student, and public schools would likely have a different position.

In the long run I think the Medicare model where we choose our own health care providers should also be be the model for schools.  Think of what Medicare would be like if the hospital you went to and your doctor were assigned based solely on where you live.  I don't think many people would accept that and I don't think we should accept that for schools either."

There's a virus ""out there"" that doesn't respect any of those boundaries or designations. I believe we should err on the side of being overly-cautious and shut down all schools until at least January 2021. Local school boards are usually made up yof well-intended community members who have virtually no background or experience in making medical decisions. Step back. Take a few deep breaths. Stop playing ""monkey see, monkey do"" with other local/regional/national education decisions. This scattershot approach to reopening schools will probably be more damaging than it is helpful."

Wear a mask and wash your hands and maintain distance from others. This substantially reduces risk. If a majority of us do these three things we can get our schools and economy open and avoid certain ruin. Elimination of risk is an unrealistic goal. Economic and social devastation is an unacceptable future.

Instead they now teach to the lowest common denominator, the slowest child in class. Why should I hold my child back?  My child wants to excel and would be held back by those that refuse to learn. Many public schools have become baby sitting services with a tiny bit of education sprinkled in.

I spend a disproportionate amount of my hard earned money on private education so that when my child grows up he will have a distinct advantage.

That tradition of being started for the sole purpose of reducing funding for public schools, reducing access to resources for poor students especially poor students of color and skirting legal and immoral imperatives at tax payer expense continues to be at the forefront of the agenda and aim of private schools. That they would demand exception from the same laws that all other students and schools must abide by even during a pandemic that has killed 154,000 Americans is completely on brand. Should they be allowed to write their own set laws while continuing to the parasitic siphoning off of public funds for private use? Of course not. Will they be allowed to? Almost certainly.

Of course not.

Local health departments have worked with local government to determine whether schools (and gyms, salons, restaurants, bars) are allowed to reopen. Once those recommendations are made, the schools decisions should be based on whether an individual school and its staff and parent community wants to open with precautions or not.

As soon as public schools choose to close, inequality/ disparities will soar.  Private schools, learning pods and other factors aside. Even among the public school attendees, the differences in home environment and family background (for a millions factors including access to food, space, differences in abuse rates, parental literacy, English language skills, Educational attainmentand time.). I am not sure why some defenders of school closures want to find a scapegoat for these Resulting disparities by blaming the small number of ppl who have to make formal arrangements (privates or pods ) for their kids. The truth is public school closures=increasing disparity, which is why many of us urge schools to open even with pandemic risks (lesser of two evils)... And by the way, this reality is not going to change in the school year or possibly next so the suggestion that “delaying “school starts is reasonable sounds ridiculous to me because October, November, or likely April or May will not be any different from now.

Of course, they need to be closed NOW, i.e. as long as they're likely to bring the Preventable Pandemic to their teachers and students.  But they also need to be closed for good: if Americans[1] have any intention of closing the ZIP Code Gap, we must start where it first happens.  Pay-per-grade schools, along with corporate-welfare and sky-fairy schools, are THE source of that gap in K-12 and help other factors like bigotry and bad employers contribute to that gap for adults, and are one of many reasons[2] that we're not quite In This Together™ as Covid attacks on the red carpet vile gopers rolled out for it.

After all, they get to outright kick out students they don't want.  Do you want YOUR child called unfit for school, especially if they succeed in destroying public school altogether and giving them no other place to go?

Time to bring the tax breaks they currently (pick)pocket back into our public schools, BEFORE the latter rot any further.

We also decrease the demand for testing and treatment, so when those private schools inevitably have outbreaks, testing capability and medical facilities will be available. Open public schools,  and no one will stay open for long. It seems hugely unfair to allow the most privileged kids to attend school while keeping the rest at home, in order to contain the spread.

Well, the CDC has recommended lots of things but it seems that you don’t believe them when they tell you that plans have to made to keep kids apart as much as possible.  

Your national Secretary of Education is a product of private schools and is somewhat detached from the needs of public schools. So, don’t be waiting too long for them to give guidance on anything.  Your state and local schools boards need to make plans and stick to them.  Be prepared for an increase in COVID-19 rates about two weeks after school starts.  It will take that amount of time for cases to develope and hospitalizations to increase.

So is the situation with private institutions, it they can provide a safe environment in which to teach, there is no reason not to let them do so.

     I understand that wealthier private and parochial schools can afford to invest in more and more elaborate safeguards against this pandemic.  But those schools' teachers and students still live together in the same cities and towns, patronizing, to one degree or another, the same businesses.  These teachers and students are still as susceptible to covid's indiscriminate attacks as anyone else and will spread this virus just as indiscriminately.

In the case of Montgomery County, it was fairly obvious that Travis Gayles shut privates as a favor to MCPS, who announced that they will be all DL through the start of February, which struck most parents as an absurdly long closure. MCPS has already lost ~3,000 students to home schooling / privates, and this was meant to staunch the bleeding—hence the October 1st date (MCPS has to submit enrollment numbers for funding on September 30.) Unfortunately for Gayles, he lost all credibility in this fiasco.

As a resident (and a Democrat) of Montgomery County, I was impressed with Governor Hogan’s handling of the pandemic - until now. 

The irony of this decision is that the privileged school children from private schools have the means to learn from a distance, they have food in there bellies every morning, and they are less apt to have to worry about the risks of so many of life’s challenges in less affluent areas. 

Personally, I live close to two elite private schools of which there are food markets and a Post Office that my neighbors and I frequent...

No guidelines have been identified regarding what the state or school needs to do in terms of transmission or safety to reopen. I am not a scientist, but it is my understanding that waiting until everyone is fully vaccinated and until the disease subsides likely means full remote this entire school year and maybe beyond that. Parents who want to just homeschool rather than deal with remote learning are now being encouraged by the teachers to still enroll and go through the motions of public education to keep the funding numbers up. I’d imagine that same concern is there for families who may defect for private schools. Working parents have not been a consideration in these discussions, the presumption is that families can make it work or survive on less income. The most vocal parents are, of course, the ones who don’t work and have time to devote to the debate."

With no technology base, the public sector had only 3hrs of instruction for the week, mostly video clips, and not interactive.

The private school I  send my kid went online with Zoom in 1 week with 6.5h instruction per day.    He didn't miss anything.   He has more interactive online learning in his private tutoring (piano, math) than his cousins have in the public curriculum.    I have no problem with continuing online learning in its current format, even though the school is opening. 

The public system has been a failure when facing the Covid crisis, and it sits squarely with the teacher's union.   The union is now in a full deflection PR strategy."
2020-08-05 13:14:53,"Some of our grandchildren attend private schools.  Their parents also pay taxes for public schools, without reservation.

None of them are rich.  That is just where they place their priorities--on their children's schooling.  

If private schools run into problems, then they run into problems.  So be it.  But just because a public school runs its business a certain way doesn't mean that if there is a problem then that problem applies to any other school."
2020-08-05 13:04:50,"If the private school children and their families, teachers, and other employees agree to stringent quarantine requirements, then by all means open up. 

Of course that will never happen. And that’s the problem with all school reopenings. It’s all about me, my kid, my life. Never mind that somewhere along the line you infect ME!

The self-centered approach to this pandemic in the US, led by Trump, is exactly why it is still raging here. And bringing discrimination lawsuits is just sickening. Again, self-centered, short-sighted."
2020-08-05 13:05:49,"Cramming children into small rooms and corridors will have the same impact on Covid 19 transmission regardless of who is paying for the service. If you think a premium tuition guarantees mask etiquette grom a 9 year old, you are deluding yourself."
2020-08-05 13:04:23,"In my long experience in developing countries I witnessed how the Governments there, mostly very corrupt and inefficient, actively destroy public education and public health. One of the reasons for doing so is to promote private businesses. A large number of those businesses are owned by politicians, directly or via proxy. The other reason is to promote religious and nationalistic propaganda that helps them politically, besides promoting their personal ignorance and bias. 

In India, the education sector is now the biggest illegal black money generating industry replacing the traditional contender for the prize- real estate. 

America is fast catching up with such countries in many such sectors, especially in public education and public health."

2020-08-05 13:16:08,"Let’s see: the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Dr. Fauci, most education scholars think kids should return to school. Certainly parents and students want it too.

Why don’t we follow the Science and take the experts advice and reopen schools?"
2020-08-05 13:11:28,"The pandemic has forced Americans to face their assumptions about how healthcare is distributed, what learning is (rather than schooling), and how a consumer economy that is based on velocity is trustworthy.  Those assumptions of invulnerability follow closely on the heels of climate change and whether our democracy could elect a tyrant who does not hold himself accountable to constitutional standards.
The secret to learning is balancing time alone with a seemingly insurmountable problem long enough to let the problem solving sense within to discover what it's limitations are and an imaginative plan for squaring with them combined with time with others who have put their time into thinking as well.  Focuses on Plato's Republic for middle and high school students, for example.  Games like bridge and chess older elementary kids, and drawing, painting, music, (especially Zoom-chorus!) and dance for younger ones.  Reading, writing, and relations is all there is to it.  If it weren't that easy and accessible through self-reliance combined with a little community feedback, we still be living like animals in caves."
2020-08-05 13:26:20,"Private schools aren't all rich kids wearing cashmere and riding ponies. There are modestly priced progressive schools using excellent teaching methods and child-led and project-based learning that our standardized public system has failed to adopt. They also teach diverse, inclusive history unlike public schools and foster a sense of responsibility and public service. A loss of progressive schools would be a loss to this country and to the families who have scrimped and saved to give their kids a proper education. These schools serve as a model for what our public system should progress toward."
2020-08-05 13:33:34,"Kids have already lost out on education because of school closings in the spring.  They should not continue to suffer.  Schools should be re-opened with the appropriate safety measures.  

I'm a baby boomer.  Many people in my generation are showing an incredible amount of entitlement and selfishness.  Schools should be for kid's benefit, not for teacher's benefit.  If a teacher has a condition that would prevent them from teaching during this pandemic, then that teacher should be allowed to take a leave of absence without any questions being asked.

The pandemic is likely to continue for at least another year, and we need to deal with it."
2020-08-05 13:43:06,The health department closed Milwaukee private schools too. But the thought is they did it to protect the public schools.  Parents were lining up at the charter schools to get their kids in class. That takes money from the public schools. And the powerful teachers union doesn’t like that.
2020-08-05 13:27:24,"The more I learn about and interact with schools, the more I see that allowing private schools and private donations to public schools to exist drives the inequality, neglect and rot at the core of our fragmented, dysfunctional public school system.  Only when everyone is forced to use the same public schools, funded equally and publicly, will there be any serious effort at making them all decent.  Separate but equal doesn’t work for race and it doesn’t work for class.  It just doesn’t work."
2020-08-05 13:49:08,"This is a purely political decision, devoid of critical thought and scientific and medical advice, serving Hogan's political aspirations as he runs for President. 

If he was following medical advice, he would close the schools, but no surprise, he was slow to require masks, restrictions on travelers from hot spots, and still hasn't closed bars.  These kids and schools will congregate and infect the general public and harm all in MD."
2020-08-05 13:28:32,"Teacher unions are trying to make their profession irrelevant. Give the funding ($15 to $25,000 per student) back to parents to choose how to educate their kids. 

Some will hire a tutor and band together with neighbors in pod learning. Some will pay for online education from public schools and some will use it for private school."
2020-08-05 13:39:24,"I have very mixed feelings about schools opening, it’s a very serious dilemma parents, society  and educators are facing.   

I believe parents need to be concerned and in many cases innovative. 
 But this doesn’t need to become another divide of accusing parents who want school to open of murder. 
It needs be a subject well scrutinized as to what some players true motivations are.   
There needs to be more teacher voices from both side of the divide, not just what unions think or privileged parents who have or can afford options.  
We have to be honest with ourselves.  About what we’re doing in our lives to be safe, or not , when we make demands on others to do it for the children.  
It would be very interesting and enlightening to see how many people so vehemently against schools opening are typing those comments while their own children are at a daycare somewhere.  Or a camp that opened, or over at friends houses so said commenter can work in peace for a bit.  
How many are writing from vacation home or hotel they rented in a hot spot because they still needed to get away.  
Or from a coffee shop table where they needed to get out and feel normal again.  
Or from your own re-opened offices.  
How many of those same parents commenting here against schools opening will still be reliant on good, affordable daycare come fall when schools don’t open.  

And in NYT : Why Are Child Care Programs Open When Schools Are Not?  

Well worth a read in conjunction with this article."
2020-08-05 13:41:27,"Private schools are making significant capital investments to meet the safety requirements set by the CDC and are accounting for the infection rate in their community. They have plans for when someone gets infected.  Here in New Jersey, infection rates are at par with that of Europe where public schools are reopening.
Private schools are implementing measures with the financial backing of parents who recognize that education is an essential part of society and consider teachers as essential workers.
The decision to keep public schools closed has devastating short and long term consequences that these States and the country will need to live with. Protesters had better spend their energy asking for more funding to reopen schools safely rather than punish private schools and drag everybody down.
Is the alternate solution to wait for a 100% effective vaccine to be widely available?  It is simply unrealistic and far from certain an outcome based on historical data.  If we don't learn to live with this virus, implementing reasonable safety measures, it is not the virus that will kill us.  We will self-destruct."
2020-08-05 13:47:25,"The simple reality...even if Maryland forces private schools to close their doors, parents with means will form pods of students and hire teachers out of their own pockets to teach in small group settings. If the public outcry over allowing private schools to open their doors is strictly a public health issue and a concern about gathering size then forcing all schools to close may be a solution. 

However if the attempt to force private schools to close is based on any notions of equity in education..then the mere idea that closing the physical location of a school will rectify any disparities is a joke."
2020-08-05 13:47:53,"The biggest hindrance to reopening are the teachers unions with all their demands, now they are afraid private and charter schools will reopen and more people will remove their children from public schools forcing layoffs to their members, Rembrandt this moment when the next round of contract talks come and the the unions say how it’s all about the children. If someone who makes burgers for minimum wage can get to work and be considered essential I think the teachers can manage. Prime example why public sector unions should be banned"

2020-08-05 13:52:36,"It's time to reimagine the public school system, it does not support the needs of our children.   We have seven families who have organized a teaching pod and are in the process of interviewing interested teachers."
2020-08-05 13:56:07,""" Leveling the playing field "" should not mean dragging everyone to the low level of public education in this country. Public education in this country is an example of what happens to a service when it becomes an item in the budget."
2020-08-05 13:55:02,This is a public health issue.  Whether a school is public or private should have no bearing whatsoever.  That moneyed interests (read: wealthy parents) and politicians supersede the decisions of health officials is simply outrageous.
2020-08-05 13:57:19,"It just seems backward to open schools for kids before the adults have gone back to work except for bars and restaurants. Shouldn't all professional offices and services be in place first, where ""adults"" can practice the safe practices and the virus can be better monitored with new cases and contact tracing better tracked? Reopening schools is like reopening full church, sports, theaters, unless it is in phases of greatly reduced numbers from normal attendance."
2020-08-05 13:56:27,"This one is fairly simple to me. If the school boards are doing their job correctly there should be a strict set of guidelines on what needs to be achieved to open safely. PPE, classroom sizes, testing procedures, quarantine procedures etc.  

Any schools can demonstrate they can achieve these goals opens."
2020-08-05 13:57:57,"It is interesting to frame the argument, or the discussion, as being between ""prestigious"" private schools and public schools. This frames the discussion as one about privileged children and ""the rest of us."" Actually, most private schools educate the underprivileged. They are charter schools, which have been extremely successful in educating the children of African-American poor in inner cities. They do it well, despite the opposition of teachers' unions. And this article is designed to help the view that we must close all private schools so that the unions can thrive in the public arena and the children get less consideration. Competition is good. There are any number of private schools. My church operates a kindergarten. Through the Arizona tax credit, anybody can give money to the kindergarten. Since people do, the children's parents pay zero tuition. And, mothers and fathers can work, knowing that their children are safe, and not worrying about day care. But, framing the discussion this way, people tend to want to see the children as being offspring of the wealthy. No, they are largely the offspring of the middle class and the working class. Reject the plan to eliminate all tax deductions and credits for donations to private schools!"
2020-08-05 13:58:17,I think it was the teachers unions that decided that Montgomery County schools should remain closed. The county health director was simply trying to insure that there was no competition that might actually educate children this fall. Good move by the governor.
2020-08-05 13:49:00,"If private schools have a plan to re-open safely then we should do more than let them.  

We should copy their plans and implement them at public schools as well.

I continue to believe elementary schools should re-open but high schools should be online.

And if we need to suspend the teacher union CBAs to gain the flexibility to deal with this once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, then do it.  This is an emergency.

The education of American schoolchildren outweighs the risk of the virus. 

""Some things are just more important than the virus"", I believe is how many people justified the BLM mass gatherings.  Education is one of them."
2020-08-05 14:04:10,"My child goes to a public school in Portland, and as a member of the PTA, we have offered up multiple ideas from hybrid learning to outdoor school, only to be shot down - with vitriol - by the school’s teachers and the district. Last Spring, my child’s teacher held ONE 20 minute zoom call once a week. And now there’s no word from the district on what school’s going to look like in the fall, which starts in two weeks. 
We can’t afford private school, but this will be our last year in the public school system, even if I have to work two jobs to pay for it."
2020-08-05 14:13:57,"My kids go to a progressive private school in upstate NY, and the main difference I see between our school and the public option is that the private schools have way more space per child.

Our school plans to open with all classes and lessons being taught outside, mostly with lean-tos.  Class sizes will be around 4-6 students per teacher.  The local public schools don’t have much outdoor space and are overcrowded with ratios of about 25-35 kids per class.

The fault isn’t with private schools - the issue is that many municipalities, states, and taxpayers have been unwilling to appropriately fund public schools.

Private education is a stretch for us, but it is one I’m glad we chose to make for our kids many years ago."
2020-08-05 14:21:02,"It's not worthwhile to close schools in order to reduce the risks to adults, by definition, really adults over 70.

Adults over 70 need to know that schools are a higher moral priority than their safety at this time.  It's time to finish fighting about that.  

Ex-teachers who no longer want to teach in schools need to have their jobs opened to other applicants ASAP so the schools can be staffed by on site.  

I am only stating the correct answer that private schools, and every other country, have come up with.  Do schools result in some deaths?  Absolutely.  Are they still a requirement?  Yes.  Is closing schools an option?  No."
2020-08-05 14:22:09,"Opening schools, public or private, is very risky for many reasons. Beyond the obvious ones involving having people in crowded, often poor ventilated, indoor spaces for many hours at a time, we have to consider the bigger picture. If schools are opened, even for a fairly short time, we can expect everything else to follow in a cascade. Everything will relax. Parents back to work, more socializing, people going back to offices, increased mass transit ridership, business reopenings, etc. And, unless COVID mutates to something benign, it shouldn’t take a degree in epidemiology to see where that takes us. 

Focusing on schools because they seem necessary is a mistake. Just as it was a mistake to delay closing them in places like NYC in the first place because of the same reason. We have seen in places like China that rampant community spread does not have to be accepted as a new normal. We need a powerful, nationwide response to get the virus under control. Other countries have done this in just months. China has done this. Then, schools and businesses can reopen carefully, with containment and mitigation measures in place. Americans feel like they have no choice because of how the nation’s wealth and resources are currently allocated and used, but it does not have to be this way. As a nation, the world’s wealthiest in fact, we have choices. As a democracy, we have choices."
2020-08-05 14:24:50,"This is the basic problem with us. Virus don't see whether the children are from private schools or public schools. It affects all. So, if public schools are closed, even private ones too need to  close. But there is an option to both. If they both take all prescribed safety norms, both can open."

2020-08-05 14:00:43,"One of the big differences driving this decision isn’t money, or class sizes, it’s teacher’s unions. The Times likes to make everything about inequality, but Catholic schools in my area have less money and class sizes equal to the public schools. Teacher’s unions are threatening to strike in Chicago over going back, even with precautions in place. It will certainly be interesting to see how this all plays out."
2020-08-05 14:20:35,"The blame for this lies squarely on the federal government. Their incompetence in handling this pandemic has led to pitting parents against parents against teachers. If Covid-19 were treated like the real threat it was back in March, we would have had adequate testing, care and protocols to reduce spread and federal funding for public schools to prepare then maybe all students would be able to be in school in some form."
2020-08-05 14:21:44,If public schools are closed to avoid spreading sickness and death then private schools should be doing the same thing. The virus does not discern public from private schools.
2020-08-05 14:26:31,"I asked the coronavirus, and it agreed to leave wealthy and privileged people alone."
2020-08-05 14:14:56,"No it's not fair that private schools have more resources but holding students back to make it ""fair"" so that all students suffer is an awful and petty suggestion. If private schools are able to open safely so that the welfare of their students, teachers, and staff is not at risk, then they should. The only thing this should highlight is the abysmal lack of funding and support our public school systems receive. Instead of holding private schools back, we should be talking about voting out politicians who don't prioritize public school education funding."
2020-08-05 14:01:33,"My wife is an Oncology nurse, nobody was concerned that she didn't miss one day of work to administer chemo to patient during the Covid pandemic. She and her fellow nurses and doctors took precautions  and educated their patients and caregivers on proper social distancing to avoid Covid. I don't understand why teachers can't do the same. Teach their students and parents how to maintain safe social distancing and proper hand washing and proper mask wearing, no chin guards or Up periscope ( nose out of mask)."
2020-08-05 14:24:03,"Deaths and new cases are down in TX from a high on July 27.

In less than 10 days, despite no new lockdowns or mandates, everything is down.  And it's not like masks were mandated on July 27; they'd been required for weeks and weeks beforehand.  

So we did nothing, and deaths dropped.  Dallas County has had a total (TOTAL) of around 700 since this whole thing started, and most were so elderly or frail that they were in long-term nursing facilities (at high-risk of death from everything).  Hardly the grim reaper ripping through a city slaying people not otherwise expected to die.

Open the schools and stop this.  I'm a teacher and I'm ready to go back.  98.8% of people survive, 80% of the deaths are in people over 80 (not schoolchildren or parents or teachers), and we will not eradicate this virus.  Time to get on with life."
2020-08-05 13:45:28,Private schools can kick out kids who do not wear masks.
2020-08-05 13:19:15,"Of course they should close! And if a neighbor is unemployed, you should stay home from work. If he is hungry, you should not eat. If he is sick, you should become ill. Equity for all!!"
2020-08-05 14:30:11,"An entire report without any value judgment.  Perhaps a better approach dear NYT would be to lead with what epidemiologists say are safe opening criteria.  Then admire how schools in areas outside those criteria are opening.  Nice survey, but people will die by these decisions and you're not doing your job."
2020-08-05 14:39:07,"Anyone who believes Covid will pass over private schools is delusional. It's not a question of if but when infections will hit private schools regardless of any precautionary measures taken (mask-wearing, social distancing, etc.) I am a retired elementary school principal and it is unimaginable that there would be no incidence of infections in any school building, and once that happens, no school, public or private, is prepared to handle outbreaks."
2020-08-05 14:40:52,"Last week I noticed a line item in the stimulus package now being debated, a distribution of $10 Billion to ""private schools"", I assume to facilitate their opening? If this is indeed the case,  should schools accepting government funding be required to follow their state's dictates or be allowed to maintain their autonomy in this matter at least?"
2020-08-05 14:46:17,"The difference is not that private schools are more ""privileged"", it's just that they are trying harder.  It is that simple. They have detailed plans to break students into cohorts, to use their athletic fields to set up temporary classrooms, and to contain or mitigate any outbreaks that may occur.  Most public schools in my area have those same resources, but unionized teachers are battling administrators, and neither side will work to put these plans in place. Its striking to me that teachers in California go shopping at grocery stores, rely on services from fire departments and PG&E, but don't see teaching our children as somehow essential. They have now lost the long-term support of the only ally they had left for their legions of supplemental parcel taxes and other foundational income: parents."
2020-08-05 14:46:47,"In our school, a hybrid model had been created and adopted. The school was split into two groups (alphabetically) and the model allows for two weeks on campus for the first group followed by 2 weeks on-line, at-home learning. The e-learning groups would be virtually included into each classroom and visible to each student by a screen. Each physical classroom would be occupied by only 6 students. Lunch at desks, clearly marked entrances and exits and one-way hallways. It was a recipe for success and perhaps a model to follow. Until it was abruptly cancelled at the whim of one person who knew nothing of the plan."
2020-08-05 14:33:55,"Teachers appear to have missed the fact that many Americans have worked throughout the pandemic to provide needed services to the public. Grocery stores, home improvement stores, liquor stores, service stations, police & fire departments, etc all have daily contact with the public. Why should teachers avoid their responsibilities, especially since most haven't missed a paycheck? Data shows elementary students have very low Covid-19 infection rates and their height means teachers are not generally face-to-face with them. Get to work and certainly don't prohibit privately employed teachers from educating their students!"
2020-08-05 14:43:54,California public schools do not support small class size nor limiting the size of schools.  Pack-them-in and to heck with the overcrowding. Maybe it's time for the California and nation to think about smaller school communities and more teachers who actually want to teach.   Teachers are essential workers. Just like police and fire.  Teachers are essential when it's time to negotiate contracts and not essential during a pandemic.
2020-08-05 14:44:09,"Keep this up.  No problem with me.  In my neighborhood, many children have a stay-at-home parent, some with Ivy League educations, directing the schooling and academic lessons.  These children have been tutored at home, have all the necessary electronic devices and high speed internet, and have done hours of at-home instruction under the supervision of highly-educated parents with books that parents purchased on our own.  So while public school teachers and their unions fight about staying closed (while of course maintaining their full paycheck), these children and other children from privileged homes, will be propelled even further in front of the pack and will eventually go to prestigious universities to become the next generation of wealthy elites.  Meanwhile, less privileged children who live in poverty with an illiterate single-mother will be left behind to become the future janitors of the world and future jail fodder for our nations prisons."
2020-08-05 14:39:38,"Why is it that the teacher's union, who has for a long time tried to dispose of private schools, get such support in the making of the decision about what private schools should do. We need the tax dollars to follow the child in the education process not the unions."
2020-08-05 14:45:17,"Private schools should absolutely have to close as well. The virus doesn’t care if you’re wealthy or poor, it spreads easily when groups of people are in close contact with one another. 

Regardless of whatever additional safety measures these schools believe they can implement, they’re still bringing large groups of children together indoors, a recipe for disaster."
2020-08-05 14:50:50,"Teachers will be sorely disappointed when they learn that they can be replaced by many fewer virtual teachers. If the class is online instruction, one teacher can instruct MANY more numbers than can be contained in the classroom. They may get their wish of not returning to the classroom by putting themselves out of a job. In the meantime, I’ll be at work - doing my job."
2020-08-05 14:51:19,"Private schools have more financial resources, but that doesn’t mean they’re more organized or truly better equipped to handle this crisis. The independent school where I teach has thrown vast amounts of money at the problem. Yet we were just told we have to reuse our masks. We don’t have a school nurse. We don’t have any plans for testing and quarantining. Our hybrid plan means I’m still seeing all 100 of my students each week- and all of those students will see 7 adults each day, at minimum. And yet, our remote learning program in the spring worked well. Students had a rigorous schedule and my colleagues and I worked day and night to plan, teach, and communicate with kids and parents.
In spite of alarming numbers and public school closures, we’re staying open ONLY because wealthy parents are demanding it, and we need their money. My colleagues and I are terrified to return to work. Can we really serve our students like this? The ethical path forward in balancing financial impacts and human impacts should always err on the side of humanity. Teachers unions might have their issues, but it’s tough to be in a situation where I have no voice and no advocate."
2020-08-05 14:52:03,"Here in California when lockdown was introduced back in March it was pretty definite and like there was no tomorrow.  Once you’ve locked something and thrown away the key, reopening it is kind of tough, as with the schools definitely shows.  Coronavirus could disappear tomorrow but we’ll still be disagreeing on reopening for years, if not longer, because we’ve gotten so good at it."
2020-08-05 14:57:43,"People tend to forget that not private school families have to pay the private tuition AND local school tax without any relief. I'm not complaining. Many of us choose that not because we are too rich to care. I choose to live in a smaller appartment, cut vacation, cut entertainment so that I could afford the private tuition and the local tax but I do not regret it. I'm well in the middle class and I don't deny my privilege but don't dehumanise us by applying the label ""the rich"" on all of us who choose to send our kids to private schools."
2020-08-05 15:00:09,Should private schools be able to stay closed if local public schools are open?  The decision should be made on an individual school basis depending on the risks and resources appertaining.
2020-08-05 15:04:26,"Most private schools aren't ""prestigious"". They are Catholic and open to all. Most parents of Catholic school kids are middle class   suburban families and lower to middle class urban families.
I attended Catholic schools K through 12. My parents were middle class but they saw Catholic schools as a necessity compared to public schools. They were right.
It took me till deep in my sophomore year in college before I took new courses that I hadn't taken in High School. Of course these schools should be open in the Fall. They have the discipline needed to pull it off safely and successfully. They also don't have the teachers unions to fight with!"
2020-08-05 15:09:50,"My son is enrolled in a NYC private K-8 school, and we are already locked in for the year. The school has been preparing for in-person reopen since May: updating ventilation systems, rearranging the space, working out how each pod of 8 kids + 1 or 2 teachers will be always isolated from contact with others. Staggered arrivals and departures, mandatory masks, use of outdoor space, testing and contact tracing, huge orders of PPE. They have thrown in a ton of money into this, and they are definitely not catering to parental demands for convenience. 

We don't know what we are going to do if the school isn't allowed to re-open and it becomes a very expensive YouTube (because let's not engage in magical thinking, young kids won't engage online). We don't have any money left to hire babysitters or pay into pods. We don't have family to move in with. I have been working and watching a 5yr old for months. My employer is understanding but that's not the same as having childcare. My mental health is gone."
2020-08-05 15:10:15,"I’m so happy people are finally expanding their thinking on how to close equity gaps! 

The biggest obstacle is frankly the family, particularly those families that have the means to give their own children an unfair advantage. Personally, I wish we could farther, and bring bussing back. But if we wanted to really even the field, the best option would probably be to take children away from the rich and give them to poor single parents, and take children from poor single parents and give them to the rich. I’m not a parent myself, but I imagine as long as parents have kids to take care of and educate, it shouldn’t matter too much whose biological kids they happen to be. This way, the poor kids would get all of the learning advantages that come with having rich parents, and the rich kids would have to deal with the adversity and limitations of having poor single parents. 

Regardless of how far we can go with this, the council’s attempt to level the playing field has been truly admirable, and I wish my own local leaders would do the same. I think lifting people up isn’t working, and never will. 

If we want true equity, we need to actually limit and hold back those who rise through unfair advantages. Where there’s underrepresentation, there’s overrepresentation which needs to be addressed. And where some students fall behind, others get ahead - and so they need to be actively held back, just like in Vonnegut’s social justice polemic “Harrison Bergeron.” Let’s do this!"
2020-08-05 15:15:40,"The Trump administration’s insistence on sending children back into the classroom,  those States refusing to comply threatened with reduced Federal funding, fails to address private school status. What can be inferred from this omission is that private schools are to be considered exempt from the proposed government mandate. What that speaks to is an elitist societal environment long years in existence that the COVID health crisis has served to highlight in numerous ways. Here it being eduction. For in America public school education has more and more come to be regarded as default education for the disadvantaged population. Identified by the families whose income is insufficient to pay private school tuition. It can be predicted that private schools having a strong financial base will be afforded the flexibility to resume education by appropriating the best and safest ways to accomplish that for both students and teachers."

There is a greater risk of a child dying in a car accident being driven to school than dying from covid - yet we are willing to take that risk. I enrolled my 5 year old in Maryland public schools this summer only to find out they will be online-only, which to me is pointless for kindergarten. We are now waiting to hear back about whether there is space for us in a private school (very likely) that will have in-person instruction. For elementary school aged children this is a critical time for them to socialize, learn to read and write, etc. I can understand having online-only instruction for older children who have a greater risk of covid complications, but I absolutely cannot understand why we would disadvantage elementary aged children for something that is such a low risk? Why are daycares, liquor stores and home-improvement stores allowed to open, yet schools are not? Daycares in Maryland now will be watching children when parents work and will be helping them get set up to attend online school. My child will be fine, but I am very worried about the children of economically-disadvantaged parents, especially single mothers, who have no other choice. High schoolers may be better off with online only, but for elementary, where the covid risk is so low OPEN the schools!!! Please consider the children not politics!!"
2020-08-05 15:34:21,"""Highlights a national divide"" is a big exaggeration. A ""national divide"" might apply if half of our students were in public schools and half of them in private. What portion of school-aged students attend public schools versus the number who attend private schools? At this moment I don't feel like researching that question but I think it's pretty safe to say that the number of students attending public schools absolutely dwarfs the number of students enrolled in private schools. So that's not really a divide. It's everyone (public) minus a tiny sliver of students (independent private schools). The main reason private schools are making a show - and that's what it is - of trying to hold classes in person is that they are trying to hold on to the families that are paying tens of thousands of dollars in tuition. If you were a private school parent, wouldn't you be asking whether it's worth paying all that money so that your child can sit in front of a computer screen at home? That's why private schools are trying to dance the open-the-school minuet. Good luck."

For us, in Vermont, it is a mandate by the Governor to wait until Sept 8 to open schools so that teachers can be prepared. Private schools started planning for this when COVID started; they also have the resources to put in place best practice safety protocols (private on-site testing). Public schools have budgets for things like shared resources (crayons, markers, rulers, cleaning supplies, etc etc), but in the time of COVID, we must now pivot and make sure every student has his or her own “kit.” Private schools have asked for families to supply these items; in the public school, we are fundraising for all students to have these dedicated resources. As much as we’d like one solution, it doesn’t exist.

Nia Haughton, 15, occasionally struggles to find the right words, and her memory can be patchy, but as she describes her lengthy treatment in a London hospital as she sits on a low wall beside her home, her account still has the power to shock.

Nia had been battling a cough and a high temperature for about 10 days, but then her condition significantly deteriorated.

After the emergency dispatcher heard Nia having difficulty breathing, an ambulance arrived within minutes. In the emergency room  she was noted as having several recognizable COVID-19 symptoms, she was sedated and placed on a ventilator inside an intensive care unit, where she remained for two weeks.

For days, her lungs labored to stave off collapse until the medical staff tried “proning” her for 16 hours a day. During proning, Nia was turned to lie on her front at a slight incline, but kept on ventilation with the help of an anesthesiologist. This approach allows oxygen to be blasted to the back of a patient’s lungs, and has been beneficial for many COVID-19 sufferers.

Eventually NIs was able to breathe but after several days in recovery, her condition worsened once again. This time, it was her brain. Awake night after night, she began hallucinating, seeing and hearing people in the hospital who were not really there.

“I couldn't tell what was real,” she said. “It was really scary. I could hear voices. It was very traumatic.”"
2020-08-05 15:38:39,"The data are clear. Children are very low risk and low risk for spreading. Teachers can wear N95 masks and face shields just like health care workers. Children can wear Face coverings to reduce risk. This is more about politics then the science. Even the Academy of Pediatricians recommends opening because of the very real risk of harm to education if school does not continue. Democrats usually say follow the science with regards to climate change, but now that we have evidence of the relatively low risk of the virus to most of the population, lockdown seems to be the only answer. We have a resurgence because protests and other large gatherings Were encouraged and supported. People went to bars and restaurants. It seems people are willing to take risks.

Yesterday it was cruise ships operating again, with predictable results. Before that, it was schools opening on Thursday in Indiana, only to be closed by Monday. Similar stories are playing out all over the country in the handful of schools already opening: open school, people get sick or exposed, close school. 

Here’s the thing: your schools, your state, and whatever you believe aren’t special. The only relevant thing here is that the virus will take advantage of any opportunity to infect people, because that’s what it does. It’s  indifferent to anything you believe. And it’s worse than closing. Just ask the families of the 155,000+ dead people and the ones who survived but still haven’t recovered months later. 

Every single time people ignore the facts, the same thing happens. It happened in Arizona. It happened in Florida. It happened at churches, bars, and parties. If you open during the pandemic, the pandemic gets worse and causes more damage than closing did. What makes people think their school, bar, or church is going to be different?

If these parents want to send their kids to school and the school says they can open, let them. 

What this ""brings into sharp relief"" to me is that public schools are mainly staffed by teachers who want to get paid for not working. I know plenty of public school teachers, some are close friends. They brag about their retirement, the benefits, etc., but boy do they hate their jobs. You don't think they'll take advantage of this to stay away longer? Ha! Meanwhile they're out in restaurants, hanging out at the bar, traveling during the summer. But go back to work? Oh, well, my!

And while there is still an issue for adults in school,  this is equally true for many others in our society who get up every day and go to work. The difference is that unlike teachers,  most people do not enjoy the privileges of the unions that allow them to stay home,  and get paid whether they work or not.  Yes, the schools need to take appropriate precautions. But they must stop playing political games and reopen so that they can educate our kids and let the rest of us get back to work. Enough is enough !"
2020-08-05 16:59:49,"While I support the decision to allow private schools to reopen if they choose, I do think this potentially creates a huge inequality issue. 

Private schools tend to have few smaller teacher to student ratios because they can refuse to admit students. My community has two private schools. Their average class sizes are between 13-15 students.Public schools can't refuse to admit students who live in their district. So my average class size is 30 students. Private schools will be able to physically distance students. Meanwhile, I just spent three hours yesterday realizing the furtherest I can spread my desks apart is one foot. 

If emergency COVID funding is tied to school reopening, private schools will get the bulk of those funds. All schools have the option to reopen, but only private schools have the option to limit enrollment to make schools safe."

They have been working since Spring Break to rearrange their campuses (for social distancing), to create ""pods"" of students and schedules that can act as a second ""firewall;"" have purchased protective gear for everyone (face shields, masks, hand sanitizer, and so on).   They also intend to have outdoor classrooms as often as possible (and have purchased additional air purifiers and ways to increase ventilation).  They will use Zoom for staff meetings, parent conferences, and so on.

I have heard RANDI WEINGARTEN, of the teacher's union, say loudly and clearly that similar plans and contingencies should be put in place for public schools (she started organizing and asking for guidance/protocols back in MARCH). There was plenty of time for many school districts to make meaningful progress towards safety - while still creating dynamic learning environments. 

The current situation isn't the private school community's fault.   The teachers and heads of school love the children and families they serve.  They rolled up their sleeves and started working.  

Public school teachers and admins also love their communities.  But they needed leadership and backing - which they did not get."
2020-08-05 16:37:06,"The comments about this article tell me that our society is just a mess. All the bickering, pointing fingers, making predictions not based on science...it’s sad and pathetic. 

I’m a retired public school teacher, proud that I taught in a racially and socioeconomically diverse public school. I can’t imagine how my superintendent is managing his stress in planning to reopen. There’s no way that students in my school could socially distance: there’s nowhere near the space, and not enough teachers, either. A hybrid plan that splits the school population into groups is the only way to provide that space. 

Many schools are doing the best they can, while admittedly some are not taking public health guidelines seriously. If the local school board isn’t convinced that this pandemic is serious, then they’ll approve a lax reopening plan. Schools are under local control. Experience may end up being a hard teacher in this pandemic.

If private schools have the resources to reopen safely, let them. Now isn’t the time to point fingers at those who pay tuition for their children. 

But while I’m talking about finger pointing, those of you who denigrate public school teachers need to take some time to walk in their shoes. That was the hardest, and most exhausting job I’ve ever had.

Theoretically speaking, it's better to have some rich people and some poor people (I recognize that that's an unrealistic depiction as there is an entire spectrum of wealth and income in between) than to have all poor people.

In this case, when it comes to schools, it is objectively better to have some students benefit from in-class learning (if possible) than to have all students suffer through poor online classes. It doesn't matter if it's just wealthier families who benefit. It's still a better outcome for society that all children's educations being set back."
2020-08-05 16:16:27,"A decree that Catholic schools must remained closed until public schools reopen, such as was overturned in Maryland by its governor, violates the First Amendment.

No public official or body can decree that religious instruction can continue only at the pleasure of the state. I taught for twenty years in Catholic schools. started each class with prayer and, where relevant, communicated Catholic teaching to my students.

Secular private schools reflect, in most instances, the beliefs of the parents of enrolled students. This may often dissent from what is taught in public schools and such dissent is also protected by the First Amendment.

The arguments from ""inequality"" are specious. If the public schools fail to reopen and do their job then it is they, not those private schools that DO reopen, that create inequality. How on earth can one believe that refusing to educate public students lessens inequality while educating those in private schools promotes it? And . . . since when does a spurious ""equality"" trump all other values?

In essence, the anti-private school lobby is no more than rapacious teacher unions who hate competition along with leftist academics and journalists who hate faith. 

The GOP is, here, being handed a potent weapon with which to demolish the Democratic Party. Those who treasure the faith-education of their children are unlikely to react well to such Marxist-inspired secularism"
2020-08-05 15:31:20,"Having spent a good part of my youth within the (admittedly extremy problematic) DC/MoCo private school bubble, I have to admit that I'm endlessly annoyed with the media's recent fawning over St. Andrews simply because the president's son attends. There are literally dozens of schools in the area that are more selective--St. Andrews in my experience mostly serves the unremarkable children of the very wealthy in Potomac and Bethesda. I've known them to accept students who were kicked out of other schools for dealing drugs (presumably the parents are wealthy). Barron is there not because it's the best school, but because it's one of the few schools in the area where his father's politics are tolerated. Every time you give them a free platform, it enables them to lure more families away from schools that actually care about their students."
2020-08-05 15:26:20,"Kudos to the private and charter school teachers and administrators who are doing their best to get kids back in school. I don't see private schools as the drivers of inequality.  The obvious drivers of inequality, ironically, in many, but of course not all, places, are public schools and teachers' unions, which seem to be doing everything in their power to increase educational inequality by keeping schools closed -- threatening to walk out, trying to limit even remote learning, etc.    

In NYC, much money and even more time has been spent pushing ""equity"", ending ""white supremacy"", etc. in order to reduce educational inequality, desegregate NY schools, and so on.   When faced with a public health crisis and closed schools, you would expect the officials who supported these policies to move heaven and earth to get the poorest, urban students back in school, since school provides critical educational, daycare, nutritional, and social services to these students and their families. But they haven't, even though not going to school will exacerbate inequality and damage the life outcomes of these students and families a million times more than an imagined ""white supremacy"" culture. These officials also have not vigorously opposed a teachers' union that cares only for its own well being and doesn't apparently want to work.  Can we please get some stories on how these officials and unions are increasing inequality?"
2020-08-05 17:59:17,"It is without dispute most private schools have far more resources than most public schools. As such they are far more able to do what is necessary to keep children masked, socially distant, and the surfaces and items clean. To forces these schools to not open because public schools may not be able to do such things is absurd and sour grapes. I say that someone who send their kids to public schools."
2020-08-05 18:36:21,"I live in an area with low community spread where the public schools won't reopen, but the privates will. My own kids will be in virtual (i.e., not being educated), and wealthier kids will go to campus and get a real education. I envy private school leadership the autonomy  to make this decision free of union pressure (and I say this as someone who has always supported teachers unions before). Our local union wouldn't take yes for an answer when our district presented a reasonably safe hybrid option with low classroom density and remote options for at-risk teachers; instead, our public schools will be converted to paid child care centers staffed by low wage workers who aren't unionized, and our district's children who stay at home will be passively babysat by recorded lectures. At least in my community, the private school sector made the right call."
2020-08-05 18:43:50,"The NYT had another piece recently on how if the rich have enough money, they can get a great experience at the top NYC private school, AND private in-home teaching for their child (allowing, for example, two highly paid parents to both go to the office, as needed).  But the total price was something like $100,000+ for the first child, and $80,000+ for each additional child, as I recall. (I could be off a bit, but that was a good indication, re scale). 

So, for private schools, IF they can use money to have much better safety standards, like good supervision in halls, good to great fancy filtration/recirculation systems for the air, etc.  why shouldn't they be allowed to have children come to their schools?

Because the left can't stand it when people pay good money they EARNED, after taxes, for things they want, like a good education for their children, in relative safety?

At some point, the mindless attacks on all wealth pass the level of sanity.  Neither the far right nor the far left has things like tolerance or reasonableness as strong suits, by any means."

Teachers are the canaries in the coal mines who (normally) let administrators know where the problems are and what needs to be addressed. We see public school teachers acting as fully-fledged stakeholders in this education discussion, with union leaders who can speak to power.

On the other hand, private school teachers—most of them—have no right to collective bargaining. No union. Yearly contracts.  If private school teachers speak out, they risk their jobs. There is a disincentive for them to raise concerns about reopening even in the best hybrid scenario. Private school teachers are the have not’s.

Therein lies the danger!
 
Health Officer Travis Gayles understands there’s just as likely a risk for community spread in the “rich” private schools as there is in its public schools. Only the reasons for the risk are different.  

Some schools seem to want for nothing; however, if teachers have no voice, then there can be no safety for our students and teachers."
2020-08-05 19:17:00,"Let's be clear: those of you who want schools to open--public OR private-- are asking teachers to die for you. Don't engage in Sartrean bad faith and deny it. You have decided that one year's worth of school--without which students would be absolutely fine, except for students with specific IEPs who will receive less attention if schools are open for all, than if we had opened schools just for them--is worth the death of likely thousands of teachers (if all schools had opened--thankfully many will not) across the country. If this is your expectation, that teachers should die--please ask Congress to set aside money for teacher's families, the way that money was set aside for the families of the victims of 9/11. Please ask your local schools to make provisions for teachers and staff with conditions listed as high risk by the CDC. But don't--don't--pretend you are not asking teachers to die.

And don't respond what is special about teachers.   First, I don't think ANY worker should be subjected to dangerous conditions. I don't favor ANYONE with the CDC conditions being  exposed. I think the meat packing plants should have been shut down, I think shopping should be through curbside pickup, I haven't eaten in a restaurant but have ordered delivery to support local businesses, I don't go to bars. The workers in these industries actually support teachers. You do not speak for them. Second, teaching is more dangerous in the current epidemic than most occupations. BY FAR."

The sooner we figure out that the Titanic doesn't have our children's best interests in mind, the sooner we can unbundle the corrupt and wasteful public education monopoly that is run for the old who feast on the young. Universal education vouchers, sooner rather than later, please. Families are desperate for a lifeboat, much less a sailboat.

NYC public schools spend $28,000 per year per pupil delivering a mediocre (if not dangerous and toxic) product. A monopoly so cruel, parents will wait in line for hours to escape, or pray for desperate lotteries to enroll their children in alternatives. A monopoly so wasteful, that for that $28,000 in spending, only $10,000 or so reaches the classroom because so much is spent on debt service and pensions, according to Chalkbeat's report this past January.

The unions and education bureaucracy form The Blob that feasts on our children, and they will take and take until our deference runs out."

Sixes Elementary in the Cherokee County School district began in-person classes on Monday. But by Tuesday, a classroom was temporarily closed for deep cleaning and the teacher and 20 other students had been asked to quarantine for two weeks after the second grader tested positive.

Cherokee County recommends, but does not require, that children wear masks in school whenever social distancing is not possible, according to the school district's reopening plan. The district would only require students to wear masks if there was a statewide mandate in place. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has fought mayors' attempts to mandate mask use."

This is just the Times and its liberal elite supporters attacking anything they can not control. Most private schools and almost  all catholic schools have much less money to spend than public schools. Catholic teachers get paid far less than public school teachers. And most  Catholic school students in places like NYC come from working class and middle class backgrounds.  The Unions give the greatest support and money to the Democrat Party. I have yet to hear from a public school teacher who does  not whine about how they are not paid enough or do not have enough resources or how much of a burden teaching their students is---well teaching at catholic schools or private schools is not any easier but these teachers do it and do it far better than public school teachers who in NY make more money than college professors in many instances and who get tenured  95% of the time with rich pensions. What public schools fear along with their Democratic apologist is that we will realize how we have been cheated out of our money to support a system of overpaid and inept school teachers and administrators. If not for the limitations of space their would be a flood of parents seeking to send their children to Catholic school.

My school was two months late in distributing teacher contracts and included new language about working conditions and expectations.  With a little over a month before the new school year was to start, it was too late for me to look for a new job even though I feel that this pressure may be putting teachers and student at risk."

Here in Westchester NY, we've been tracking at 1% test positivity rates for the past 2 months, and most public and private schools are planning to reopen to the extent they can meet the reduced-density social distancing guidelines.  For most schools that means kids will attend school in-person about 2-3 days/week.  We shouldn't punish the schools that can meet the state guidelines just because other schools cannot due to space constraints or who runs them.  My family spent 6 years in the public schools and then switched to private.  We are not siphoning any money away from the public schools - in fact, the public schools love families like mine.  They receive my full property taxes, but they don't have to spend any money to educate my 2 kids.  I do think we have to watch covid rates closely in all areas, and if cases increase and test positivity rates hit 5% then both public and private schools in that area should be closed."

Most Americans, if they knew what they were spending per child to get a public education, would be outraged for what their children get for that outsized investment.  It's an average, nationwide, in excess of $12K/student (2017).

And the comment that private and parochial schools are better off than public schools, which enjoy state monopolies and, most important, claims on taxpayer dollars regardless of whether the taxpayer is a consumer of the school, is risible: the real inequality is for parents, esp. in parochial schools, who have to pay twice -- taxes and tuition -- to escape the public school plantation."

Completely and utter selfishness is the only explanation.

The one thing we do know about this virus is that gatherings are the source of outbreaks. And, we have seen around outbreaks around the country at camps and daycares as well as kids testing positive within the first day or two of school. So that people understand, there are more than 50 private schools in our county, so we are talking about AT LEAST a few thousand kids returning to school. That doesn’t count faculty and staff.

Is anyone going to point out that ALL schools represent a group larger than 10?Too uncomfortable to call the good doctor on his own nonstarter? There are uncomfortable interviews and there are dead students and teachers and those they infect; I know which one matters. It's not a hard call.

I've been banging this drum since June because it was abundantly clear then that we would end up blowing this, the most critical piece on the table, in exactly the same way we've blown every single response to this virus. Months have passed while every outlet that could and should have been a voice for reason calling for schools to close was, instead, coopted for illogical, deranged, delusional thinking, thinking that has imperiled not just our children but our country.

When will this get through? This is NOT a student/teacher issue. Our schools do not exist in a vacuum. Students don't drive the bus, teach the class, cook the school lunches, and clean the buildings. Students come in contact all day long with adults, the highest risk group, who do. They then carry home the virus.

Our County Health Commissioner rightly determined it isn't safe to open schools while every metric --infection, hospitalization, and death rates --are rising. Acting like the good citizens they are, our public schools immediately complied. In fact, most had already determined this on their own and have spent the summer mindfully planning for robust online learning. 

Private schools? Well...private schools have determined that exceptionalism evidently means that private school students are allowed to risk death to prove that our schools are fancier and better. It's very difficult not to see this as some craven, misguided marketing ploy. The thinking is pretty transparent...See? If you had just plunked down a great deal of money on one of our superior schools, you would have been treated to in-person learning!  

I really do struggle with this. Imagine the headmaster or mistress, with no medical training, thinking he or she gets to override the COUNTY HEALTH COMMISSIONER. 

Entirely lost in this debate is any sense of civic duty or compassion for the healthcare workers who will soon be overwhelmed when our schools follow the pattern everywhere and contribute to skyrocketing numbers, students and teachers who may die, or the wider community put at risk.

It seems many public school districts are choosing not to reopen because of lack of resources and undue influence and pressure from teacher's unions who do not want to head back to schools.  

In the first case, shame on communities for underfunding school districts and shame on school districts for squandering resources.

In the second case shame on teacher's unions who refuse to acknowledge that they are essential workers.  Many others in the work force are risking their health to provide basic services, e.g. grocery stores and food service.

Socio-economic disparities will only grow if we cannot get our children back to school- all of them.  Let's not fight amongst ourselves with this destructive class warefare rubric.  Let us allow private schools to operate and use their lessons learned and apply them to our public schools so that every child benefits.

It's about everyone who comes into contact with them, because an outbreak at any school--whether public or private--is likely to spread into the larger community. If, as is the case for much of the country, the situation is serious enough to keep public schools closed, then chances are there will be infections in private schools also, regardless of attempts to prevent them.

I say keep the schools shut until we have a cure and a vaccination. Do video classes as much as possible. Put everything live on hold. When this is all over we can make up the lost time by having summer sessions or longer school days. It may take a  couple of years to completely catch up but I'd rather see schools open in the summertime and after-hours than sick and dead kids and teachers. If everyone is doing this then no one will fall behind. It's not competition, it's survival.

Over 23,000 New York City residents already died of Covid-19, yet de Blasio, as incompetent and as callous as Trump, pretends he can open NYC schools when no other major school district is.

De Blasio is guaranteed to botch it. Most NYC schools are underfunded/overcrowded with packed classrooms. We have no national healthcare.

My wife has taught in Harlem for over 25 years. Children will have to be masked, social distance, and never touch. Students will touch each other, take off their masks, and sneeze and cough all over other students and teachers, (my wife lost count of all the times children sneezed in her face long ago). 

Students will be unable to distance even if they could remember to, which they won't. (Consider how often your children forget to listen to you after 5 seconds. Multiply it by millions).

My wife's students live almost entirely in packed apartments in projects in multi-generational families. There's barely room for everyone to move. It's common for a grandparent to share a bed with a grandchild, who is one of my wife’s students. If these children return to school they'll go home and infect their mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, and grandparents.

In a normal year at schools in our area, they have a registration week prior to opening where kids/parents turn up for registering in classes/sports/programs.  Staff are brought in for this situation.
Why not a similar testing week? As in many testing centres around the country, the tests could be conducted from people's cars.  
Those kids found to be infectious would be quarantined and not allowed to attend school until a second test proved negative.
Currently we are speculating about who might/would/will get infected when schools starts, because we have no idea as to how many kids or staff currently are asymptomatic but infectious.
Wouldn't a country wide testing program prioritising kids and school staff give us the information we need to open schools safely?"
2020-08-05 17:33:16,"Chicago is doing the smart thing. Every parent should get familiar with their state’s school reopening roadmap, and if the state failed to set tough controls, get familiar with your local district’s plan. 

Georgia, for example, where we’ve seen pictures of kids without masks packed into hallways like sardines, has a lax roadmap:
“Georgia’s Path to Recovery for K-12 Schools provides considerations, recommendations, and best practices to ensure a safe and successful 2020-2021 school year. This guidance is not mandated, or state required. Local school districts have the authority and flexibility to meet their individual needs and be responsive to their communities.”

Paulding County Georgia already has students and staff testing positive and they’ve only been opened since Monday. This county is not part of Atlanta proper. In fact, it’s quite rural in many parts. One of their high schools was built on top of a Civil War battlefield (the Battle of Dallas during General Sherman’s march) — it’s not a densely populated county. And their superintendent says that masks are a “personal choice.”

This same school district has a dress code, does it not? Most high schools will punish/send a child home if shorts or skirts are too short, but a mask is a personal choice? Why? It could easily be part of the required dress code, were this superintendent not bound and determined to politicize the matter. Why is he able to do this? Because Georgia does not have a strict reopening plan."

""The only way you're going to win the race is that when all eight are rowing in unison. You get one that catches a crab, as it were, with, an oar goes that way or you don't row, you don't win. So as long as you have any member of society, any demographic group who's not seriously trying to get to the end game of suppressing this, it will continue to smolder and smolder and smolder, and that will be the reason why in a non-unified way we've plateaued at an unacceptable level.""

What we can foresee is that poor children, of whatever race, are going to lose a year or two of educational achievement. Then, sometime later, we're going to read how awful it was that they lost those years of achievement – and the income that would have come with it.

Since we already know this, why do we not focus on ensuring that all children receive the educations that they deserve, and that their tax-paying parents expect for them. What is stopping us from making this contribution to our society as a whole.

Are we really this incapable of providing basic services to our most vulnerable citizens; that is, our children. I think not, and I would ask our political leaders, regardless of party or jurisdiction, to focus their efforts upon educating the children who will soon be leading us into what I believe must be a better future.

If we cannot do that, at a minimum, I don't think there is much hope in terms of where we're going to end up."

Funding to state governments so that they can retain employees who otherwise would be fired due to reduced tax revenues is a Covid-19 issue.

I am so tired of reporters who don't seem to understand the difference between raw numbers and per capita numbers!

California has a bad outbreak right now, but we are not, by any stretch, the worst.  We have twice as many people as New York, so per capita, we have roughly half as many total, cumulative cases.

In new cases, we are often listed as one of the three or so worst places, but per capita, it's actually about number 15 (or so - it changes often).  Fifteenth is bad, and it's driven heavily by things like sub standard housing and horrible crowding in farmworker communities, which has been a crying shame for ages, so we should accept that we are doing pretty badly, and work to improve.

But fifteenth is very far from the worst, and I'd like to see a little accuracy and less sensationalism.  What about a complete moratorium on reporting raw numbers?  They are meaningless.  Adjust everything as a fraction of population."

My main concern is ventilation, now that we understand coronavirus spreads by droplets *and aerosols*, which like cigarette smoke may linger suspended in the air for minutes. Epidemiology has shown us superspreader events in restaurants and office buildings with limited outside ventilation.

Many modern high rise hotels have centralized HVAC, no working guest control to turn off fans, and no windows that open. I’d worry the return air from my coughing neighbor next door could make its way into my room. A hotel as an immovable cruise ship.

Republicans don't want a deal. They're strangling us. And they're wearing smiles while doing it.

The president tweeted overnight that the coronavirus catastrophe ""is what it is."" Republicans are marking time, along with the president.

Where's his concern about the safety of our children? Oh, I forgot; his son is safe. What else matters?

The ""dealmakers"" on the Hill, particularly and especially Republicans, know that we are in desperate straits but there's no sense of urgency. They left Washington last Thursday without an agreement. Republicans hold poised the knife waiting to plunge it into the heart of America's center.

I recall the 1971 song warning of ""Smiling Faces Sometimes."" But the party of ""No!' certainly found money for a $1.7-trillion sloppy kiss to the one percent in 2017. And Trump's still at approximately 40% in the polls?

People on unemployment are collecting it because their job is no longer available to them due to Covid-19 shutdowns or their place of work has a reduced schedule or cliental,  hence fewer workers needed.

And at this time it is mostly not safe to return to work for most workers.

You are assuming the risk by entering the premises. (Georgia Senate Bill (SB) 359: Georgia COVID-19 Business Safety Act)

I’m sorry, but when did a public school become a business? Teachers have no option to work from home in this district. So they are REQUIRED to assume the risk of entering the building. They either assume the risk, or resign. 260 teachers sick with COVID after one day of planning sounds like a risk no one should be required to take.

The concept that worker's should be given the freedom to decide their own health and ultimate fate is contrary to social stratification defined by  Capitalism.

Also, I think your article could be more accurate. It’s not just Trump’s “critics” who say he and his administration haven’t done enough to combat the pandemic. The science, the data, and the comparison with the far better outcomes of advanced nations tell us that his non-response and total lack of leadership has been catastrophic. Now Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans are adding to this debacle by not coming to aid lower and middle income Americans who have no jobs through no fault of their own. We will shortly be in a Great Depression II, thanks to these modern day Hoovers.  They tell us we can’t tax the ultra-wealthy business tycoons because it might discourage them from working, but it’s ok to refuse to provide a $600 benefit that means avoiding eviction and hunger because they are afraid people might be discouraged from working in serf-level wage jobs?

Republicans did everything they could to block anything Obama tried to do and significantly slowed the recovery. They then ran against Obama's supposed poor performance and retook the House in 2010--our dumbest election in recent memory.

I realize this information continues to change because the entire situation is constantly fluid, however, I sometimes find an honest disconnect between the heading and the information provided.

What I find alarming is the number of new deaths in the past 14 days - 36%.

In the meantime, Hurricane Isaias made landfall late Monday in North Carolina.  Heaven knows how many new cases of COVID-19 could result from the aftermath of this storm.

And in the middle of this entire overwhelming nightmare are tens of millions of unemployed individuals. 

Lawmakers continue to argue, fight, disagree and battle over some reasonable measure of a relief package while Trump is ""unconcerned with extending unemployment benefits"" and views the mounting death toll from this pandemic as ""It is what it is.""

Republicans aren't moving to assist because they feel separate from unemployed individuals who need assistance to keep a roof over their head. It's analogous to the drug wars, where urban crack addicts were routinely punished severely, while many heroin addicts from white, comfortable families received sympathy instead. Here Republicans grumble about the laziness of individual Americans and let them flail and figure out an impossible situation for themselves, while businesses led by their wealthy mates in class receive their generous attention.

The second story is Mitch McConnell and the Republicans refusal even to consider the Democrats' bill for additional unemployment compensation, which would help lower income Americans, particularly black and Hispanic workers.

The economy, already historically weakened, will go into free-fall as we near the election and Trump's ""only I can fix it"" message will ring hollow to all.

What it “is” is that he will accept no responsibility, no accountability for the exponential speed and spread of infection and death. What “is” is that the devastation which the coronavirus has wrought upon my fellow countrymen could have been assuaged, indeed prevented, if someone more ethical and moral, more capable, more caring, a real leader, was sitting in the Oval Office.

I doubt there is a single lawmaker who cried because of the fear and uncertainly they saw on the faces of their families because there was no money for . . .  anything, especially the most basic of needs.

For once, just once, I wish every lawmaker could walk a mile or even a block in the footsteps of the millions of unemployed Americans.  But no, I suspect they won't or could care less as they pack up and leave for their month- long recess at the close of this week.

Shortly after that, Congress approved a 2 Trillion economic relief package, the Cares Act (H.R. 748), signed into law on March 27.  

The GOP and White House now are grandstanding again by wanting the next relief package to be as small as possible (1.1 Trillion vs. the 3 Trillion the Dems propose).  

As expected, the GOP plan (backed by the White House) is too small to deal with the size of the economic fallout caused by the pandemic, which was, in comparison with pretty much every other country, disastrous.  

Whether we like it or not, we need to keep the country on a lifeline until 2021 as our political leadership has and continues to fail to bring this virus under control.

2020-08-04 16:43:12,"The Republicans were ecstatic to give companies a $1.8tn tax cut. The economy was growing quickly, unemployment was low, the deficit was $1tn, and approximately one third of that money disappeared overseas in share buy backs, juicing the stock market. Even now, many companies have billions of dollars sat on their balance sheets, doing nothing. Defence spending was increased, every penny borrowed.

Yet the idea of giving a smaller amount to American people in desperate need, who struggle to pay rent, buy food and can't find jobs, is anathema to Republicans. Suddenly, the deficit & national debt are relevant again.

Simply put, Republicans made money out of the tax cut scam, both personally and in stock price increases, by handing cash to American companies. They see no such personal benefit in helping actual American people by handing them cash. The fact that it is temporary, when the corporate tax cuts are permanent, makes no difference to them.

This is the modern Republican party. How much money can I make? What's in it for me? Democrats, meanwhile, try to help the average American, those in need, and don't look to feather their own nests at every opportunity.

Come November, the Republicans will be overwhelmingly rejected by US voters, and America will take a large step to the left, joining the ranks of other developed nations & putting it's populace first.

Trump and his enablers are incapable of coherent policy. Congress appears hopelessly divided along socioeconomic lines: the Fed will take good care of the investor class; the rest must work and take their chances.

Some citizens are concerned about their health and the health of others and happily wear masks. Others doubt the science because of its ‘liberal’ bias and feel personal freedom trumps potential public health. 

Since most infections are asymptomatic, and even most of those who become symptomatic avoid hospitalization, the vast majority of the anti-maskers will essentially get away with it. It’s first order thinking at its most self centered and most tragic. 

Even a new Biden administration will face 40% of the population propagandized by Trump, Fox Noise and right wing media. Hopefully one or more vaccines will protect those who want to be protected by next year, but Trump will still want all the credit.

Given the likely vagaries of vaccine development, deployment and acceptance, we’ll almost certainly emerge from the pandemic gradually. And those at the bottom will have borne the majority of the economic and health consequences.

That is exactly why you do not want a politician to be fully in charge of a public health crisis. Mayor de Blasio apparently has not learned the disaster consequence of Trump by outsourcing the covid-19 testing capacity to his son in law Jared in March.

The entire GOP was defined by cynicism and a hatred of democracy long before most of us were born. The Tea Party was a cynical scam cooked-up and financed by the Koch Brothers to radically increase their already massive wealth and power by making sure they paid no taxes and didn't have to pay a penny to the millions of Americans they poisoned and killed. 

The GOP never cared about deficits. It has proven it over and over again by exploding deficits while in office and railing against them when out of office. 

Lee Atwater's infamous interview of nearly 40 years ago, laced with racist profanity, proved how cynical the talking points of everyone in the GOP has been for decades.

Trump's GOP is the same GOP which has existed for 70 years. It never changes; it advances white supremacy and is for wealthy donors.

Clare Malone of FiveThirtyEight has laid all of this out in: ""The Republican Choice, How a party spent decades making itself white"". 

The GOP has always only cared about maintaining power at all costs. It was a racist party, and a de facto authoritarian party, long before Trump. 

Trump exists because the GOP was willing to do anything, including steal Supreme Court seats to install autocrats and theocrats, in order to destroy democracy and replace it with right-wing authoritarianism."

Tens of millions Americans today lack the money to tide them over until this interruption to our economy ends. The loss of jobs includes other losses as well including health benefits, educational support, peer support, and structured daily schedules. Part of the purpose of the unemployment benefit with the supplement is to incentivize our citizens to avoid contact with others to the greatest extent possible for a protracted time with greatly inadequate understanding of the purpose. None of us particularly enjoys the threat of death or permanent disability after weeks of physical misery preceded by months of isolation. If through compliant efforts of avoidance you’ve remained infection free but are now facing eviction, hunger, and the loss of possessions UNLESS you return to a job with substantial risk of COVID exposure, you are beaten.

	Being a fellow Highschool student myself, it is very saddening to be reading an article like this one. Not only is it devastating news that there was a tremendous uproar in COVID cases in Israel after schools reopened, but it shows me how the school system won’t be the same for quite a while.
As a Junior in High School, I don’t have much longer until I complete my years of schooling and join adulthood America, six years to be exact. With the precautions being taken surrounding the spread of COVID in schooling systems has completely changed the way schools will function. Now, this is not necessarily a negative thing, it is actually very good to see that schools are taking these precautions so that their students don’t get sick. The fact that I am able to start my school year in September and be present in school is a blessing, but it is still unfortunate that the school year will be quite weird. 
Hopefully, lessons are learned from seeing a first-hand account of how Israel opened up schools but was very unsuccessful in containing the virus. Hopefully, these lessons will be transferred over to the American schooling system in order to keep kids as safe as possible while trying to give them as much of a normal learning environment as possible."

South Korea had its first case on or about the same date we did. They had the same information we did. Their death rate per million population is 6. Ours is 482. And climbing. 

So South Korea's death rate is literally about 1% of ours. The other 99% of our death rate is solely attributable to our response to the virus compared to South Korea's. They had testing, tracking and tracing in place. Trump didn't.

In other words, of our 159,000 deaths, well over 150,000 are attributable to the failed response of a failed state. trump is the head of that state who had--as he put it--""total authority"" over our response.

So the statement that ""It’s under control as much as you can control it.” is false. But it might have been true if trump had said that ""It’s under control as much as I controlled it.”  Which of course was not at all. This is not ""It is what it is"".

Anything decided on between Pelosi, Schumer and the white house has no guarantee of senate passage. How about letting Mitch, Mnuchin and Meadows figure out what they stand for and go from there. It seems that the Democratic leaders negotiating with the white house is a fools errand unless and until they have certainty that it can pass both the senate and the house. If they think that they can form enough of a coalition of Democrats and Republicans to get this through, they're just spinning their wheels.

In virtually all of those countries, people haven’t had to choose between going hungry and staying safe. They’ve been provided with enough financial relief to make ends meet. In Canada, where I live, food banks are much busier than normal but there are no 5 mile long traffic jams of cars carrying people to a square meal.

We will be ending hurricane season, and starting cold and flu seasons.  If DACA has been ended, we will have lost 30,000 frontline healthcare workers (ones that we helped pay to train, and who will be welcomed with open arms by other countries).  If the ACA has been ended, over 25 million Americans will have lost healthcare coverage, that doesn't count those who will lose coverage by the rollback of Medicaid expansion.  All Americans with pre-existing conditions (as many as 133 million) will lose the guarantee that they can get healthcare coverage, or get it at a comparable price.

I will concede that children born in households where love and guidance is never shown tend to be dysfunctional and attract mates who are similar.  Many of us who were born in the 1940s and 1950s were products of homes where parents did not often show emotion, where at times tenderness was not visually displayed, fathers tended to have more than one job in order to provide for their families, often children were to be seen and not heard, mothers were homemakers, they did not enjoy the modern appliances that made life easy, their funds were often limited, but through all of this, there was a hidden understanding that you were loved.

How hard should it be to give massive aid to distressed state and local governments so that they are not forced to cut jobs and services during a raging pandemic and an economic collapse?

I even work when it is just enough money to negate what my unemployment check would be that particular week. I am proof that when people can work, they work. 

I've never taken unemployment before, and when this is done, I am not likely to again. But the UI insurance has done what it should. I pay my rent. I pay my bills. I feed my kids. It has kept my family from being homeless. It has functioned as a safety net should. 

And when I can, I work. 

Every Republican or ""conservative"" talking point is nothing more than an empty sales pitch. They are the greedy, xenophobic, fear-filled portion of our society who don't seem to understand the meaning of community. 

They are the people who donate to charities for the tax breaks, but when people really need help, they shake their heads and say ""I wish I could"" and then move along.

Or MUCH better funding for hiring and the maintenance of our National and State parks that are getting so much use right now since flying and international travel is not happening.  These are jobs the government could create right now. Just give the “Creation of Jobs”  job to any PTA mom whose ever held a cupcake sale and you’ll see progress and programs to get people back to work.

It's already Tuesday evening and still no deal or agreement and come Friday, these lawmakers will be gone for a month.  An entire month.

A decision should have been reached weeks if not months ago instead of this kind of torture for millions in not knowing if that added $600 a week will continue or not.

This isn't some kind of high risk poker game but rather millions of lives are at stake and risk here.  This continual shake of the dice to see if an agreement can or will be reached is insane.  I truly believe this political game playing is about finally agreeing to an agreement as long as Republicans get what they really want in the end.  It's not about helping millions of people, it's only about them and whatever their GOP agenda is.

The ""not insignificant minority"" of Democrats in the Senate that McConnell refers to with such disdain comprises 47% of the votes in the Senate, and represent citizens of 28 of our 50 states!

The fact that McConnell and the rest of the Republicans don't acknowledge that Democrats represent just as many voters as the Republicans do demonstrates how hubristically out of touch the Republicans are.  After years of demonizing Democrat citizens as ""not representing true American values,"" and after not even acknowledging that Trump lost the popular vote by more than 3,000,000 votes, he now deigns to call the Dems ""not insignificant?!?!?

As quoted above, the multiple dipping is the same as an opioid addict going from doctor to doctor to get multiple prescriptions for the same medication. Neither is legal, to the best of my knowledge. Perhaps more to the point is a comparison with party goers who stand around the onion dip and one after another after another take a potato chip and double dip it in the dip bowl. Before you know it, the dip is gone. That's what's been happening with the pandemic relief funds. To the money hogs and the double dippers goes all the money.

It is wrong to compensate those not working an adequate live-able income, while depriving an adequate income to those holding down a job.

I understand, and agree with, the argument that one should not earn more on unemployment than one earns by working.   But the better way to prevent this is to raise the minimum wage to a live able wage.   Poverty wages are wrong, regardless of the existence of a pandemic."

The richest fifth of Americans will received nearly two-thirds of total benefits of the Tax cuts in 2018 and the richest 1 percent alone will receive 83 percent of the total benefits in 2027.

“And wherever this thing settles between the president of the United States and his team that has to sign it into law and the Democrat not-insignificant minority in the Senate and majority in the House is something I am prepared to support, even if I have some problems with certain parts of it.”

This quote demonstrates McConnell's shameful laissez-faire attitude about working at all to help average Americans who are suffering.

However, the Times left out a significant continuation of the quote, which I found on Yahoo:

""McConnell conceded that Republicans cannot seem to agree on a negotiating position.  “If you’re looking for total consensus among Republican senators, you’re not gonna find it,” McConnell said when asked on what the future of the extra unemployment benefits should be. “We do have divisions, about what to do.”""

In other words, McConnell admits that he's just gonna punt and not even be bothered with being part of the negotiations, because he knows that his Republican mob can't get their act together.

OK, that's fine. But why didn't he do this six weeks ago, when the Dems in the House passed their bill?  Why did he declare it ""dead on arrival,"" and then waste 6 weeks trying to corral his unruly mob, and then concede failure and shrug AFTER the financial help for American workers expired?

This is what Americans get when they vote for ""The Party of No"": They wreck everything; then promise something better; then fail to deliver anything at all."

So how can Mitch McConnell betray this policy and pay unemployed Americans a staggering sum of $600 a week?

2020-08-04 14:07:33,Why the woke fascination with sex work?  (I don't confuse it with actual concern for other humans.)
2020-08-04 13:55:52,"So called “sex work” in Italy and elsewhere is a direct result of poverty. This has been well documented long before the virus hit.

The idea that selling your body parts and running the risk of STD’s,  violence, robbery and domination by pimps and organized crime is a liberal fantasy that has somehow gained currency in the West.

It’s argued that sex work is a choice and should be legalized. Studies that have interviewed women in Germany, New Zealand and selected counties in Nevada where prostitution is legal showed that sex work represents the absence of real choice for women.

Do you know any girls who say “when I grow up I want to work truck stops at 2:00 in the morning?”

Sex work should be decriminalized. But being a John should not. As long as men have the option to turn women into a commodity they will do so and this view of women as a thing to be bought and sold will retard every effort to achieve real equality for women.

Let’s establish real equality and real choice for women in education, employment  opportunities, social life and politics and then let’s see how many actually freely choose to sell themselves to men?

For now, Italy should use this moment of the perils of the virus to help these women get out of prostitution. Safety for them means real safety, not just temporary measure because of the virus."
2020-08-04 14:11:41,"How is it that Italy has ""sex workers"" while America only has ""human trafficking victims?"""
2020-08-04 15:52:34,"""Prostitution is not illegal in Italy, nor is it regulated as an official occupation.""

And there's the problem."
2020-08-04 15:31:43,"As much as we would like to talk about the sex workers I think we need to look at the real problems here. Many of these people have poverty due to many reasons. What should be done is getting help from others like we are supposed to do. The UN passed a bill stating that each country needs to provide 7% of their budget to help poverty in foreign countries. Only three countries actually do. America gives less than 1%. Instead of talking about these poor women who have to do this to live, lets talk about how to actually help people in poverty live a life they deserve. If you need more information go to Borgenproject.org we can help these people."
2020-08-04 14:08:23,"Silly subtitle sentence:  “But the coronavirus has forced many sex workers to accept certain risks in order to avoid poverty.”

ALL sex workers ALREADY accepted certain risks in order to avoid poverty."
2020-08-04 16:29:03,"I don’t know who is moderating these comments but the NyTimes picks show a clear bias toward legalizing “sex work” and an amoral perspective.

What evidence does Ben have that sex work has existed since the dawn of time? Do Chimpanzees or gorillas or any of our other close mammal relatives engage in sex work? 

It’s exploitation. It’s not a choice. Johns may delude themselves that it is voluntary, to justify their behavior. But, how voluntary is it when you are an immigrant supporting three other (female!) relatives back home as this article details. 

No it isn’t just heterosexual, but transsexuals are over represented. Why? Because they are marginalized and discriminated against!!"
2020-08-04 15:42:13,"Stop calling the exploitation of poor women sex work.
Sweden is right: prostitution can never be regarded as a job. Do not legalize as it increases human trafficking as well as illegal immigration; countries who thought they do good found out that legalizing increases demand and that there are just not enough Dutch, German, Spanish .... women willing to have sex with multiple men on a regular basis for (often little) money. Help the women, punish the clients and put the traffickers in prison."
2020-08-04 15:01:14,What a horrible business to be in any time.  Maybe this Corona virus will scare them and make them stop.  They are only shortening their lives and there customers.  Listen to music to relax daily and look for a safer job.  There will be openings now with the thousands that died from the virus.
2020-08-04 17:48:46,"One of the most moving parts of this article is the story of Regina Satariano, a sixty-year-old sex worker who scraped together all she had to provide food for other sex workers.  She is straight out of the pages of the Gospel, and her action made me cry.  Let's do all we can to protect women in this country like Regina.  They deserve our support."
2020-08-04 16:37:51,"this is primarily a failure of Italian government.  Either make it illegal and enforce the law or legalize, regulate and protect sex work like other jobs.  Sex work is in limbo because its not illegal but workers have no rights and protections and thus get no help from government like other workers."
2020-08-04 16:52:03,"Sex work, like abortion, cannot be stopped.  Rich people will always have access to abortion and to purchase sex.  If these practices are made illegal, they just go underground and become more dangerous for the pregnant women and sex workers (by choice or not).  By all means enhance economic opportunities for poor, uneducated and undocumented people.  Sex work primarily attracts people who have few other options."
2020-08-04 17:48:03,"I would prefer to hear from the ""sex workers"" or ""human trafficking victims"" themselves before making a determination about what is best for them, and what exactly is their predicament.

What do they need to feel safe? Do they want to continue selling sex for money? Are they being forced by someone or a group?

I'm willing to listen to whatever arguments advocates have for or against. However, I would not solely trust people who claim speak for others, particularly others labeled by some as victims.

Thank you."
2020-08-04 19:40:38,"For all those commenting that prostitution has existed since ancient times:  it wasn't long ago that people said that about slavery.  

It was said that slavery existed since ancient times, it was even in the Bible, that it would always exist, that it was the correct order of human society that some would be slaves, that it was an economic necessity, etc. etc. etc.  

Most of us - Sen. Tom Cotton being one notable exception - no longer accept this.  

It's time to stop accepting that ""sex work"" - which is mostly carried out by human trafficking victims - will always be with us, is inevitable, a ""necessary evil,"" etc.  It is another form of slavery."
2020-08-04 13:22:29,"I feel for the people in this article but wow!  I can’t help wondering how much markup these caterers are building into their prices that a pop-up restaurant with very little overhead is not coming anywhere close to helping.

These include event planners, bands, DJ companies and other entertainers, photographers, videographers, florists, decor, linen, tent, lighting, table, chair, and dance floor rental companies, providers of customized party favors, event venues, private bus companies, and many others."
2020-08-04 14:32:01,"Thank you for sharing this, those of us in crowd based events businesses have been all but left out of the conversation. Every single one of my peers in weddings and events is suffering, I am/was a wedding florist and my next scheduled event is August 2021. It took me 10 years to build my business and in just a few months, I'm seeing the entire industry evaporate. Pivoting is not optional, we have to reinvent and many will have to move on. I don't want to be bailed out, I don't have any certainty it will ever be the same. Thanks for writing this, you should talk to music venues, people that work in concert venues, touring bands. There are so many of us who spent our working lives among crowds that have no prospects of resuming our work safely and for actual profit."

It has been humbling.  I have not had to let anyone go thanks to a PPP loan and we have become much more nimble and just struggled through this fidning different revenue streams.

The roommate or at the least the school should have notified him about the positive test given his medical history but given HIPPA laws probably could not be done. Also, given the fact that the school is going to remote learning does make you wonder why the players need to be there at the risk of their own health.  Mr. Woods should be proud of the stand that he and other PAC-10 players are taking more should do so to change the system and be the next wave of ""good trouble""."
2020-08-04 18:31:57,"The NCAA plantation system will end this season, starting with football.  And the obscenely paid coaches and ADs can't stand it.  It works for them, so why care about anyone else?"
2020-08-04 18:33:22,"There is no way to make big-time college sports clean. It should be abandoned.  It perverts the academic function of the university. My college had no football team.  I suspect we studied more in the fall than they do at Football U. 

There is minor league baseball. Let there be minor league football and basketball.  No need to mix this with the universities. Club sports are fine."
2020-08-04 19:58:40,"There is a movement now in America-long overdue-from college and professional athletes demanding a voice in matters of their health and well-being. Players are concerned about racism and social justice more than ever before. This ""movement"" will gain momentum because it puts players on the moral high ground. Coaches and ADs around America are going to see themselves being pictured as villains. 

I think this is going to be watershed year in collegiate sports which will put a spotlight on NCAA and individual institutions for their historical ""deafness"" and the evolution of college coaches as  potentates. The term ""student athlete"" is considered as a kind of joke because it is an impossible task for almost all athletes recruited-with some few exceptions at some few colleges. The pandemic has brought the relationships between athletes and their coaches and AD into newer focus which should lead to a totally different pathway for the future."

Mr. Rolovich contends that his words were misconstrued and, it seems, that the prohibition of participation is due to the opting out for health reasons, not for ""speaking out"" or for membership in the Pac-12 Conference unity group.

It seems to me that when the very matter that is being contested here hinges on what was actually said and meant, and when the interpretation what was actually said and meant is in dispute, the NYTimes should have, at the very least, provided a verbatim transcript of the relevant part of the conversation so that readers could judge for themselves the validity of each interpretation."

Why do we say a scholarship is enough? they don't tell you that 20K is enough for hat you do.

As a public institution, Washington State must follow the First Amendment, and it can in no way punish the player (e.g. pull his scholarship and kick him off the team) for exercising his rights.  His scholarship should be reinstated and he should be returned to team status, even if he is not playing."

2020-08-04 19:11:25,"Considering the the civil penalties risked, not to mention the derailing of the college career of Kassidy, Mr. Woods showed real courage in coming forward with this evidence.

This is awful exploitation under the yoke of the plantation, as others here have expressed.

You really have to question the judgment and maturity of Coach Rolovich.   The thoughtful, prudent, compassionate coach would have said, ""I understand, Kassidy.   You come back and be a Cougar when you feel comfortable.""

But instead Rolovich said, ""Clean out your locker.""    

Woods has a serious, genetic blood disorder.   But one that is not uncommon in African Americans.    WSU has had some great African Amercian players in the past.    But it is also in the agrarian Palouse, next to the Idaho border, and there ain't a lot of black folks out there.    This incident sends a horrible message to black recruits.

WSU should terminate Coach Rolovich on a morals clause in his contract.   Given the previous coach was controversial Mike Leach, I'm sure that is the case.   Why would the WSU administration or the Martin Stadium crowd want Rolovich representing them?   This comes from a team in the ""Conference of Champions"" that Bill Walton is always lauding.  

I'll tell you what Kassidy, y'all come down to Tucson.   Coach Sumlin has a spot for you."
2020-08-04 18:05:38,"I am a WSU alum, shame on you Rolovich!  Was he hand picked by Leach when he left since Leach himself was not very tolerant of differences of opinion.  Treating these kids like property is awful, this is 2020 and they play on a football field not a plantation.

Kassidy Woods is becoming a leader and we should all support and wish kids who face obstacles in life with honesty the best.  I will remember his name much longer than whoever this coach is.  All the best to you young man!"

2020-08-04 18:37:19,"The old adage in the football biz for players as well as coaches was: ""The you're hired, you're one-day closer to being fired ... !""
The unfortunate fact is: No one (especially) on the coaching / admin-side cares - you can add pro coaches and agents to the mix later in your career!! When you're no longer productive on the field or from a marketing prospective, you're gone ... And, until things change this is the way it's going to be, period!
The good news is these kids and current crop of pro-players are getting wise to how much the system uses and abuses them, regardless of the sport, and they're beginning to stand-up for themselves and collectively to make demands for a fairer share of the money pie they generate ... 
The better news, and what the likes of the counter-intuitive Rolovich and Chun - the entire NCAA for that matter - don't seem to get, is there now even more susceptible to getting kick-off-the team, out'a the league and not hired again as a coach, largely due to a complete lack of understanding of how the sports business has changed so much, in such a short period of time ... 
Young Mr. Woods may not know it, but in many respects, he and his fellow players are modern-day Curt Flood(s) ... !!! Good for you young man ..."
2020-08-04 20:06:59,"Good for Kassidy Woods, I support him and feel like the coach/university is exploiting these young men. They should let Woods get his education and not take away his scholarship. I attended WSU back in the early nineties and it's a strange place. It was a mostly white campus and the majority of students who were black were athletes. It's also located in a fairly racist area of the country, I recall that a WSU athlete had strayed too far from campus one year and was found lynched in Northern Idaho. After that, university officials would have to tell black students not to travel too far from campus.

Two faced white men with the serious lack of morals and support for common human decency should not coach anywhere. They need a coach they can look up to.

Honoring their demands regarding pay for play would immediately make any school non-compliant with NCAA bylaws, this causing great financial harm for the educational institutions. This coach was correct in protecting his employer (Washington State) by dealing with this situation the way he did. The player recording the conversation (which was benign) shows he was never acting in good faith. The player also needs to understand that when making an ultimatum in life, the situation can go one of two ways, i.e. demands aren’t always met. This entire story is much ado about nothing."

What...?

When did it become mandatory that young men and women had to play college sports? I always thought playing a sport was a life choice and not a college requirement (like freshman english). If you want a college degree then go to college and get one. If you want to attend college and play sports because you actually 'love the game' then sign up for intramural sports. If you want to attend college and play for the school then you play by their rules.

When I read this article it sounded like someone thought they were entitled to play football and get paid and opt out and protest and do whatever they felt like doing while expecting the college to agree to their demands. College isn't about sports or paying someone for playing a game. College is about getting an education...or have we all forgotten about that?"

We are using telemedicine extensively to triage and manage noncommunicable diseases as well as several other diseases. The availability of drugs and tests is critical however . There has been panic and many have forgotten basic principles of care in the chaos. Patients should not ignore symptoms and delay coming to the clinic or hospital . The pandemic has created opportunities to care for many patients more comprehensively using technology and the benefits will surely last beyond this timeframe. Using the same means to identify and track TB could perhaps be done now more thoroughly. It is time to involve the community in doing this.

I would just add that what doesn’t get conveyed is the same people who are fighting HIV, TB, Malaria, Anti-microbial resistance by supplying all the drugs are the same people fighting Covid-19 by supplying all the drugs and they are doing double duty right now.

Consider the huge proportion of deaths that have occurred in care homes in many western nations, wherein many people are near their natural deaths. Consider the CDC research suggesting that actual cases are 10X or more those reported, putting the death rate under one percent.

Where was the concern for human life when it was not mom or dad and when it was easily preventable on a global scale? 

Instead we have public shaming over masks, hectoring of youth who want to live their low risk lives, massive disruption, and economic ruin for many because people are not able or willing to face the brutal realities that nature dolls our regularly.

The impact on TB diagnoses was immediate: The number of new cases recorded by the Indian government between March 25 and June 19 was 60,486, compared with 179,792 during the same period in 2019.""

The decrease in TB diagnoses could be due to the lack  of crowding in public places due to the strict weeks-long lockdown from March 24th onwards. After all, TB ""infection prospers in crowds, spreading to people in close reach"" as the article notes in the first para.

Hence, the lockdown measures designed to prevent COVID-19 transmission may have prevented as many  TB transmissions than usual in a similar period.

There is evidence - with regard to COVID-19 - that India's lockdown was effective in stalling the momentum of infections. Brazil and the US which both have smaller populations but did not observe a nationwide lockdown each have more deaths than India with 1.3 billion people. This shows the effectiveness and criticality of the lockdown measures in a country. India's quick doubling rate had improved.

It is possible for cases to be understated due to limitations in testing capacity and the difficulty in detecting asymptomatic cases. But India is accepted to have kept *deaths* down for COVID-19. With 500 million smartphone users and the most newspapers, there is no way of hiding the deaths."

Are you kidding me.

I have been visiting other public health systems versus just the one I am intimately acquainted with where I live in Appalachia. Where public health is appalling.

I take notes. I listen. I have one compelling observation.

Foster families. The throwaways. Kids with no advocates whatsoever.

Emergency placements are becoming emergencies themselves. The American South is bearing the brunt the nightmare.

I have seen babies in public health clinics having their diapers changed on clinic waiting room floors. I have seen boys who do sex work turn around and leave clinics (often armed cops are at the doors) to return to sex work.

In order to survive. Leave morality out of it. These are kids. Sex work buys food.

Many of these kids are familiar with the foster care system and the placement cycles of disease. We call them the hard to reach. What exactly do they have to reach for.

They will be returning to public school, too. Kids are going to die. Teachers are going to die. Staff is going to die. There is no money.

The boys who do sex work call their customers tricks. These men never face consequences. They become invisible. But not this time. Tricks are going to die.

Kids who have committed no crime are being placed in juvenile detention centers. Where disease is rampant. As disease numbers rise. So do sexually transmitted diseases.

Not only is there a wave of deaths from treatable and preventable diseases as described in this article, there is growing hunger and starvation around the world.

Many of those who recommend strict lockdowns include some epidemiologists, public health officials, and members of the press who seem to have dangerous tunnel vision. They realize, correctly, that strict lockdowns will ""flatten the curve"" and prevent local surges, but they seem to fail to take into account the catastrophic collateral damage.

Many experts also believe that mass protests are harmless, which is also a blatant falsehood on the other side of the equation.

Until there is a vaccine, there is no universally correct solution, and for sure there is no playbook. But the best approach is likely a balanced one. Perhaps the most important thing is that we all wear masks, whenever we are in public.  Mass protests, with continued close contact, usually with strangers, shouting, and yelling, are dangerous behavior during a pandemic caused by respiratory virus.  Leaf blowers can cause lethal spread of the virus.

At the same time, strict, Draconian lockdowns and a complete shutdown of the world economy likely cause more deaths than they prevent.

Common sense and balance, people!!"
2020-08-03 20:08:32,For starters there is an excellent vaccination for TB - BCG. This country needs an aggressive program to educate people on the benefits of vaccination. There are too many fundamental religious fanatics trying to dictate others on matters they have no knowledge of. Almost as if they want to drag us all back into the middle ages. The other big problem is that there is no wiil to spend money on quality public health programs. It is not called the Health Industry for nothing. The word says it all.

Call it whatever you like, but it's unchecked over population. The U.N.'s answer for it all is mass migration instead of discussing ways to curtail the growth.

We do have to hope for the silver lining mentioned at the end of the article.  While NGOs have managed to do great things, it is time to teach these countries to fish .. in other words to set up their own health systems to insure that life-saving medicines are distributed down to the final mile.  And the US and other wealthy countries could fund this down through the government, with plenty of help in rooting out corruption ..

It would be wonderful, if the world community wanted to provide affordable or free health care to all the 7. 6 billion humans on the planet.  Here is my deal, I work for that, if it includes comprehensive family planning, and and effort for negative population growth. Scientists like Edward O Wilson, or some of his friends, have suggested that the worlds ecosystems and non human species would be much better off if the human population was not greater than 4 billion. Any number greater than that is probably unstainable, without the crowding out of many other species. So, we can do like grownups. or let nature do it with pandemics, floods, famines, fires, droughts, and civil wars.

But hey, let's shut the country down. To be followed by:
Total economic collapse
Millions in destitution
Starvation
No health care, unless wealthy

It is mostly because individuals don't always use condoms, with both heterosexual, and homosexual sex.  This was also how HIV was often spread, and having HIV lowers ones immunity, making you more vulnerable to catching TB, which is often more virulent than in times past. The nature of the human animal isn't given to thinking first about those practices that protect themselves from danger, whether sexually transmitted disease, the COVID-19, drug addiction, auto accidents, obesity, lung cancer, and emphysema, etc."

Covid is nothing. Its barely more than the flu. If we tallied all the asymptomatic people and people who had covid but never got tested I bet we would see a death rate only a bit more than the Flu. Now kids won't be going to school, business will fail, people will get other diseases like TB and drug addiction or fail to get their HIV meds and they will die needlessly. Covid is really only dangerous to old people. Instead of telling old people to be careful we decided to shut the entire world down. I bet more will die from these decisions than will ever die of Covid. And I bet that people who make these arguments will be shamed and vilified by the left, who seem to actually enjoy Covid because it hurts Trump."

2020-08-04 11:36:39,I wonder if there is a small upside attached to the health focus being moved so far towards Covid-19; will the increase in mask wearing and in social distancing also help prevent the transmission of T.B.?

COVID will increase TB deaths for the reasons outlined in the article.  COVID has reversed at least a decade of efforts in controlling TB, HIV and malaria.

2020-08-04 10:13:02,"Handwashing, mask-wearing (or even covering the face properly with a cloth), and social distancing, can be an effective strategy to mitigate or prevent an epidemic of any infectious disease, be it TB or COVID-19. The problem is compliance of following restrictions by the majority of people vs defiance by a small minority, who become super-spreaders.
 
I recall strict social distancing norms imposed by my mother, at our home in a small town in Punjab, India, for full 2 years, relaxing only on April 19, 1961 when my father, whom I called Taaya,  died prematurely at age 43, after having contracted TB. He had started losing appetite and weight, which came down to just 37 kg in 1958.  Besides, he would have bouts of coughing. Medical tests confirmed in early 1959 that he had TB, contracted, I believe from malnutrition during prolonged periods of joblessness.
 
As a caregiver, my mother not only attended to my father, but also made sure that she protected me and herself from the infection, using the only three weapons available - keeping distance from the patient, covering the face while interacting with him, and general sanitation. She isolated Taaya in a separate room, and separated his utensils. He was asked not to spit openly in public, and to cover his mouth when coughing or sneezing.

My mother saved me as well as herself from TB. She lived to the age of 74, until she died in 1997. Let us follow simple preventive measures, without fail, to avoid COVID-19

Of course, the most vulnerable communities will be most highly impacted. TB is now threatening to kill more people than COVID-19. 

How do we respond ? The United States has led the world in building a global health infrastructure to support low income countries. The Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and MALARIA is a critical anchor. The fund has saved more than 32 million lives and cut HIV, TB, and MALARIA by nearly half since its inception.
According to The Global Fund website the fund has made available around $1 Billion to support countries as they respond to the pandemic. That money is nearly gone. The fund estimates that it will need $5 Billion to mitigate the impact of the Covid in the next 12 months.  

This week US Senate is considering what Covid related-issues must be addressed in its emergency COVID funding bill. Fortunately there is funding included for GAVI.
GAVI is an international organization provides basic vaccines for children living in the world’s poorest countries. There has been no money allocated for the Global Fund despite the urgent need. Our country has the capacity to address the pandemic both at home and around the world. There is huge cost in not doing so.

Good luck with that one!"
2020-08-03 14:42:03,"Where I am, the major insurance companies have already stopped paying for telemedicine visits.  Medicare still OK.  
So people generally have to come back to the office, the same was that it was before coronavirus.  

So telemedicine is NOT here to stay, and is generally already finished here."
2020-08-03 14:49:13,"This is just one more reason of many why America MUST step up and make broadband available to EVERYONE.  It is not something that ""would be nice.""  It is necessary for everything we are going to be doing in the future."
2020-08-03 15:04:46,"Austin ISD is removing nurses from schools, and going to a telemedicine program.  Enrollment this year had an opt-out for doctors to prescribe medication to your child after ""treating"" them virtually.  No consulting the parents or pediatrician, first.  I nearly broke my computer mouse clicking that one.  That's one step farther than I am willing to go.

On the other hand, our trusted family doctor has seen the kids via Zoom a couple of times, and it hasn't been a big deal at all.  If it saves money, and gets the same result, that's great.  Most of the time she is dealing with the same three or four issues, anyway.  She's known our kids since they were three hours old."
2020-08-03 15:05:02,"We have been effectively using remote visits (Zoom or FaceTime, occasional phone only) in our primary care practice in Massachusetts since March. The telemedicine visits are essentially comparable to in-person visits except where physical examination is critical, in which case we now are able to bring the patient in. But we also do a rapid Covid-19 antigen test (Quidell) for active disease before the patient enters the office, for our protection and theirs. This strategy has enabled us to properly care for our patients. 

Virtual visits should be paid exactly as in-person visits, indefinitely. The visits are equally resource intensive and in practice less efficient of provider time. Physicians and other providers are dedicated professionals who make clinical venue choices with care, respecting the clinical need and patient and staff safety.

Continued full payment for telemedicine is essential to the financial survival of primary care practices. We will need virtual visits long into the future. The insurance reimbursement should not be made even more complex by second-guessing nor restricted by caveats nor starved by reduced payment levels. 

And, insurers and policy makers should note, patients (at least ours) overwhelmingly like virtual visits as a regular alternative. We feel virtual visits as a regular tool allow for better care of our patients."
2020-08-03 15:10:08,"I've have been using telepsychology since the start of the pandemic, as have many of my colleagues. Clients say they are comfortable with them and respond similarly to coming for an office visit - exploring stressful experiences, getting support for depression and anxiety, applying solutions and moving to next steps in treatment. Many say they prefer telesessions for the convenience, especially people with mobility problems. Two items are overlooked by the article. Healthcare providers themselves may be at higher risk from the coronavirus. I am one of those people advised in my state to ""stay home, stay healthy"" until Phase 4 of reopening. This is because I have four risk factors and will be unable to safely return to in-person sessions until I can be vaccinated. What will happen for continuity of care of my clients if my sessions are no longer covered by insurance or Medicare? Also, there would be a reduced cost if psychotherapists could provide services from a home office, sharing commercial office space for essential visits. Does this mean our rates should be reduced for such visits? Managed care has already squeezed my profession with low fees. I expect that teletherapy effectiveness is being studied during this time and would not be surprised if it is found to be as effective as in-person visits for the majority of clients."
2020-08-03 15:13:34,"I think telemedicine may work for known conditions only. I worry about those conditions the doctor stumbles across sometimes. For example my friend's extremely aggresive leukemia was discovered by her gynecologist in a routine exam. Her doctor was an excellent listener and observed things that weren't ""in her wheelhouse"". Still she put several pieces together and certainly saved my friend's life. Would everything have come together like that in a virtual appointment?"
2020-08-03 15:17:01,"Until recently, in California, it was long considered a violation of the standard of care for a physician to prescribe any medication without a good-faith medical exam.  Necessity has thrown that standard out the window.  Maybe.

Vital signs can’t be obtained over the phone.  Doctors actually have brains, and powers of observation.  They gather and interpret a great deal of data just by interacting with a patient in person, by seeing the patient walk, and by seeing the undressed patient’s skin.  Telemedicine has its place, especially for follow-up appointments.  But much is lost without an in-person visit.

The bottom line is that insurance companies will be happy with telemedicine if it saves them money.  It will become another excuse to pay physicians less.  Patients will find telemedicine to be more convenient, and they will not typically understand what has been lost."
2020-08-03 15:19:27,"And, quite frankly, would most physicians consider it real medicine?"
2020-08-03 15:26:48,"I think we MUST embrace telemedicine.  It is a no-brainer to save time and money.

I go to the physician fairly frequently and I think telemedicine would work just fine for at least 2/3 of my visits.  I'm an old person with chronic conditions and a lot of my stuff involves monitoring my lab numbers and talking things over.

Is it appropriate for every situation?  Of course not."
2020-08-03 15:32:46,"As an older person I see several doctors and I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I could see them via Zoom. It is some distance to my doctor and would have meant money I really don't have to get to those appointments using Uber.
I feel as though the doctor and I talked about what we needed to and covered everything.
I would like to continue doing this for everything except, of course, when i need a physical exam."
2020-08-03 15:46:52,"As a primary care physician for almost 4 decades I am in full support of continuation of telemedicine. It has been a lifeline for so many of my older, medically complex seniors during the Covid crisis. And in truth there are many issues--medical and psychosocial which can be well addressed with telemed visits. It does not replace in person care but it will be an essential adjunct for the foreseeable future."
2020-08-03 15:56:12,"I just had a telemedicine appointment this morning.  Both my doctor and I hate it, but it's now a necessity and it serves an important function.

It's not the same as an in-person appointment, but we have to make allowances and get the job done.  I do think telemedicine is here to stay, as long as we recognize that it has limitations and we can't expect it to solve all the important jobs of going to see your physician.

My new pandemic motto is:  Accept and adapt."
2020-08-03 16:02:28,"I work for a very big med school and we are using TeleMed right now to help train our students in using this technique.  We've been doing this for at least 10 years.  Originally we thought it would be an enormous help for rural patients that otherwise would have to travel 200 miles to see their doctor or for patients who have a difficult time getting to their doctor for whatever reason.  Now we see it as the wave of the future.  Nothing will ever take the place of seeing a doctor in person, but many, many office visits can be done and done well and safely by Zoom.  TeleMed is here to stay and I think both patients and doctors will be better off for that.  Insurance companies need to figure it out...Or we need Single-Payer Health Care!"

A young, eloquent, health-educated person can get a lot out of a telehealth appointment.  

There are a lot of other kinds of patients that don't know what they are missing in terms of care, at least not until they are in the ER for problems that were missed.

The capacity for Medicare fraud is huge.  

I don't want to foot the bill because the government just made stealing from it so much easier."
2020-08-03 16:57:48,"Telemedicine has a place, and has been around for a while, but it's inadequate at best.  While there were a few months where there was no other way for doctors to 'see' their patients, that time is over.  Yet, my doctor still refuses to go to the office, despite nurses and PAs on site.  

Telemedicine should never be considered as a replacement for in-person care."
2020-08-03 17:52:37,"While obviously not a panacea, Telemedicine certainly has its place in the health care provider universe. The major concerns being fraud prevention and possible aggressive reimbursement cost reductions by insurance companies. 

I absolutely love the ability to participate in virtual health care  finding it extremely convenient when its appropriate."
2020-08-03 18:48:35,Telemed is definitely a part of the future of medicine. But billing for $4 billion in March-April for '20 vs. $60 million for the same period in '19 means some major fraud is going on which will have to be stopped before telemed will proceed on a continuing basis in this country.
2020-08-03 19:50:16,"The patient will see you now 

This is not a time for tentative toe-dipping into virtual care. Going virtual is the new requirement for providers to retain their customers. Consumers are already differentiating the value of virtual care from legacy medicine: 36% reported they would switch their physician to have access to virtual care.

Advances in medical science over the last century have more than doubled the average life span. Yet our experience as patients is almost indistinguishable from the days of rotary dial phones. 

Fear of infection chased us to our screens and the novel experience of healthcare coming to us through the convenience of our computers and phones in the relative safety of our homes. 

The COVID-19 pandemic catapulted consumers into the 21st century healthcare experience we’d been missing. And we’re not going back to that rotary dial healthcare.  It’s a message every hospital and health system in the country must heed, and an opportunity for bold leaders prepared to act on this shift in consumer attitudes and expectations."
2020-08-03 20:00:41,"Telemedicine was being used, albeit not as widely, before the pandemic, especially in rural areas of SC that have few specialists.  Often that meant going to a clinic and interacting with a doctor at the Medical University of SC.  In fact, several years ago, a local ED physician used it to contact a neurologist there when my friend had a stroke. Unfortunately, that doctor then decided to ignore the advice of the neurologist and not give a clot buster to my friend, resulting in partial paralysis.  But the point remains that telemedicine was here before the pandemic and has expanded since the pandemic."
2020-08-03 15:25:28,"Telemedicine will democratize health care.
Why do I need to go to a doctor’s office for basic “sick call”?
It’s imbecilic to think we have to do so much “in person” when there is viable technology to help.
Xrays? Yes. I will go to an office for that.  Toe fungus?  Not so much.

Technology and science will keep us from extinction...unless Trump is reelected. Then, we’re all doomed."

I don't need a chat, I need tests that I haven't had in almost 3 years... The only benefits of these type of appt's are for physicians!!

2020-08-03 14:52:46,"I would like to see a “double-blind” study of sorts. 
Do a telemed visit AND an actual visit and see if there was any difference in quality of care. Does it vary be illness? By medical speciality? Can it be aided by supplying a low cost medical equipment kit (digital thermometer, pulse oximeter, BP, ekg, etc) to those enrolled in telemed to monitor vitals. 
And let people opt-in for cost SAVINGS. 
If you and your spouse both have employer coverage, one can opt out for spousal coverage by the other. There is usually a cash incentive to do so, $2,500. 
If people choose telemed share the savings with them.

2020-08-03 14:38:05,"Telemedicine only exists at this moment because it is being reimbursed under emergency orders. Insurance companies will, as soon as they are out from under this ""emergency"", stop reimbursing so as to force (read lower number) patients to show up in person even for verbal discussions that could be done by telemedicine. This will reduce the ""losses"" (insurance companies word for payments it has to make for health services and thus unable to keep for their executive bonuses). Our experience has been that many private insurers reject payment on about 5% of completely legitimate billings just because they have learned it will ultimately lead to resubmission in only 70% of cases the most basic of their  ""loss"" saver strategies. I love capitalism, especially when the insurance companies fund our politicians reelection. We need to things to get as bad as possible where eventually 5 people control 99% of the worlds wealth...then we will all be content."

2020-08-03 15:05:57,"Telehealth is an unmitigated positive for patients when used correctly - it radically expands access to health care while reducing costs.  Needless to say, vested interests in the medical provider space hate it. Before the shutdown, there had already appeared a number of stories (recall the Hubble and SmileDirect stories) fed by medical industry lobbyists to credulous reporters, making reference to bad actors as evidence for how all of us need “protection” from the concept of telehealth writ large. 

Properly regulated, telehealth can be a godsend - let’s hope special interests don’t kill it."

2020-08-03 23:03:35,"Something I didn’t know about telemedicine appointments is that some states require you to be physically in the same state where the doctor is located while you do your telemedicine appointment. To see a doctor at Emory in Atlanta, I have to drive across the state line (anywhere on Georgia soil) to conduct this appointment. Not sure how this appointment is going to work on my phone in the Georgia boonies, but I guess I’ll find out."
2020-08-03 23:17:25,"When they can properly draw blood and do the required tests the labs do, accurately. re what my physician orders every 6 months, then MAYBE tele-medicine would make sense to me -- IF seeing the patient in person didn't help any. 

It's one thing, perhaps, for a young healthy person to call in about a sore throat.  Once people need regular labs to monitor things, it's not buying that much, and risking missing things. 

And if one has to drive in anyway for the labs and be exposed to all the coughing, sneezing, etc. in the waiting room (even without any COVID-19 around), I just don't see the point. 

When the SAFE AND ACCURATE monitoring / scanning machines that catch more than the doctor would are cheap and available for the normal patient to use daily, be sure and get back to us on how normal doctor visits aren't needed."
2020-08-04 00:49:44,"As someone with extremely fatiguing and neurocognitive disabilities I have found telemedicine to be a life changing positive addition to my life.  I'd say 3/4 of my appointments my doctors don't touch me other than the techs taking my temp or weight, both of which I can do from home.  I'm also immunocompromised and concerned about catching viruses and bacterial infections even before COVID.  To no longer take that risk going to the doctor's or to no longer have to exhaust myself driving across town to see a doctor for 15 minutes who just takes a few notes and sends me on my way is miraculous.  

I agree with the article that it needs to be a balance.  Once or twice a year I can go in for some labs.  But I see multiple doctors every 2-3 months and a therapist/neuropsychologist.  It is a lot and now I have at least a bit more energy to manage other parts of my life.  For some this is about accessibility and quality of life."
2020-08-04 01:15:52,"As a psychiatrist I can deliver 99.9999 percent of the care via telehealth vs in person and no one gets sick. In my city a young psychiatrist recently died of covid.  I have patients who have had it. I have patients who also make suboptimal choices and travel to hot zones for vacation. 

Congress needs to mandate universal access to telehealth at in person rates. This is a no brainer. 

If insurance refuses to pay or cover on par then either people will go without care (they won't be able to find providers, especially mental health providers) or will need to pay fully out of pocket as providers drop insurances.

Also, Medicaid wasn't included in the article but is another important piece of the American health care landscape that also needs to cover telehealth."

2020-08-04 01:57:56,"Telemedicine was held back in 1989-91 by the people who created the modern system, RBRVS, that governs all professional billing in medicine.  The reason they allowed payment only for face-to-face visits was predominantly related to prevention of fraud.  It was not the system of private insurance that created this concern.  It was Medicare that was hesitant, and Medicaid followed, then the private insurers.

 With current computer systems, it is now possible to fully document a telemedicine visit.  In addition, the paradigm of billing is rapidly evolving, and the main determinant in the future will likely be time with the provider.  In that case, telemedicine is an equivalent service to a visit in the office.   

There is now no reason to avoid payment for telemedicine.  Given that the effects of covid on society, the risks of transmission, and the issues with safety are not going away quickly, there is a huge probability that telemedicine is here to stay.   It is clear that some aspects of medical care will continue to require hands-on assessment in an office by a doctor, but a huge part of care is now demonstrated to be safe in a virtual environment.  Doctors are rapidly adapting, and the systems are so user-friendly for patients, that even those with fear of computers can use the telemedicine systems.  

This genii is not going back into the bottle....."
2020-08-04 03:15:42,"Like anything else connected to medicine as practiced in the U.S., this can be a good thing or a nightmare.  If it is used in the best interest of the patient's health, it will help health outcomes (allowing people more regular access to their doctors, allowing doctors more regular access to their patients).  But our medical system is not set up to help patients (or doctors).  It is set up to help insurance companies, and pharmaceutical companies.  With this framework, you know that it will be used in situations where it should not be (to replace nurses & staff in schools, in residential settings, in prisons).  Anything where companies tied to the medical distribution chain can see a profit.  

Telemedicine is a tool, no more, no less.  Whether it is a good thing depends on how we use it."

2020-08-04 16:40:22,"Nothing matters more than the health of our children.
I hear a lot of hand-wringing about the inefficacy of online learning, but little actual evidence that it doesn't work.
Children develop so that they are progressively more able to process concepts and acquire skills.  Therefore, many students may actually benefit in having those skills and concepts presented later in the learning process, and it is possible that all may benefit in making up time.
As for college students, is it not possible to set up weekly one-on-one conferences with a mentor (the professor of a small class, or a grad student for the larger ones) as well as a forum for discussion with other students in that class? This even approximates the classical British system for advanced education, which seems to have worked pretty well.
As for working parents in this time - I can't even..."
2020-08-04 16:42:30,"Idk- I live in Boston and the plans most of the universities in the area have for bringing students back actually seem fairly reasonable. They're renting in bulk apartments and hotel rooms to allow social distancing, which is a much needed boon for places that are seeing tourist revenue dried up. And they've secured testing and have a protocol in place for when students get back or get sick. Local businesses really can use the money and I don't have much reason to believe with all the protocols the colleges have in place that it will be much of an added burden to the local health system. 

The other option of course is to make the universities give tuition discounts for going online. For what people are paying to go to school, they really should be getting in person instruction. And with this in mind, I think it's reasonable to adopt a similar attitude towards public schools- put pressure on older, tenured teachers to either go in or retire, otherwise if they're doing online instruction pay them less for doing less work or replace them with young people fresh out of M. Ed programs and give those kids an entry level salary. I know plenty of young folks prior to this who would kill to teach in an urban or suburban school who couldn't find work because tenured teachers didn't want to leave, what with all the perks they get. Either decrease the cost to taxpayer or college student or have a changing of the guard in staff."

2020-08-04 16:45:58,"There is an argument for focusing the greatest effort on providing some in-person education for the youngest students, but the author does not explain why college students should return for an all-remote ""experience"" rather than deferring their return.

2020-08-04 16:47:45,"I will be returning to Tulane University this Fall. Almost all of my courses will be in-person. While the school has planned as safely as possible for an in-person experience, I have little faith in the semester. The school has already let us know that things will not go smoothly, admitting than testing is certainly going to have ""hiccups"", despite their plan being good. I don't quite understand how they can go forward when they're even publicly stating that such critical aspects of the plan are not going to work well.

The problem with universities having a ""traditional"" experience is that the specific elements or technicalities faciliating in-person learning will be so cumbersome that courses by virtue of being safe cannot be ""traditional"".

Moreover, the administration seems so focused on asking ""how can we have safe in-person classes?"" that they forget to ask if we can even be in the same room with 10 other people. 

I expect that my courses will essentially be Zoom calls, but this semester I'll have to wear pants to class."
2020-08-04 16:50:32,"The author is incorrect regarding young children. We now know from a large South Korean study that students aged 10 and above can transmit the disease at the same rate as adults; their younger peers can spread the virus at about half the rate of adults. In addition, a Chicago study found that children five and under can have up to 100 times the amount of the virus than adults. Schools, if they reopen, will certainly not be the same as they were when they were closed in March. Some explain that kids need to go back to “socialize,” however, every opportunity to socialize such as gathering for lunch, having a lab partner, working in groups, going to a dance, play sports, etc, will not happen as we socially distance to keep all, including teachers, safe. Schools under normal circumstances, are breeding grounds for viruses as buildings were designed for maximum capacity, are plagued by poor air ventilation and circulation, and many have failing HVAC systems that are way past their expiration date. You want schools to reopen, which we all do, then society is going to have to fund the necessary repairs and upgrades (including air conditioning) to make students, teachers, and staff safe. I can’t teach my kids from a grave."
2020-08-04 16:53:53,"I was just sharing my thoughts with my husband yesterday that school districts should move to online learning for all middle and high school students--most can handle being home alone if their parents need to work, and allow a select number to learn online in the school building where they can receive extra supports if needed or just get space that they might not otherwise have at home.

This would allow districts to utilize middle school and high school buildings to educate elementary school students, who would suffer the most by a delay, and many of whom are being sent back to the brick-and-mortar school because parents must work and there is no one to watch them. 

I added that I don't think tremendous harm would come if high school students and maybe some middle school students were permitted to take the upcoming year off or take classes part-time, (maintaining math, which, once you fall behind, it's hard to catch up)--they'd graduate a half a year to a year later, but I think they'd cope just fine--just as a college student who occasionally takes time off. Or districts could add a summer option.

Finally, add the option for some non-college bound students to test out of high school and secure a full diploma to further help make space."
2020-08-04 16:55:09,"The ""younger kids don't get infected"" theory was always based on flimsy evidence and is now completely falling apart. In the Georgia summer camp outbreak, 51 percent of the 6-10 age group tested positive compared to 44 percent and 33 percent for older cohorts. ""Isolating"", for a young child, means going home to spread it to family members who care for them, and research shows that mothers do the overwhelming majority of child care even in families where both parents work outside the home.

Please, no more happy talk from economists about how younger children can go to school safely when the virus is spreading at these levels."
2020-08-04 16:58:21,"""For colleges, competition for tuition dollars is pushing them to take outsize risks to get students back on campus, while for public school districts, inadequate funding — combined with the failure of government to curb the coronavirus — is keeping them from getting children safely back into school buildings.""

I would argue that inadequate funding is the reason for *both* of these issues. Public universities have been increasingly relying on tuition money to stay afloat, as state funding has been decreasing over time. If education in general was properly funded, it would be easier to do what is right. 

I hope that this pandemic will make people learn that education, public health, and the economy are all intertwined - if you want a healthy economy for businesses to thrive, you need a well-educated and healthy population."

As a parent of a student in an art college, it feels like these institutions are playing with fire to stay financially afloat while risking my daughter's health and the health of all staff & students.

2020-08-04 17:13:25,"I felt like this comparison, trading off colleges with K-5 schools was off base because they don't feel like a trade to me. Would we be able to open schools more safely if all those college students stayed in their homes rather than coming to a residential environment in schools where they are less in contact with vulnerable parents/grandparents? They would be in contact with vulnerable faculty/staff if those staff interacted with them, but allowing vulnerable faculty to teach online would eliminate that contact. And opening K-5 schools safely does not have the capacity (or desire) to isolate the children from their more vulnerable families. They will still return to their family homes every night. 

(and I do see that college towns, like Ann Arbor might face a different math since their populations increase when students arrive from across the country)"

In the meantime, I’ve enrolled our kids in an online academy. The WHO guidelines, which have been suppressed in the US, call for a positivity rate of  5 percent or less of those tested before schools can open safely. Our positivity rate is around 18.5 percent and hospitals are full. What a great time for in-person instruction!"
2020-08-04 17:19:56,"But, to hear the president of the United States tell it, ""all schools should re-open.""

Until there is a secure and trusted vaccine in place--and that may not be for at least two years--parents and administrators and educators from K-12 through doctoral programs need to come to a no-look-back decision: close all schools to physical access and resort to on-line educations.

The problem I see with that is that students will fall further behind the normal curve, but normal left the building when the Covid-19 entered. The concept of grade schools (1-6); middle school (7-8) and high school (9-12) will have to be either expanded or contracted according to the student's academic history and age. This is all subjective but when will objective in this dynamic appear again?

If we had a functioning president and a functional Secretary of Education instead of the former telling us that ""it is what it is"" and the latter pushing for public taxpayer money for private (read: white, Christian, evangelical curricula) schools, perhaps we could begin a serious discussion as to how we're going too address this issue.

Oh; did I mention working parents and the unemployment rate and the cost of child care? Food and housing security?
Re-opening schools is just not the correct decision now. 

There is no right and there's too much wrong."
2020-08-04 17:21:33,"When I was young, middle class people did not have to mortgage their home so their child could go to a private college and public colleges were within almost anyone's reach.  If you came from a working class or lower income family, you could go to a public university by working during the summer and/or a part time job during the year.   Easy student loans made it easy for private colleges and universities to raise their tuition, fees, hire lots of non-teaching staff, build spa like gymnasiums, beautifully groomed lawns, musical and cultural events, etc.  Public universities followed suit except much of the tuition was placed on taxpayers.  Putting college within reach of everyone without saddling students with draconian debt and more taxes on the middle class does not work with easy student loans. Those endless non-core educational experiences cost more money than most working and middle class families can afford.   Where else can an 18 year old incur a $150,000 debt with no questions asked and no clear promise of repayment?  The colleges and universities as well as the private elementary, middle and secondary schools saying they will open because of the ""in class"" experience means they want their tuition money upfront before COVID races through their school, sickens people, and forces them to shut down.  A lot of people infected, many sick, and some dead is the inevitable result, but by then they will have the tuition in the bank.  That's the real bottom line."

2020-08-04 17:37:28,"Talk to anyone in Higher Education. We have three facts on the table, staring us in the face.

1) Unlike K-12, college is entirely a competitive industry. Colleges compete within regions, they compete with similarly ranked schools, they compete for funding and endowments, they compete for a national and international pool of students. To not compete is to lose. The K-12 industry does not face this dimension to nearly the same degree.

2) Higher Education in the US was already on the rocks. Enrollments and demographics have not been kind, and too many schools are up to their neck in debt, and that is with austerity measures being implemented on and off for at least 20 years now, and soaring and unsustainable tuition and debt loads for their students. 

3) The pandemic has sped up the collapse of this system. Colleges are opening because many cannot make payroll or even keep the lights on, without room and board fees, the full college bill of fare. ""Going fully online"" is financially impossible, unless parents feel like paying premium dollar for what will in many cases simply be a Jetson's version of a correspondence course. Not. Worth. It. Anyone paying more than 2k for an online only class is being suckered.

These are the three cards face up on the table. The schools largely have no choice except to try to play this terrible hand. And most of them will lose. The laws of virology do not care about what we wish could happen."
2020-08-04 17:42:48,"“During 2019-2020 academic year the average yearly price of tuition, fees, room, and board was $30,500 but can vary widely:
$21,950 for public 4-year institution (in-state rate)
$38,330 for public 4-year institution (out of state)
$49,879 for private nonprofit 4-year institution. Note that for the most selective private institutions, just tuition and fees can be $60K or more yearly - however, most of these universities do provide need-based assistance.

In 1980-81 (adjusted for inflation):
$7,910 for public 4-year institution (in-state rate)
$17,340 for private nonprofit 4-year institution.”

“Among the Class of 2019, 69% of college students took out student loans, and they graduated with an average debt of $29,900, including both private and federal debt. Meanwhile, 14% of their parents took out an average of $37,200 in federal parent PLUS loans.

You’ve probably heard another scary statistic: Americans owe over $1.64 trillion in student loan debt, spread out among about 45 million borrowers. That’s about $587 billion more than the total U.S. credit card debt.”

The business model for colleges/universities has been broken for decades. 

Since the Reagan era, between Republicans and neoliberal Democrats, we have completely broken this country for the vast majority of Americans - the middle class and the poor.

2020-08-04 17:46:47,"In Iowa, Gov. Kim Reynolds, after changing guidelines for return-to-learn multiple times when she didn't approve of local school boards' decisions, last week mandated ALL school districts hold at least 50% of classes in-person. 

Her guideline/threshold for going to 100% remote was finally announced on July 30: 15-20% TEST POSITIVITY in a county AND 10% of students absent (no consideration of adult staff or families), at which point a district may ASK PERMISSION to IA DOE for 2 weeks remote learning. 

15% test+ indicates wide community spread. 10% students absent represents out-of-control school spread. CDC says 10%+ is unsafe for in-person. All others (NIH, WHO, epidemiologists around the country, and at U. of Iowa say 5% max, 3% better. Anything above is unsafe. 

3 school districts so far have defied her order and announced they will start school according to their school-board-voted plan. 

Today, Reynolds announced that students whose districts defy the law, will not get credit for their classes. Note: the law she refers to was part of legislation passed in March exempting schools from making up missed school time. It was passed to ensure safety and not penalize students. Now she will use that same law to ensure community danger and penalize students. She also threatened to strip administrators of their licenses.

2020-08-04 17:59:15,"Dynarski makes some great points but they are largely irrelevant in Colorado.

Colorado has something called a tax payers 'bill of rights (TABOR). This allows tax revenue to decrease without limit, but the rate of increase is strictly limited. Any amount collected above the limit returned to the taxpayers.  Sounds great in principle.  In practice with every economic downturn, education funding sees a large cut that is not replaced as the economy recovers.  The effect compounds with each economic downturn. 

As a result, funding of public schools and universities has been cut and cut. Wealthy school districts make up some of the difference through local fund raising and local tax increases.   Poorer district lack the resources and suffer. The public universities most likely to survive have figured out how to operate essentially as private institutions, with the state participating as an unreliable minor partner.

 None of the public elementary, middle and high schools have the resources to open safely in person, but they will throw the dice with a ""hybrid"" approach.  The poorer districts play this game with dice loaded against them.  Many of the die hard TABOR supporters are demanding that schools open in person.  

The universities need the tuition and residence hall fees to survive and will open in a hybrid mode as well.  But not to worry.  At least one of Colorado's universities will not put more than 2 students in a dorm room, even if it is a triple. 

Heaven help us."
2020-08-04 18:02:38,"Number of cases is not very meaningful since it includes people re-tested, false positives and false negatives.  Hospitalizations is a much better measure.  According to the CDC, in the week ending July 25 there were 4 covid-related hospitalizations per 100,000 in the U.S.  School age children were about 5% of those, or .20 per 100,000.  There are about 50 million students in K-12.   If you do the math that's 100 K-12 students in the hospital due to Covid during that week.  100 out of 50,000,000 is ridiculously low to even talk about closing schools."
2020-08-04 18:04:56,"Officially, the University of Wisconsin campus (~ 10.5 K students) in the small town where I live plans to open for in-person classes.  But ""people who know people"" tell me that the real plan is to (a) announce/prepare for in-person classes; (b) *collect tuition* for in-person classes; (c) begin in-person classes; (d) wait a couple weeks for the inevitable town-wide surge in Covid-19 cases; and (e) shut down and offer on-line classes.  A classic bait-and-switch scam."
2020-08-04 18:13:31,Students wouldn’t be so opposed to a full online curriculum if the tuition price was lowered. It’s not the same education and my school (BMCC CUNY) refuses to adjust the price. I’m certain if campuses lower the tuition for online only there would be a surge in interest. PPL HAVE THE TIME to take online classes right now. Make it affordable and retain your students and possibly gain more
2020-08-04 18:18:02,"The issue is not children or college students returning to classrooms, it is TEACHERS and PROFESSORS returning to classrooms.  Covid-19 poses almost no risk to the former; it is unclear how much ADDITIONAL risk it poses to the latter.

For most parents, and most health experts, if the schools were open, they'd send their children.  Same for most college students.

Colleges and universities are able to open because they can force their faculty to teach or convince them the mitigation in place is sufficient to keep them as safe as in their community setting.  Public schools are unable to do the same in many states with their teachers."
2020-08-04 18:20:53,"I believe K-12 needs to reopen because the educational loss from not opening will be staggering, but doing it incorrectly will simply backfire. 
In the end, this piece concludes that under current conditions it is not safe to return to schools, even elementary school which is contrary to the entire premise of the article and shows the awful situation we are facing."
2020-08-04 18:26:57,"According to the article, the broad consensus among experts is that it is most important to get kids back into the classroom because otherwise their learning will slide.  My question would be how much urgency there is in this.  If a kid takes a break, are they not able to make it up?  Suppose a student takes a ""gap year.""  Does that mean a permanent loss to their educational outcome?

I would also ask what urgency attaches to getting kids back in the classroom in the current environment.  Given the anxiety over masks, hand washing, social distancing, etc., do we expect that they will learn as much as they would have otherwise?"
2020-08-04 18:27:44,"It is infuriating to read “...And with Congress headed toward its August vacation, it’s unlikely that fresh funds will start flowing to local schools soon.” It flies in the face of official statements as in “this is a war (with a virus)”. 
Our elected officials — and of course Trump and the WH — taking any break before addressing such vital matters is an affront."
2020-08-04 18:33:27,"Let's be clear:  Many colleges & universities are pushing to re-open because they have so much DORMITORY space that needs to be filled.

For instance, NYU has built dormitories all over the Village and East Village, so they have an enormous amount of money invested in real estate - and they need to get a RETURN on that investment. In my opinion, NYU is now as much in the real estate business as it is in the business of education. (And I can remember when they were a ""commuter"" school with hardly any dorms!)

Thus, it seems a lot of colleges & universities have a very vested interest in re-opening to students living on-campus, regardless of whether or not that's the safe thing to do for the students, for the institution's employees, or for the regular people who happen to live in the surrounding community.

When NYU's dorms fill up with thousands of students from all around the country & overseas, that will represent a new danger of Covid to everyone who lives in or NEAR an NYU dormitory - and especially for older people. All the people who live in the neighborhoods around NYU dorms will be at risk, and NYU really doesn't much seem to take that into account - if you're not part of NYU, you don't exist.

It's unfortunate that colleges & universities don't seem to value the lives of people who are not directly connected to their enterprise - and we are going to be stuck with the effects of that all around the country as college & universities re-open."
2020-08-04 18:26:52,"There are no easy answers to this dilemma. My husband teaches science at a small liberal arts college and is working twice as hard preparing to teach for both in-person and online courses, knowing that lab and field classes don't translate well to online instruction. If the college doesn't open in person, they run the risk of the school folding since it is entirely tuition based and has a small endowment. But we don't want students, staff, and their families to be put at risk either. So our options are that he could maybe lose his job and our health insurance or possibly gets sick or worse. I'm infuriated that the lack of national leadership and willful ignorance of some people to wear masks and practice social distancing has put us and countless others in such a bad predicament."
2020-08-04 17:18:01,"I recently graduated from college and the actions of my colleagues - both those who graduated and are still in school - deeply concerns me.

Many of my friends are quick to blame the spread of the virus on the mistakes and mishandling of the pandemic by the White House, to which I agree with. Yet, on Instagram or any other social media, I see the same people at a party with large group of people, not wearing a mask. Some of them are even going on Tinder dates or having random hookups. They just don't understand it's also part of THEIR responsibilities to social distance.

I've tried to confront some of these friends, to which some of them have responded well. However, others have also told me that I'm just jealous. To which I reply: yes, I am jealous - of your ignorance. Of your ability to ignore the turmoil that healthcare workers are struggling through. Of your ability to ignore the heartbroken families who lost their loved ones to this pandemic.

Ignorance is a deathly bliss."
2020-08-04 18:40:06,"I teach college classes. At Georgia Tech, we switched to distance learning around March 15 in the Spring semester. And I taught remotely all summer as well.

Most college students performed well with distance learning. I agree that younger students (in the beginning of K-12) benefit more from in-person classes, when they are safe and possible (in certain districts, based on public health metrics).

I, and most of my colleagues, will be teaching our college classes remotely this fall at Georgia Tech. The overwhelming majority of our students and faculty have opted (when possible) to not return to campus this fall. We have made distance learning work, since mid-March.

This issue should not be politicized. It is about public health and learning outcomes. But I will point out that Georgia Tech is an engineering school (a more conservative culture than most colleges), and is in the state of Georgia (which leans Republican). 

Due to pressure from the students and faculty, the University System of Georgia caved and we are mostly following the recommendations of scientists and public health experts. The scientists (including my colleagues at Georgia Tech) fortunately prevailed."
2020-08-04 17:25:48,"I think deferring to go to College for one year is a great option especially for incoming freshmen. But colleges don’t want that and therefore are offering in person classes to attract students.  As cases begin to surge colleges will go completely online, by now they have locked in students and collected tuition. Just wait and see.  

People need to accept we have a pandemic going on that is real, invisible, and deadly and out of control so do not expect back to normal."
2020-08-04 19:08:42,"Ranking #1 in the amount of deaths in the world from the Covid virus is our United States at 155, 402; #2 is Brazil at 94,665; and India at 38,938 ranks #3. Why are we even having a conversation about school re-openings? Safety and health should be the number one concern for all of our nation's kids, educators, and educational staff. We all need to do our part even if it means sacrificing whatever our sense of ""normal"" is. Practice the CDC guidelines. Wait for a vaccine. Then talk about the educational gaps and the economy."
2020-08-04 16:53:21,"Opening schools at this point in time is ridiculous. Sending your kid to school is akin to child abuse.

Inevitably, if schools are opened people will get sick and die. It's not worth it. So this is what we do:

When I was in grad school I attended a double summer session and thereby made up a half-year of study and I graduated a half-year early. 

I say keep the schools shut until we have a cure and a vaccination. Do video classes as much as possible. Put everything live on hold. When this is all over we can make up the lost time by having summer sessions or longer school days. It may take a  couple of years to completely catch up but I'd rather see schools open in the summertime and after-hours than sick and dead kids and teachers. If everyone is doing this then no one will fall behind. It's not a competition, it's survival.

I point this out because the Times and its reporters have been misleading its readers by suggesting that sending younger students back to the classroom is not supported by health experts. As to the economic factors driving college planning the Professor is correct in her analysis. However, there is no evidence that college students are at greater health risk even if they have the virus---at least no reference to any health experts in the Professor's remarks. And of course this has been the problem in all this--- contradictions in what so called health experts state---health studies published too quickly on thin research---the same political hacks and News Media who use all this to support their own propaganda. The colleges are at fault for not delaying the start of the Fall term to much later in the Fall and not to August.  They rushed and now they have put themselves in a position they can't easily get out of.  They could have limited themselves to getting only Upper or Lower division students on campus AND NOT ALL STUDENTS AT THE SAME TIME!!!. Reviewing most Plans one can see just how poorly this has been done: some have stated that libraries and student centers will be closed or limited. Where will all these students go to when not going to their hybrid classes? And testing?"

But Trump didn't take that initiative nor did Arizona Gov Ducey who is callously referred to as Dopey Ducey for his failure to rein in the disease. When the mayors of Phoenix and Tucson tried to enforce the wearing of masks Ducey overruled and caused countless deaths. Yet, despite their abysmal performance, Trump and Ducey remain in their jobs.

V overblown daily hysteric concerning the virus in the liberal press is ridiculous. In these pages it is routine to mention the total number of virus cases in the US, get absurdly they never adjust for population, deaths per million etc which would be an apples to apples comparison but that would not fit the left's hysteria narrative. Why provide accurate, data driven information when you can provide biased useless numbers that add to the (anti Trump) Hysterics? I find it comical when the left discuss is economics verse safety regarding the virus. The spin is always anti Trump, if there are elevated virus numbers then trump is disregarding safety, and when terrible economic numbers come out all the sudden trump owns the economy. Before March it was all because Barack Obama's profound economic acumen was why our economy was doing fantastic. four months later Trump owns at all, what a joke. And yes these colleges absolutely must consider economics going forward, just as all businesses  must, and as all schools should! And that includes grade schools and high schools, teachers should be considered essential workers and schools essential as well!

A few of his small brained supporters did and are no longer with us.
2020-08-04 19:19:16,"This is a good observation.  Had we invested resources in pooled testing, more widespread testing, and in setting up distanced classrooms, more elementary schools could have opened this fall.  Small children are mostly under their family's control anyway, whereas college students have the movement patterns of adults, and similar lack of adherence to distancing precautions.  Here in San Francisco, I see a lot of masked kids taking good care of their environment.  I wish their families well in managing their schooling."
2020-08-04 19:24:19,"Not only are college students more likely than younger students to be able to successfully study online or to take a year off from academics, they are also likely to spread the virus into areas where it's currently at least somewhat under control. Large universities, especially, will draw students from all over this country, including states where the virus is raging. Their presence is likely to make it riskier to send children of any age back to school, because the higher the rate of community spread, the more difficult it is to keep local schools and businesses open."

On the other hand, only 35% of HS parents opted for distance only."
2020-08-04 19:39:38,"This piece should be required reading for every educational administrator and every person who sits on a board of education, people who typically have never spent much (or any) time in the classroom as a teacher.

One of my old professors has been championing “pod learning” — where elementary kids learn together in pods of approximately 10. It’s easy for those who are opting to homeschool. Kids in the same neighborhood, same street, same apartment complex, etc. meet together for a few hours a day, then do the remaining learning online. It would do wonders for their social, emotional, behavioral, mental well-being. Outdoor classrooms with a play area where they can exercise would be best. 

But why should this have to be limited to homeschooling? Why must it be only available to parents who can afford to stay home? Elementary schools should have already figured this out. They should have already divided the classes into pods. They should have been pouring concrete and setting posts to make screened-in pavilions for outdoor pod learning to keep kids and teachers safe. 

But schools haven't done that because it takes too much money to hire enough teachers to break classes into small pods. So instead, when one child gets sick in a teeny-tiny classroom space with poor ventilation, the whole class of 20+ will likely have to quarantine. Being in a pod in a mostly outdoor environment would limit exposure and make it easier to contact trace in case someone contracts the virus."
2020-08-04 20:24:16,"This article is very frustrating because it ignores the crucial other part of making these decisions, the safety of students, teachers and their families. You can't make decisions about this without considering both issues. Since the author didn't consider both required needs, the article is of not much use. You can do better than this."
2020-08-04 21:00:57,"We could be doing so much more. 

Student loan debt forgiveness could encourage college students to stay home this year and work as teacher's aides at their local elementary school. These aides could provide the human capital needed to split classes into two smaller pods that share a single teacher and have their own aide to supervise learning while the credentialed teacher is working with the other pod. Schools will need people to help with temperature checks, recess supervision, disinfection etc. They will need more personel if they are to maintain the integrity of a class pod in after-school care programs. 

Federal funds could have been allocated months ago to improve school air handling and ventilation, create outdoor learning spaces, install plexiglass partitions, and buy N95 masks for teachers and other school staff."

As students return to campus, and new frosh start spreading their suddenly-independent wings, Covid is going to spread like wildfire.

New students in particular, searching for new friends and the inevitable sexual liaisons, will congregate and mingle both on and off-campus in droves.  These ""kids"", suddenly without any parental or adult supervision are just going to laugh at mandates such as mask-wearing and maintaining social distance.

And how do I know this?  Simple, half a century ago I too was a new college kid.  It was true then and it is even more so now.

I've no kids or grandkids so I won't worry about what happens in November.  You know, when those college kids all come back home for Thanksgiving Dinner with Mom, Dad and Granny.

College students may not listen to medical advice and will end up spreading the virus, but at least they are old enough to make conscious and well-informed choices. Elementary-aged students are at the mercy of their parents, who may be at the mercy of financial concerns or plain ill-informed, and we are sending these children into situations where they will, innocently, be vectors of disease and death to their family and may suffer lifelong health issues personally. Sending children, incapable of informed consent, into the most high-risk settings is an ethical and human rights issue that the U.S. is on the wrong side of."

When the money is gone, Congress will just have to appropriate more.  I, for one, am looking forward to watching McConnell squirm as the economy continues to plummet while he wrestles with the remains of the tea party.  Americans are suffering. But maybe that was what we needed to wake us up."

Congress made an exception for the pandemic for churches and other non-profits which is certainly warranted. But $1.3 billion to the Catholic Church, whose finances have suffered through sexual abuse settlements, while many small businesses are left out in the cold? 

Small business employs approximately 53% of the US workforce and is the lifeblood of job creation.  What is so disturbing is the lack of transparency, the favoritism, the lack of accountability & the total lack of understanding of all involved in designing this program.  

We are all paying an exorbitant price for the grossly incompetent government response to COVID & these high costs will continue for future generations"
2020-08-03 21:14:27,"While the cap is unfortunate, I can understand it. The EIDL pre-covid was often only used when it was a regional and/or industry specific disaster. It has now turned into a government program that is understaffed, and does not have the infrastructure in place now, let alone in March, to handle this demand.

The fraudsters aside, if you take away the cap, and let any small business owner in America apply for a loan program that requires no collateral and a 30 year payback period, and is specifically designed to get money out fast, they will take advantage. Your only defense then is a complicated (and likely outdated) government algorithm, as there is not the capacity for total oversight, or proper underwriting to determine if this is truly a ""Emergency Loan"".

The cap is there so small business owners are forced to use it for pandemic expenses, otherwise, entrepreneurs all over the country will take a 30 year fixed loan and apply it to capital investment (or their own pockets), not to ""save"" their business. 

Main Street and Small Businesses does need saving, and it cannot due it without government support, but the EIDL program is not going to accomplish this, only Congress will."

To some extent, it might be said, that the USA is betting on a vaccine, rather than undertaking the vigorous efforts that eradicating the virus with massive testing and contact tracing would entail.

With the other coronaviruses MERS and SARS, the companies that were developing vaccines never got to commercialize them, because, in the developed countries, the outbreaks were ended by identifying those infected, tracing all of those in contact with anyone infected and isolating those individuals as necessary. That is occurring now in the countries that are making good progress towards eradicating the virus. Any successful developers of vaccines for COVID-19 will likely fare better, in terms of commercialization. However, in most of the developed world, COVID-19 will be ended without any vaccine. This will be done by identifying those infected, tracing all of those in contact with anyone infected and isolating those individuals as necessary.

Most of the rest of the developed world will join New Zealand and Iceland in having the virus so much under control, that no social distancing or masks will be required and all types of sporting events will be permitted with the full number of spectators...""

It was all scooped up by faster, and LARGER companies who, by virtue of having the resources to move quickly, didn’t need it, meaning they have other sources of capital.

In connection, I have begun to wonder if some headway against the mask slackers of today might be made by impressing upon them one's property rights in attempting to enforce mask wearing on private property. 

I am not super-optimistic about the idea, but it would seem to have some potential for effectively countering the conservative politics that undergird the reaction against masks. Perhaps in telling the slackers, ""this is my property and I decide who comes upon it"", some of them will finally be made to listen."

From the San Luis Obispo Daily Telegram 
14 November 1918
There was some talk early this morning regarding the recall of the mask ordinance at an early date but this is now all off because of the great increase in the number of cases. 
People of the city are now demanding a more rigid enforcement of the ordinance than ever and there is a disposition on the part of many to take a hand in the matter of assisting the police in securing convictions of those who do not fully comply with the mask regulation. 
Complaint has been made that in many families where individuals have been ill with influenza, proper precautions have not been taken to prevent spread of the disease to other members of the family. 
There can be no question in the mind of any one that, if the epidemic is to be wiped out at least ordinary habits of cleanliness must be observed. 
Scores of people have been seen on the streets wearing masks that were so dirty that they are disgusting. A dirty mask is worse than none and a person who wears one is not only endangering his own health and life but that of the 
entire community."

The store aisles are slim, dirty and are always blocked with boxes because there is usually just one or two people working the store and turnover historically is ridiculous. The organization has a horrible employment reputation.
So on the way in I notice a NEW big sign 'Masks required'. I let an older woman move ahead of me and then a young couple brushed past me and hurried into store talking loudly. I went to the spot in front of store for item and they came rushing around corner of the aisle. I held my arm out hand up and told them to stay away. The young woman's face became red and they turned and headed for register. They saw I was behind at a distance and they were talking about whether they forgot anything standing and looking around at candy, just standing in front of register. Then the young man glanced at me through the corner of his eyes and I asked him if he missed the sign on the door. They ignored me and hurried out the door. The cashier/merchandiser/manager who was masked said be careful there are some nutty people out there.
So if the police don't let the people know about the mandate/s which are laws then I will. I feel it is our job to protect the vulnerable and also for the public welfare. Don't let these selfish rude wacko 'slackers' break the rules when lives may be at risk."

And, for the people who don't want to wear masks properly, over their mouths and noses, what do they need to be convinced that wearing a mask can save their lives and the lives of people they know?  Will it take needing a ventilator and the induced coma to convince them?  

Most of us don't like wearing masks.  They're an annoyance in hot weather.  They retain odors from our mouths.  They need to be washed at the end of the day or sooner if we sweat through them.  Wearing them while biking is a nuisance.  But, just as an umbrella is part of a rainy day, so too is a mask during a pandemic.  

I think the math is very simple here:  wear a mask in public and your odds of not getting COVID19 are quite good.  Don't and be one of the unlucky people to be around some people who are asymptomatic but carrying it.  Then you can spread it to family and friends until you become obviously ill.

If we're honest, the way most people are using the masks is not going to be very effective at all. It really has become more virtue signaling more than an effective public health measure.

It’s logic is simple. If we fake the effect of a less contagious disease, it goes away faster.

“Flattening the curve” is misleading – it could mean the same number eventually are infected but we get there slower and the bad effects linger longer. Not true. If we lower Rt (number infected by anyone who’s contagious at time t), the effect is reducing the total number infected. And reducing need for extreme measures.

Masks are one of the most critical weapons in slowing the spread, even more than with a flu pandemic, as Copvid-19 is highly contagious in the presymptomatic stage – and possibly with a hgh rate of asymptomatic infections as well.

A mask mandate does not remove your freedom. A prolonged period of chaos arising from an unconstrained outbreak does.

This allows us to draw considerable insights into the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and similar reactions.

However, since the 1918 influenza falls outside the biological lifespan of the Baby Boom generation (mid-1940s to present), it is sad that this article likely won't get much traction from your predominantly Boomer readership. Their eyes tend to glaze over when reading or hearing about events prior to World War II and other ""ancient history.""

Rather than reporting on events before the Boomers' collective births, have you considered writing an article about Woodstock or the JFK assassination or the Rolling Stones? You would get a lot of clicks from the house-bound Boomers who are bored during this pandemic and want to reflect upon the bygone icons/culture of their younger days.

I cannot fathom their disregard for their fellow passengers, or their willful ignorance with respect to coved-19 transmission.  I’m also dismayed that on many buses, every single window is closed.  Of course an open window defeats air conditioning, but at this time I’m far more concerned about adequate ventilation.

Maybe today, lavish colors of revamped buildings, streets and attires attuned to the latest fashion have taken old over those grainy views. 
Although, in terms of social behavior, the same parallels can be made with the current situation. 
And on this ground, there is nothing to be cheerful about. 
Just like in 1918, too many pockets of resistance won’t listen to the voice of reason, and instead will act recklessly and with total disregard for the consequences downstream. Today still, much of the crowd abides by the belief that masks are inefficient, represent an assault on their liberty rights, just as this tiny piece of fabric tied to the bottom of their face is both seen unpractical and unfashionable.

The government should STOP TAXING the purchase of MASKS.

The government is correctly and widely requiring people to wear face masks.  But since it is required, and required for the public and personal health, the government shouldn’t make money off masks.

Furthermore, making masks (or cloth used to make them at home) sales tax/free, and thus more affordable, would make it easier and more likely that the people most at risk and perhaps most likely to be infected — lower income people — more likely to use masks and to use them properly (e.g., not reuse the same one day after day, week after week).

They held up really well, and history recognizes the sacrifices they made and the hardships they endured. Americans, though further distanced by geography from most of the scenes of the fighting, also suffered great distractions in their normal lives as well as enormous grief from the loss of loved ones.

Hearing the whining of today’s Americans about the “indignities” being forced on them by what they declare to be “unconstitutional” mask orders, makes me realize what babies we have become in comparison to the aptly named Greatest Generation. To think that the descendants of the generation of men who stormed the beaches at Normandy are so pitifully selfish that they refuse to wear a mask properly makes me realize how much our society has become degraded.

We have lots of laws that inhibit personal freedom in order to make like safer and better for the public at large, so what’s the big deal? Perhaps it simply is that we have a man-child in the Oval Office who has set a self-indulgent example.

What is it about America that apparently makes this rebelliousness so much worse??
In other countries, it appears that people were more willing to do what is best to bring the numbers down and benefit society the most.

In America, it’s considered weak, or sissy to cooperate (Trump).
It’s hard to imagine that the severity of the problem in the US doesn’t have something to do with the extreme belligerence in the face of reality.

I would hazard to guess that the anti-maskers are the same people who also deny climate science, believe in a freedom to pollute, were for invading Iraq during the Bush years, don’t believe in wearing seatbelts, and generally want to do whatever they can to defy any thought of working together for the benefit of all.

I remember hearing a famous radio personality, years ago, proclaiming that he always makes sure to buy the vehicle that will pollute the most.

Why do so many Americans find cooperation so abhorrent??"

2020-08-03 19:38:51,"Not just the masks, but the foreign contagion (""Chinese Virus"") smearing had its precursor:  the disease originally became epidemic in the US midwest, military forces carried it on crowded troop ships to the UK and Europe, the flu spread globally.  Here in Toronto, big civic anti-lockdown protests are photographed with signs castigating ""the GERMAN Virus"" ..."
2020-08-03 19:30:36,"Not mentioned here is that the masks of 1918 were ""useless."" That is the word used by John M. Barry, author of ""The Great Influenza."" The masks were quite porous, even if multi-layered. Such masks could not stop a microscopic virus. There is also no clear evidence suggesting that the masks in use in 1918 actually curbed the spread.

Many of today's masks are not much better than those used in 1918. The emphasis on masks may give people a false sense of confidence when in fact the best way to avoid infection is really to avoid getting close to other people."
2020-08-03 19:51:00,"I like Hasan Minhaj's suggestion to try to think of wearing your mask as a bumper sticker for your face.   Make it fun or make a message out of it.  I mean seriously, if someone gave Donald Trump a mask that said ""Trump 2020"" on it, he might actually wear it. 

I wish I read this article about masks as a historical retrospective right when the pandemic started.  Maybe some patterns we're seeing today would be more predictable and less shocking.   Historically in the U.S. where many people don't follow scientific advice or simply don't like following authorities even it's for it's their own good, what do you do?  How do you positively incentive people to wear masks and does police non-mask wearing in public even help?  

There's also the economics of jobs losses and being poor during a pandemic.  So you can't pay your rent and buy food.  Covid testing is slow and not even free.  Masks aren't free (and uncomfortable worn for long periods of time) and cleaning supplies aren't free either.  Asking for compliance and spending money on masks when you're wondering if you can buy food or pay rent is surely infuriating and stressful.  

Anyway, be safe everyone.  Try to be kinder to each other and try to wear a mask.  Learn from the San Francisco mask slacker, you don't want to get smacked with a sack of silver dollars for being inconsiderate."

I read it shortly after it was published and have gifted the updated version to friends.  The 1918 pandemic was largely ignored, to some degree out of ignorance and some degree out of corruption.  We didn't acknowledge the real worldwide death estimate until the last 10 years.  But, as bad as that pandemic was, it gave quick rise to the U.S. medical research and care industry like Johns Hopkins, etc.  For some reason, Asian countries have long embraced masks and we have not.  Europe is 50/50.  I think it's largely due to the conflicting information from our scientists.  Most say masks are critical, but there is an ""expert cult"" that say NO.  Who to believe?"

Kids know in their hearts by now that masks save lives and that young  carriers can infect their older contacts. I'm reminded of a quotation from Emerson's essay Self-Reliance. ""The great man * is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps, with perfect sweetness, the independence of solitude.""

2020-08-03 19:30:49,"The following is a cut/paste from NIH News Release 4/2/2007, describing an analysis by the Imperial College of London on the
1918 flu pandemic responses in US cities. 
 
""In San Francisco, which they found to have the most effective measures, they estimate that deaths would have been 25 percent higher had city officials not implemented their interventions when they did. But had San Francisco left its controls in place continuously from September 1918 through May 1919, the analysis suggests, the city might have reduced deaths by more than 90 percent."" 

How ironic that San Francisco was again credited for its very effective and early lockdown in our current pandemic as well as again having opened too quickly and reversed those gains.

Still, in this century, we have the benefits of PCR and antibody testing and mobile devises can be used for contact tracing just as well as they are used by advertisers to hound us for their profits. So it is a double shame that we didn't learn from the 20th century and we have not used the knowledge of the 21st century. 

The above excerpt thought a nine month public health control effort would have been sufficient to save 90% of 1918 flu deaths. In the current coronavirus pandemic, nine months from San Francisco's lock down in March would be December. With our current much larger population and possibly a more deadly virus, nine months of 20th century controls may not be sufficient. We must use our 21st century advances more effectively."

- history is repeated if people don't learn from previous experiences
- the Covid-19 deniers' reactions in 2020 are comparable to the ones of the deniers' and anti-maskers in 1918-19, although one would expect for the American society to have absorbed lessons from the misfortunes of the past.

If we deny a virus access to hosts it will die off. However, virus' use our human need to congregate to reproduce and spread. Yet humans will not be stopped from doing whatever they want regardless of the warnings.

I suspect it would be easier if it didn't seem like health care (and the government?) was a racket designed to extract every dollar it could from our suffering.

A government official who marshals a pro-business law gets a share of the business profits, but one who marshals one for the people gets nothing.  Indeed, officials who prove themselves a friend of business get a ticket into other opportunities, while being anti-business is a mark that excludes you.  Meanwhile, businesses subject to government regulations are constantly subject to the threats that officials will revisit the laws and regulations and extract more profit."

It’s logical only to consider closed cases. A closed case is one in which the afflicted has either recovered or died.

The message here is pretty obvious: ""If you question lockdowns, get over yourself; we locked down and wore masks in 1918, too."" Unfortunately this comparison is not very good and also has some awkward logic.

Were there attempts to regulate behavior and enforce face coverings in public? Sure. But to compare the enforcement and communication systems of 1918 to those of today would be absurd. And *correct* masks are mostly effective in specific instances; they are not the panacea that they are being held up as. And no, this does not make me ""anti-mask."" 

But the bigger issue is the complete logical contradiction inherent in this argument: with the millions that ended up dying, holding up the lockdowns (if you could call them that) and masks of 1918 as the example of how to approach this problem is an extremely dubious thing to do. Whether it was because of lack of participation or some other reason, one is forced to admit that these measures were a complete failure. But with enough shaming, it will work this time around, right? Please.

As long as humans birth and breed other humans who have anti-social brains, I don't think people will ever change or progress. Thousands of years. As long as humans fall on this bell curve of human intelligence and emotions, I can't see anything changing. This is history repeating itself again and again and again... People may look different in different times (hairstyles and fashion and adornments), but their selfish behaviors, anti-social attitudes, and pride in self-ignorance never change. I've given up on about half of all humans.

In fact, the American Civil War was the last time this tactic was widely employed. With deadly rifled bores and advanced cannonades, why was a 5,800 year old military tactic still being used? Why?

Technology Change always precedes Culture Change. The Board Members of higher education institutions are terrified because the pandemic has reveled a growing truth that their vast and expensive infrastructures are substantially obsolete.

Commercial Real Estate is in free fall, or, soon to be in free fall, because employees are being allowed to work from home and they have proven to do this effectively.

Masks represent a piece of vital technology and again culture is slow to adopt. This is why leadership in crises so vital. Without it, the tribe does not know what to do. When it is allowed to become political, leadership has failed miserably.

(The weave of a mask not being adequately fine enough to stop something as small as the diameter of the virus.)

Examining the period of time, back in the US, when Samuel was born to Bruno and Lucille, it becomes clear that he was born into a troubled moment in their lives. Their first child, Josephine, born June of 1851, died suddenly in February of 1853, at twenty months of age. The Epidemic records for 1852 - 1853 describe a serious outbreak of Yellow Fever that summer that took over 8000 lives, so this may have been the cause of her death. 
Samuel arrived a scant three months later so his birth must certainly have been accompanied with mixed emotions; the grief of their too recent loss and the joy of their first born son. One can only try to imagine the difficulty Lucille had in bonding with her newborn boy while still aching for her precious, lost, daughter Josephine.
Perhaps that frail bond helped set Samuel's course with women, as he seemed to have trouble forming deep and lasting relationships. 
Whatever the dynamics it was hardly a ‘normal’ entrance into the world. Perhaps the tenuousness of his trust in his mother’s love, constantly testing it for re-assurance, caused his father grief. Certainly Bruno would have felt protective towards his dear Lucille and perhaps tried to shield her from Samuel’s neediness.

The man ahead of me — 50-ish, slovenly — had his mask pulled down well below his nose, so it just covered mouth and chin. You cannot enter a business here unless you have a mask on, so I guess he thought he he was making some kind of point, by complying halfway? He was arguing over something with the very young cashier, and leaning over the counter more than he needed to. A manager had to come over to sort this all out. The manager gestured at the guy to pull up his mask. The guy complied, with a shrug and an eye roll and an eye smirk. He then proceeded to pay for his pile of purchases with a bunch of wrinkled bills and change pulled (slowly) from various grubby pockets. It was like he was going out of his way to violate every request for sanitation and distancing. Why? What would he gain from that bratty behavior? I do realize that not everyone has an electronic means of paying for goods, but if you need to use cash you could organize your money ahead of time, out of respect for the cashier (who should not have to touch money damp from your sweat).

There will be more and more pandemics of ""new"" viruses.  Masks, social distancing, and hand hygiene are essential public health tools to save lives, protect communities, and safeguard economies that will be needed with each pandemic. 

Failure to wear a mask during a respiratory disease pandemic recklessly endangers communities.  We need legislation that will treat failure to wear masks like we currently treat drunk driving.  

Failure to wear masks kills people. Deal with it. Nobody has a ""right"" to recklessly endanger others."

All of these desperate issues vying for our attention ultimately stand on the bedrock of our finite stock of doctors and nurses and health care technicians. Look at it like the Battle of Britain: a nation facing invasion and obliteration had only a certain number of fighter planes and trained pilots to fend off enemy bombers that were a prelude to that invasion. The British could replace the Spitfires and Hurricanes readily enough but at some point the ranks of trained pilots would be exhausted. And the nation would then be defenseless before the full invasion phase of the enemy onslaught.

If this pandemic keeps going sideways at some point we might run out of our Few — the doctors and nurses that are our fighter pilots — who for all too many of us are the only thing standing between us and death or serious long-term illness wrought by uncontrolled spread of this invading virus."

We Democrats have asked for women to be allowed freedom over their own bodies for a good long while now. Don't wanna wear a mask? Try being told you MUST complete a pregnancy, even when raped.

Why would anyone want to trust ""medical experts"" who can't even provide basic information correctly about masks vs a virus? instead giving the public their non-stop word salads and riddles and an endless stream of contradictory mumbo jumbo, and are caught time and time again not even following their same guidelines and restrictions while out in public. This holds true for MSM journalists as well, reporting from White House press conferences, and on news shows when they assume the camera isn't rolling, removing their masks after the camera is assumed ""off"".

Im a registered Democrat since 1982 and I refuse to believe the scare tactics and shaming manipulations of ""selfishness"" and ""conspiracy theory"" so prevalent in this attempt at psychologically conditioning the public into some twisted form of ""obedience"".

The latest coronavirus kills only people who are already suffering from seriously compromised health, thus the number of cases is irrelevant - unless hospitals are overwhelmed, which they are clearly not.  They were mostly empty and having to lay off staff until they were finally allowed to restart offering other kinds of care.  More people will die from lack of access to healthcare because of this shutdown of regular care, plus the suicides and deaths of despair due to the isolation, than lives ""saved"" by all this irrational, counterproductive policy making.

My father, who experienced tremendous hardship as a child, didn't talk of these things. Nonetheless, I'd like to believe that he - a conservative Republican his whole adult life - would be appalled at the lack of courage and leadership demonstrated by he whose name I can't even bear to mention.

He was writing about the fact that the toxic properties of lead were known for sixty years, and were still being ignored and many were poisoned thereby.   He might just as well have been writing about the resistance to the use of his lightning rods, or of smallpox inoculation, both of which he promoted.  

Failing to wear a mask in a pandemic of this sort is on the same level as driving drunk, or firing a gun at random down a dark street, not knowing if the gun is loaded with blanks or live ammunition.  Doing these things MIGHT not do any harm to anyone on any given occasion.  But the more often people do them, the more inevitable it becomes that people are going to die."

To say that we will possibly never have a vaccine or an effective strategy for control of this virus leads people (the public!) to throw up their hands and *do nothing*. We need people to actively take steps to mitigate the spread, and if people believe it is too hard a problem to solve or it will go on indefinitely, they will give up. 

I am a scientist, so I definitely understand how cautious and measured they are in their statements. But, they need to add some psychology, communications science, and sociology to their arsenal - their communications to the public, while based on careful thinking and scientific expertise, are likely having adverse impacts on the public’s thinking about this coronavirus. Think about how they parsed words and technicalities about asymptomatic and presymptomatic and the arbitrary definitions of “airborne” and aerosol size. 

But I think one reason we are having such a hard time in the US, even in very “elite” and educated locales, is that people don’t believe anyone in authority is doing anything to protect them and their community, and so they are making decisions based on their personal risk levels and tolerances, because our governments and leaders have shown its every person for themselves. And scientists telling people there is a good chance there will never be a systematic solution just fuels this type of individual-based response in people."

These are things we know will help us get a handle on the virus: Universal really free testing; complete contact tracing; mandatory quarantine of those testing positive, whether they have symptoms or not, until they no longer test positive; wearing masks all the time in public; washing your hands once an hour.

People who do not mention all these things and work to implement them are 1. Incompetent (they can’t read well enough to figure out that the points I mention are the salient ones) 2. Delusional (“It will go away on it’s own; only people in blue states will get it; we are in God’s hands and he will protect the deserving and so everyone who gets it deserves to die, etc) 3. Criminal (This old malaria drug that I just bought lots of stock in is the cure!; We can’t afford to give everyone free testing, but if you are willing to pay a thousand dollars or $2,000, or even $6,000, through the private testing clearing house, we will test you; We can’t afford to treat everyone, so old people should stay away from hospitals and die quietly; States should bid for the PPE the government has stockpiled, and I am going to give most of it to my friends, but if you pay me enough money, you can have some too.)

Now Dr. Deborah Birx is following in the fearful footsteps of her medical administration colleagues in telling us that we're entering a ""new phase"" and that masks are the only known vaccine against it until we actually have a chemical one.

This isn’t “accidental”, it’s intentional. And every time governments attempt to address the abuses and mismanagement of health care costs the “industry” ramps up the lobbying, influence buying and outright intimidation. Expose them and their predation and superficial public relations gimmicks and schemes are trotted out to deflect and deny responsibility. It ain’t gonna end soon, not one of the daisy chain of opportunistic rent seeking financial types will allow it too.

To reopen or not, to quarantine, etc should be a local, not a national decision.

But last week, I had conversations with a local rural mom and with an airline pilot who both said they believed the virus was going away in November. A friend from Colorado said she knows of two doctors who also believe this.  It’s dropped like a dog whistle, to see if you belong to their alternate reality club.  I get it, though.  Most people haven’t experienced it yet.  I’ve only heard of second hand stories of people who got it, and most recovered.  But I keep reminding people that during the summer if 1918 a lot of people were convinced there was no pandemic.  Tell me there’s no pandemic when we get through the winter with this."
2020-08-03 13:33:49,"I am watching on Facebook people continually trying to organize very large gatherings at public or private facilities, with little or no mention of coronavirus guidelines and which appear to be blatant violations of state orders.  The photos and videos of past gatherings show almost no compliance on masks or social distancing.  Then, as police or others in the state shut down these venues, the same people complain online about “discrimination” or violations of their “freedom.”  They even try to link the issue to BLM, claiming they would be allowed to gather without masks if they were protesting.  And then, like little boys, they try to look for other venues where their violations might go undiscovered.  It is all so pathetic, but it’s probably explained by a lack of education since there’s likely not a single college degree among them.

What is very disturbing is their claim that suburban police are with them, but are “ordered” by their bosses to “remind” them about masks and social distancing.  When we can’t even trust the cops to enforce compliance forcefully, it’s no wonder the virus continues to spread.

Instead, she opted to tow the administration’s line of “this will pass”. She was more of an apologist than a figure of merit. I think she just realized by her tone that she may become the scapegoat in the disintegrating Trump administration and looked for an opening in the data to show more concern. Compare this administration’s response to the administration’s response to H1N1 ten years ago. Huge difference in response and ultimate effect on the US."

In any other administration people that have proven themselves completely incapable of stepping up to the moment would be replaced. The answer is that they are doing what is asked, they are serving their master, and soothing Trump’s ego above all else. It shouldn’t need saying, but public officials should serve the public. I imagine each one of these failures tells themselves that it could be worse without them, that someone worse might take their place. There is no worse. We are the worst in the world right now with no end in sight."
2020-08-03 14:06:48,"Why can’t we follow the example of other countries? This American exceptionalism nonsense is killing us.  There is a simple answer here: we need a federal push for a 28 day nationwide SIP order plus the economic stimulus to support it.  Look at the Aussie state of Victoria- just 700 cases a day were enough for their government to put health above all and take extreme measures.  If we did that, by September 1 our numbers would be down, and we could consider reopening.  But of course Americans are the smartest and bestest right?"

2020-08-03 14:35:05,"There should be no conjecture over whether Trump will pressure scientists to prematurely deploy a vaccine.

Of course he will. 

Why? Because selling a scam or bogus solution is what he knows how to do. It is all he knows how to do. He will sell this like he sells hotels, resorts, golf courses, campaigns for president, all of his ""deals"".
 First he will watch Russia and see how their vaccine scam works.
Then he will pack the various independent FDA panels charged with evaluating vaccines with  his toadies. 
Then the ""warp speed"" drug companies will issue preliminary positive results for example stating that the vaccine has made few people ill or has few side effects. This will say nothing about efficacy since that would take months to determine.
Trump will declare victory and call for immediate implementation.
His FDA and packed panels will approve emergency production and distribution.
What happens next is anyone's guess. If we are lucky,( so far we haven't been), people will get injected and they won't get sick and die. If we are very lucky they won't get devastating side effects. If we are very very lucky they will attain immunity long enough to vote.

Adm Giroir says an 85-90% compliance rate would have the same effect as a complete shutdown. I wonder if he has a similar statistic about the compliance rate if he would turn around, just once, and tell the president that HE needs to wear a mask, every day, everywhere he goes. I fear he's more concerned about what would happen to his job and rank, given the history of the president's reaction to military officers who have the temerity to test him.

We already know Trump is no leader. It does nothing to help our confidence in the testifying of Dr Birx and Adm Giroir to know they are lined up right behind him, unwilling and unable to get even slightly out of line."

2020-08-03 15:50:43,Just hope none of that vaccine goes to Trump supporters.
2020-08-03 15:51:12,I guess it’s safe to say trump will never accept that he has zero credibility when it comes to anything concerning the pandemic.  His reputation will never get over his prediction that the virus infected “fifteen people from China” and was headed to zero. His penchant for denigrating￼ anyone who values telling the American people the truth over his lies is the only transparency all can see. The real American people are listening to Dr. Fauci. Period.
2020-08-03 16:25:41,"Dr. Gottlieb is the only medical expert that has remained constant as this pandemic has evolved, repeatedly warning the public of the increasing threat. He pointed out that the CDC and WHO made a mistake by not emphasizing masks early in the first surge."

The only one that is blatantly pathetic is Trump himself, the liar and conspiracist in-chief. Does he really think he can go on cheating on his 'base' of credulously adoring fans that his assertions are worth it's poisonous hate and division?"

I’m sorry, but not surprised, that your boss has torched you now too."
2020-08-03 16:05:46,"Dr. Birx is clearly Pollyannaish in her public remarks.  She sugarcoats everything she says, or intentionally obfuscates with technical jargon and lengthy responses to reporters' questions.  Her CNN interview was a wreck, as much Dana Bash's fault for not pressing her and keeping her on track.  Dr. Birx is a patsy of the Trump administration, they use her as a soft-sell conduit to the public, she's a tool, knows it, but lacks the ethics and spine to stand up for herself and the science she  promotes.  Unless she changes track quickly, she'll go down in history as part of the problem, rather than somebody that really tried to help."
2020-08-03 16:29:27,"Bottom line: What's-his-name is getting Americans needlessly dead from Covid-19 at a rate of roughly one small red state per year. Their botching of the pandemic has truly deep-sixed the economy. Their answer is to extort Americans into racing back to work before it is safe, by refusing to help out with jobs, incomes, food, mortgages, rents, etc.

The suggestion from one bugnutty extremist Trump surrogate to unilaterally stop collecting payroll taxes is precisely the same as saying they would like to take advantage of the pandemic in order to take away Social Security and Medicare. Like they have precisely stated their intentions to use the pandemic to take away food stamps, health care, etc."
2020-08-03 16:26:27,"The only way Trump’s bogus, spurious and oversimplified claim that more testing explains the number of new cases would be true is if the positivity rate mirrored the rate of increased testing which is not the case. Sadly, this is another distraction for Trump. I think he recognizes, as he always has, that a large portion of his base is gullible and scientifically illiterate. He can say whatever he wants, and they’ll simply repeat his nonsense. They don’t conduct their own research—if they did, they wouldn’t be so easily duped into believing conspiracy theories. If your rate of infections is up 194% but your testing rate is up 37% then you can’t look at those two separate data points and conclude they mean the same thing unless you’re studying Trumpian arithmetic where 2 + 2 = 3 b/c thanks Obama! One is a measure of an increase in testing, the other looks at the rate of new cases/infections. Time and time again the Trump WH has shown they will cherry-pick data and skew it to depict whatever lies or talking points they’d like to try to sell you today.  Example, during Trump’s Chris Wallace interview the press secretary handed Trump a graph that conveniently left out the mortality data of other industrialized countries with lower mortality rates than us. I wonder why!? You can’t claim to have the lowest mortality rate in the world when you show a graph that leaves out the mortality data of other industrialized nations, unless, of course, you’re Donald Trump."
2020-08-03 16:29:56,"I was glad to see Dr. Brix, after months of mealy mouth platitudes, finely grew some!  Of course DT was quick to throw her under the bus.  I applaud and am eternally grateful to Dr. Fauci for not allowing DT to intimidate him from altering his message that this is a serious pandemic requiring a serious response.  Dr. Fauci remains a firm, polite, and informative messenger even when facing off with the rude and insufferable Jim Jordan on Friday!"
2020-08-03 16:35:39,My regard for Dr. Birx dropped when Trump looked at her from the podium and asked for her approval in the use of bleach and ultra violet light to treat the virus. Her response was to stare at the floor. Her response should have been to stand up walk out of the room and resign. Her standing would have elevated to star status  way beyond the rest of those surrounding Trump who applaud his every word. There are just some things you do and some things you don't do. To allow someone to demean your reputation and character on camera like Trump did and there not be a consequence is unforgiving on her part.
2020-08-03 16:44:17,The percentage of positive test results is higher than it was.  That means the virus is spreading faster than the number of tests is increasing.  This is not a difficult concept.
2020-08-03 17:02:01,"Why were the school kids not tested before they returned to school?
We are supposed to be able to test tens of thousands each day currently, so why not prioritise school children to ensure those that have the virus, but are asymptomatic, are quarantined. and those that are negative can safely return to school.
The school authorities appear to be clueless as to how to open safely.  They are constantly asking for guidance and assistance from the Government or Feds.  Can' t they come up with a plan themselves?
Of course, there are going to be kids out there that are asymptomatic - so get them out of the pool returning to school. (That would  help the rest of the population too, as these children/youths are everywhere without social distancing or masks)
Then test every 2 weeks.  It really is not rocket science. Any school authority can put a testing plan together with their local health authority - if they really want to."

2020-08-03 16:50:10,"Sooooo, we are blaming Birx now?  ""Yeah, let's burn the witch,"" cried the townsfolk.
My goodness, the enablers couldn't be bothered hearing from witnesses during an impeachment trial.

My anger is directed at the bunch of Republican Senators who couldn't be bothered with their oath and job responsibilities; who sold their stock with insider trading and; who porked their tardy pandemic proposal with FBI buildings and Pentagon contracts."
2020-08-03 16:55:50,"Trump's behavior during this pandemic is beyond egregious.  It is downright pathological and criminal. He lashes out at Dr. Birx for having enough moxie and in short supply, courage, to warn us of the trajectory of Covid-19's ""'new phase'"" of exponential spread.  And where are you, Mr. McConnell and those of your ilk in the Senate?  We can not rely on Mr. Trump who is incapable of any accountability yet alone responsibility for his utter failure during this lethal coronavirus metastasis.  We can not rely on the Secretary of HHS.  The CDC is muzzled.  And then there is Congress, or rather half of it, who is silent or an abetter of disease and death....all because of its base, the MAGA family at large.  Enough!  This utter insanity of spins, deceptions, diversions, and downright lies MUST end."
2020-08-03 16:36:08,"There is a reason Trump does not have a unified plan for ANYTHING! Health, Financial, and Global Warming: He can lie, lie, lie, reverse political course and fire anyone on a dime. Whatever or Whoever works in his favor this month may not work 10 days later. That is why most of us are dizzy and sick to our stomachs."
2020-08-03 16:40:45,"Birx now qualifies for Dr. Trump's invisible pill. The same one he prescribed for Dr. Nancy Messonnier, head of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, back in February. When she told the truth about the virus. Judging by Dr. Fauci's visibility, the pill works better on women."
2020-08-03 16:46:26,I not sure why djt is so concerned about others making his administration look bad over the coronavirus response. He’s doing a fine job of that all by himself.
2020-08-03 16:49:00,"I am so glad that scientists are willing to speak the truth in the face of the tyrant trump. He gets too much coverage in the press and on twitter.

It’s bad enough we have to battle a pandemic in real time, but then when one layers on trump’s lies it becomes almost unbearable.

Please, please, let’s vote him out of office and get rid of our national nightmare!"
2020-08-03 16:51:29,"Dr. Birx had to know that in order to do right by the country she would have to speak truths that Trump and his enablers want to keep hidden from the public.

I can't imagine anything more despicable than Trump's behavior and disregard for the health and welfare of the American people.

I do however expect that Trump will soon lower the bar even further as he becomes even more desperate to get reelected.

We are in a dark place.  It's still getting darker.

We should impeach and remove Trump even this close to the election to save lives.

You do know that Trump will pardon Pence or whoever the vice president is shortly before he leaves office, resign, then get pardoned by Pence or whoever the vice president is after Trump resigns, don't you?"

2020-08-03 16:54:11,"The pandemic will be with us for an interminable period. The Spanish flu from 1918, 1919, 1920 was much deadlier than Covid 19. We had 150,000 die in one month. Masks were the bogieman then as now."
2020-08-03 16:54:48,"Everyone in the education industry knows what is coming around the bend. We have known it months, once it was clear the US had basically flunked its pandemic exam and did not put anything in place nationally that could have tamped down our numbers.

Everyone in the industry knows. Those in charge are either under compulsion (do this or I will find someone who will) or in deep denial.

This shall most clearly not be the most happiest time of the year. I doubt very many schools, k-12 or college, will make it to October with this ""in person"" fiasco. 

You cannot rewrite the laws of virology to fit what you wish could happen. 

Hang on to your hats, everyone. Here comes the Fall."
2020-08-03 16:58:55,"Trump would blame all this on too much testing - remove testing, no problem!

Why anyone could imagine school would be any less virus-free than the general public is beyond me.

2020-08-03 17:01:00,"First, it was Dr. Anthony Fauci; now it’s Dr. Deborah Birx telling the nation what amounts to Donald Trump’s epic failure to contain the deadly COVID-19 virus. And just after praising her for her scarf choices, he appears to want to strangle her with one. It’s the same old really sickening story that has now claimed over 155,000 American lives and Trump who believes that silencing the voices of medical experts will somehow lessen the death and destruction his malicious political malpractice has caused. We have an economic catastrophe stemming from a pandemic that Trump cannot and will not handle. Delusion and jaw-boning states, and now public schools, to reopen is only, as Dr.  it’s noted, a recipe for even more eco ice and physical harm that is pushing the nation to the very brink of a major depression. And, Republicans sharing Trump’s myopia concerning cause and effect the situation is grave (pun intended) as we head toward September the historic time of economic reckoning, or is it wreck-owning."
2020-08-03 16:40:50,"Even after almost 4 years of this onslaught, it has never stopped feeling surreal reading Trump's tweets.  Every single time it's a shock ""This moronic, trolling, grade-school level tweet was actually written by The President Of The United States! And there are thousands more like them!""

It's still disorientating.

And that seems to be the Great Divide.  Those of us who have that experience, who just immediately register how grossly unfit this man is to be President and feel like we are living in a bad episode of The Twilight Zone, with those who say ""Ha, ha, right on Pres!"" and have something in themselves confirmed by those tweets."

That's Trump for you. He takes all the credit, none of the payments."
2020-08-03 16:58:39,"For once I have to agree with Trump:

1) We're in the first phase still and possibly spirally downward out of control;

2) Dr. Birx has done a pathetic job...because she chose to work for Trump. I wouldn't take advice from Birx now on how to remove lice or fry rice.

I'm surprised Trump hasn't gotten Dr. Oz or Dr. Phil to be his medical adviser. All are sellers of snake oil, so they would get along fine. I guess know Birx should get her own TV show to promote fake medicine."

When the medical professionals that serve the American people are pressured by the president, a serial liar and proven ignoramus, to repeat his lies and embrace his stupidity, they lose their credibility. The only surprise is that Dr. Birx has lasted this long.

But the real losers in all of this are the American people. Had we had competent leadership, like Germany for example, we would have saved tens of thousands of lives and we would have a much stronger economy. But that’s the whole point of this election, isn’t it? We don’t have competent or honest or dedicated leadership.  We have a man whose only interest is himself, a man who got in another couple of rounds of golf this weekend and then came home to tweet his displeasure that somebody with a modicum of integrity didn’t lie sufficiently to satisfy him.

The surprising thing about this election is that anybody could look at Trump’s performance in office and even consider voting for him. Those who fear that Trump threatens to be the American Orban or Erdogan or Putin recognize that tens of millions of his followers actually want that future for America. Millions of his followers won’t accept any other outcome no matter what the actual vote is on Nov. 3. How did our democracy come to this?"
2020-08-03 16:49:04,"Be wary, friends.  I know I am.  In Oklahoma, yesterday was an amazing day.  Cases were down, more than half, from over a thousand the day before to under 500.  But the amazing part was that Oklahoma County had gone from hundreds a day to zero.  Yes, not one case had been reported that day.  Tulsa Country went from hundreds to... why, zero, too!  And no one seemed to notice that.  Our third “interim epidemiologist” had his contract lapse Friday, and now there are none. Now, by evening, cases had appeared somehow for both of the “miracle” counties, some cases, but the count for the day was still very low.  I don’t know that Governor Stitt—the man who in March dined out in a crowded restaurant with his family, and posted pictures inviting all Oklahomans to come on out, the first Governor in the nation to get Covid19, who still won’t sign a mask mandate—would countenance under-reporting of our cases.

No - we will lose children, young adults, teachers and yet more members of our communities.

All because too many politicians refused to use the economic strength of the USA to buy us time to figure this out.   Figuring it out - might have meant a less severe recession or less of the dreaded ""W"".

And all because too many are too selfish to think of others - not wearing masks, gathering in groups and other high risk C-19 behaviors.

For speaking the truth Trump devalues her.  Why she and Dr. Fauci have not resigned is beyond me but nobody is safe from Trump's wrath when he perceives a slight. Let the nut case wallow in his lies and bizarre fantasy world but let the rest of us listen and respect the voices of sanity and concern - the voices of the public health professionals and personnel who have American's backs and vested concern - and that certainly is not Trump, Pence and Azar."

As the weeks went by her enthusiasm for her new found fame was obvious.  Fauci was forced out, others were insulted and maligned and left. Trump was more irrational and dictatorial.  But still she performed, doing her best to satisfy her scientific obligation, and keep the favor of Trump. It became harder and harder.  You could see it in her face, and with less attention to her appearance.  To me she seemed weary to the strain of not being the respected scientist she had always been

Yesterday Dr. Birx decided to try to reclaim her soul if not repair her reputation.  That might take more effort.  I am just a citizen observer.  What must her colleagues have been thinking.  She is now reporting what is happening, standing on a mountain os sick people and lost lives."

Small businesses are inherently conservative about loans, for good reason.
Unconditional support sufficient to pay for rent and equipment is the only answer.

3] October: Country in the throes of mass economic downturn combined with out-of-control pandemic.  Schools closed. Mass unemployment and homelessness.
4] Trump 'forced' to call for another nationwide shutdown.
5] With country in shutdown, Trump again tries to cancel election, or delay it, or somehow throws a giant wrench in the works.
6]  Mass protests ensue across the US, leading Trump to send National Guard units and/or federal marshals to major cities.
7] Late October:  In Washington DC, Trump orders federal troops into the streets to combat anarchists wanting a free, open election.

Inevitably, if schools are opened people will get sick and die. It's not worth it. So this is what we do:

When I was in grad school I attended a double summer session and thereby made up a half-year of study and I graduated a half-year early. 

I say keep the schools shut until we have a cure and a vaccination. Do video classes as much as possible. Put everything live on hold. When this is all over we can make up the lost time by having summer sessions or longer school days. It may take a  couple of years to completely catch up but I'd rather see schools open in the summertime and after-hours than sick and dead kids and teachers. If everyone is doing this then no one will fall behind. It's not a competition, it's survival. 

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures!"
2020-08-03 17:34:19,"Dr. Birx stopped short of telling the US public the pandemic is totally out of control in many states by now, but she did admit extraordinary precautions from the population were necessary and urgent. 

Though she tried to please Trump for months, of course he turns against her. Wonder if he will also turn against Admiral Giroir who said just about the same?

Apart from denouncing warnings and degrading scientists Trump is busy sabotaging state efforts, delay testing, ""cooking"" the numbers and delay much needed federal help. That probably wont help him anyway as the pandemic hit even the rural bible belt and eventually will take its toll.

Of course Trump try to deflect blame and talk about miracle cures and vaccines. Even if an effective vaccine is developed it will take many months to immunize the US. And meanwhile the casualties will keep on growing and the economy tank. Unemployed will be ruined and lose homes without substantial help. States, cities, utilities and local authorities go bankrupt and will be forced to fire even more employees.

The US should and could have controlled the virus by now, and you would have too, if Trump wasn't so concerned with pleasing a small minority of armed hysterical tossers and sectarian wingnuts. 

In short Trump sabotaged your initial lockdown and squandered 3 trillions, he is complicit in thousands of unnecessary deaths and a collapsing economy. It is hard to see how the pandemic could have been handled worse in the US."

No planning, no interest in any input from people with experience or knowledge - no interest in reality at all. 

The Federal response to the pandemic was bungled, period. And we are all suffering because of it. 

The Republican Convention was bungled as well - by the same person and for the same reason. Donald Trump refused to take advice and now they have to scramble. Is it in North Carolina? Florida? With people? On video?  Who knows, it changes by the hour. 

But I have to say that I am enjoying the Republican Convention mess. And if anyone has to have another (of the thousand) reason to vote Democrat in November, just look at how they handled their Convention. Democrats accepted reality - the pandemic; they listened to experts - the pandemic wasn’t going to ‘magically disappear.  They made sober, stable arrangements and their Convention will go forward as planned with no last-minute craziness - of course they don’t have to answer to a crazy man.

That’s the tragedy that’s beyond “pathetic” where thousands of Americans continue to die everyday while Trump sits on the sidelines and his less-than-honest medical adviser doesn’t have the courage to follow her mentor, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and call for a “reset” with a national lockdown that Trump never considered, but is our only hope now for containing the coronavirus.

If, as seems more likely, I'm still liable for those taxes, well good thing I didn't cancel withholding.

Casting such as bill as some kind of ""giveaway"" to the underserving and lazy unemployed is part and parcel of the short-sighted economics the GOP is prone towards.

Simply put, this Relief Bill is a critically necessary economic pump-priming tool to prevent a near certain financial implosion.  The bill will put ready spending money into the hands of desperate recipients who will immediately deploy that money for goods and services.  This will result in a ""multiplier effect"" as this money flows throughout the economy passing from hand to hand.

At the same time, the Democrat's version contains critically needed funds to reimburse State and Local governments who's budgets have been ravaged by Covid-related expenses.  Failure to pass on these funds will result in massive State and Local budget cutbacks that will cripple the financing of schools, infrastructure and public safety.

It does not take a genius in Keynesian economics to realize the immediate necessity for the Federal government to embark on a massive deficit financing program.  The GOP-controlled Senate and Administration's parsimonious policies are all too reminiscent of the era from 1929 to 1933 when the initial stock market crash led to the onset and entrenchment of the Great Depression."

Birx only sees that in April there were 15,000 positive cases growing to 24,556 in July.  But, as Trump correctly predicted, when you have more tests, in this case 4 times as many, you'll get more positives.

Can't everyone get a temperature reading on a playing field or in the parking lot before entering each day? This could be logistically difficult with a large school, so better yet, organize the distribution of thermometers and a sheet of instructions in every language spoken among the school's population explaining how to correctly take a reading, and what readings indicate that an individual should not be coming to school, might be ill, and health services they can call. Maybe develop an app that the induvidual can use to record the daily readings until they are healthy enough to return. Finally, it will obviously not be as effective or intensive as on site participation, but set up a video camera in the classroom and stream the lessons live so those kids forced to stay at home can still have some way to participate. It is a conundrum about what to do when a teacher falls sick, and this must be addressed so instructors have paid sick leave and whatever other support the need as they recover. Use daily testing as a ""teachable moment"" for families and kids, and say if you want to go back to school and enjoy the company of your classmates again, everyone must get on board with testing and mask wearing, hand washing, distancing, etc. Peer pressure between students to cooperate might just work!"

People are losing their homes, going hungry and have no health insurance.  And yet, all the president can do is make erroneous assumptions and digs about various Democratic mayors.

The fact that schools will be closed again if Covid is found in the building places us currently in the 16th century toolbox in dealing with Covid.

4. 19th century. Vaccines. Warp Speed development -- prediction of a vaccine by end of 2020 year -- still problems with anti vaxxers. Vaccines will be ready by year end.  The risk in opening schools with physical contact is foolhardy seeing we are so close.

No treatment, no vaccine, and no cure; and yet much higher odds than winning the lottery (1 in 12 who catch it dying from COVID, compared to 1 in several million in winning) and people are willing to wait for a vaccine than demand a total lockdown."

A healthy, financially security, united middle class would be a threat to the those in power - because a strong, secure, and educated middle class would be a force against the corruption, self-dealing, and extractive capitalism (vs. the managed capitalism we all used to benefit from before the ‘80s) that is crippling our economy.

A strong middle class would push to make share buy backs (ie stock manipulation) illegal again (as it was before 1981) and fight against their tax dollars being used for welfare for the wealthy paid for by the middle class (think 2017 tax cut), and would realize the craven cruelty in not providing at least basic healthcare for the citizenry.

- a cheater on golf course; 
- a failed businessman with multiple bankruptcy cases; 
- a man who refused to apologize for demanding the death penalty for the five black, innocent youngsters in the Central Park incident.
- a man who treats his wife as no more pleasant than those women who sold their bodies for his carnal desires; 
- a man who defends his own behaviors by resorting to cheap and nasty vindictiveness of an unhinged thug;
- a coward with a bone spurs, whose sheer incompetence has led to more American deaths than the total fatalities of Americans from all wars since WWII. Sadly, among those deaths are veterans who answered their duty when called upon.

Too much to do for our current administration which excels in casting blame, but is deficient in handling the problem.  As long as the virus rages uncontrolled,  schools can't open, parents can't leave to work, stores can't appeal to customers, restaurants can't seat customers indoors  people will not fly,sports , arenas, and theaters will shut down---we just won't be able to have any normalcy in our country.

This is not simply largesse to his backers - it is a deliberate means of causing harm.  2) First he deliberately ignored warnings about the coronavirus, then he spread lies about its seriousness, then he actively interfered with state officials who were trying their best.  Now he is pushing for the economy to re-open and for schools to be open even though the virus is out of control.  3) He is deliberately undermining the upcoming election, both by asserting that it will be fraudulent and by making it clear that he will welcome foreign assistance and interferences.  All of these things indicate that his goal - in addition to enriching himself, his family and his friends - is to weaken the United States."

Trump was going to -- and has -- undercut them both them all along, while merely posing as though he had a science-based team.  Their resignations would be more useful to the nation than staying on to be continue being humiliated daily, spending more than half of their skill and time trying to avoid a juvenile president's tweet.

Trump's ineptitude, narcissistic selfishness, and failure of leadership have killed tens of thousands of Americans.  More will die, and even more will die if trump is re-elected, because with that we will see the gutting of Social Security and Medicare, which will kill millions prematurely.   

Drs. Birx and Fauci should resign to strip trump of the abused faux-credibility they have lent him.   If trump replaces them with toadies . . . well, (1) calling Dr. Birx ""pathetic"" and undercutting medical science in that way, and (2) giving people like Jim Jordan and Rand Paul the chance to repeatedly attack Dr. Fauci in Congressional hearings to undercut medical science in that way, have exactly the same effect, don't they?

Please cut OUR losses, Drs. Birx and Fauci.   Resign loudly and with anger at the association of your names with an administration that has caused needless death to tens of thousands of Americans.   Resign before more of us get the trump death sentence."

Nero fiddled while Rome burned, and Trump tweets while thousands of Americans die unnecessarily. That he also shows zero class and integrity goes without saying.

But here’s what’s also odd about this. We know he only cares about himself, and right now only about how he can get re-elected.  Yet behavior like attacking these respected doctors is totally destructive to that. He’s good with his red hat true believers—they have nowhere else to go. He needs to book them and then work to win over the lukewarm undecided voters. Yet this conduct will only nauseate them, just as it does for those of us who long ago made up our minds about him.

There’s an old joke about a scorpion who hitches a ride across a river from a turtle. The turtle is skeptical, but the scorpion reassures him it’s in their common interest to get to the other side. Yet halfway across the scorpion stings the turtle. “Now we’ll both die!,” laments the turtle. “I know,” sighs the scorpion, “but that’s just my nature.”

And that’s where Trump is stuck. He is so much a prisoner of his impulses and his needs to feed his ego he can’t even do what he must do to save his own life, not to mention ours.

About 140 days to January 20th. More people will die, yet there’s nothing we can really do. It would be nice if our Republican leaders had a little integrity, but..."
2020-08-04 00:09:16,"The new loss of health insurance due to COVID illustrates that the ACA needs much fixing. We still have only 91% covered (largely due to real unaffordability), and some of those people counted as ""insured"" in the stats really aren't -- estates are on the line for all medical bills paid out in some states (like MA, NJ, MD), for people 55 and older getting a Medicaid or ACA expanded Medicaid.

Further, there is one problem with the ACA that may be very hard to fix.

The ACA has embedded technical complexities owing to the split in coverage between ACA expanded Medicaid and on-exchange plans, which the various state agencies in many states are not technically skilled enough to manage without causing periods of non-coverage and other gaps for people.

Each state will have a different version of problems.

In MA, twice last year, I was switched on about 6 days notice to expanded Medicaid from an on-exchange plan.  This could have bankrupted me had I been in the hospital with a voiding of approved procedures and in-network providers.

(In one case, the cause was that mid-year, the state decided to start using updated Federal Poverty Level (FPL) cutpoints, nudging me and about 1000 other people in MA into expanded Medicaid eligibility (to 138% FPL, no asset limit).

There was another problem, that in a different switch, the state told me it couldn't answer my question about whether the old coverage would be terminated before the new one started.

2020-08-04 00:01:30,"On the ""2 million Americans, already hit economically, recently lost their health insurance"", the ACA needs some serious fixes.  

An example of where the currently flawed system, with the current ACA, is acting perniciously now during COVID is in the case of the many people having lost jobs or income being switched now to ACA expanded Medicaid, in the 10-14 states (including blue MA, MD, and NJ) that still estate recover all medical bills paid out by any Medicaid, including ACA expanded Medicaid, for people 55 and older.

All medical bills are paid for those people now, but those peoples' estates are on the line for all those when they die. It's not insurance at all, and can be a financial bomb.

To make this real, see from recent weeks:

Scroll to ""Q: Medicaid estate recovery"", you will see that Dad, living in Maryland, ages  62 to 64, got ACA's expanded Medicaid after he lost his job, and MD Medicaid paid the bills for his illnesses.  

Dad thought he had real insurance.

But, when he died, at age 64, his 3 children, who also had thought he had had real insurance, discovered that although Dad was among the 91% of people counted as ""insured"" by the U.S. Census Bureau, he actually had just a loan until death for medical expenses, and actually, had no insurance at all.

(All bills paid out had to be paid back to the MD Medicaid Department by Dad's 3 kids--that's not insurance in any sense of the term.)"

Quite frankly, Birx, Fauci, even Gupta --doctors I once greatly admired-- are part of the problem. If we showed any logical, reasonable person the data we've acquired about how dangerous this virus is, how widespread the pandemic is, and pointed out that our infection, hospitalization, and death rates are exploding and reminded them that this is a novel virus (meaning we don't know how it will morph or what the long-term consequences will be) and then clarified that doctors with big podiums failed to use them to INSIST that schools close until it's under control, they wouldn't believe it. 

Our County Board of Health has determined it is NOT safe to open schools, because it isn't. The private schools in the area intend to open anyway even though every public school is being socially responsible in answering the call to go online. There's exceptionalism for you... this virus is so sly it can distinguish a public school student from a private one. Who knew?

We're in chaos. Millions of us are at the mercy of poor leadership on every front. Our lives literally depend on someone, anyone taking control and making the hard calls, and even these doctors equivocate when our kids are in peril.

This requires a deeper understanding how so many can continue to line up behind trump in spite of  how completely,
utterly, and dangerously  inept  he has been. It is 
not possible with a straight face to argue otherwise unless one is also willing to deny overwhelming evidence. 

A  functioning  democracy is not possible when so many    have no interest in really understanding how we've gotten to the current  disaster.  

 There is a complete disconnect between what the majority of people in these states think they know to be true and what is actually verifiably true. 

The only possible explanation is that 
the vast majority of sick people in the red states are not white and have rarely   interacted with the white majority who are less sick and  can continue their enduring faith in trump's ""leadership"" without too many qualms due to personal experience.

When so many reveal a deep psychotic break with their daily
reality, it is very difficult for normal civic behavior in a democracy to occur. Delusions create strong desires and emotions that cannot be controlled or constrained. This leads to the inability to make sense of what is proper behavior during a mass crisis and only aggravates the negative 
consequences.

He will declare that soon every US citizen will have access to the vaccine, while reassuring everyone that the vaccine will be effective and safe; hence, the end of Covid-19.  

At that point he needs someone who is credible with the public to come on stage and back his claims.  He knows that both Dr. Fauci and Admiral Giroir refuse to do that. 

Until last Sunday, Mr. Trump was counting on Dr. Birx doing just that.  But Dr. Brix, appearing on ""Fox News Sunday"", contradicted him, predicting very high Covid-19 death toll in near future.  That drove Mr. Trump angry.  He rushed to his tweet account, calling her ""pathetic."" 

A large part of that anger stemmed from the fact that he could no longer rely on her to back his claims on the efficacy and safety of his ""wonder vaccine"".  He was also disappointed in himself, as it was now too late to fire her from the WH Coronavirus Task Force.

I suspect there will be soon some changes in the WH Coronavirus Task Force.  New individuals may be added to the task force and they will be given more prominence and public exposure than Dr. Fauci, Admiral Giroir, and Dr. Birx.  Those individuals will be scrutinized in advance for loyalty to Mr. Trump and could be the ones who will be with him on stage when announcing his ""wonder vaccine""."

The Public Health Service visits the homes of positive cases, at random times. If a contagious individual is not at home, where they are supposed to be, the police follow up and issue hefty citations.

In the United States, I have only heard of such enforcement in isolated instances, such as an uncommon instance in Key West, Florida. It has been said by a United States Supreme Court Justice that freedom only extends so far as the tip of the next person’s nose. It is fine to test people, but if they display symptoms and go to work the next day and infect co-workers, or go shopping for clothes and infect everyone in the store, then the whole point of testing is lost. The number of tests is not the issue. What the government will do with the results is the issue.

This part of the manual was particularly mind-numbing:

“Schools and childcare programs are not expected to screen children, students, or staff to identify cases of COVID-19. If a community (or more specifically, a school) has cases of COVID-19, local health officials will help identify those individuals and follow up on next steps.”

And what are the next steps? They never actually explained that.  Nor did they explain what happens when a school lacks a full-time nurse. What about the lag time between when a kid is tested at a dr’s office and when the school receives the results? And what if parents don’t take the kid to the dr at all?

I won’t even get into the part with the diagram expecting all classrooms to be 24 feet across and contain only 10 desks. Yikes. My classroom was a shoebox, and I had 28 desks crammed in it with hardly any walking space. So yeah... Box Checkers need a reality check.

Parents, please don’t send your kids back to school in the middle of this. Schools cannot guarantee their safety. If you’ve ever worked in a K-12 school, you know that 99% of the problems are top-down problems. They have NO PLAN."

Yet, Mitch McConnell couldn’t be bothered to come up with a package that his own party can agree on, much less negotiate a compromise with House Democrats.  The GOP is very good at giving tax breaks to the already rich and at tearing things down, like the ACA, but they cannot create or build anything that helps ordinary Americans.

Instead, without a defense, and without even really trying, they are now trying to portray confidence, with American kids being used as guinea pigs.

100-percent of college age kids and younger will be contracting the virus. This much is basic common sense after seeing transmission rates in this and other countries. Officials are hoping that college kids will have recovered before they go home at Thanksgiving. As for the younger, school-age kids, they are clueless and grasping at straws. This battle was lost long ago. It's now down to every individual to protect themselves and their families, because the government has proved that it's not within its ability to do so.

One chance to do something: Get a grip. Grow some courage and rid the country of absurd selfishness. Forget the economy and subsidize the people as much as this government has subsidized corporations. Corporations are not living things, and they can do nothing without people to run them.

But there is a possibility of the following scenario.

For example: when a person gets infected by clostridium Tetani or Menengecoc etc.  The critical issue is you had to take measures timely. Following symptoms and starting treatment.

If you are late even a little bit, you may end up the full-fledged infection. Consequences are severe disability or death.

The critical question is How do we know we passed or not, that threshold which Dr. Birx said, it is widespread in the USA.

We wasted 6 months plus we behave like a reality show character and resisted against measures. 

What you are going to control with half measures?

Tetanus and meningitis, sometimes actions of late treatment are very dramatic and brutally invasive.

Such as inducing coma to prevent severe brain or muscle damages.

Teachers have already resigned over this. They currently have a petition with over 3,000 signatures requesting to work from home lest they resign. 

ONE day after teachers returned to the school buildings to begin planning, at least 260 employees tested positive for COVID-19. Just one day. When it was initially reported, that number was 3. So of course that number will continue to increase. So now, what do they expect these teachers to do? Isolate at home, where they should’ve stayed anyway, as Gwinnett County has around 18,000 total cases, about 10% of the entire state of Georgia’s cases. They had no business making teachers return to campus. 

Gwinnett County has 141 schools. That’s 141 Petri dishes. Why make teachers go back to these  multiple school buildings when they could teach from home?  Because school systems have no idea what they’re doing. They are playing Russian roulette."

The Senate never addressed the issue - are we surprised? - and the administration has changed the previously published date - are we surprised again?

There is no disservice that the Trump cabal will not visit upon the American people in their ugly attempts to corrupt the democratic process so they can win in November, or in this case, for the next decade.

I am an RN and one of those that you see going out testing every day. Last Friday morning I tested nine people for preop clearance and this includes such things as dental work or surgery.

Out of the nine people I tested but had no symptoms at all… Five tested positive. For the past 3 to 4 months out of approximately 450 people I tested we had only three come back as positive.

I am an RN at the Santa Rosa VA clinic that is a one Hour Drive N. of San Francisco￼￼. If valid this is an extraordinary increase and points to the fact that extremely high percentage of infection can come from people who have no symptoms… This fits with the idea of an incredible spread.

I’ve said it before in my comments but I seriously hope Trump gets this and leaves the planet. He is an absolute joke of a human being and people are dying because of his actions and inaction. ￼￼￼ i’ve never seen such a human being who is such an incredible loser. ￼"

Most of the early work on the Census was done while BostWash was in lockdown, and its poorest residents unreachable - Census workers were not going door-to-door where these activities were not prohibited by Covid-19 control restrictions.
And the sector always undercounted - those without fixed addresses due to poverty got only a cursory count.
The residents of the South and Midwest behaved as if nothing was happening - and Census takers were able to go door-to-door, unencumbered by face shields and fear.
The new extra House Members these warped numbers will generate will cause more havoc in the areas of the US hardest hit by the pandemic.
With work complete in areas favored by the Administration, instead of extending the Census which will first affect the 2022 election, we’ll just close down and give them a decade of extra benefits, in Congress and Block Grants.
When something has prevented proper data collection, the proper thing to do is to give more time and resources to do the job properly.

This virus doesn’t care what zip code you live in. We are all at risk. And now, a young man in high school has lost his parents.

It is tracking this week to reach 1500 by the end of the week.  

Group gatherings of more than a few people,  whether indoors or outdoors,  clearly appear to be the key to the spread.  Fresh air and UV radiation provided by nature cannot compensate for the fact that the virus is everywhere,  and any concentration of people anywhere produces an increase in both the number of infections, and the seriousness of those infections.

This is what will happen in the US if we just let this pandemic spread like wild fire and just ride it out.   Millions will get sick.  Some will survive and some will die. Those who have medical issues or who are in fragile health need to stay inside and protect themselves. While others who are more robust will contract the virus, suffer little or no symptoms and become asymptomatic carriers of the disease.  
This is what happens when people worship money and material goods ahead of humanity.  If one person gets sick and dies needlessly it's one person too many.

That would give enough time for reactions (14+ days) before the polls open.

I suggest that the nuclear families of the President, Vice-President and cabinet members should all be (t)asked to volunteer (or be volunteered by the one who has authority to do anything he wants) for this effort.

2020-08-03 10:15:15,"If we can only forget the 160,000 dead and the mayhem that is trump .I will wait a few months to see how safe it is before I try it whenever it comes out."
2020-08-03 10:19:41,"A return to near normality is as accessible now as it was way back
in early March. A serious, national, four-week shutdown of all non-essential services with every American receiving economic support from the government to which they have paid taxes and shirkers receiving stiff fines. In four weeks, the virus would be under control again throughout the nation and we could cautiously contemplate returning our children to school with the same degree of safety as the Europeans. It’s simple and requires no rushing of research."
2020-08-03 10:24:53,Does anyone doubt that President Trump would push to bring the vaccine out before its ready just to win the election?
2020-08-03 10:25:08,"Even if there is nothing form Operation Warp speed, tRump will continue to lie. Leaders of OWS can state on the record that they have nothing to show and tRump will claim victory and insist he is on top of the game. Remember, he needs to keep up the pretense that he is a war time hero and everything is under control.

TRump and Jarod; utter failures. We know tRump will lie. His base will believe him."
2020-08-03 10:24:44,"My suggestion.... the first doses should be administered to the Trump Administration and his family.  Oh, and all the ""talking heads"" who are going to tout it!
 I certainly will not be lining up in any quay, and I'm in that ""over 65 w/ underlying conditions! And I am not an anti-vaccer.    No thank-you."
2020-08-03 10:15:57,It’s like the premise of a horror novel.
2020-08-03 10:22:19,Trump is there most transparent con artist in history. the fact that he's fooled 60 million Americans is a testament to our failing education system.
2020-08-03 10:30:14,I worry about this. The October Surprise in any Presidential election is never good news.  This is one area where election reform is needed
2020-08-03 10:30:01,"So the White House is pushing for a vaccine as soon as possible but they want our children, teachers and support staff to go back to school before there is a vaccine?!?!
Let’s all pause and think about that."
2020-08-03 10:34:26,"Not only scientists, but all Americans have good reason to be concerned about developing coronavirus vaccines that are entering clinical trials.  The FDA does not remotely have sufficient personnel to properly monitor the results of human clinical trials.  So, the FDA relies upon the honesty and integrity of the principal investigators who run the clinical trials and the pharmaceutical companies that employ them.  Compensation of the principal investigators is tied to the number of human volunteers who complete their participation in the clinical trials.  
We have been relying upon a system of honest self-checking by principal investigators and pharmaceutical companies for decades.  This system of having the fox mind the chicken coop has real risks under normal circumstances.  In the age of Covid 19, those risks are amplified dramatically because billions of dollars have been committed by the federal government to Operation Warp Speed...a project designed to deliver a vaccine that must rescue our American economy...a project that is Donald Trump’s last hope to escape defeat in the fall."
2020-08-03 10:36:51,"While I fully realize that a vaccine is the only way to a fundamental and safe return to ""normal"" life and work, if this is rushed there is a whole population of anti-vaxxers and skeptics who will now have an another excuse (albeit a somewhat reasonable one) NOT to vaccinate themselves and theirs.  If this is rushed even I, as a 30 year RN, may have second thoughts about a rushed and not fully vetted vaccine.  Patience, thoroughness, and safety is the only way to do this.  Even if you have to wear a mask another year."
2020-08-03 10:40:22,"Seems to me it would be much more prudent to at the moment do what we k ow works. If Trump really cared about the welfare of anyone but himself we would have been controlling the virus months ago. There would be no need to expedite a process that requires strict procedure and oversight. 

It doesn’t take a genius to see that this is absolutely about politics and money. At 68yrs old I would have to seriously consider whether or not to accept any vaccine rushed beyond normal protocols."
2020-08-03 10:33:50,"Do we say that the vaccine is a political stunt that won't help curb the virus' spread and may even be harmful? Or do we hope that the actual scientists, the ones who make the vaccine, gather the data, report the data to journals, and who act as peer reviewers, won't be swayed by political pressure? 

Maybe I am naive, but I for one just have to hope for the latter. We live in a world of such rampant anti-science and anti-fact rhetoric I just have to trust the scientists. I'm too scared of the direction we are heading as a world, where everything is political, and objective facts depend on whose side you're on. I don't want to live it a world where scientists en masse have been corrupted to this extreme extent."
2020-08-03 10:35:23,"If rushing a vaccine to market for political purposes is Trump’s electoral strategy, it seems to be a non starter.  Who does it appeal to?  No one outside of his base.  

Donald’s well documented skepticism of vaccines and general anti science bias strikes a chord with his most devoted followers.  They are voting for him anyway but unlikely to get vaccinated because they don’t understand the benefits of vaccines generally and still think Covid19 is a hoax or someone else’s problem.

Those of us who believe that Donald is spectacularly untrustworthy and has grossly mismanaged the pandemic are going to be wary of any vaccine that arrives under the aegis of this Administration.  No one really wants to take the chance that Jared is the “expert” signing off on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine."
2020-08-03 10:36:35,It is entirely reasonable to have serious doubts about the safety and efficacy of any vaccine in which the Trump administration  has a role.
2020-08-03 10:39:28,"I decided back in November that I would not believe anything revealed after January 1 in the way of scandals or stories (other than natural disasters) that could influence the election.  Roger Stone is loose; there will be ""shocking"" revelations.  Keep focused and ignore the noise.  And it will get very noisy."
2020-08-03 10:39:45,"I’m 72 and wouldn’t take a vaccine developed in a few months, especially when pushed by White House and I think most people won’t. Trump could careless if a bunch of people die after election."
2020-08-03 10:40:04,"Anything that comes out of this administration is suspect. Trump pushes snake oil cures such as Hydroxychloroquine, so there is no reason why we should not all be aware of his next boondoggle."
2020-08-03 11:01:16,"Folks, it will take 1-2 months to enroll enough people to have a sufficiently powered study. It will then take at least 3 months (90 days) to get any usable data on efficacy. It is a question of logistics and time to observe. Then, and only then, will there be trustworthy, reliable, peer reviewed data."
2020-08-03 10:41:22,"Operation Warp Speed. The name alone frightens me. Add to that, a failed President, a failed CDC, a politically driven pandemic response, a questionable FDA independence, and a pharmaceutical industry chock full of greed. 

Why shouldn't all America be leery of any vaccine being promoted as safe with the lies that have been spewing out of the White House about COVID-19 since January.

I'll wait and listen to the Biden Administration before making any decision regarding a vaccine."
2020-08-03 10:53:01,"The only thing I've seen moving at speed in the Trump circle is the way he throws billions of our money around to buy the expertise of others, usually foreigners. America has long refused to educate all of her own children, but compensated with a flood of highly qualified immigrants. Now that Trump has stalled that flow, we have to go to London, Oxford, and France on shopping trips for a vaccine. Do we now include Moscow in that buy-in? Beijing? And please---""warp speed"" is a term from a science fiction TV show."
2020-08-03 10:59:34,"Trump is largely responsible for the large magnitude of infections and deaths. And now he wants to get credit for solving (even if it is too early to call it a solution) the problem?

This is like an arsonist who tries to take credit for being the first to call the fire department after setting fire to the house.

The only question is whether or not Americans see through this ploy and come out in droves to send Trump packing out of the WH."
2020-08-03 11:09:49,"Let's al just step back and take a breath and contemplate how utterly obscene it is for Trump to want a vaccine ""before the election."" Could there be any better proof that the man cares nothing--nothing--about human life, except, of course, his own? ""Just bring me something I can call a vaccine,"" he saying in effect, ""and who cares whether it works as long a people don't find out until after I'm re-elected."""
2020-08-03 11:10:59,Let’s be more accurate here.  It is not the “administration” that is providing billions of dollars to develop a vaccine.  It is the “government” and that includes everybody in the country who work hard to support the government.  Thank goodness for that.
2020-08-03 10:51:58,"Moderna has a different kind of vaccine. It uses mRNA technology  which is having your cells get instructions from the medicine to ask the cell machinery to make a response. No one has ever done a vaccine like this. But the great thing about Moderna is that they have a pipeline of many vaccines including Zika virus, and even cancer and heart disease.  To this nonscientist, It represents an advance in vaccine development. 

It is clear from Trump's politicized handling of the PPE in blue states that he is incapable of equitably distribution vaccine in any way that is fair."
2020-08-03 10:55:13,Any vaccine not vetted by the FDA’s outside panel of experts would be a non-starter.
2020-08-03 10:46:11,"So this is basically an article about wether or not the people will believe the results. Which is also the $64,000.00 dollar question. Under a normal presidency there would be no question at all, as to the validity of the vaccine. That is why we need to get rid of this president because you do not know if he is lying or not. trump has that question asked on every decision he has to make. This is no way to run a country never mind a company."
2020-08-03 10:51:21,"Or is the opposite true?  Efforts are being made to delay the vaccines until after the election.  Two weeks ago, a few trials were approved for Phase III yet none of them have completed inoculations of test subjects.  Why?  Why weren't volunteers preapproved and ready when the vaccines were authorized to move to large scale human trials.  The timing on this is right on the election.  A few weeks late and it is after the election.  A few weeks early and it is before the election.  It seems that the process has slowed down just enough to come in right after the election.  Just so everyone understands, big pharma, the AMA, and corporate hospitals hate Trump.  I think this story might have it backward."
2020-08-03 10:56:54,"It escaped no one that the proposed deadline also intersected nicely with President Trump’s need to curb the virus before the election in November.

That is the entire point of this exercise.  Giant headlines, big, big, big headlines and his hopes of a win in November. 

Who would line up for a fake vaccine developed by fake science backed by a fake president?   If he said the moon was made of cheese and people were starving his followers would be launching themselves out of backyard rockets.  

The insanity will only end when we have someone in the White House who can build trust back into the process.  I will not be getting a vaccine that is built on politics  instead of science."
2020-08-03 11:03:00,"I find it just amazing how quickly political desperation can change republican agendas. Overnight vaccines, 12yrs of fighting to abolish health care to suddenly managing a bigly beautiful healthcare program. Supposed cheaper prescription drugs etc etc etc. 

Repubs have shamefully proven time and again that the only principles they adhere to are whatever serves them best at the moment. To say that they are political chameleons is putting it mildly. Weasels would be much more appropriate."
2020-08-03 11:05:24,"If scientists are worried about the politicizing of the vaccine, they should announce that it won’t be available before the election. I’m vaccinated, my kids are vaccinated, I get  flu shot every year. But I wouldn’t get a Covid19 vaccine that was available in October. The pressure on companies to get it out there in time to rescue trump’s reelection bid makes it very likely it will be released before it is either safe or effective. Trump will make a fake announcement about it being ready no matter what, but I’ll wait until December to see what scientists have to say about it."
2020-08-03 11:12:22,We saw what happened to Dr Rick Bright when he tried to prevent Trump from forcing him to waste money on Hydroxychloroquin.  With the entire election at stake you can be sure that anyone who stands in the way of approving an untested vaccine will lose their job and get death threats from the Trump base.   How many people will have the courage to stand up to that kind of pressure? I would not consider taking any vaccine until a Biden administration team has reviewed it for safety.
2020-08-03 10:58:16,It seems logical that the country should indeed move forward at “warp speed.”  Ultimately I could care less who wins the Presidency if only we can save more lives.  I tire of these conspiracy narratives.  Everything is not about politics.  It seems the Trump administration can do nothing that pleases Democrats.  If the administration was not moving at warp speed it would be criticized for dragging its feet.  This article suggests that Trump has undermined science but in the same breath criticizes him for employing science that could save the world from more deaths. There is no winning even when lives are at stake.  Forget about winning the Presidency.  It seems there is no way of winning anything anymore.
2020-08-03 10:44:27,"We could never take a vaccine produced during Trump's tenure.  We cannot trust the FDA, CDC or the DOJ all of which are controlled by Trump or Kushner.  Unless Europeans accept the Vaccine, I will wait."
2020-08-03 10:52:05,I find the premise of this article enraging. Public distrust or political expediency are small prices to pay to save hundreds of thousands of lives. Warp speed is not fast enough. We need challenge trials and we needed them last month.
2020-08-03 11:06:31,"As a retired researcher, who worked on vaccine development for many years I am a believer in the beneficial effects of vaccines and under normal circumstances would feel confident in the approval process for safety and efficacy.
BUT, with a FDA head who has demonstrated numerous times to be a Trump sycophant and many others in the chain of health command like him, I also worry that our once stellar approval process will be undermined by a madman.
We must insure by any means possible that Trumpites be kept miles away from evaluating the data."
2020-08-03 10:49:34,"Warped thinking.

If, by some miracle, a vaccine will be ready for distribution by October it will not negate the fact that 200,000 Americans will have died by then.  

It will not negate the fact that Trump's refusal to have a universal plan for all 50 states to combat the virus led to tens of thousands of people dying or suffering needlessly.

It will not negate the fact the US ranks at the bottom or close to the bottom in almost every metric in the response to the pandemic.

Incompetence, neglect, lack of leadership, corruption, and the rest of the self-inflicted wounds that define Trump will be his undoing on November 3rd.

A vaccine by October and Trump getting trounced in November would be the best of both worlds."
2020-08-03 11:02:07,"I am an infectious diseases physician. I know, as sure as the sun rises in the East, that it is not possible to adequately assess safety of a vaccine in such a short time. And vaccines, when not adequately tested, CAN be unsafe. The fastest we have ever, EVER, developed a vaccine would be four years - for mumps.

For example, the Dengue fever vaccine that makes the disease even worse. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in 1966 that also made the disease worse and killed two toddlers. RSV remains a disease for which a vaccine is elusive.

With blatantly political appointees at FDA and CDC (and I've already completely lost faith in the CDC), the safety of this vaccine is going to be questionable. I don't trust these appointees to keep the health of the American people uppermost, because they want to keep their jobs. Even though keeping Americans safe IS their primary job."
2020-08-03 11:08:23,"I have not heard one virologist or epidemiologist from the renowned Pasteur Institute or the other prestigious scientific research centers in France and elsewhere in Europe express optimism about a viable vaccine any earlier than next year or later. 

In any case, why would anyone believe that Jared Kushner and Mike Pence  could organize and carry out a rapid and effective vaccination program in the US - particularly with anti-vaxxers who don’t even believe the science behind the proven vaccines that have been successfully administered for years. 

I’m as pro-vaccination as they come, but I won’t be lining up for any vaccine developed under Azar and rushed out as a Hail Mary for Trump’s re-election!"
2020-08-03 11:37:09,"For myself  with underlying cardiac issues I question a vaccine so soon.  Would I take it would be questionable.  Who should get it first, health care workers, people of color an seniors. Would there be enough and how will it be distributed""  How long would we have to wait to make sure it works and does no harm.  If this is being pushed for POTUS then I question the vaccine.  Let the makers of a vaccine really test and make sure it is safe.  Contracting the virus is awful by itself. then add a vaccine rushed thru with very little time to see if it is safe would do more harm than good.  POTUS let the Governor's figure out how to handle the virus and it did not just disappear.  He is trying to ride the tide of a vaccine to improve his image and this is a huge concern.  He is the reason why we are where we are today.  Everything he is doing if trying to improve his image and from the beginning he has made false claims and just recently 7 months after the start put on a mask.  If he was a real leader he would have been working very hard to get it under control as he was made aware of it in 2019.  He could have given up his golfing and New Year's party.  He has sacrifice nothing."
2020-08-03 10:43:37,"Gee, really? The guy in the White House acts like HE is personally working in the labs, and that HE alone will be responsible for the miraculous cure. And he is spending billions of dollars to various companies on ""maybes"". Their handling of this has been like a Marx Brothers movie,with a David Lynch twist. Can't wait to see who benefitted from all the stock options doled out."
2020-08-03 10:57:51,"This explains why we see no efforts to combat the spread of this Trump virus.
Trump is betting on this accelerated vaccine project so he can claim it as his response come October.
Use the population as Guinea pigs."
2020-08-03 10:59:52,"News flash from the front Ines fighting the corona virus: The very healthcare workers that are targeted for receiving the vaccine first know their science and none of them want to be the first. There are natural laws dictating speed according to circumstance.

Let Jared and his family take the first shots."
2020-08-03 11:05:46,"So just who are “the people involved in the process”?  On the surface it would seem to include Sharan, Katie, Noah Peter and Annie."
2020-08-03 11:33:48,"NOW they are sounding the alarm????

Too little and possibly too late.   Our ineffective response to this pandemic is not just a sidebar in what is wrong with our country.  We, Americans, analyze and rationalize without taking personal responsibility. Our failures include marginal understanding of how our government works and what it is there for. It is, or should be, the moral and ethical vehicle upon which our nation rides. But like a shiny new car, we have neglected it’s maintenance in favor of runaway capitalism. We have underestimated the rot of under-education  in favor of shiny superficial spending. And yes, allowed the mountebanks to climb on the backs of the less advantaged to their palaces of wealth and power. 

Old Glory is in tatters and Rome is burning. I try to see the glorious dawn of tomorrow, but we are like the pathetic orchestra that played on as the Titanic was sinking. I listen to the pundits in their babble pretending they can cure this cancer by dissecting the travesties of the day. But it is like trying to staunch the bleeding of a hemophiliac. 

The ravages of this pandemic are the result of each and every vote we cast for the lowest of local officials to the pennies we have spent, lured by the avarice of showing we were better than the next guy. We are not."
2020-08-03 11:36:27,What is the political opposition's greatest fear? That a vacccine will be developed before the election. Better start undermining the idea now. otherwise the current administration might get the credit. Horrors!
2020-08-03 11:41:13,"I’m not planning to be first in line for a vaccine.

Why would I trust a vaccine produced by this corrupt administration?  I’m waiting for the media reports on 
-who is getting payoffs from all these billions handed out
-all the research short cuts and deadly side effects 
-elected members of Congress making stock market profits off insider information 

I’ll let others be “Warp Speed” guinea pig."
2020-08-03 11:11:28,"This says it all  “President Trump’s need to curb the virus before the election in November.”

There is NO WAY I will take a Trump peddled vaccine hastily made and tested."
2020-08-03 11:29:07,"After reading the whistleblower complaint filed by Dr. Rick Bright after he was removed as head of BARDA (the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which is charged with organizing and financing options on vaccines and therapies), it became clear that the administration wanted Dr. Bright gone so that Alex Azar & Co. could have access to billions of dollars of money awarded to BARDA by Congress for the development of a vaccine.  This has allowed the administration to award tons of money to its favored biomedical and pharmaceutical companies for a vaccine without having to go through the rigorous protocols employed by Dr. Bright.  This prepared the way for Trump to dump billions of tax payer dollars into the market place in the hope that someone might quickly develop a vaccine before the election and make us forget Trump’s gross incompetence, ignorance, and lies that have resulted in the deaths of so many people.  And, of course, if someone does develop a vaccine, we won’t even miss those wasted billions that were thrown about like confetti by the “former” pharmaceutical lobbyists making the decisions in the White House.  There is nothing new here: Trump has always used other people’s money to advance his own interests.  Now, we tax payers are the chumps."
2020-08-03 10:52:02,"It will not be developed by November 5th so there is no need to publish a fake news story like that. Were it done people would have to agree to be guinea pigs, which I sure will not be."
2020-08-03 11:11:52,Political pressure is a two-way street. Democrats have no interest in curbing the virus until after the election in November.
2020-08-03 11:18:12,"What a surprise.  He is also involved in the Tsarnaev court case where he has no business (I was happy by the way that he got the death sentence) and yes, it is all about the election.  Wonder how he is going to get everyone back to work in time!"
2020-08-03 11:36:11,"“The rapid research, development, trials and eventual distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine is emblematic of President Trump’s highest priority: the health and safety of the American people,” said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman. “It has nothing to do with politics.”

All rational people know this is a total falsehood. Were it true, we would have had a rational, comprehensive response from the beginning.  Instead ours in the US  has been the worst."
2020-08-03 10:47:32,"Trump needs a big win badly.  So it would not surprise me that he will exert all manner of pressure on Big Pharma to deliver something, even if it isn't much more effective than a placebo.  So, any vaccine that is released before November is totally suspect as to its efficacy.  What is worse, at the rate everything is being pushed to deliver, harmful side effects that may not show up for a month or two after the inoculation will not be caught and the cure could be just as bad as the disease."
2020-08-03 11:20:47,"When Trump in his usual go-it-alone America-First mode, decided not to join the Europeans in their cooperative vaccine initiative, it was the first time that I agreed with him...of course for different reasons.  

My fear is that he would somehow manage to corrupt that international effort.  This way, with the Europeans acting independent of us, if the Trump corruption fears of American scientists leave us with no effective vaccine, and far behind the rest of the world - again -  at least the Europeans will do it right.

Perhaps in 2021, the nations of Europe will take pity on us - as they do now because of our pathetic GOP public health failures - and help us out with the vaccine.  However, if Trump gets re-elected, we are simply doomed."
2020-08-03 11:21:27,"Well, Trump outtrumped himself once again—that third of our country who are anti-vaxers are all his supporters.

There’s about as much chance of a vaccine by year’s end as there is a GOP health care plan that costs less and covers everyone. Trump has less credibility than an email claiming to be from a Nigerian prince who will share his fortune with you if you lend him $1,500. No one with a brain is going to buy the vaccine story, and the rest (his supporters) are nihilists who  refuse to take a vaccine. Trump might as well offer free birth control vending machines in grade schools.

Trump is simultaneously maintaining that it’s safe for schools to reopen at the end of summer yet unsafe for the election to be held on its normal date and must be pushed back. He can’t decide whether he should put out a fire with gasoline or empty  an ocean by drowning it but every day, fewer people care what he says any more."
2020-08-03 11:19:41,"This article is conjecture and insinuation. It provides no evidence and some of is wrong. It's devastating to the public health and should be removed.

Both vaccines that entered trials last week require 28 days between vaccinations. The calendar to complete the trial is fixed. The results require blood tests which can be done quickly. The analysis of results can be sped up safely as can the evaluation through the regulatory chain.

There's no reason this can't be done safely by November solely in the interest of the public health. Warp Speed is in the interest of the public health. It doesn't cut corners. It takes multiple processes and does them concurrently.  The risk isn't safety, it's cost. A pharmaceutical company may end up dispensing with worthless vaccines. So be it.

The Emergency Use Authorization for hydroxychloroquine was appropriate as was its withdrawal.  Both were based on what was known at the time. No one in the medical community should criticize Hahn for it.

Everything done at government agencies has a paper trail accessible via FOIA.  If you have evidence of unscientific action done for political reasons, the public health demands you provide it. If you don't, the public health demands you desist from conjecture. Stock portfolios aren't evidence if they comply with ethics laws.

The article reduces the public's trust of the FDA based on an unnamed ""scientists"". They can publish their opinions with their names and credentials. This is poor journalism."
2020-08-03 11:29:06,"Millions of people will refuse to take this vaccine if they feel that the drug companies have not performed adequate testing. We already have a large number who say they will not accept this vaccine under any circumstances, but a rushed and poorly tested drug that meets the Trump requirement for readiness before the election will be a bust. 
Drug companies are always motivated by greed- the temptation to make billions of dollars and hope for the best in your vaccine formulation would certainly be a strong possibility, especially with an FDA headed by a drug company stooge."
2020-08-03 11:01:37,"I was wondering when the NYT would begin its campaign to sow doubts about the vaccine.  I can stop wondering now.  I get that you don’t want to give credit where it’s due.  President Trump has pulled out all the stops in getting a vaccine that in addition to causing over 150,000 deaths in the US has ground global economic activity to a near halt which is causing immense pain on nearly everyone’s part.  Every day this persists is a very bad day.  Not sure exactly what risks we should accept for a chance at an early solution, but probably the societally productive thing to be doing here is the exact opposite of insisting on perfect data as to safety and efficacy; instead we should be encouraging people to get vaccinated in as high numbers as possible as soon as it clears regulatory approval.  I’m sure that’s exactly what the NYT will promote unless it starts to look like it can be rolled out before Election Day or soon enough thereafter that Trump gets the credit he deserves."
2020-08-03 11:04:10,"So does everyone I know. And next to this article is one about Russia hastening a trial in October. Will Trump deliver an executive order to get one here, ahead of the election he will only acknowledge if he wins? Shame on us for letting the insanity get this far -- and it keeps going."
2020-08-03 11:19:42,"Here's what we know for certain: if Donald Trump is involved with something, the integrity of whatever that something is becomes greatly diminished. This is essentially a law of nature.  Vaccines are not something you want to rush.  Once they're in people's bodies you can't take them back out.  The vaccine delusion is why Trump doesn't have any pandemic plan whatsoever.  He thinks the vaccine will save him.  Insanity."
2020-08-03 11:30:05,"The the very first batch of the vaccine should be given to President Donald Trump. Next in line, Republican members of the Senate and Congress. Then, any citizen with a ""Trump 2020"" sign in their yard."

With that being  said giving the generally bungled response why would anyone consider a vaccine overseen by this crew.   A process that usually takes 12 years is now being completed in 12 months, suspicious at best, murderous at worst."
2020-08-03 11:18:05,"I am a front line worker and am certainly not an anti vaccine nut. The only way they can force this vaccine on me is if they tie me down and give it against my will.  Let Pelosi give the vaccine to every administration official including Trump and his grifter family on live TV, then I might relent. President Ford forced me to get the swine flu vaccine over 40 years ago, how many people suffered with Guillain-Barre because of politics in 1976?"
2020-08-03 11:24:33,"I am a New York ICU nurse and I guarantee you every medical professional is going to have her own rigorous critical thinking process before submitting to a new and rushed vaccine. We made it through the surge heroically and more - or less - intact. We know how to use PPE and best practices professionally and personally. We won’t be letting our guard down now. The alluring new vaccine, if not rigorously vetted and presented, will not be the must-have for health care workers or the general public that some politicians envision."
2020-08-03 11:31:46,"I appreciate the skepticism, but bear in mind that other countries are also rushing for a vaccine.  I wonder if the press in those countries are publishing similar stories?"
2020-08-03 11:37:57,"Trump has endorsed med that does not work and may harm. Why would he not endorse a bogus vaccine if he believes it will help him? And from what we've seen, there are medical ""experts"" more than willing to help him."
2020-08-03 11:24:31,"Is it possible a multi billion dollar advanced payment for a vaccine that is not yet available for sale to the public, make a dose of that vaccine available  months  in advance to that President with the deep pockets.  Could an advanced vaccine inoculation explain our Presidents lack of personal health concern when he holds events large and small with the public with no masks and no social distancing?"
2020-08-03 11:52:47,Nothing wrong with a deadline.  Many projects benefit from having a target.  Some never end because there is not a goal.
2020-08-03 11:53:26,"If not for Trump there would be no need for rushed half asssed vaccine that may or may not be safe. I personally will decline any overnight vaccine until it is proven in actual practice, not rushed, to be effective and safe."
2020-08-03 11:51:20,"Maybe the safest approach is to look outside our borders to the vaccines being developed elsewhere in the world. From what I have read, the most promising vaccines have been coming out of England and other countries where Trump and Azar can't corrupt and disrupt high standards for safety. Maybe seeing that Germany and England are approving a given vaccine for use will put our minds at ease about whether the regulators are acting prudently on our own soil?"
2020-08-03 11:44:48,No way am I getting this vaccine while trump is ruling the USA.

2020-08-03 11:29:41,"1. The Food and Drug Administration must have people who are prepared to block the administration over attempted release of any vaccine considered risky due to lack of lack of trials or because other warning signs emerge. If the FDA is unable to do this then a staff member should become a public whistleblower.

2. Why does the NYT feel it necessary to describe someone as ""pencil thin"" in an article related to CV vaccine? Would the writers describe him as ""muffin bulky"" if he was? Subject matter too dry for you?"

We all know how much Trump follows his mentor Putin.  We should expect a similar announcement by Trump before the election, whether or not the US vaccines have been properly tested.

We should not believe Trump any more than we should believe Putin."

2020-08-03 11:53:42,"It will be hard to trust the safety of a vaccine promoted by a compulsive liar who has been advocating dangerous treatments for covid-19 for months. This is the point at which ""We know what he really means"" is insufficient."
2020-08-03 11:54:39,"A fear well-founded. To use a poker term, Trump has been betting on the come with billions of taxpayer dollars doled out to big pharma at home and abroad in hopes of getting a vaccine developed before the election. If it pays off, he will brag that only he could have done it. If it doesn't, he'll blame Obama, Fauci, Birx, Democrats, China, science, doctors in general and foreign hackers -- everyone but Russia and himself."
2020-08-03 11:59:46,"The FDA is already indelibly tarnished for approving hydrochloroquine for emergency use and allowing unverified antibody tests to flood the market.  The CDC and the WH has not explained in any way why the German developed WHO tests were ignored leading to a months long gap in US testing.  And the financials of vaccine development will surely show the US will be highly overcharged for vaccines that taxpayer money has already paid for.  (Just like Gilead is charging the US 25% more than the rest of the world for treatment with remdisivir, developed with 179 million taxpayer money.)

So, sure, I’m eager to be vaccinated with a sugar water/minimally effective/ side effects problem vaccine .......just to re-elect a president who is standing on a growing mountain of 150,000 American corpses.  

My distrust in Trump and his corruption of our gov including scientific entities like the EPA, the CDC, the FDA is boundless."
2020-08-03 12:03:05,"Sorry gang, but there is no way that I'm injecting anything into my body that was the result of this Presidents efforts to RUSH a vaccine to market.
 
Trump has already proven, time and time again that he puts his reelection ahead of public safety, so why should the safety of a vaccine be any different. 

I'm sure there will be immunity from lawsuits buried into the fine print of the deals he's doing with the drug companies, so the only losers will be the American public, who will be faced with taking a vaccine that was artificially rushed to market without adequate testing.  

Reality. A vaccine of any kind that goes from zero to market availability in less than 6 months is simply insane. No way you can convince me it was tested properly. Trump is desperate and he'll do anything to try and win the election even if it means killing more Americans in the process."
2020-08-03 11:53:46,Two things can be true at the same time: the vaccine was rushed and the vaccine will work. One can hope.

Alternatively stated:   a return to the form of governance that gave us a 250 year track record that is the envy of the world Vs. a Cult of Personality form of governance where we toss aside our institutions and put our faith in one person.

I don't understand why Republicans are so afraid of losing that they would attack our institutions.  They got smoked in 2008 but regained control of Congress 4 years later and the Presidency 4 years after that.  They will get another shot at power, that is the best part of our Republic."
2020-08-03 12:01:55,"I worked as a Navy Hospital Corpsman at the Great Lakes Regional Medical Center north of Chicago in 1976-77 when a potential pandemic of Swine, Hong Kong and Victoria flu was forecast. The federal government rushed a vaccine for each flu virus and forced the entire military to be vaccinated per President Ford. The vaccine sickened everyone. No one on base was spared by the triple vaccine and people were calling in sick because they were bed ridden. The 1976 pandemic never showed up but the consequences of poorly vetting the vaccine created problems for years in those with severe reactions.

That is my fear at this point. I’m all for a vaccine but for those of us who are immune compromised, we can’t take chances on a vaccine that causes us more problems."
2020-08-03 11:59:36,"You can risk Covid-19 or you can risk a vaccine.  The virus has no thought whatsoever about protecting anybody's health, but lots of thought is going into making a vaccine safe - a clear choice in the vaccine's favor.  Yes, I want to see all the politicians and vaccine manufacturers take the vaccine first."
2020-08-03 12:00:49,Way to go NY Times! Thanks for opinion instead of hard investigative reporting that plays right into anti vaxxer camp. Sowing seeds of doubt will only ensure failure of whatever vaccine is developed. How about hard reporting on what is actually being done to ensure efficacy and safety of vaccine and interviewing people who would get it instead of only presenting nay sayers ? Oh I forgot that doesn’t produce sensationalized headlines that serve to sell more papers.
2020-08-03 12:01:31,"Can't imagine why scientists would think Trump would push unsafe, untested cures simply as a campaign tool... oh yah thats right, he's done it before... several times in fact. No accountability for this President, none, and a Senate so lame it might as well not even exist.... so don't bother looking to them for any oversight. Billions in public money going to Pfizer, etc and they still want to overcharge us."
2020-08-03 12:02:04,"I am not sure why the NYTimes is sowing distrust of Operation Warpspeed.  Dr. Fauci is very encouraged  about progress in developing various vaccines and the developers are highly professional biotech and pharmaceutical companies.  Moreover, the project has been financed so that the government is not ""putting all its eggs in one basket"". 
To politicize this issue when there are already so many misinformed people  inappropriately skeptical about vaccines  is highly irresponsible. Plus I see no ""smoking gun"" in this article other than Trump hate."
2020-08-03 12:04:50,Trump has done such an effective job at undermining science and even his own administration that few Americans will have any confidence in Trump’s vaccine. Like Trump steaks and Trump wine. Who’s going to be Trump’s guinea pig for the vaccine?

I am diligent about keeping up with my boosters. All of this background is intended to make the point that I’m strongly pro-vaccine under ordinary circumstances. However, under no circumstances would I consent to get a vaccine that was rushed into production by the Trump administration, which only cares about favorable news coverage and winning re-election and not about the safety and efficacy of a vaccine. The man doesn’t care in the least whether Americans die en masse from a faulty vaccine as long as they hold off on dying until after the election."

Will this administration snap it’s fingers and suddenly millions of glass vials, syringes, clinics for giving injections, etc suddenly materialize?? This is undoubtedly the most corrupt and incompetent president our country has ever endured. He couldn’t even provide our health care workers with sufficient PPE nor our citizens with adequate testing. 
Unfortunately, for all of us... the fools who refuse to mask up and socially distance included, our country has been ravaged and demoralized by this outrageous administration. The actual vaccine is nearly a case of “ The Emperor’s Clothes”. Please VOTE!!"
2020-08-03 12:03:12,"Trump is a narcissist who only cares about himself, money and his family. He consistently attacks people base on party affiliation. So how can anyone take him seriously to protect them? His base that he is trying to appease with this vaccine is most likely made up of anti-vaxxers. Even if he could pull off a hail Mary stunt of a vaccine before the Nov. 3 election he would still need to pull off a Lazarus feat and raise those 153,000 Americans back from the dead when he went around calling the virus a "" the new Democrat hoax."""

2020-08-03 12:21:03,"What about children? Will the vaccine be tested in children on a large enough scale to demonstrate safety? New reports suggest that children carry high viral load and may be significant sources of transmission, yet are we going to vaccinate them even though they seem to be least effected by the virus?

I am unaware of current vaccine trial designs but it seems to me that early trials should focus on those most harmed by this illness. A logical approach would be to demonstrate safety and efficacy in our nursing home residents first. Then slowly broaden the program to include other vulnerable populations."
2020-08-03 12:10:01,If a vaccine is found in October there is no way I will be injecting that into my body.  Not a chance.
2020-08-03 12:12:49,"The news here is simple.

Covid has killed 155,000 Americans; the WHO and CDC had predicted some 2 million Americans would die of it.

The US death rate, currently 3.3%, is the lowest of any modern industrialized nation, from one third of that in Spain and Sweden to one fifth of that in France and Belgium.

And now a vaccine, produced by the most modern methods in the most modern, scientifically operated, research facilities in the world, appears close to being ready for use, months if not years ahead of all predictions.

And all you can say is our ""murderous"" president,  who has killed so many of us in this pandemic already with his ""greedy ineptitude,"" now must have some dark, comic book motives for this next evil move of his. 

You will continue your lock-down forever, or at least until it defeats him in the next election. That lock-down has killed ten times the number of covid deaths by heart disease, cancer, diabetes, untreated and diagnosed too late. One million small businesses, each the product of years, even decades of hard work and sacrifice, have closed for good. One million families and millions of workers have lost their livelihoods. 

History is going to evaluate him, and this, rather differently."
2020-08-03 12:16:52,It's not all about Trump and Republicans.  Democrats would be acting just as fast if they were in charge.
2020-08-03 12:09:09,"A Covid vaccine before the election is looking like Trump’s only chance, and you can be absolutely sure he will be announcing one - it doesn’t matter if it exists or not.
Am I being paranoid when I suggest that the billions of dollars given to big pharma might have involved a little quid pro quo?
Would Trump do a thing like that?"
2020-08-03 12:17:44,"Oh my. I've always trusted real medical science and am a strong believer in the efficacy of vaccination, having grown up in the polio/smallpox/measles/mumps era. But this terrifies me, not so much because good scientists will cheat, but because Trump will be sure that the decision makers are political sycophants.  And now the mistrust he has already sown will destroy the faith the general public will have in the vaccine, eliminating the potential benefits of having one."
2020-08-03 12:11:51,"To compellingly show vaccine effectiveness in preventing deaths before the election, the vaccine would need administered and effective in 100 million older sicker poorer people. To show fewer infections in all red states, the two doses of vaccine would need to be given in the end of September and the middle of October. The data would need analyzing and peer-review reporting. At best 5,000-10,000 will have the vaccine and it will look promising (via company here say), but infection rates will still be climbing because of open schools."
2020-08-03 12:14:50,"Scientists aren't the only ones worried that Mr. trump and his hand-picked loyalists will push an unready vaccine to market. We have learned by now that nothing is sacred, nothing is incorruptible, nothing it too risky if it will benefit mr. trump."
2020-08-03 12:15:23,"Scientists worry?

A majority of Americans are worried.

Donald J. Trump has repeatedly proven during the COVDI19 pandemic that he'll do anything and everything for personal, political gain.

As Trump publicly lauded how he'll rush to get a vaccine out by the Fall, coincidentally right before the November election, numerous virologists explained that developing a safe and effective vaccine takes 12-18 months, if one can be developed at all."
2020-08-03 12:14:22,"The solution to this crisis does not rely solely upon a vaccine. As individual companies institute measures to protect their customers and employees, they are contributing to the solution & reducing the incidence. Likewise, whoever receives the vaccine first (assuming it works), they will decrease the pool of people who can spread the virus. Third, as the population experiences more deaths, it will gradually distance and wear protective gear at an increasing rate. While the media likes to point out the deniers, the overall population is moving towards safety. That's how humans survived this long.

Trump created a false scenario that appealed to the emotional and financial needs of many people so they discounted the severity of the disease and exacerbated the problem. But as they watch family members die, they learn that Trump's narrative was false and they are adjusting. Trump's bungling of so many facets lead to many deaths but the election will address that problem. The biggest failure was our inability to rectify the leadership failure and replace Trump sooner."
2020-08-03 12:15:09,When Fauci says a vaccine is safe I’ll be the first in line.

A rough piggish bully handing out massive, publicly funded financial incentives to an industry who’s CEO’s only care about their market value... especially now... is probably not the best scenario for the creation of anything I would ever put inside my body.

2020-08-03 12:14:30,"We couldn't trust the White House to accurately show the path of a hurricane. Trump undermined scientists to save face. What do you think he'll sacrifice to save his election? He doesn't listen to experts, he doesn't believe his own intelligence agencies, and he bullied or hollowed out agencies that protect and serve the people (CDC, EPA, now the USPS, etc.). He's plowed over guardrails and destroyed democratic norms. If you don't think he'll try to put his thumb on the scale for this, you're naive.

Those of us unwilling to take a rushed and politically motivated vaccine from a serial liar understand good science, and how to properly take care of ourselves and families.  I am pro-vaccines and anti-Trump lies.  That means I won't take his vaccine.  Period."
2020-08-03 12:14:22,"Doesn’t trump realize that people won’t get the vaccine if they don’t trust it?  Just like they won’t vote for him because they don’t trust him.  And then the infections will continue to go up.  Oh, I forgot, this is all about him and not us."
2020-08-03 12:37:37,"I'm sure that once a vaccine is available, it will be total chaos.

2020-08-03 12:22:17,Has anyone else noticed how the stock prices of companies publicizing their vaccine research have risen quickly? Moderna was around 20 for most of last year and recently is closer to 70. It obviously pays to make big splashy announcements about the success of your research.
2020-08-03 12:27:35,"When the FDA is ready to approve the first vaccine, President Trump should demonstrate his leadership by making the nationally televised announcement in the Oval Office and ceremonially taking the first dose himself.  He can take full credit for Operation Warp Speed and reassure the public of the vaccine safety."
2020-08-03 12:28:30,"Doesn't really matter if a vaccine is found before the election, trump will announce a miracle cure in Mid October. Since when did truth or facts ever hamper him?"
2020-08-03 12:20:32,"The need for an ""October Surprise"" is probably one of the reasons that the Republicans want to provide corporate liability protection in their corona virus relief bill.  The possible (likely?) scenario is that company X produces a vaccine with promising results and the FDA ramrods its approval for distribution before the election.  Trump then runs on the fact that HE developed a corona virus vaccine to save the country.  Trump gets re-elected, the vaccine is shown to have harmful side effects and it is withdrawn from the market.  Company X is then protected from lawsuits by the people who suffered from the side effects, and/or the families of those who died because of the vaccine."
2020-08-03 12:29:01,"Operation Warp Speed is a strategy launched in the very good brain of Donald Trump. He has provided $billions in seed/bribe money; appointed a senior officer of a vaccine manufacturer to the task force; given the companies the incentive to report on progress and reap the rewards of soaring stock prices.
But several viable vaccines may be developed, with an efficacy sufficient to blunt the spread of the virus. Trump is actually not looking to bring a vaccine to market before Election Day. He wants the papers, news channels and social media flooded with stories about how successful the various trials are. And whether the drug companies can deliver a vaccine in “warp speed” or ever they certainly can  be the bearer of great news for Trump as they cash in on soaring market values.
The scourge of polio has been virtually eliminated; Dr.Salk worked for years until he unleashed the terror of booster shots on crying first graders. He waived his royalties.
We live in different times; it’s Trump’s world now; it’s all pay to play. Success will be measured in votes for Trump; profits for drug companies, and a few vaccines that will blunt the contagion which will linger for years."
2020-08-03 12:20:18,"If you really want to know how vaccines are brought to the marketplace you must read Dr. Ezekiel Emmanuel. In 3 different books he explains in lay terms how complicated and difficult the process to bring a safe effective vaccine for public use is. If you think there are some anti vaccine groups out there now imagine if trump pushes a vaccine to get out early mainly to help his reelection the number of americans who will not go near that vaccine would be astronomical. It takes at minimum 18- 24 months of vigorous testing after  vigorous development process for a vaccine to be classes as ""safe"". Then again no one should be surprised at trumps actions. He is always on the wrong side of science."
2020-08-03 12:25:39,"All our naysayers, go on and fret about neglected safety and the project's impact on Trump's re-election chances. No one will be forced to receive a Covid vaccine against their will, nor will clinical trials stop under an emergency use authorization if one is granted. Young skeptics who can afford to play dice with this virus can gain the advantages of later, better data by waiting an extra year or two if they choose.

The US has already experienced a vaccine fiasco within living memory, in the rare Guillain-Barre syndrome affecting teens after the 1976 swine flu campaign, yet uptake of other immunizations has remained fine ever since. The anti-vaxxers focused on purported  links to autism instead, citing mercury but not the questionable flu shot in its pitches.

Fact is, if our country doesn't have a choice anyhow, does it really matter why that's so? I'm more worried about surviving in good health to January 20 than I am about the election results. A new vaccine will have been tested for safety, immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy in animals and several tens of thousands of volunteers before being offered to the public. If and when it is, I'll be at the clinic to get it."
2020-08-03 12:26:36,"There will really be only one chance of getting the public to accept an emergency vaccine.   If it goes wrong, the public won't give it a second chance"
2020-08-03 12:29:51,"The Trump Administration has devoted federal resources to advance vaccines and therapies in a way it hasn't geared up for testing, contact tracing, and urging people to wear masks. This is consistent with Trump's general message that his supporters find so attractive: ""You are entitled to whatever this country has to offer, without taking any personal responsibility. You can blame dark-skinned minorities for whatever is bothering you, and I alone can fix it."" Vaccines and therapies require no effort on our part, while the other remedies require everyone to work together, which is not in Trump's playbook.

Unless vaccine developers take the highly unethical step of deliberately exposing those receiving an experimental vaccine or placebo to Covid-19, I don't see how effectiveness can be proven in just a few short months."
2020-08-03 12:39:07,"An under appreciated aspect of the scientific enterprise is surfacing as critical to progress in COVID19 prevention and treatment which is that of data analysis. How to design trials that determine whether a treatment or a vaccine is effective by producing sufficient data of appropriate caliber is one key aspect of that challenge? Doctors, scientists, public health officials and even drug companies outsource much of this data analysis work and usually  lack the expertise to analyze what comes back in. The same even holds true for the most prestigious medical journals whose peer review process is light on such expertise. One consequence of this deficiency is waste, fraud and abuse leading to public harm when the conclusions from scientific research rest on faulty data analysis.  Docs on the front lines are arguing with public health officials about hydroxychloroquine. Lives are at stake. A prominent epidemiologist from Yale well versed in data analysis states it works when given early. Dr. Fauci states it’s ineffective. Most doctors lack the skills to analyze the existing data themselves from clinical studies that are fraught with methodological problems. Remdesivir does what?

And should that happen, and unsafe drug, Trump will fire someone, more people will die due to the virus and some to stupidity of providing an unsafe vaccine.

I can hunker down, wear masks and gloves, and wait for something safe and effective and Trump’s quest to further flush the country down the commode in a second term be damned.

For once, I ask our elected politicians in the House and Senate, and the handful of governors who fear Trump, let scientists do their jobs without interference or politics.  We already know the results of political meddling."

Jared Kushner's secret national testing plan that went poof:

""Most troubling of all, perhaps, was a sentiment the expert said a member of Kushner’s team expressed: that because the virus had hit blue states hardest, a national plan was unnecessary and would not make sense politically. “The political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to Democratic states, that they could blame those governors, and that would be an effective political strategy,” said the expert.

That logic may have swayed Kushner. “It was very clear that Jared was ultimately the decision maker as to what [plan] was going to come out,” the expert said.""

A vaccine which many experts originally indicated would take 1 year to 18 months if not longer will now magically appear in a matter of months, miraculously before the Nov 3 election. Americans have yet to hear the truth, obtain transparency, cooperation, guidance and assurances from Trump and the White House and now they are talking about an “operation warp speed” cure. While the entire country and world is in disarray, Trump is playing politics with American lives and undermining our scientists while at the same time stripping our Democracy every chance he gets. 

There are many in government as well as millions of Americans who are complicit, have sidestepped their responsibilities to the Nation and twisted the facts in support of the lunatic we have as President.

Then, when a vaccine is thoroughly vetted,  when the scientists at the CDC and experts at the FDA tell us that the vaccine is safe and has been vetted thoroughly I will take it.

Then there is the Trump factor. He wants a vaccine by October, that would be perfect for him. He can claim victory over the virus, be reelected and safely back in the white house before anyone knows whether it works, whether it causes side effects. People who distrust trump will make the most of this.

2020-08-03 12:47:18,There are too many compounded failures of this administration in the health care field with regard to the pandemic to put much trust in rapid vaccine development before the November election. The integrity of the developers is likely unquestionable but it must be taken into account that Trump is a grifter and and many of those who do his bidding do not sparkle with integrity. Hail Mary passes in football fail more often than they succeed but the failure of a rapidly developed vaccine can harm humans.

2020-08-03 12:49:29,"There is no doubt that a timely vaccine is absolutely essential at this time. It will be useless if we wait for the Coronavirus 2 to leave our planet alone, on its own. During the last swine flu pandemic in 2009, the vaccine came towards the tapering end of the pandemic after millions were infected including myself and several 1000s died. From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus.

The federal govt of the USA has poured billions into companies to deliver a safe effective vaccine not candidates that cannot be tested to the satisfaction of the FDA. Money talks but the FDA cannot let it talk. The ultimate decision makers will be we the people. If the people do not buy into the value proposition and risk benefit ratio of taking the vaccine then any shoddy work will meet with resistance. Just like I was never going to allow treatment by hydroxychloroquine in case I was on my death bed with COVID-19, even if almighty God told me that it is the only life saver left. Same goes with the Moderna vaccine candidate, I will never take it because it is not previously tested concept for long term adverse effects. I am not going to be a guinea pig for an unproven vaccine and I am not going to be a placebo. I have been in observational trials where I knew possible health benefits."

2020-08-03 12:51:09,Scientists.... Politicians.... People. This is NOT about Trump. Ignore the man. Due diligence and adequate testing are absolutely necessary to develop a safe vaccine.

2020-08-03 12:52:24,"To be fair, science is rarely separate from politics. It starts with presumptions on methods, context and what you care about. It involves a LOT of money, and increasingly an implied consensus of what is best for all. It's easy to imagine someone who sees COVID19 as a low threat or low interest, and is uninterested by it, and they do not have to be against science. Many people may not get a vaccine because its not interesting, nor a priority, nor do they endorse to politics of the shutdown nor the expense it takes for this task."
2020-08-03 13:05:31,"Not only should we be worried about government pressure to short cut the approval process, but we should also be concerned about the validity of the data released by both this government and the private drug companies.  Remember that White House contracts have gone to Trump supporters and companies with direct ties to this administration’s cabinet.  Private companies often keep their data private as proprietary information.  Their studies are often not peer reviewed or published openly again for financial patent reasons.  Hopefully our scientific community will stand up to both political and economic pressure from the government and private drug companies.  If they do not safeguard the process, the antivaxers will be emboldened to refuse immunization when it is effective and real."
2020-08-03 13:06:21,"The Federal Government allowed a few of the current vaccines in development to bypass the liability of Phase 2 testing and go the Phase 3. With that being said, any vaccine that is delivered before Phase 3 testing is complete is not a sound choice for human use. As a physician, I would love to have an effective vaccine tomorrow but that is not safe for my patients. If a vaccine is not safe, it could cause far worse human and economic tragedy than this virus has already caused. Politics is getting what one wants but the reality of this virus is that it does not care about politics and wants. Hypothetically, if we had a vaccine tomorrow, it would still take time to make sure that people are protected from this virus which means weeks. Make no mistake, to inject millions of people with any vaccine that has not completed Phase 3 testing is playing Russian Roulette with human lives. If a vaccine is pushed out in October, it will not have completed Phase 3 testing which means that it will not be safe."

And, if all that is not enough, the drug companies are planning to profit as well!"
2020-08-03 13:02:00,"This type of reporting is irresponsible. Presenting a possibility, which would require a great number of scientists and career administrators to act deeply unethically, as a fact and thereby undermining confidence in the vaccine that is yet to be developed is a great disservice to public health. There are already plenty of anti-vaxxers out there on both the left and the right. Why add fuel to the fire? Come back with reporting of actual interference and concerns about the development of the vaccine.

Your last paragraph should have been your first, so people that base their views and beliefs on headlines rather than a thoughtful consideration of facts don't rush to their facebook pages to make another breathless post about how they can't trust this administration with anything.

Dr. Fauci has expressed confidence that the system will hold.

2020-08-03 13:05:20,Everyone should understand that Trump wants us to be told there will be a vaccine in October.  He does not care if there is an actual proven vaccine.  Just like we were told he would turn over his tax returns and Mexico would pay for the wall.  Trump would love to announce a 'beautiful' vaccine will be available to anyone who wants it in October.  Come November 4 it will disappear.  Please don't be fooled again by this con man.

I don’t believe in the hocus-pocus spouted by those who cannot provide empirical evidence. I also believe there is much modern medicine can learn from the past and homeopathy.

I will not accept the politicizing of this vaccine. The deadline to find a proven vaccine is not Election Day or any other artificial time constraint. The deadline is when the vaccine is proven to work. I understand there is a tremendous pressure to find a vaccine for COVID-19 and its ability to stop this pandemic. If and when there is a vaccine rushed to market I will not be first in line, or second or third or ......

Instead I will wait and see its effects on the population over a period of time determined by me and listen to the independent scientists, medical experts and Dr. Fauci. I will not listen to a politician."

This is an unprecedented time and the first vaccine in the U.S. is recruiting 30,000 volunteers for the last phase (phase 3) of testing before seeking approval from the FDA. Since I understand some models have forecast possibly 15,000-300,000 new deaths before the new year Operation Warp Speed is imperative. Politicizing this, as a few scientists may be doing, is a disservice to those at risk. We need this vaccine yesterday.

Now we have the most corrupt, self-serving president in history who only cares about himself and his reelection and is spreading lies like wildfire.  Don't think he won't do anything to force enough people in his administration, including the FDA commissioner, to push through a vaccine, any vaccine, before it's ready, if it's ready.  Besides, a vaccine is not the magic solution to this out of control pandemic.  It does not eliminate overnight the need to continue with significant public health measures.  We are in this for the long haul.  No one can have any confidence in anything coming out of the Trump administration.  We must hold on until they are all voted out of office in November.  And they MUST be voted out."
2020-08-03 13:15:22,"A rational person would hedge their bets by investing as much money as necessary, regardless of cost, to create the necessary infrastructure (and supplies) to ramp up daily testing to levels dictated by science to get the upper hand containing the spread of the coronavirus (collecting samples, turnaround times of 24 hours and a sophisticated, rapid tracing capability) at maximum warp 7 speed (best I can remember from 1966).  I’ve read the absolute minimum should be 2,000,000/day but 3 to 4,000,000/day being optimal.  That’s a goal achievable in a much shorter time period and would have been operational months ago if Trump began the initiative early in the year."

This goes towards gross negligence from Republicans who themselves have received a paycheck but find the American People who are in hardship do not deserve such. Presently at least 20 Republican Senators will not support any form of stimulus as they feel it may not be needed and will only contribute to a higher deficit. During this pandemic, we have seen the Republican Party shirk it's duty to the people, they have provided monies for Pharmaceuticals, for large corporations and the wealthy, this is known, what else have they done that the taxpayer is not aware of? Mnuchin feels that providing a $600.00 weekly unemployment bonus would discourage employment, which seems incredulous considering that due to this unforeseen pandemic jobs are few, yet rent, mortgage, food, utilities, clothing has not taken a break from monthly budgets. You need wonder is Russia's untested vaccine being considered by Trump in order to give false reassurance for his re-election? The only certainty that there presently is, is the fact that too many Americans are being infected, too many have died, too many are being disadvantaged, too many are vulnerable and this is not Partisan, the concerns regarding Schools and a second wave are real as they should be."

The developers of the vaccine lack production facilities. As I understand the WarpSpeed concept, HHS pays for pharma to scale up and produce vaccines that may work, but pharma takes no risk. They get paid whether or not the the deliverable product works. End result = profits for big pharma.

HHS decides whether the vaccines are working well enough. No doubt citizen T will make the final decision.  Putin has already decided that health workers in Russia will be among the first to receive the Russian version of the vaccine. That makes it very easy for T to decide.

End result = a win for citizen P, citizen T,  legal persons, oligarchs, and major shareholders in big pharma.

Guess who the losers will be, for there are certain to be those who don't tolerate the vaccine well and errors in production and distribution. We won't know the results until tests are completed down the road, but by then the war will be over.

This is how wars are won or lost, you build planes and ships from the plans you have on the drawing boards, and fight with the army you have, not the army you want to have."
2020-08-03 13:38:51,"Because the FDA approved emergency use of hydroxychloroquine, apparently because Trump advocated its use, no vaccine they approve can be trusted.
If a vaccine is approved by German health authorities, then it is likely effective and safe.  But, until the US has a trustworthy administration, no coronavirus vaccine released here can be considered reliable.  And the result of Trump's FDA possibly approving a vaccine that has minimal effectiveness and/or serious side effects will be an even worse situation."
2020-08-03 13:32:09,This is exactly why I will only trust Dr. Fauci. Until he gives his approval I will not get the vaccine.
2020-08-03 13:32:43,"I am old with a compromised immune system, but I will wait for a European or Chinese accepted vaccine before I will quit my isolation.

2020-08-03 13:37:05,"Trump, Kushner and Navarro put on this warp speed vaccine effort.  What could go wrong?
Americans do not deserve to be political guinea pigs for his reelection.  We have been through enough.
The 157,000 Americans dead from COVID-19.  Most would be alive today if warp speed had been applied in February when the virus first showed up.  
This reeks of politics.
To use trump's words; HOAX!"
2020-08-03 13:31:50,"White House officials said that Mr. Trump would not distort the vaccine review process to help his campaign.

Scary. This administration cannot be trusted with our health and safety."
2020-08-03 13:31:33,"“We would consider using an emergency use authorization if we felt that the risks associated with the vaccine were much lower than the risks of not having a vaccine.” During a pandemic this is a low bar. And when some die from the vaccine — even if fewer than from (an ineptly dealt with) virus — the anti vaxxers will get an unbelievable boost. In the face of future resistance to vaccination many people will die from measles, polio, and the next coronavirus. Trump again is putting his short term interests above the welfare of the US."
2020-08-03 13:35:20,"Vital to ensure that FDA holds a form outside expert advisory committee hearing (& vote) to review the clinical safety and efficacy data independently before issuing ANY approvals - emergency or otherwise. With the collapse of credibility of the CDC under Trump, the FDA has to be under a spotlight. Hydroxychloroquine emergency approval was an early warning signal. We don’t want a repeat of the polio vaccine Cutter tragedy - on a potentially much larger scale - just so Trump gets a re-election talking point."
2020-08-03 13:31:26,"I too worry about political influence on the vaccine question.

One reason is the Food and Drug Administration issued and ""emergency"" approval for use of hycoxychloroquine after Trump touted it.

Another is the change of the Centers for Disease and Control Board of their guidelines for reopening of schools to reflect Trump's views.

Still another is the ouster of whistle blower Rick Bright from his position in charge of vaccine development and replacement by a political appointee."

2020-08-03 13:43:21,"It's ridiculous & tragic that all of Trump's decisions are based on his re-election agenda. I believe that he doesn't even like the job as he has continually shown no interest in 'growing into the job'. He spends all his time cultivating & holding on to his cult-like supporters. Trump's main desire for re-election is so that he can continue to enjoy the protection from criminal charges that the office of the presidency gives him.  Of course he knows that the NY State Attorney Office has proof of his illegal hush payments to his 2 mistresses plus his illegal tax evasion & likely his money laundering for Russians (and possibly others). 
Eventually history will expose all of his crimes but he'll likely never be imprisoned as any trial will drag on & on then he'll appeal any guilty decisions for years."
2020-08-03 13:44:13,"Trump has a fervent base who would self-inject Chlorox if he advised it (and some have!). Vaccine or no vaccine, they will vote for him.

For undecided voters, I question whether approval of a vaccine in October would translate into approval for Trump, after everything else he has put them through. I certainly hope not. 

But, would Trump foist a bogus vaccine onto the US public in hopes of getting elected? Yes, of course. That's not even a question!"
2020-08-03 13:45:12,"The wealthy elites care only about one thing - removing Trump from office.  They have no concern for the poor or suffering, or how many will die so they can delay progress on a vaccine for political advantage."
2020-08-03 13:38:42,The article makes it sound as though Trump was offered two responses to the coronavirus:  follow health experts on testing and contact tracing and quarantining or believe in fairies and hope to get a vaccine by October.  Trump chose the latter.  Is it pure coincidence that Putin is also pushing to get a vaccine by October?
2020-08-03 13:39:14,Everyone hopes for safe effective vaccines. At the same time it’s clear that Jared Kushner and his associates want to make an announcement in October and will stop at almost nothing to do that.

2020-08-03 13:41:42,"Of course an effective, safe vaccine wouldn't be a game-changer (and when rushed to meet a political deadline can't be guaranteed to be either safe or effective). What Trump & Co. fail to understand is that 10s of 1000s have *needlessly* died as a result of Trump's failure at leadership and governance. Millions have suffered unemployment and underemployment, facing shelter and food insecurity, as a result of Trump's incompetence.

A vaccine is what is needed; however, one shouldn't expect to receive accolades and awards for meeting the requirements of a job -- a ""participant ribbon"" if you will -- one receives accolades and awards for going above and beyond.

But then, this is a president who boasts about having passed a mental competence test that is used to determine whether dementia and intellectual impairment are present."
2020-08-03 13:43:22,Knowing that Trump will be involved in the vaccine assures us that it will be politicized so that he will be in the media cycle.  He'll be taking all of the credit for the vaccine.

It is after all, largely driven by funding of organizations like FDA, NIH and CDC which are affected by the administration is in power. But the quality of scientific research and the veracity behind it's products must be controlled and determined by the scientists and not politicians. When that is not the case, science becomes a sham and worse, dangerous.

It would be ironic and tragic if a vaccine for coronavirus turned out to have unacceptably dangerous side effects and the anti-vaxxers were proven correct."
2020-08-03 13:00:34,"Seems pretty obvious to me. Putin is going ahead with mass vaccinations in October. Trump is likely to simply grab the Russian formula, whip out a couple of million, and dole it out in October."
2020-08-03 14:17:52,"I'm a physician and if anyone thinks I'm gonna be first in line for this vaccine, think again. Operation Warp Speed is not the way to produce a vaccine, this is a concoction for disaster. Long term studies are in place for a reason, in order to assure the safety and effective delivery of a vaccine. Even when long term studies appear to be safe and reliable, they often fail with disastrous effects. And it's not simply the vaccine, there are production and distribution errors, including effects of temperature, storage and the type of distribution bottles necessary. The effects of any vaccine must be studied on a variety of individuals, adults, children, races, those with underlying conditions, smokers, those who are over-weight, those take certain medications. This takes years ... it's far better to learn to live with this virus safely than to rush a vaccine.  PPE's for all citizens would be far better at this stage."
2020-08-03 14:23:19,As far as I am concerned the release date of a vaccine(s) is of little interest compared to the requirement that vaccine(s) be BOTH effective and safe.  I'm in the at risk group based on age and will NOT be vaccinated early in the public release (thank you I'll wait 4-6 weeks to be sure all is well) and will NOT trust any comments from any Trump administration source with the possible exception of Dr. Fauci.
2020-08-03 13:46:06,"Without question Trump will do anything possible to have a vaccine before the election.  Even if the vaccine is not fully available, Trump will shamelessly lie about it just as he does with Covid testing."

This encapsulates the lazy anti-intellectualism and scientific illiteracy of the the trumpublican party - characterizing a carefully conceived scientific process for developing and testing vaccines as just a bunch of silly boxes to check.  I will wait until President Biden and a majority Democratic Congress is in place in 2021 for credible information on progress against COVID.  I wouldn't receive ""treatment"" from this most corrupt administration for all the money in the world."
2020-08-03 13:54:49,"It is impossible to prove any of these vaccines effective by the end of October.  However, Trump will declare that he has the vaccine, no matter what reality is - that has always worked with his minions and I am sure it will again.  It will be past the election before people realize he is lying.  I hope there are some career people in government with enough integrity that they will resign in protest.  It will be catastrophic to get people to think they are protected, when they are not."

He lies about everything, and we know Trump wants nothing more than his ""magic bean"" solution to this pandemic.  He's holding children hostage to his re-election campaign by forcing schools to reopen lest they lose funding.  He would certainly roll out an unproven and unsafe ""vaccine"" if he thought it would lead to a second term, and promote it like it was Trump Wine or Trump Steak.  I am not willing to have my health held hostage, too."
2020-08-03 13:51:53,"To all scientists working on vaccines: Please just say NO! to any pressure to rush your work.

A botched first vaccine is not just going to destroy confidence in any subsequently released problem-free and effective Coronavirus vaccines, but it will bolster the general anti-vaxxing movement in a way that nothing else could.

Just when there is some hope after so much terror and tragedy, we are told that the vaccines may be dangerous after all, rushed when not yet ready, rushed when questions remain.  Anti-vaxxers are likely copying this article to circulate among their like-minded friends.   And those on the fence, will be pushed off and decide to give in to their fears.  A more helpful and balanced article would give prominence instead to what may make the process and the vaccines credible and safe.  Consideration, for instance, is not given to some of the novel candidate vaccines which may not require the same length of development time as vaccines of the past.  Brief notation that reputation of vast drug companies and their product lines are at stake is made at the end of the article but that is hardly enough to provide balance."

It goes down to Trump's level, that is, to the gossip of the corner bar.  Try to report,in quotes, Dr. Fauci's cautious statements about the vaccine.  And stop, in the name of an indispensable sobriety.  Your ability to influence public opinion can be just as dangerous as Trump’s tweets “I talked to the FDA”.   Please, leave “our” sanitary sanctuary out of this mess. or there will be nothing left to believe in."
2020-08-03 13:49:36,"The slipshod approach to developing a critically needed vaccine for Covid-19 as described in this article is another example of how American society is continuing its rapid slide into a dystopian future in which political advantage and profiteering completely replace any concern for the public good.  Not only will the anti-vaccine gang seek to capitalize on any complications with an improperly tested vaccine, but the millions of Americans and global citizens, who would normally embrace the benefits of vaccines, will also become skeptical of the public health institutions that purport to be acting in our best interests.  It is incomplete to simply blame trump for this.  Our path toward moral corruption began well before he showed up and is a direct result of the corporate greed that has been sparing no expense to influence our government on their own behalf.  We have to address the destructive role of money in our politics or we won’t survive it."
2020-08-03 14:02:17,"What worries me the most is the possibility of Trump and his associates to make the vaccination mandatory among the public.

2020-08-03 14:16:33,"Speculative articles like this have become a NYT staple.  What might Trump do if given the chance?

But here—so far—Operation Warp Speed seems to be doing the right things.  With career bureaucrats and scientists (ie predate Trump), military logistics chiefs, and industry experts who actually develop vaccines (the government doesn’t, it oversees tests) all on board.

So far so good.  And with thousands dying every day around the world, this should move fast to save lives.  The Pharma industry is ramped up as never before. The early involvement of military logistics experts is smart. And not every potential vaccine needs to pass the tests.

TDR is a real thing.  What will the NYT say if an early vaccine actually works well?  Who wants to speculate?"
2020-08-03 14:19:22,"Dr. Birx has been very clear in supporting safety measures to minimize the impact of the virus, but she has been totally unpersuasive within the White House in making her views official policy.  DJT has been unfettered in his campaign against public health; Dr. Birx’s statements have only given Trump more leeway to tweet about unsafe practices and to play golf instead of attending to the nation’s business.  The country needs federal mandates for masks and social distancing to halt the spread of COVID-19, not just statements of personal opinion.  

Tens of thousands have died needlessly because of the Administration’s failure to act. As it stands, Dr. Birx is just a member of the supporting cast, singing “Anything You Can Do.”  Trump tweets, “I can do anything better than you,” and she responds, Oh, no you can’t.”  Dr. Birx’s reputation already is in tatters.  She should resign immediately and continue to speak out with increased vigor as a private citizen."

Trumps handling of foreign affairs has our enemies laughing and our allies troubled. Our allies want to be our allies but Trump is doing everything he can, intentional or not, to destroy our relationships.

Trump has shown repeatedly that his campaign promises were just wiffs of hot air, said to get elected. He has either ignored his promises or failed to deliver on his promises.

Trump, and his lackey's have correputed or tried to corrupt every institution in our government. His ignoring of the peoples uprising against racism and police brutality showed him for the horrible President he is.

So don't just focus on the pandemic. Sure his fumbling of that cost us untold billions and many ten's of thousands of lives. It's a big deal, horrible and is almost criminal but if a vaccine is ready in October, and it works, his handling of the pandemic will be forgotten.

We  are seeing the result in the horrendous death toll and subsequent damage to the entire economy by the sophomoric decisions made by the politicians in the Trump administration and the Republicans in the federal and state governments who have followed the ignorant decisions made by Trump and his Republican supporters. America has been diminished for decades because the electoral college selected Donald Trump, the loser in the 2016 election, as the president. Instead of a leader when we most needed one. we got a political clown act played by a failed casino owner.

The strong emphasis is this article is on politics, and the scientific scrutiny is understated. This is a mistake.  Whether we call the US project ""warp speed"" or something else, we need to do everything possible encourage the rapid development, and necessary testing of safe vaccines effective against the novel corona virus.

Aside from the difficulty of developing the vaccine itself, the pressure to release it to the public prior to the election, demanded by a man obsessed with ratings, is too much for me to feel secure with any product released too quickly.  Testing takes time and cannot be rushed.  The consequences of doing so will create an unimaginably dangerous situation."

2. Vaccine might be impossible for COVID (no vaccine for the common cold).
3. Vaccine will increase sensitivity to COVID and increase the death rate.
4. Vaccine will lead to future disease (example: chickenpoxs causes shingles many years latter).
5. Due to the new technologies involved with the production of a vaccine, a secondary ingredient in the making of the vaccine will cause illness and death.
6. Faculty production of the vaccine (contamination) will cause wide spread illness and death.

It was later reported that in order to get President Trumps attention away from re-election into forming some sort of strategy, was that he was told that it was “our people” who were being severely inflicted with a up swing of reported cases in Red states.

They are truly soulless."
2020-08-03 14:58:18,"Why do all reports describe a vaccine as BOTH ""safe and effective,"" or as NEITHER? Is it possible that a vaccine will be proven to be ""safe"" but not yet proven to be ""effective?"" 

If that possibility exists (i.e., proven ""safe"" but not yet proven ""effective""), why would a physician NOT advise his or her patients to take that vaccine? I wouldn't change my BEHAVIOR after taking a vaccine unless the vaccine had been proven ""effective,"" but why wait if the vaccine has been proven ""safe"" and it may later be proven ""effective"" too? True, if a vaccine has not yet been proven ""safe,"" or if a vaccine has been proven ""safe"" but has also been proven ""ineffective"", no patient should be advised to take the vaccine, nor should a physician advise a patient to take any vaccine whose ""effectiveness"" has not been established if the physician believes the patient may change his or her behavior before the vaccine is proven ""effective."" But (apart from that entirely legitimate concern that a vaccine-taker may change his or her behavior prematurely) if a vaccine has been proven ""safe"" and the jury is still out on the ""effective"" question, why would any doctor NOT advise his or her patient to take that vaccine? After all, the vaccine might later be proven also to be ""effective,"" in which case an early vaccine-taker will be wise to have taken it early -- it might have prevented the patient from contracting COVID-19.

This seems like a ""no brainer"" to me. Am I missing something?"

The biggest interest of vaccine development and its clinical trial should be American people's health and safety. But the current administration's interest is, apparently his re-election. I don't have trust on how things will be evaluated based on our interest, but on his interest. And he has shown us again and again that he's willing to ""warp"" the facts if it serves his interests, and I don't see why and how vaccine development will be different from his COVID19 handling."
2020-08-03 15:32:12,"As someone who worked with medical researchers for many years, for me this push to put out a COVID vaccine raises numerous alarms. Production of any pharmaceutical product involves a rigorous process in both development and testing stages. Particularly, as it addresses a drug’s potential side effects both short and long term. This testing customarily demands clinical trials of specific classification be carried out according to strictly established protocol and its data collected and scrupulously evaluated. This can’t be rushed but demands years of committed effort not months. Into this medical/scientific paradigm is now intruded the politics of the Trump administration. The development of a vaccine seen less about health and more of a calculated political device. Having  the anticipated potential to cast President Trump as the hero who saved the day. And one who deserves election to a second term. In this type of environment what America and by extension the world could end up with, if an  old adage applies, is a cure worse than the disease."

If it is out there too early I likely will wait to see what the reality is before personally agreeing to the vaccine. I think there seems to be a failure to involve the public on how they may feel. Success can only be measured by involving all parties."

The October surprise that MIGHT happen would be Putin’s release of some of the kompromat he has on Trump, as a means of payback to the man who didn’t cripple NATO, didn’t get Putin added to the G7, turned the covert Ukraine deal with Zelensky into a worldwide embarrassment, and didn’t eliminate the US’s economic sanctions on Russia.

THAT is the October surprise to wish for, and it just may happen. 

The kompromat Putin has on Trump, that makes Trump Putin’s lap dog, will all get exposed sooner or later - they both must know that - and since Trump is now useless to Putin, Putin may decide to flex his muscles about two months from now, to show that Trump was his puppet all along: doing so would significantly help Putin’s public image and approval ratings in Russia, which are now at historic lows."

However that will not affect my November vote, whatever the status of vaccine research come election time.  President Trump has already lost my vote.

He is not responsible for the virus.  What happened early in the year, as the virus hit our shores, would have happened regardless of who was President.

But he is responsible for the lack of leadership in the response to the virus.  First, he lied about the impact, and continually suggested it would soon go away.  Rather than lead the Nation, as a President of all Americans, he punted the job to the states, and then proceeded to undermine their efforts (""liberate Michigan!"").  He has fought with and minimized respected scientists and balked at the value of testing.  Harry Truman, the ""buck stops here"" President, must be spinning in his grave over the lack of leadership.

Those are the things that will drive my November vote.  I will cheer and applaud development of a vaccine, important for us all.  But this incompetent President lost my vote long ago."

Articles like this that use disparate reasons to cast doubt on the total process without any proof of wrongdoing simply lends credence to the notion that the press is going to criticize the President no matter what he does, and that a main goal of their reporting on the pandemic has always been to use it as a cudgel to bash a man that they despise."

Instead, words like ""hoax"" and ""disappearing"",  ""I dont need to wear a mask"" began to trend.  This administration and especially the Trump family care about no one except for themselves.   I dont trust a vaccine whose management from testing, to production to implementation is being led by this White House.  I'm not getting a vaccine touted by politicians and the republican party  who ignored a historic pandemic to score political points. I am getting my vaccine in Europe when one becomes available if we are able to travel to Europe in the near future."

It ought to be clear by now to anyone sentient that Trump cares not one iota about how many people a faulty vaccine would kill if it stands even a tiny chance of improving his political prospects.

It's weird that we're where we're at, but I'm at the point where I hope such a vaccine is NOT developed in the United States because I do not trust our regulatory agencies to have the public - and not Trump's - interest as their top priority."

Yet I see only one statement that a scientist from the University of Pennsylvania is ""really worried"". Why is he concerned? The vaccine candidates have been shown to be safe in early stage trials. Phase 3 trials will provide further evidence of safety, but will not rule out rare adverse reactions (and these will happen with any vaccine no matter how many long it is studied). This article raises concerns without citing reasons and will only inappropriately raise vaccine anxiety."
2020-08-03 15:15:51,"I suspect it is not a vaccine the democrats that should have the democrats worried, they should worry about a bridge to a vaccine - antibody therapies.  There are several phase III trials for antibody therapies and likely will be available by early fall."

During frequent national shortages, the vaccine became a political issue, as did it's safety, but there was always a clinical track record for all parties to rely on. Not so, with any Corona virus vaccine. How convenient that Mr. Putin is (again) providing political cover to a struggling Mr. Trump, this time by giving him a miraculous early distribution example to point to. And I'm sure our trusted enemy will declare and promise his haphazard vaccine is safe and effective. If I were not fully awake, I would be sure I was dreaming in Science Fiction."

(Let's forget for a moment about the laughability of the pharma industry keeping things you can grow in your own backyard away from you), without feeding into it by rushing a vaccine to market?

I worked for 9 years developing electronic case report forms and data collection standards for oncology trials for a large pharmaceutical company.  There's a reason drug development takes as long as it does.  We all know that if a vaccine is released too soon and there turn out to be terrible adverse events that were not caught early because of inadequate testing, it's not Trump who's going to take the hit. And every time a pharmaceutical product goes bad, it's not just a public health nightmare, but a PR one that feeds into the conspiracy believers and foments distrust in the process.

There should be no shortcuts, particularly not shortcuts that are only in the service of getting an incompetent and corrupt president re-elected."

Did they not hear his answers to a number of questions regarding efficacy AND safety of the vaccine process. He says that safety is not being compromised in this process and that there has been no interference from the Administration to shortcut safety for expediency. If you adhere to what Dr. Fauci has been saying to this point, are you all now doubting him?"

Now you're telling us that Operation WARP Speed project is putting American lives at risk because it is cutting through bureaucratic red tape.

Anyone who has dealt with the FDA knows that their prime directive since the thalidomide tragedy (yes, another Star Trek reference) is not to get needed drugs to patients, but to ensure that they can NEVER be BLAMED for approving a drug that has unknown side effects, no matter how many innocent lives it costs; after all the dead can't complain. This is why President Trump passed Right to Try Act law into existence on May 30, 2018. 

So once again little more than a Trump is bad and must be voted out of office column."

- What’s the efficacy of Trump’s handling of the pandemic crisis so far, with respect to cases and deaths? Answer: failure
- What’s the success of widespread testing with rapid results, logistically and medically? Answer: failure
- How effectively has the federal government distributed PPE with the healthcare, educational and first-responder sectors, and dollars to shore up the economy and families under lockdown? Answer: with chaotic ineptitude 
- How coordinated is the national messaging and communications on necessary preventive measures? Answer: poster child on the worst example
- How conflicted and corrupt is the decision making process for vaccine research and approval? Answer: as corrupt as two generations of real estate shysters, even as billions of dollars of CARES money have been pocketed by cronies
- What’s the record of any “warp speed” effort to institutionally rush mission-critical endeavors? Answer: refer to examples like the Boeing 737 Max, intel reports in advance of the Iraq war, or even New York state’s attempt to handle mass mail-in voting

And it's great that Phase 3 trials are getting underway already. What nobody accounts for is the time it will take to get enough infections to show with statistical confidence that the vaccine has prevented infection or illness. Remember, you're not trying to prove you made a sick person well; you're trying to prove you prevented a healthy person from getting sick. The numbers required are staggering. All the more difficult if trial subjects adhere (as they must) to requirements of social distance, masking, and hand-washing, which we know will minimize chances of infection. I applaud the efforts to work fast and to manufacture on a large scale completely at risk, but you simply can't rush the time course of an efficacy trial."

By rushing though a COVID vaccine without sufficient testing, you run the risk of any negative and potentially harmful side effects being associated with all vaccines, not just the untested ones, and giving anti-vaxxers more false ammunition. Not only would we not be able to successfully battle COVID, we would now be battling other previously preventable diseases at that same time."

Dem leadership doesn't give a whit about the American public.  Every comment, outrage or move they make is part of a larger political strategy.  And it comes from the top.  In his eulogy of John Lewis, Obama basically called for statehood for D.C. and Puerto Rico.  Why is he advocating this?  Because in all likelihood both would be democratic states and put 4 more democratic senators in the senate.  He did this IN A EULOGY.  He made a political push, IN A EULOGY.

The COVID cure is coming November 3rd. “We won’t need a vaccine,” Kelley assures us. “The treatment won’t be  hydroxychloroquine, and we won’t need a test to know we don’t have it,” for on election day the virus “loses its political usefulness.” If Trump wins, Kelly says, “even Democrats will know it’s time to move on, that COVID politically is a dog; they’ll have to find something else to run him out of town on.” If Biden wins, “the media will cease telling the COVID story” at the same fever pitch. “It evaporates as a story.” And Dr. Fauci will change his tune. “He won’t dare disagree with Joe Biden, for if he does, the media will not take his side.” COVID is real, Kelly insists, “but the assignment of blame is artificial.” Homelessness is also a real problem, Kelly analogizes, but it’s funny how it goes away and then returns with great force depending on which party’s in power."

He wants to be able to claim that he and his administration have been successful in developing a vaccine that will make this virus ""simply go away.""

What I never hear from his or his administration is that this vaccine MUST be proven safe and effective from the FDA BEFORE administering it to the public.""The longer that vaccines are tested before being released, the likelier they are to be safe and effective"" but the one thing Trump does NOT have is time.  The election is 13 weeks away.  There is NO way enough legitimate clinical trials can be conducted in that time period, much less by the end of the year.

This ""hurry-up-and-put-something-together-so-I-can-get re-elected"" mindset could result in many more unnecessary deaths.

It's not confidence in the public health system that is the problem here; it's confidence in the political system that is in charge of the public health system.

The Trump administration has spent 3+ years demonstrating, on every front, that nothing they say or do can be trusted. The president himself has no qualms issuing statements laden with falsehoods. And now we are to take on faith and the good will of people in this very administration that Operation Warp Speed does not have a political motivation as part of its design. From whence do we derive this faith?

It would be horrible to root for the failure of this project in order to deny Trump an election advantage while people are dying. But it would be naive to believe Judd Deere's straight faced proclamation that Trump's highest priority is the health and safety of the American people. He has clearly shown this is not the case with his response to the epidemic thus far.

What we do know is that Trump will say anything to get re-elected, because he knows what awaits him once he is Citizen Trump again.  He will lie about the vaccine, and it will not bother him at all if he puts the lives of his own voters at risk.

I have a modest proposal: should Trump announce that a vaccine has magically appeared, let him and his ardent supporters take the vaccine first.  The rest of us will await the results of this social experiment.

I don't see that scenario that far fetched due to the track record of ""accomplishments"" of this administration was anything but. Each decision since January about this pandemic has been plagued with problems, whether it be a total denial of its existence, a downplay of its deadly consequences, overpriced faulty ventilators purchased or not having enough N95 masks for medical personnel.  

In May, White House Coronavirus Task Force Coordinator, Mike Pence, stated that this group had ""flattened the curve, slowed the spread, saved lives"" as he and the administration did victory laps around the White House grounds. 

It wasn't until just last month when Florida and Texas exploded with new cases that this administration finally woke up and believed the numbers flashing across their phones and TVs.

The mere fact that ""Trump campaign advisers privately call a pre-election vaccine “the holy grail"" sends a very cold chill down my back. Clinical trials are still going on.

I am not injecting anything into my body that Trump has pressured scientists to take short cuts on.
When Fauci and other trustworthy experts say its ready to do, I will get vaccinated."
2020-08-03 15:25:01,"a major  problem with a rapidly developed vaccine for the novel corona virus is who is toutiung it: people who are on record :
1. as vaccine deniers
2. as science deniers and skeptics (ouch)
3, magic bullet seekers and not preventive measure advocates (i.e face mask opposing morons) 
4. as not having a shred of credibility left to use an effective vaccine for the good of the ENTIRE country.....and whose choices thus far have been to politicize everything about this virus (laughingly they excoriated a reporter for ""politicizing"" that absolutely stupid  congressman Louis Gohmert 's diagnosis!!)

2. Whether or not a vax is actually ready, it will be distributed, probably (and unavoidably) in small numbers at first. 

3. If the vax is not ready, the effects will be learned/felt after the election. Trump will blame everyone else if there's a problem.

I mean, after all, PC liberals are the real threat, right? Who cares about carbon, tearing up all nuclear arms treaties, and turning the US into a disaster zone, almost uniquely in the first world--if indeed we are in the first world anymore. We're not.

No, it's tearing down a Confederate statue that's really destroying America. Keep telling yourselves that."
2020-08-03 16:24:23,"Tens of thousands of innocent people have died because Trump is an ignorant egomaniac who politicized the pandemic after destroying the CDC capacity to respond to national needs. How many poisoned themselves with Clorox or Lysol on his absurd advice? How many put themselves at medical risk by taking hydroxychloroquine on Trump's ignorant advice ?

Only peer-reviewed clinical proof of efficacy of a coronavirus vaccine can be used as a gold standard for taking any vaccine, especially a vaccine produced under Trump's political pressure and financial support."

2020-08-03 17:14:07,I still won't vote for Trump or any Republican in the upcoming election. Trump is a totally corrupt person and a vaccine won't change my mind about him or any of his enablers.

„We would consider using an emergency use authorization if we felt that the risks associated with the vaccine were much lower than the risks of not having a vaccine,” 

What’s so wrong about this statement by the FDA representative? Shouldn’t this trade off consideration guide the decision, really?"
2020-08-03 17:27:38,"It is discouraging to see Trump trying to take credit for the very science he disparaged. Please, Trump supporters, look at what Trump has said and done. The Oxford vaccine is likely to be one of the first approved by the FDA. Trump had nothing to do with its development, both Oxford and AstraZeneca are European. But you can bet he will claim that he personally created the vaccine."

2020-08-03 17:20:11,"Why are so many comments below allowing Trump to control the conversation about the coronavirus vaccines and let him cloud your judgement? The career medical professionals in the Trump administration are holding out well of their independence under extremely difficult circumstances. It is well known that Trump disbanded most of Obama’s pandemic preparation task forces and cut back research funds. This included an 18% cut of NIH funding in2017. Despite that, the NIH scientists continued their research on SARS and MERS (earlier forms of coronavirus) which became part of the foundation of the potential covid vaccine it developed with Moderna in early 2020. The term “Operation Warp Speed” obscures the tremendous efforts scientists put into, long before the pandemic hit. As reported in this article, the FDA-approval is usually based on data from clinical trials and the recommendation of an independent advisory panel of outside experts. But here is this “distrust” of FDA-approved vaccines vs. those approved by foreign-countries. They are denying the tremendous efforts put up by the American scientists who have done their best despite this ignorant administration. This article also mentioned: Trump administration’s original October target has already slipped, the target has now moved to the end of the year or early 2021.  If you still somehow believe Trump is capable of messing up the FDA approval process, why don’t you just vote him out of the office on November 3?"
2020-08-03 17:21:06,"“The president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who is helping to steer the re-election campaign from the White House, is a regular participant in meetings of a board formed to oversee the vaccine effort.”

Well that’s comforting...  If it’s anything like he and his bro’s efforts to find PPE for the nation we’re doomed."
2020-08-03 17:22:07,"If there was one thing that would make me worry about taking a vaccine it would be knowing that Donald had his greasy fingers all over it’s approval process. I’m sure I’m not the only one who would lose confidence in it, and that in itself would make it even more difficult to meet the mark of herd immunity."
2020-08-03 17:20:46,"Aside from all the perfectly reasonable arguments about why the safety and efficacy of a rushed vaccine should be doubted, there is this:
If Donald Trump is trying to sell it as a product of his stable genius and his perfect handling of the pandemic, the odds are about 20,000 to 1 that it’s a lie.
It’s the reverse Midas touch."
2020-08-03 17:21:43,"The Trump Administration Medicine Show rolls on, with promising cures and elixirs for all.

2020-08-03 17:17:38,"Just another perfect example of why Trump's injecting his political commentary is non-productive and often dangerous.  Yes, we all want an effective and safe vaccine asap but because Trump has zero credibility his comments about 'warp speed' development make many very suspicious Trump will force FDA approval without convincing evidence that the vaccine is effective and safe for broad spectrum of our population.  Trump should exit the stage and let CDC lead all aspects of defeating this pandemic and development and distribution of any vaccines."

While Trump is not directly responsible for the wording and emphasis, it is patently obvious that the HHS was using that to appeal to Trump, and, possibly, made it a goal for political reasons.
Broad use of the vaccine should be based only on medical considerations.
Nevertheless, I think Nov 4 would probably be optimal for the welfare of the nation.
It seems highly unlikely to be out by then (unless political pressure is the determinant)."
2020-08-03 17:59:35,"So, you’re telling me that if I say it enough times, it doesn’t automatically become true?  In the age of information, truth has become highly subjective.

Biology, physical law - you name it!  Of course, none of it has ever been true."
2020-08-03 18:14:30,"Even if we have a safe and effective vaccine by the end of this year, it will only be capable of defeating this scourge if a sufficient number of people are willing to take it. My fear is stories like this may make the decision to take it a political one. Maybe that’s just fine for young healthy progressives who fear a successful vaccine effort will hurt their political gials. But many of us not-so-young political moderates with underlying conditions are counting on a vaccine to survive. Dr. Fauci said a few days ago the FDA was not ignoring safety protocols to rush this thing along. Maybe you have a better source than Fauci to say otherwise. Until then, I’ll take the vaccine."
2020-08-03 18:14:33,"It's not only the medical and scientific communities who are worried about this. Anyone paying attention has been concerned about it for some time. I don't know anyone, including doctors, who will take a vaccine rushed out before the election."

2020-08-03 18:27:16,"Last week, when Trump tweeted about the nutbar doctor, I believe that was an attempt to start finding doctors who will agree with anything he does. In this case it didn't work because he didn't do his homework (no surprise) and discover she has nutty theories.
He is trying to find doctors who will back him up because in October he will say, ""By executive order, I have approved the most promising vaccine, Vaccine X, to be manufactured and given to Americans. The FDA was being too slow. Too much red tape. You will get your vaccine shot in a matter of weeks.""
Some doctors in white lab coats will be standing behind him and will back him up. He needs to find these doctors now, so he can start building up public trust in them."
2020-08-03 17:48:24,"As well they should.  Remember, Dr. Hahn, FDA ""head"" ""personally approved"" the use of hydroxychloroquine, despite no confirmed scientific evidence of its efficacy against caronavirus, using the ""emergency"" excuse.  Wonder who ""convinced"" him to do that?  Why shouldn't we expect another ""emergency"" science override from Hahn, who's already demonstrated his ""flexibility""?"
2020-08-03 18:08:40,Warp speed is a bullseye effort by Trump to win reelection with a cure. BTW how come Trump is trying to force TikTok sale to a US company using phony fake security concerns.

2020-08-03 17:33:51,"Trump is so wrong. Does he think that he can wish this away? If he proceeds to encourage re-opening before there is a cure and a vaccination then the blood which is shed will be on his hands. I assure you, that will not win him the election."
2020-08-03 18:28:51,"Does anyone in their right mind think that the companies, etc. who are actively trying to develop a vaccine are only doing so because a scientifically illiterate demagogue like Trump wants them to?

Coming up with a prestigious and lucrative cure to a pandemic is probably sufficiently motivating."
2020-08-03 18:04:05,"Sadly, Trump is approaching a much-needed vaccine the same way he has approached most other policy decisions - through naked self-interest. Trump views a vaccine as a conduit to re-election, nothing more, nothing less. His blatant disregard for human life and his, “The buck stops anywhere but here” attitude have been on display since his inauguration. Dr. Slaoui’s conflict of interest reflects an administration rife with such conflicts.

If Trump can push for the rollout of a vaccine in October, he may be able to salvage his campaign. The same people who have been aggressively refusing to wear masks or socially distance (they put the “dumb” in “free-dumb”) will proclaim Trump a hero. This is all Trump cares about.

If the vaccine later proves to be ineffective or to cause terrible side effects, we won’t discover that until after the election - and Trump will once again have avoided any accountability for the neglect and dereliction of his duties."
2020-08-03 18:07:35,"Yes, there is going to be all kinds of pressure. There will be threats, empty promises, bribes, lies, corruption, careers ruined, reputations tarnished.  The important thing will be Trump's election, not the health of the nation or concerns for lives lost.

The scientists need to focus on the integrity of their work.  Sadly, that will be difficult."
2020-08-03 17:32:54,"I was hoping for an objective comparison between the traditional approach and operation Warp Speed.  Instead the article was filled with opinions.  PLEASE investigate the differences.  Are certain tasks simply shorter? are tasks being done in parallel? are tasks being eliminated?  Only then can we make an intelligent decision regarding the risk of ""rushing"" the vaccine."
2020-08-03 18:07:31,"Trump is obeying Putin's marching orders-- rushing a poorly tested vaccine for political boost. Putin is rushing a vaccine out- and he also disdained wearing a mask !
Despite O'Brian's list of cover stories- Trump has seemed to follow all Putin's directives.
America is in chaos, with worst pandemic response, collapsed economy and now- due to Russia's  FSB & GRU disinformation on social media- America is in 'partisan' conflict about everything- especially sound scientific public health strategies.
Troops killed in Afghanistan, reduced troops in Germany, retreat from arms control treaties (while claiming a BIG nuclear deal)- this O'Brian article is savvy Russian cover stories.
Rushed vaccine before November 3rd is madness and inspires maximum distrust from US citizens- thus bestowing little benefit for containing the pandemic!"
2020-08-03 18:06:05,"What's my personal choice?

1. Take an untested vaccine, promoted by a president in whom I have absolutely no trust and still promotes debunked hydroxychloroquine. The rushed vaccine may or may not have unintended side effects or could inadvertently give me COVID-19 disease or worse just kill me. Regardless of the outcome of the vaccine, buddies of the president are profiting enormously. I cannot trust it with my life.

2. Stay safely alive in lockdown, wearing my mask when I have to go out for food and medicine, for another couple of months. When the CDC and FDA under President Biden recommend a vaccine, I'll seriously consider it. I do take all other recommended vaccines, such as the flu.

I'll chose option 2. I will not take a political vaccine."
2020-08-03 18:16:36,"WOW.

Calling a vaccine that is not even out of the test tube much less the lab yet ""the holy grail"" and an ""October surprise"" should be sounding off loud alarms rather than the giddiness of ""a lot of people on the inside of this process.""

2020-08-03 17:48:42,"Politically, Trump doesn't need for a vaccine to be developed by October. What he needs is to be able to claim a vaccine has been developed. What do you bet he actually makes that claim, no matter what the experts say?

I don't know about you, but I would not be willing to take a vaccine that Trump proclaims effective just before the election, any more than I would be willing to take any of the other bogus cures he has promoted. Clorox anyone?"
2020-08-03 17:53:04,"I think we all agree that a vaccine must be both safe and effective. After all, if a vaccine is effective but it kills anyone who takes it, that vaccine should be assiduously avoided.

Nor should anyone bother taking a vaccine that has been shown to be ineffective, even if that vaccine has been shown to be safe.

But some vaccines don't fall in either category: the safety of the vaccine HAS been established but its effectiveness is not yet known. (For a concrete example, in another NY article today, Sanofi stated that it will test its prospective vaccine's safety first and its effectiveness later.) My question is -- assuming that a physician is not concerned that a patient taking a ""safe"" vaccine whose efficacy has not yet been determined will change his or her behavior before the vaccine's effectiveness has been determined (a legitimate concern, as I mentioned in my initial comment) --  should the physician authorize the patient to take a vaccine that is ""safe"" but which may or may not be effective? Frankly, I can see no reason NOT to."
2020-08-03 19:04:07,"With the increasing spread and dying Americans, expectation that we need  a safe effective vaccine has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with ensuring a vaccine gets delivered as soon as is possible for public health reasons. No one should care whether Trump wins or Biden wins or the elections are postponed. It will make zero difference to help people survive during the pandemic if we do not have a safe effective vaccine to protect people. If after spending billions if a timely vaccine is not delivered in the USA then China, France, India or UK will deliver for US."

Trump and his moronic entourage are desperate for ""a win"" and will spend as much public money as they can lay their hands on one, whether real or fake. And like the inherently dangerous Boeing Max, a US vaccine will magically get federal government agency approval because the system is so inherently corrupt, so much money, so many jobs, and so much politically ride on ""yes"", irrespective of merits. The W.H.O. quite rightly is saying, today, a safe and effective vaccine is many months, possibly many years, away. No wonder Trump was in such a rush to de-fund and de-legitimize it. He and the truth cannot abide one another. Expect a whole new batch of terrible whoppers from Trump on Covid-19 from now until November.

Trump has tried to cut corners since day 1 of this pandemic.  We have suffered tremendously as of result of this immaturity and foolishness.  Lets us hope that the doctors and scientists have the strength and wisdom to prevent him and his lackeys from trying to do that here.

Regardless, Moderna's results will indeed be announced near election day (Oct 30?).  They are likely to be positive.  Trump will then issue a massive vaccine roll out.

“Government tax payer funds” and “Federal tax payer funding” will remind everyone, including the Administration and especially the pharmaceutical companies who is paying for this.  For every mention of funding, the “US tax payer” should be included.   This is not semantic.

As pharma companies, once they’ve fulfilled the most minimal requirements to get the funding, will start charging huge amounts for these vaccines going forward citing their time and investment.  They will charge huge amounts for any derivative drugs they develop from these year after year.  

The US tax payer is on the hook for so much of the funding of research in this country,’ for pharma, tech, and even space travel - but our huge financial infusions are lost in the heady “wow, what amazing private industry innovations these are! See, governments can’t do what private companies risk to do”. Which is false at best and disingenuous at worse.  All these companies, especially pharma, have fed on tax payer funded research heavily for decades without acknowledgement, and without fair compensation (or any).

Is anything really working right now to contain the virus?  No!   So.....get the vaccine out, be clear about the risks, and then let adults decide what they want to do about getting inoculated."
2020-08-03 19:11:05,"A vaccine is needed, but it would be much less urgent if the Trump administration had been half as effective as many other countries and had instituted a universal masking order as soon as the virus was detected in the US and ordered the production of masks and PPE. Instead he repeatedly claimed he had already stopped the epidemic and that it was of no concern, and asserted that real Americans don't wear masks."

""I will be extremely suspicious of any vaccine that is approved before the election. Period.""

If the FDA declares that a proposed vaccine is safe but ineffective, why take it? But if the FDA declares that a proposed vaccine is safe and that it may or may not be effective, why NOT take that vaccine?"

The downside became painfully obvious a few years later. One thing a rapid process does not do is allow for reflection. You don’t sleep on the data and game out “what if’s” in your head. You suppress any stray thoughts about potential  problems or issues. 

There are certainly ways to significantly accelerate vaccine development. The most important is parallel pathing the construction and qualification of production facilities even when you don’t know what you will be producing. The only risk there is financial as some of the investments will not be used. But those are acceptable risks. 

I worry about the medical risks."
2020-08-03 20:32:23,"Despite many comments suggesting the contrary, very few (if any) Americans will rely on what Donald Trump has to say about any vaccine.

But if a vaccine has been proven safe, why not take it if there's a realistic possibility that it will later be proven effective as well? A physician's authorization should be required, but should we tell physicians that they can make only one decision? There are several good reasons why a physician wouldn't authorize a vaccine (for example: an irresponsible patient might ""jump the gun"" and engage in reckless behavior because the patient believes the vaccine is effective but it's not), but isn't that a matter for the physicians? Should we let physicians decide, or should we tell them that only one decision will be acceptable? Are we telling patients that they must get the virus because they may not be vaccinated with a ""safe"" vaccine that may or may not also be ""effective?"""

A nurse, saying she will not be vaccinated?  I never, ever thought I would say that, let alone declare it publicly in national newsprint.  If patients had, previous to Trump, said they would not be vaccinated, I would definitely try to find out why, because after all, wouldn’t that be the “right” protective thing to do? And for the safety of others, too?  

I don’t trust a thing this man, Donald Trump, does, says, or touches.  His Health and Human Services Azar does not have a medical degree - he’s a pharmaceutical lobbyist!  Birx and her models have been a circus.  The CDC has even stooped to advise children to fend for themselves into going to school, by going along with someone who called COVID a hoax, willing to infest youth and then to infest the rest of us. 

And we are supposed to think these people would safely inject our body with a quick “fix” before an election?  

No way!  If being a healthcare servant all these years taught me anything - it has taught me safety first.  And the likes of Donald Trump is the furthest thing away from safety or care I could ever, ever imagine."

Would you trust it then?  How slow does it have to be developed to trust it? 9 months, a year, 2 years, 5 years? This thing is ravaging the world / personally, I’m going to trust the science on this one - if a major company regardless of country develops a vaccine - and the peer review is positive, I’m on board."

And the “experts” will certify anything if their palms are sufficiently greased. Case in point: all the quacks that touted hydro chloroquine. If you dig deep enough, you’ll find Jared and the old man lining their pockets off any and every fake cure possible. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Americans will die.

The reason, these people are scared that US may produce a vaccine before the election and that may help Trump."
2020-08-03 14:08:20,"Do you want a vaccine or a political talking point?
Hydroxychloroquine was used by thousands of physicians worldwide before Trump ever mentioned it. And it had  been used primarily as part of a triple regimen, not as an isolated drug as used some of the studies. But the reason it was used extensively initially besides of prior effect on other Coronaviruses was because it is safe- despite the media hysteria reporting cardiac arrhythmias that were not associated with the drug. It is relatively inexpensive and available. But the use was demonized solely because Trump brought it up. Politics drove  attempts to limit its prescribing more than science. The studies showing positive effects are rarely reported outside of medical literature.
 Is that what we want with a vaccine? A politically correct therapy 
based on who develops it instead of efficacy of treatment?"

2020-08-03 23:18:09,"The FDA has released a guidance document specifically for the coronavirus vaccine that differs from the guidance for approval of other biologics in several important ways.  These include allowing certain manufacturing validations to be performed after approval, and allowing the agency to skip the Pre-Approval Inspection of the manufacturing facility, which in the ordinary course is a key final check.  It also specifically calls out the possibility of releasing a vaccine through an Emergency Use Authorization, before full review of the Biologics License Application for approval.

I do wonder how the Republican politicians will respond to any vaccines that are released.  After months of denying the very existence of the virus, will they be first in line (thinking of you, Louis Gohmert) for the shots?  Or will they claim that since they've already been infected, they don't need it?

But let us all hope that the members of the ""Deep State"" hold fast to their duties and refuse to approve a vaccine that has not been thoroughly tested.  And let us hope that the companies developing the vaccine will see that it is in their best interest to not cut corners in testing (for reasons of bad publicity if nothing else)."

2020-08-01 15:04:43,"Having been in the healthcare industry for over 40 years and almost half of that calling on large hospital pharmacies around the USA, medication shortages are a big problem.  For example, Jardiance a pill for diabetic type 2 people cost a shocking $8,600 per year if bought through any pharmacy located in the USA.  If you order Jardiance through a Canadian pharmacy the cost is only $860 per year.  

The USA is the only country in the free world that does not allow large healthcare providers or insurers to bargain for their medications.  For instance a vaccine to stop Hepatitis C cost a shocking $90,000 to treat one patient.  

Hopefully when President Biden is sworn into office, he will correct these problems.  The USA is the most expensive healthcare system in the world.  France for instance, which during our revolution trained our physicians including Dr. Benjamin Rush, who helped inoculate our people against smallpox.  

Unlike our current president, I am a Veteran and my ancestors came to this country in 1607 serving under Captain John Smith.  Please vote in the upcoming presidential election.  How our current president seeks to avoid leaving office will be interesting and the NYT will keep us informed!"

2020-08-01 16:32:11,"The other day when I listened to 'Planet Money' on NPR, the program talked about the need to invest in and build multiple factories simultaneously (building useless factories, for a good reason - Susan Athey, Stanford economist's bold idea), each with an ability to handle different production technology as many of the vaccines currently in trials do come from diverse biotechnology.  The program equated this to a simple scenario where  our life dependent on completing a home construction project on time and failure to do so would mean a literal death.  In such an instance, I suppose we will undertake not one but multiple home constructions so at least one of them is complete by the deadline.  

Serum Institute is really impressive with its production capability with one type of vaccine production and what Mr. Poonawalla has willingly risked but we need similar ability on other technologies.  I do not think neither governments nor pharma companies can make huge investments in production capacities that they may never use."
2020-08-01 16:58:04,"I am happy to see a positive article about India from the NYT. The Indian pharmaceutical industry provides >30% of all drugs to poor and developing countries at a fraction of the cost.

The same drugs are available (look up gefitinib) in India for about $100 a month and I know patients that have flown there to buy the drug so as to not bankrupt themselves. 
Given that western pharmaceutical giants will no doubt make billions and billons off of a Covid-19 vaccine I am humbled to see this family run business doing at slightly above cost price. Kudos to them- hope for the world."

Vaccine may not save the economic devastation but just may save India from a catastrophe of epic proportions. Big Bet by Indian billionaires in the Coronavirus vaccine race is not just personally profitable but it will be patriotic for a country that will be celebrating its 73rd Independence day on August 15, 2020. There is really nothing to celebrate without a vaccine and without containing the spread.

It is better that the billionaires from around the world invest their billions sitting around in their coffers collecting zero returns than governments shoveling billions of tax payer money on vaccine candidates hyped by useless preliminary data that cannot really predict how well a safe deployable vaccine might work."

The land where it stands is too valuable and forcing closure will mean selling it to builders for a huge profit. Meanwhile Serum institute is getting investment to ramp up production.
2020-08-01 16:53:37,"Mr. Poonawalla’s Serum Institute venture is extremely commendable for one big reason. It is a private company, doing a life-saving public service without any government funds, and at least until now, doing it profitably. Contrast that with many India and US companies first take copious government funds and then some time produce less than stellar results. (Elon Must probably has done so with his initial SpaceX efforts).

Now the plot thickens, akin to a James Bond movie, only in reverse. Typically, a multibillionaire with fondness for expensive horses, planes and cars wants to unleash a calamity on the world, say a virus, unless the governments all over the world pay ransom. In addition, the most powerful country in the world wants to stop him. In the Serum Institute story, things are opposite. The benevolent billionaire wants to save the world, but a powerful rouge government who unleashed the virus to suffocate other economic powers does not want Serum Institute’s production. The powerful country uses every means to sabotage the production. It tries to co-opt workers with the gratuitous bevy of beauties, bottles and bribes; and compromise Institute’s  computers with software viruses like Stuxnet that sabotaged Iranian uranium centrifuges. Hopefully, in this case, the benevolent billionaire was expecting this, and he foils the rouge government which sinks in the shark infested sea. The world saved. Happy ending indeed."

Mumbai race course is one of the best spots in India.  India's richest race, the Indian Derby - is held on first Sunday of February. 

At the race course, he's always shadowed by two unformed and armed policemen.  But he is very approachable, and I have talked to him a couple of times.

When he, the Elder is ready to depart his house in his Rolls - a phalanx of security stop rtraffyc on Bhulabai Desai Road so he could make a right turn towards the racecourse.

I love horse racing.  And Mr. Poonawallah - unlike the now fugitive, one Mr. Mallya - who almost destroyed racing - is a great steward of Mumbai race course.

Racing has fallen in hard times recently with government crackdown in black money, higher taxes and usual Indian legal fights over contracts.

Mumbai race course is one of the best spots in India.  India's richest race, the Indian Derby - is held on first Sunday of February. 

At the race course, he's always shadowed by two unformed and armed policemen.  But he is very approachable, and I have talked to him a couple of times.

If anybody can succeed - it is these folks.

It is also worth mentioning that they belong to Parsi sect of India - which has produced several of Indian industrialists - the most notable, the House of Tatas."
2020-08-01 18:09:33,"I think Mr Poonawala is interesting personality in many ways. I thought it was interesting to note that he agreed to set aside 60,000 doses for Parsis - a micro community in India which is dwindling in size. They felt it was important they save themselves to the extent possible from this pandemic. Would I trust the safety of this vaccine? Gives me more confidence that he would do that."
2020-08-01 18:13:58,This story sounds like one of a gritty entrepreneur rolling the dice on a huge bet that can save humanity. Sadly it is not. Mr. Poonawallah will still be fabulously wealthy if the venture fails but if it succeeds will become more wealthy. And once again we will have large swaths of the population of the planet subjected to the profit motive determining who gets health care and who doesn’t. Already I can hear the plaints of legislators justifying rationing vaccinations because “It’s too expensive to vaccinate everyone “.

If the vaccine works and IF this is true
""for India and lower- and middle-income countries during the pandemic and charge an amount that is no more than its production costs."" --- he will gain huge profit on scale."

Poonawallas own 50  cars, each worth between a few hundred thousand dollars and a million plus. This doesn't paint a portrait of a true philanthropist.

The Serum Institute, like many other Indian companies, like Infosys and such, all operate at cost---meaning their profit margins are limited like maybe 5%.

Public-private partnership is the global norm in the global response to this global pandemic. Here in the UK (as in the EU), 'big pharma' is not so over-mighty as to deserve mistrust by default... we still have the NHS as our de facto monopoly-buyer to help prevent the routine, legal price-gouging/profit-maximisation people in the USA suffer (thanks to US law, and the healthcare system it produces).

Mr Poonawalla is evidently in business to be 'successful' but equally evidently his family-owned corporation is not subjugated to ""increasing shareholder value"" as its guiding metric of 'success' (let alone its sole legally-enforceable objective, as a 'person' in its own right). As an Indian corporation, why shouldn't it aim to help India prosper by generating income and profits from non-Indian territories and paying Indian taxes on them?"

The Parsi community in India are descended from the refugees who came to India after being nearly exterminated in their home country of Persia by the Islamic Arab Invaders who forced them to convert or die in the 7th Century AD. After coming to India they adopted Indian customs but kept their faith. The Parsi community's contribution to India is unparalleled for such a small population. From India's most celebrated company the Tata's, to some great Lawyers and war heros to Indian independence leaders, the Parsi community has given so much to the nation - in terms of industry, philanthropy and never been the cause of anything negative. This shows how a group of immigrants end up becoming a part of the soul of the nation. Mr. Poonawala's big heartedness could of course have business interests yet he follows the footsteps of his ancestors in first thinking about his nation, then the world. The Parsi community is held in high esteem and affection  by all of India, and hopefully the world gets to know their greatness now that they're literally saving the world!"

The Ponawallas  are Zoroastrians,  and Mr. Ponawalla has demonstrated that creed in giving vaccines to poor countries for free or for very little.  Of course, he has made millions with his Serum Institute. Time will show how this new venture will work. Till then we, in the West wait."
2020-08-01 16:18:47,"What a heart-warming story! This is exactly the kind of bold and risk-filled initiative at the grand scale required to solve this and other global problems such as climate change. Kudos to Cyrus and Adar Poonawalla!

It seems to me that this is the one worthwhile use of the vast fortunes accumulated by billionaires. Why can’t a majority of billionaires do things like this? Imagine the PR: “Billionaires donate personal wealth to save the world!” No one will grudge their grand mansions and fleets of Rolls-Royces and Jaguars if they get serious about saving the world. The proportion of those trying to do this now, like Bill Gates, is minuscule. Imagine if it becomes a majority! Risks even on this scale are not going to impoverish any of them. A billion dollars is such a vast amount that it can buy a lavish lifestyle for hundreds of generations — if you spend a thousand dollars a day, a billion will last 3000 years, and that doesn't even factor in interest...

On a personal note, I was born and raised in the historic city of Poona (now Pune). I clearly remember family outings more than 50 years ago, sampling the wonderful fare served at the Royal Western India Turf Club where the elder Poonawalla raced his thoroughbreds, and picnicking at the Empress Botanical Garden close by. The name “Poonawalla” simply means “coming from Poona.” More power to you, Cyrus and Adar! For the sake of all of humanity, may your endeavor be successful.

But in calm moment, good to examine the Serum business. They are devoting a modest proportion of their fortune (made by producing vaccines, presumably at the ""market price"" that is right for them) to enlarging their factories to jump-start the Oxford vaccine.

The worst-case, is that in November, the Oxford won't get the green light anywhere... and they could get sued for killing some ""early adaptors"" and have to dump tons of useless vaccine. But they have their enlarged factories which may yet be partially paid for under Warp Speed programs.

2020-08-05 17:38:24,"I'm in the midst (hopefully the final rounds) of a bout with a mysterious condition myself, and here's what I've learned: 

* Most doctors have a handful of conditions they're familiar with, and they like to match your symptoms to one of these diseases. If your symptoms don't fit anything the doctors routinely see, you either get referred to a specialist (who has his/her own list) or brushed off as a wacko. You're really, really lucky if you find a doctor who's willing to think creatively, consider rare conditions, and read research studies (even the ones you link him/her!)

* Many doctors hate and fear not knowing the cause of an illness, so rather than admit they don't know, they tell you whatever you have is psychosomatic (it's all in your head!) or idiopathic (it's in your body, but only in YOUR body! This condition is unique to you). They often prescribe you something that treats the symptoms but not the disease, so if you want to treat the disease you end up your own guinea pig. That's life, but BE SCIENTIFIC!

* Stress and uncertainty worsen EVERYTHING. If you dwell on a disease, exaggerate its power, or fell prey to helplessness and doubt, your health will suffer and your condition will probably deteriorate. You are your body's champion, and you have to act like it. Being vigilant without worrying is key: write down your symptoms for the day, then live your life - don't give any more of your time and mind to your disease than you absolutely must.

Hang in there!"

I did not go to the Hospital because I feared getting Covid-19 and we were also on lockdown at the time.  A week later I started with a dry cough that I assumed were allergies.  Now, nearly 4 months later, my knee and ankles are still not the same, and I get waves of achiness.  I am still afraid to go to the doctor's office, but I think i should be tested for Lyme and Covid. I am certain I had Covid-19.  The fact that Americans do not fully understand the range of symptoms,  seriousness of the potential of the disease and the fallibility of testing means we are in for a long hard year or two.  I get so angry when I see people (mostly men) not wearing masks.  How many people have to die?  Wake Up America!!!"
2020-08-05 22:06:17,"Thanks so much. It is hard to communicate the importance of the  ACE2 receptor clearly enough. You hear in the dispatches from emergency rooms, or in academic discussions what is missing from the lemming mantra respiratory disease. The importance of what is written here should be shouted from the rooftops. How can we explain that the ubiquity of ACE2 receptors in the body, the importance of recognising changes and pain that are abnormal without being alarmist. I think this article communicates clearly and effectively the important information that might not otherwise not be heard."
2020-08-05 22:20:45,"Thank you for this information.  Clearly novel viruses are terrifying.  

On another point the graphics and text (moving letters, different font sizes and moving images) describing Covid symptoms in the previous article are maddening and difficult to read.  Stop doing it."
2020-08-05 23:07:48,"Thanks for this excellent overview, and revisitation of the virus, since we've kind of become complacent over these 6 plus months.
The accompanying graphic guide is also excellent.
I had a very similar experience to Mr. Gregson, mentioned in the article, way back in January, after a visit from a friend from California who was also sick, in a ""weird"" way.   
It seems like the most prevalent symptom is: Weird; and that should give us all pause."
2020-08-06 00:05:15,"The symptoms are so varied and evolving, it’s hard to know when to become concerned. I thought a high fever would be the commonality, but this piece suggests that is just not so.

When I was tested it was because my Province added gastrointestinal issues as a possible symptom on the self-diagnoses questionnaire on the App. available to us.

I imagine, as they run the data on the emerging symptoms the list will be expanded. Nevertheless, it's all such a worry because it is such an unpredictable virus."
2020-08-06 01:57:31,"Wear your mask! 
Wash your hands.
Treat social distancing as if it is still as important as it was three months ago, because it is still as important as it was three months ago.

People who might want to skip the precautions that protect others, because they feel OK or don't think their symptoms could possibly be covid - please act under the assumption that you could be spreading virus.

So wear your mask,  keep the hands clean and keep your distance.

If we all do that, we buy us all some time, for better diagnostics, better treatments and hopefully some effective vaccines."
2020-08-06 02:24:13,"This article is the best I have read so far that explains in layman’s terms the differences in how this hideous virus can manifest itself once it infects you.  And for any individual, the symptoms and how the virus runs it course is so different!  That, to me, is why COVID-19 is so scary; you can’t EVER predict how it may affect you, or your loved ones for that matter.  I am now a front line worker in healthcare, trying to reopen our office in the past two weeks.  I have found the public understands so little, and they believe all the false information out there quite easily.   Or ignore the truth.  NYT has been my go to this entire time for responsible reporting and facts.   I am modeling the ideas in this article into a visitor questionnaire I’m writing for our healthcare practice, and will use it to help our staff learn how to listen and ask about symptoms that can be COVID-19 related, even if remotely."
2020-08-05 22:19:40,"I believe there’s a reliable measure already around for male octogenarians like myself to use to determine wellness and freedom from the virus.

As long as we can still go to bed at night thinking about women, chances are good we’ll wake up all right in the morning."
2020-08-06 14:50:36,"We still know nothing. It’s a moving target. “False negatives,” huh. I feel so much better now. Rushing out a vaccine seems like it’ll have similar random side effects, results, impact. So much time wasted. My heart goes out to docs and scientists but the rush to “re-open” crowd willfully ignores them."
2020-08-06 14:38:52,No attention seems to be given to the several days of low grade fever that can start when Covit takes hold of the body. A dismissible as “it’ll go away” low grade fever.
2020-08-06 15:07:06,Does this mean those of us who have suffered for years with Myalgic Encephalitis /Chronic Fatigue Syndrome might face less dismissal of our debilitating symptoms as being a product of laziness or mental illness? Will the research on mitochondrial failure now have more funding as the similar post-Covid symptoms surface in thousands of people?
2020-08-06 15:15:40,"Thanks for the thoughtful reporting and wise, concise presentation. In a world of information overload, not to mention an endless flood of misinformation, this kind of professionalism is needed more than ever."
2020-08-06 15:17:56,"Thank you for this piece! In early March after travel to Jackson Hole Wy, I had about a week of sore throat, dry cough, low grade fever and extreme fatigue. My doctor didn’t see the need for even a video visit, as he was sure I had the flu. BUT I had recurring heartburn (which I never get) and ended taking an antacid. Now I’m pretty sure it was Covid."
2020-08-06 15:35:20,"One symptom you didn't discuss is shortness of breath.  Does this always appear in conjunction with other symptoms, or can it be an isolated indicator?  I developed chest tightness and shortness of breath rather abruptly this spring, but as I am a lifelong asthmatic the doctors in the ER attributed it to that.  There was none of the usual asthmatic wheezing, coughing, or phlegm, and no other virus symptoms.   It did not respond as completely to cortisone treatments as past events had, and I ended up needing two 10-day courses just to feel semi-OK.  Hadn't had a chronic problem in 25 years, but this took over 6 weeks to abate and left me on a daily steroid inhaler.  People suggested that panic may have played a part, and I will allow that possibility, but an MD friend suggested that it might have been my brush with COVID.  No way to know as they refused to test me in the ER since I wasn't being admitted -- tests were still in short supply at that time.  What research have  you seen on this symptom appearing by itself?  Just curious."
2020-08-06 15:47:13,"The testing is obviously not reliable.

How in the world are we supposed to accept the vaccines will be safe when we can't even accurately test?"
2020-08-06 15:56:43,",
At Thanksgiving, I flew home through major airports: Boston Logan, Atlanta, and Nashville Two weeks later. I had my head buried i my pillow for three weeks with a dry unproductive cough. 
The headache that I experienced was so debilitating, I assumed it was a sinus infection.  I never have headaches and this one was severe.  I walked into walls when I did get up and my balance was off which I considered a major issue. I had a degree of fever which would go away,  My joints ached severely, I had a pain ln my hip that would not go away,  This fatigue and aches disrupted my day. I didn' have to be convinced to sleep because the fatigue was so debilitating.  I felt certain I was exposed to COVID-19.I have pain and often severe in joints that have never hurt.  I took a test for antibodies, but it was negative.  My GYN  had the same symptoms, flew through airports at the same time and was sick. She and I are convinced we had this virus. For me some of the symptoms continue to linger.  It has been 6 months.  She and I think that all test are fallible and there are many false negatives and false positives.  I amof the opinion that the viruse was present long before March. 








At Thanksgiving, I flew home through major airports: Boston Logan, Atlanta, and Nashville."
2020-08-06 15:59:12,"In mid-March, I got what I presumed were severe (for me) allergy symptoms: itchy ears/eyes, sneezing, occasional sore throat, ~3 days without taste/smell, occasional chills, sweats and headache, and some chest tightness.  The symptoms lasted about a month and peaked when the trees were budding.

No cough or sustained difficulty breathing, no high fever.  Didn’t consult a doctor because the effects were not sufficiently severe and lined up well with a taxonomy of allergy symptoms.

Will always wonder if I had CoViD.  If so, I am profoundly grateful that my case was mild."
2020-08-06 16:08:23,"My symptoms were typical of many others with loss of smell and taste, aches, sinus issue but I also had inflammation and pain in 3 knuckles on one hand.  They swelled and remain that way since late March. When I donated plasma the nurse thought it could be a response from my body fighting the virus.  

I haven’t heard of anyone else with that symptom so I wonder if it’s a coincidence."
2020-08-06 16:15:39,"This is indeed a very vexing disease. Almost any symptom, whether mild or acute, makes one think that they may be infected. I've had minor nasal congestion since January, and it never worsens or goes away. I tested negative in April.

And since testing is still - still! - not reliable, a negative result can not be relied upon. Unless testing accuracy improves a lot, we will always wonder and have doubts, which makes a bad situation even worse. Sigh."
2020-08-06 16:16:48,"Thank you for this frank, nuanced column.  I also find it worthwhile to read the comments - to learn what people's symptoms and experiences have been with COVID.
It would be helpful to know why fecal samples aren't being done so much in the U.S., yet are showing high reliability when used in other nations.  Perhaps we can switch over to this form of screening for the virus, and get better results."
2020-08-06 16:31:39,"Yes, it is important to know the symptoms of the virus. At least if people know the symptoms, and if they come across one or two, they can immediately approach a physician and try to get medicines to avoid the virus spreading further. I have heard in many nations, many positive patients have been totally cured with the available dosage of medicines. Those who die are with severe problems who have other serious health issues."
2020-08-06 16:41:47,Thanks for this summary of what we have learned so far. Doctors to be more aware of these symptoms in order to help people.  The public needs to know about them and understand how much Doctors are struggling to cope with this novel virus. The challenge for public health is to make this information more widely available for nonreaders.  There needs to be an effort by those in the entertainment fields to make compelling short reality videos and they need to be run for free as PSAs on every platform.
2020-08-06 16:45:16,"There are so many symptoms that are all so variable it's really impossible for the afflicted person to know what they have. I had something that made me feel truly horrible, but lacked the most definitive symptoms. I didn't die from it and didn't require hospitalization. By the time a test was finally administered, I wasn't positive. Whether I had ""crownavirus"" (COVID is so like CORVID, the crow family, I sometimes think of it as ""crownavirus."") I'll probably never know. I wonder if the US will learn anything from this experience, or just slip back into slipshod complacency. A lot of people have the mistaken idea that, because this pandemic is a once-in-a-century event, it won't happen again for a hundred years. Not so.  A similar infectious agent could arise next week. There has been a wake-up call. Our government should not hit the snooze button."
2020-08-06 16:45:40,Boy this virus is a hard one.  I've had many of these symptoms over time - same symptoms different causes.
2020-08-06 16:47:33,"There are also people who present only with vasovagal syncope -- a near-faint. They're usually over 65 and may have a history of cardiac problems.  A chest x-ray may show Covid within a day or two. 

I had two episodes in February. Unlike typical syncope, they were not completely relieved by lying down. A large animal seemed to sit on my chest to keep me company. I thought of heading for the ER, but I felt too ill. My Dr later scoffed that if it hadn't gone away when I lay down, it wasn't really syncope: I just had anxiety."
2020-08-06 16:53:18,"There is a good chance that certain of us, and we are a large number, would never know if we got Covid-19.

In 2012, I took a statin drug for seven months. Looking back, I realize that I got adverse effects almost instantly--tightening of joints, tearing of tendons and ligaments, foot cramps, then muscle cramps, and terrible fatigue.

Now, 8 years later, I still have all these symptoms. The statin-triggered disease took me from trekking in the Himalayas to almost entirely exercise-intolerant. There are better days and worse days, but except for the end-game, I don't see how I'd know that I had Covid-19. See StatinStories.com.

I imagine that the same is true for others--people with Lyme disease, perhaps MS, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. Anyone who already has a chronic disease with symptoms that could be Covid.

If there is any advice for us for as to how we'd realize that we had a new problem, I'd appreciate it. I'm already cautious, but if I knew I had Covid-19, I'd be even more so. StatinStories.com"
2020-08-06 16:54:39,"It's odd that the incidence of fever reported was as low as 40%.  Of course whether a fever is detected depends on when the measurement is taken during the course of the disease.  The Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) tabulated incidence of symptoms among 56,000 laboratory confirmed cases.  Fever was the most frequently observed symptom with an incidence of 88%."
2020-08-06 16:58:44,"I'm fairly certain that I had Covid-19 during May but I can't prove it. Everything I read and heard said ""Just stay indoors!"" which I did for an entire month.
I never lost my sense of smell or taste, which most people do. However, in addition to fatigue and sore throat the biggest change was the often extreme heaviness in my chest. Some days it felt as though an elephant was dancing on top of my chest.
The heaviness never went away completely but it became much less severe over time.
As far as I'm concerned I had Covid-19. Maybe one day I'll know for sure."
2020-08-06 17:08:19,"My partner and I JUST moved from Hawaii to the high altitude desert for a job change. We have been masking and socially distancing since March but there were movers in the house in Hawaii and then we had to fly and now we are quarantining. I lived from many years in the high altitude desert and have allergies here which went away while I was in Hawaii. Symptoms are itchy eyes, sneezing and mild congestion. I'm pretty sure it's just the old allergies returning as time release guaifenesin and Flonase are helping. But still I can't help wondering ..."
2020-08-06 17:14:06,"As I read more and more of these articles on Covid by pundits, doctors, epidemiologists I am deeply troubled by one cogent fact. Virtually not one expert over these 6 months or so has made the slightest effort to discuss the role of proper diet in minimizing and perhaps even preventing serious effects of this virus. Rather than risking the fear of being accused of shaming people for being obese or binging on unhealthy carbs and dangerous fatty acids, pundits/physicians dance around these facts, instead telling people to sleep well, wash your hands, and wear a mask. The fact is there are many foods, and especially the seed oils (mostly omega 6) such as soybean oil, corn oil, safflower/sunflower oils that create an underlying chronic inflammatory condition. Thus while the covid virus brings forth a rather typical immune response, the body goes haywire when the underlying inflammatory condition becomes paired with the viral immune response. This is what is most likely causing individuals to respond so poorly and creating the dangerous cytokine storm that are endangering so many lives. There are a few physicians who are discussing these issues; but they are not being heard."
2020-08-06 17:20:41,"I was diagnosed with a “very bad respiratory infection” in January after being at the Seattle airport. I didn’t get better until the end of February.

For two months I was extremely fatigued, on/off fever, difficulty breathing, tightness in my chest, vomiting, weight loss, loss of taste, but the oddest symptom was my fine motor functions diminished, my hands became shaky, at one point my arms became paralyzed and my jaw locked.

After that episode EMT was called because I couldn’t move and they said it was due to stress and believed the respiratory infection was a separate issue. I was still feeling narcoleptic and I followed up with my doctor who told me my symptoms were “all over the place.” I was made to feel like it was all my head. Nonetheless, she ordered blood work and found my iron levels had been decimated. I was told my iron levels were at 7 when they should been over 100. But still no explanation as to why.

It was awful to feel so horrible for so long. Each night I went to bed feeling like I wasn’t going to wake up in the morning because I felt like I was suffocating. I was sacred I was going to die. 5 months later I still can’t breathe properly, particularly in high altitude and get lightheaded. I’m still not the same. I still don’t know if it was COVID but assume it was. A small % may die from COVID, but just having it can be awful and life changing."
2020-08-06 17:32:42,"Add vertigo to the list of weird early COVID symptoms. Mine started with an attack of severe vertigo with vomiting. This was followed over the next few days by mild diarrhea, some stomach cramping and gas, a mild wet cough, a post-nasal drip, and mild headaches. I never had a fever and never lost my sense of smell or taste."
2020-08-06 17:40:14,"I'm at very low risk of infection, but gosh I've had weird symptoms in the last few months that I can't explain.  The biggest is fatigue.  Just unexplained tiredness during the day where I have this urge to just sit down.  It's a feeling like you get when you've been on your feet all day and you just want to find a place to sit down to rest your legs.  I've also had a strange sour taste in my mouth.  In February, I had a little shortness of breath that I noticed while lying in bed, but not since then.  I have a thermometer I keep next to my bed and I check my temperature often and have not had any fever.  I haven't been tested for Covid-19."
2020-08-06 17:46:08,"I agree with all the statements calling for easier, at-home testing.  I came down with what I believe to be a cold this week.  It started as an extreme dry feeling way back in my sinuses/throat, then progressed to a very runny nose and sore throat.  It feels like a classic head cold to me, so I wonder if I should go through the trouble of getting tested for Covid?  Being able to check through a saliva test at home would be much more effective than jumping through multiple hoops at a local testing site, for what may be ultimately nothing more than a routine cold."
2020-08-06 17:51:18,"Aside from varied symptoms and many unusual presentations, it’s also important to stress that there’s more than just mortality to reckon with as a consequence of Covid-19. People here and elsewhere describe suffering prolonged fatigue and recurrent pains. And even though most who are hospitalized survive, many are left with kidney, heart, or brain damage that may be permanent and debilitating. That’s not to mention the financial costs for those lacking coverage or with high deductibles. Those are real costs that real people and ultimately our society will bear."
2020-08-06 18:04:35,"Thank you so much for this informative article!  In early March, I had many of these symptoms, including chills, sore throat, headaches, extreme fatigue (sleeping ALL the time, when I'm typically up at the crack of dawn), and this weird sensation of having metal on my chest, making it difficult to breathe.  I also had the vivid dreams that some have described, and one day, the scariest, I became so confused that I had no idea what day it was or understood what was going on around me.  

I never had the high-grade fever though, so even here in Washington State, I was unable to get a test at that time.  My physician's office STILL do not have tests; I spoke to him over the phone at the time.  It truly felt that going to the hospital back then was a one-way trip, so I decided to wait it out at home.  Thankfully, it did not get worse, but the fatigue still lingers.

Tara, your article illustrates the myriad ways in which this virus attacks, and also shows us how much we still have to learn.  Thank you for the excellent reporting!"
2020-08-06 19:00:30,"This is the first article I've seen mention those who have no fever still having the symptoms. I got Covid in Jan-Feb, without fever, thought it resolved. I got a negative test April 4 which suggested either the antibodies had gone, or a false negative. 

Meanwhile, I was having and continue to have a daily Jack-In-The-Box pop-up of discrete symptoms I'd had in January. One day I'll have the cough. Another the achy back & need to sleep. Another, (right now since midday yesterday) shortness of breath upon minor exertion. In July I had two brief recurrences of the original illness of about 3-4 days, all the old symptoms, diarrhea included, which resolved back into these intermittent days of old symptoms.

I just now got Negative results from a second test taken last week. It's hard to trust your experience of your body when the tests don't comport with it. Makes me feel nuts, like I must be somaticizing."
2020-08-06 19:08:16,"Back in March (mid-to late), I developed a ""dry cough.""  By that I mean uncontrollable coughing without any congestion at all.  Prior to that my husband developed what he referred to as a ""dry cough"" but I could hear the congestion underneath (as opposed to what I was experiencing.  Because I work in a nursing home I stayed home the next day after the cough came on.  Eventually both of our coughs subsided.

The next month (April) I suddenly lost my sense of taste and smell.  No warning.  No cold (I always lose these senses when I suffer a cold) but I was certain I didn't actually have a cold.  After 2 weeks I called my doctor's office and told them I couldn't taste or smell anything.  I had a tele-medical visit with my doctor who didn't seem very concerned.  He said I should stay home (but specifically said I didn't need to quarantine).  FYI:  I never had a fever (and I was taking my temperature every day.

On May 13th I had my first test (I tested for the virus and the antibodies).  I tested negative for the virus but positive for the antibodies.  The following week I tested for the virus again, as my employer required it.  It came back positive.  I quarantined for 14 days.

My senses slowly came back in June and I have tested negative every week since the first positive test.  I can taste and smell my food but it still affects me from time to time and I lose the senses for a day or so.  This has happened a couple of times.

I have a feeling it's a permanent after effect."
2020-08-06 16:39:04,"Three weeks of hell for me. On March 18th I felt tired after 30 minutes of tennis. That night fever spiked to 103 and stayed there for 3 days. Cough and fatigue were other symptoms. Then on day 8 I took a bad turn. Severe nearly constant coughing, bone crushing headache and shortness of breath. MY o2 level dropped to the low 70's. Should be above 90. My husband is a nurse practitioner and took good care of me and we decided not to go the emergency room. Just toughed it out with breathing exericses and within a day o2 above 90 again. Fever finally went away 3 weeks after initial symptoms but cough persisted a bit more.  I had lost 20 lbs. and wedding ring slipped off my finger while showering. Five months out and have been donating plasma as my antibody levels remain very high. Strange symptoms persist-random rashes that disappear as quickly as they appear; I have allergies for the first time in my 62 years(an older brother who also got Covid has allergies now as well); shortness of breath only if I lie supine but relieved by activity. Been playing tennis midday in the heat and no breathing problem! Daily headaches though not as severe as during primary illness. General klutziness where I misjudge where things are. I've found hitting the tennis ball against the wall for an hour a day has helped with this last symptom. Still I feel lucky to be alive and not have anything remotely debilitating. Husband has tested negative for antibodies."

In your research have you heard of Covid-19 causing delirium with agitation and paranoia?
A 34 y.o. relative had sudden onset of severe insomnia, then paranoia, then delirium-so severe psych hospitalization was recommended.  But all local beds were full!
She calmed down with a powerful antipsychotic, Zyprexa.  Got off it after two weeks.
She is almost her normal self, two months later.  
She has had one Covid-19 antigen test, negative, but no Covid-19 antibody test.

2020-08-06 17:04:32,"This list of symptoms reminds me of the opening of Jerome K Jerome's classic:""Three Men in a Boat"". The male narrator describes having every ailment except ""housemaid's knee"". Is there any symptom that covid doesn't cause? Lack of discrimination renders such a list as pretty useless."
2020-08-06 17:16:10,"Test test test.  It’s always been about early identification of those who are infected, putting them in quarantine and treatment, and tracing, quarantining and testing those with whom they’ve been in close contact.  

With readily available testing including fecal testing the confusing array of Covid symptoms subject to misdiagnosis becomes less of an issue.  

This is where the Trump administration failed utterly: by not mobilizing the nation to mass- produce reliable tests with rapid results, set up test sites, establish clear quarantine and contact tracing protocols, and unite around basic safety measures like masks.  

The proof of Republican ignorance, indifference and incompetence is in the proverbial pudding.  Our Covid 19 outcomes are dismal, and unnecessarily so.  Only the acts of responsible local and state officials have prevented greater devastation.

Despite Trump’s manifest unfitness, there is zero reason to think the Putin-Trump campaign operatives won’t find ways to steal or subvert the November election.  Their depraved enablers at Facebook are already making the unthinkable possible.  

Anyone with a mind and a pulse needs to do everything possible in the next weeks to ensure a tsunami of blue votes, delivered and counted in time to matter."
2020-08-06 17:48:54,"Testing, testing, testing and more testing.  If we cannot rely on symptoms we must test to locate and isolate those who are infected.  In the testing triage in my state the symptoms you mention will not meet testing eligibility requirements.  This is more than absurd -- it is deadly.

I am afraid that Trump has politicized every step that we need to take to get this virus under any semblance of control, even blaming testing for increasing case numbers.  If you wanted a playbook for how to most efficiently spread a pandemic, look no further than Trump, the GOP and Fox News, who have been instrumental in spreading deadly misinformation and attacking experts who would inform us otherwise.  That Dr. Fauci has to hire security to protect his family shows just how far we have gone down this idiotic rabbit hole.

Until we get an effective vaccine or testing is funded and made easily available I fear that this virus will continue to ravage us.  I have been holed up for five months and I consider myself beyond fortunate that my main problem is loneliness.  I am in the highest risk group and, without testing, every little symptom means a possible infection that will keep me isolated.  November cannot come soon enough for me so that I, and hopefully a tidal wave like me, will finally remove the GOP from power."
2020-08-06 15:32:26,"My take-away from this article: see a doctor if you have serious or persistent symptoms and get a CoViD test, even if CoViD seems unlikely."
2020-08-06 16:50:37,"I had all the classic symptoms then a negative antibody test. I think the test was wrong. My symptoms in mid-March included: fever, tickle in my throat, headaches, chills, extreme fatigue, mental confusion, a painful finger (felt like a clot, but who knows?) blurry vision, diarrhea, and of course loss of taste/smell. Some of the symptoms came and went for weeks. Too bad we don't live in an advanced nation capable of providing adequate testing."
2020-08-06 17:51:46,"Can someone from the New York Times answer this one question, that is, why are the reporters from the NYT only reporting portions of what happened to some of these people mentioned in the article?

For example the person from South Orange appears to be still sick, but nothing is mentioned if he was tested a second time and what the results were.

Cautioning readers of aches and pains when nothing in the article mentions if any of these people work in high risk industries to contract the virus, or if they were socially distancing themselves and wearing masks, may be cautionary but is borderline creating fear."
2020-08-06 15:01:26,"This article indeed is frightening and terrifying.

When I had influenza back in December, I had so many of the symptoms listed except for having a fever.  The crazy fatigue was truly the worst.  I could barely make it to the bathroom and my husband had to help me back into bed.  It went on like that for 5 days.  It took me almost 8 weeks before I felt half way normal.

I always wondered if I might have had COVID-19 because we had just returned from Germany and Austria a few days before I became ill.  No one heard of this virus in December and most people barely paid attention to it in January.

I think it's the false negative test results that bother me the most.  My husband and I always said that if either of us began to have any of the ""classic"" symptoms listed, we would assume we had the virus and self-quarantine ourselves from everyone just to be safe.

Fortunately, our health has been fine although our nerves have been frayed from time to time.

It's been over 6 months and STILL not enough PPE nor tests.  And yet Trump continues to boast that this entire pandemic is ""under control.""

If billions of dollars can be given to a plethora of drug companies to try and manufacturer a vaccine for this virus, how come the federal government hasn't been able to spend similar amounts of money in getting the equipment and tests needed for medical professionals to do their jobs better and more effectively?  

Why shouldn't every American get tested if they feel they need it?"
2020-08-06 15:06:04,"In February our 17 year old daughter was sick for a week and then passed what she had to our son. He got a nasty cold with a horrible cough and a strange rash on his arms and hands. Both negative for strep and flu and it last three weeks... I got a mild case of it.

Now I wonder but too chicken to even get tested for antibodies...."

Could this be an enhanced pathogen?
“Arboviruses, transmitted by insects, usually aim for the brain, muscles, liver, heart, and kidneys. Enteric viruses lay siege to the gastrointestinal tract, entering the body through contaminated water or food. Respiratory viruses, responsible for measles, mumps, and chicken pox, are airborne viruses that assault the nose and throat.”   —from Ken Alibek, Biohazard, Delta 1999."

Can't someone dig deeper and find out possible reasons for these unexplained Covid infections?
Did these people shop, receive packages, or drive a rental car?"
2020-08-06 17:23:53,Excellent review.  I’m a physician. I went skiing in Vail early winter which turned out to be an epicenter.  On return developed the “mother of all colds” that lasted 2 weeks and an eye stye. Wasn’t tested but pretty sure Covid
2020-08-06 19:42:16,"It is shocking to me how long it took the US medical profession to catch on to this ample spectrum of symptoms. I had at least two, and I knew from reading the French press that these were being established as symptoms of Covid-19.  But my physician dismissed it twice, in late April and again late May, as not Covid because I did not have a significant fever.  It has been strange to see reports in the foreign press about headaches, skin lesions, chills without fever, joint pain, and the thrombotic sequels, yet well into mid July, medical professionals (including emergency room doctors) dismissed these concerns."
2020-08-06 20:09:13,"I’m sure I had Covid19 starting March 1, but testing criteria was extremely narrow at that time, so I’ve never been tested.  As a retired nurse, I kept a daily log of my symptoms; later when I reviewed it, I had no memory of having written those words.  No fever but brain fog, shortness of breath, headaches, extreme sweating, fatigue and cardiac pain were dominant.  I also had the “weird” factor, as if there was a nuclear reactor in my chest.  Now five months later if I over exert I get a return of the fatigue unlike anything I’ve ever experienced - it’s as if my muscles are made of Jello.  My right shoulder joint seems to be harboring something left over from the virus, because it will ache severely if I over exert in any way.  I’m also very intolerant of environmental heat - it makes me feel nauseated and confused.  I’m almost 68 years old and very physically fit.  I expect these hanger-on symptoms might linger for years."
2020-08-06 20:35:41,"Thank you Tara for a superb article. I have another to propose -- I had Covid in March and recently tested ANA positive, though I have no symptoms of any autoimmune disease. Others recovering from Covid on an online support group have also reported positive ANA test results. Is this coincidence? Or is this part of the ongoing Covid saga for some people?"
2020-08-06 21:04:07,"I have a disease with many of the EXACT same symptoms described in this article. How would I know if I got Covid-19 other than by almost constant testing?

Some of my symptoms, and also the symptoms of others with my disease, cut and pasted from the article:
---severe body aches and crippling fatigue...from head to toe
---“crazy fatigue” It’s been the fatigue that is the most debilitating
---body aches
---severe pain in hip muscles, described as “really weird.”
---roller coaster, feeling better ...then it comes roaring back.”
---severe joint and body pain, particularly in large muscles
---excruciating muscle pain in the shoulders, thighs or lower back
---severe leg pain 
---“Down to her calf she said, ‘Ouch, that really hurts
--blood clots
---Covid toes — painful red or purple lesions on the tips of fingers and toes...really painful. I thought maybe I had stubbed them 
---first sign that something was wrong hit him during exercise.
---The amount of energy I have — I feel like I’m at altitude
---painful inflammation in the joints...lead to rhabdomyolysis
(the rhabdomyolysis with the disease I have has itself resulted in death)
---It’s a terrifying story

This is EXACTLY the description of the disease I and others got immediately upon taking a statin drug. My case: 7 months, low-dose statin, 8 years ago, still have ALL these symptoms. How would I know if I got Covid-19?

2020-08-07 01:14:58,"So, in other words, it seems like Covid-19 is the dream illness of the hypochondriac.  The symptoms could be a number of things or none at all.  The testing results are sometimes accurate and and sometimes false.  People can be asymptomatic.

Finally, an article that is so honest in saying this is unpredictable and we know less than we think we know.

I will tell you, before this is all over, we will all be hypochondriacs - wondering if this symptoms means..."
2020-08-07 07:42:01,"I have been dealing with chronic fatigue and joint pain for over a decade, but this summer has been so debilitating! Although i have tested negative for Covid 3 times, I think I had it from the 2nd week of June, to now. The weird purply toes , extreme weakness, brain fog, hot flashes that left my hair and shirt soaked with sweat, cold sores and canker sores at least 6 at a time, severe leg bone pain that lasted for an hour or two for a 3 day period, ringing in my ear, and being super itchy and breaking out in chicken pox like rash, that hasnt healed and just started up again. My question is, if some people don't test positive but are pretty sure they have it, how long are we contagious? I just quit my teaching job after teaching for 30+ years...because the kids are coming back Aug. 17th and I don't feel we are safe yet. But I am having to move in with a relative, and I don't want to give it to them. I'm starting to be able to breathe better, but the itchy rash started up again. How do long haulers know when they are not contagious?"
2020-08-07 08:42:40,"Almost two months ago my husband had emergency surgery for a tumor in his small intestine. He has been my hero for a few years now when he was diagnosed with a rare skin cancer, known as Merkel Cell Carcinoma. He had undergone the surgery but he was released and contacted by hospital where he was notified that whilst in hospital he was exposed two different times from staff members who were treating him, tested positive for Covid-19. We both had to self quarantine for two weeks. My husband has been in a bad way since he was exposed, however the same hospital refused to let him be tested for the virus. Long story short, he has been getting worse than ever before. He was going to be in a trial for this deadly disease of his carcinoma. But he was so very sick that he was brought back to the same hospital where he was going through test after test because this is so rare of a deadly skin cancer and the medical professionals were running several different tests on him, because they were so interested in his diagnosis. 

An extremely kind hospitality who treated me about a year ago for serious health issues that I have developed for several years, was the most kind and caring Doctor who called me and informed me that my husband was going through the active stage of dying and all we wanted was to have him home, and be together as he was so very ill. The Doctor said that he refused any more data collection from so many tests to only learn about the disease. He was back yesterday!"
2020-08-07 09:39:17,"Thank you, Ms. Parker-Pope for this truly informative article. While it’s tempting to worry about these various and sundry symptoms (I have RA, fibro, DDD, SFN, allergies, and lifelong IBS), I was more freaked out by that human body graphic—his face is gives me the willies!"
2020-08-07 02:32:21,I am recovering from covid 19. Everything in this article is correct. My symptoms were mild to moderate. Some days I suffered more than others. I definitely had pain throughout my entire body. I had diarrhea and most telling when I loss my smell and taste. This virus is a real invisible monster. It's real sneaky too. Be safe. I tried and still have it.
2020-08-07 13:17:59,"The problem with this article is that every symptom described can be caused by dozens of other diseases, many of which prior to the COVID outbreak would be lumped together as the flu.
Reading the comments it appears to reinforce the false belief in patients with similar symptoms that they have COVID-19, no matter what the testing ( or lack thereof) actually confirms.
It has become the chronic fatigue of the 21st Century.
Thanks media, you have created another pop disease for the worried well."
2020-08-07 13:21:30,"Many comments refer to contracting COVID-19 despite social distancing, hand washing and wearing a mask.  Again, masks do not protect the wearer if you are exposed to a non-mask wearer who may have the virus. One wears the mask to protect others (with increased protection if both parties are wearing masks). Why, after all these months of explanation, is this still not understood?"
2020-08-07 14:40:35,"It seems that all symptoms could be COVID-19 symptoms, so I'll just stay home and ignore any and all symptoms until I'm too weak to get out of bed. At that point, I'll call 911 to come and get the body."

2020-08-07 14:29:17,"There is no disease quite like this Covid19. Those who hope there is a herd immunity are really just crossing their fingers. Nobody knows much, except those who study it day by day. There are lots of what ifs. And can yous? As in can you be reinfected, even though you have had it? How long can the virus stay alive inside your nasal passages? Will the vaccine prevent the disease, or just buffer the effects. So many questions, still very few answers."
2020-08-07 15:02:53,I think it's wonderful and so helpful that Tara takes the time to reply and add her own insights. Great!
2020-08-07 22:42:55,"Thank you for the article! Not only is the virus new but with so many non-textbook symptoms it's important to keep reporting on virus and symptom updates.

I read a lot about how those with pre-existing conditions are more susceptible but I also noticed one commonality in those who were infected, those who are healthy and exercise a lot, especially runners. Which might mean that very active lungs can also be an excellent host for COVID-19?
Has any experts noticed this, too?

I hope someone thinks about this.  
Thank you for considering."
2020-08-08 00:17:00,"I am a Covid long-hauler, one of perhaps a third of all who have contracted the virus. I have had Covid 19 symptoms since March 16. I wish people were more aware of what an awful disease this is beyond the acute phase. Besides the tragedy of the deaths of so many, most people are not aware of.this chronic component.

I am a member of several Facebook Covid support groups. Many victims are youngish, had a ""mild case,"" and were in excellent health before getting the virus. I suggest you acquaint yourself with the many symptoms from brain fog to heart problems to gut problems and more. 

It will get you go wear a mask."
2020-08-08 01:12:03,"After being sick for a few days, I went to the ER on December 31st, 2019 because I had slept for 20 hours straight and could barely walk. I had a cough that I have never had. Every time I would cough, it would trigger a Migraine that was so terrible in pain. 

I had random cramps all over my body too.

My Diagnosis? 'Mystery Infection in the Lungs'

I lost 15 pounds while recovering from this mystery illness. I truly believe I had COVID-19."
2020-08-08 12:16:50,"I’m not a doc, but I’m pretty good with science. What the range of symptoms in this article may portend is the difficulty in developing a vaccine.  With multiple parts of the body being affected in many ways, it is very hard to envision a vaccine that can be truly effective.  On the other hand, this may help in identifying the presence of Covid in an individual and in developing treatments, but a one- or two-shot annual vaccine may be years away, if even possible."
2020-08-08 12:29:56,"Considering so many of those interviewed for this article wore masks, distanced, and washed their hands regularly, we should definitely re-open schools to in-person instruction. NOT!

As an itinerant educational consultant in several schools, I am privy to the concerns of large numbers of educators, students, and parents. Education will be a sham when most teachers and students range from being scared to being terrified.

Further, we are simply not able to provide safe public schools because our testing is not only inadequate (a week or more for results that are often incorrect) but our understanding of this novel virus is minimal."
2020-08-08 13:32:27,"Reading the article and comments, it occurs to me that Tara Parker-Pope has collected an amazing data base of stories of Covid survivors and that this collection must rival any available.  Hospitals get to know the illness based on those in their care, but who else is paying attention to this growing body of stories from those who may talk or teleconference with a doctor but are then left to suffer through the illness on their own?   We have a lot to learn from these experiences, both individually and collectively.

I hope two things; (1) that you, Tara, will continue to collect these stories and (2) that somehow they will be put to good use so that doctors can learn from them and those afflicted don't have to feel so alone with their ""weird"" symptoms.   Thank you!"
2020-08-08 16:18:59,"In mid March,  I began sneezing more than usual, and had several days’ worth of chills, (never took my temp). I never considered it was Covid-19. I don’t recall if I lost my sense of taste, but I was pretty winded each time I bent down to pick up anything. This lasted a while after my chills went away and the sneezing subsided.
Fast forward to June, at a doctor’s appt for something, I asked if I could get an antibody test, just to check. Two days later, I got the results — positive
In late Feb., my son got sick at college - fever, body aches, two ER visits bec campus health office closed, 3-4 days missing classes. ER diagnosis = flu.
On July 16, he got an antibody test. Result = positive. Whether or not that was from the Feb illness, no clue, or maybe he was one of the ppl who are just asymptomatic."
2020-08-08 16:36:11,"My husband and I got sick the 2nd week in March with classic symptoms of Covid.  My husband was down about a week and I was up and down for about 6 weeks.  The virus did get into my lungs and caused symptoms, but I am not having issues with that anymore.  However I am not really functioning.  Severe fatigue, weakness, excruciating pain in my shoulder for no reason.  I had an underlying immune dysfunction and I believe that my body doesn't have the ability to clear this virus completely.  I think the best thing I can do is work on rebuilding my immune system.  I am fearful about getting reinfected with a slightly different strain of what I had because I'm not certain my body can handle another attack.  It may take me out."
2020-08-07 21:00:09,I have it.  It gets you anyway that it can.   It presents differently in every victim.
2020-08-07 18:57:00,"Tara, if you write another article, please mention that COVID often has vascular and neurological complications. My husband and I are ""long haulers,"" sick since March 16. I am an athlete who now has leaky heart valves. My husband had an EKG that sent him straight from the cardiologist office to the hospital, fearing a heart attack. After an angiogram showing no blockage, the doctors have no explanation. 

We continue to heal, but it is a long, slow process that takes patience. We are very aware of our daily energy bank: go broke and you end up in bed. The recovery is jagged, with ups and downs.

We absolutely could not get through this without Body Politic, an online group of 14,000 sufferers worldwide who share symptoms and recovery strategies."
2020-08-08 11:58:55,I don’t know about anyone else but after reading this article I’m even more confused. Seems that it’s hell if you do and hell if you don’t.
2020-08-08 22:40:02,"Very informative article, thank you for sharing these experiences and offering advice. Living in a vacation destination, I am stunned at the groups of people I see without masks, not social distancing.  I'm also surprised at the lack of mandates by our public officials, even in this mostly liberal community. We opened early and the virus has spread rapidly as a result. Now we are attempting to take a step back, which isn't working well. If only our leaders, at all levels, agreed on a few simple guidelines to mandate, and to model, we likely would have significantly less infections and deaths at this time."
2020-08-09 11:47:27,"This article was so enlightening. My experience was so similar to that of the professor - nausea and gastrointestinal problems, headache, serious fatigue - I could fall asleep at the drop of a hat - along with a two day fever. My swab test was negative. The entire experience lasted a week. Although I'm in a high risk group, my doctor never mentioned a decal test. Nor had I ever read about one before. Thank you for this vital information."
2020-08-09 17:20:06,"I attended a conference at the end of February with about 300 people who had flown in from all over the country.  No social distancing because it was before we were in a pandemic - the disease was just starting to spread.  Thirteen days later I was in bed with chills, body aches, a massive headache.   No temperature. The day before these symptoms started, a realtor had been at my house.  When he called a couple of days later to follow up, I mentioned I was sick and he panicked - after leaving my house he he had to visit his 89 year old mother who was on kidney dialysis and was diabetic.  I went to my doctor and begged to be tested. But this was early in the spread and the CDC had said to test only people who had been in contact with someone who had tested positive or who had traveled to one of the virus hot spots.  And besides - I had no fever. The doctor tested me for the flu - negative. He said I must just have “some random virus.”   I was finally able to get a test about a month later and it was negative. I don’t think they were doing antibody tests then. I still don’t know if I had Covid (if so, it was a relatively mild case - and I would be considered lucky because I’m over 70 and have asthma) or if I really did just have some random virus. Testing here in the OC (plague central/anti-mask central) is so hard to get that I’m sure there are a large number of people here who are positive but can’t get a test. Even if tested, people are having to wait 2-3 weeks for results."
2020-08-09 17:36:59,"As daunting as trying to figure out the symptoms is, getting a test and results in a reasonable amount of time is even more frustrating. I have friends and relatives who have waited for days to get a test and weeks for the results. Meanwhile providers are “guessing”.

2020-08-09 21:07:54,"""Anosmia, the loss of sense of smell that is also often accompanied by a loss of taste, is viewed as a defining symptom.""

That's a common symptom of zinc deficiency, which has a hard time getting into your cells.  Zinc has a very effective antiviral activity and is often used against the cold betacoronavirus.

So you should be taking zinc - 30 mg/day.  If you have C19 symptoms you need 100mg/day.

But it needs to get through the cell wall's lipid membrane and inside the cell to the Virus so its antiviral action can slow down Viral replication.

For that you need an ionophore - a zinc transporter - and that would be hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).  That's why HCQ (200 mg) works, despite what you read in the media.  

See all the studies here: c19study.com

Out of 70 (most peer-reviewed), 53 are positive.  The negative studies used too high a dose (2400 mg) or were not given with zinc.  

HCQ is not effective without the zinc.

In February MDs prescribed HCQ for themselves and their families so you can't find it.  No problem.  

You can buy Quercetin (or also EGCG) on Amazon and they work exactly the same way - maybe better.  

These are also zinc ionophores delivering zinc's antiviral activity into the cell to directly interfere with Viral function.  Might not even need a vaccine with that.

So why is pharma and their captured media down on it?  Because they cannot legally sell or profit from their new expensive drugs if there is an older or natural drug that does the job better."

His pediatrician told me it looked like covid---fatigue and a temp that would not fall. We both had covid tests, both negative. After I became ill w shortness of breath and low pulse ox I had an antibody test which came back positive for IgM antibodies. My doctor had me retested 2 weeks later and both IgM and IgG antibodies were negative. Did we have covid? Who knows? I never felt I understood the accuracy of this test and if I should assume I had it based on the brief IgM positive. I remain mystified."
2020-08-10 10:48:53,"My doctor said allergies, did not recommend a test. My kids doctor, same thing. We all have different symptoms are and feeling mostly better now. I asked for all of us to be tested but we’re denied. This was last week. We have been living as if we are still on lockdown, but go outside most of the day. We walk, bike ride, do sports in the yard. We wear masks, stay more than 6 feet away from anyone, and rarely come across another person, so no idea where we could have caught it. Perhaps that is why the docs said no test? Or does the virus stay in you until it it ready to show itself."
2020-08-10 08:58:32,"It is frustrating to read another article that contradicts the status quo on Covid.   I have read over a dozen articles stating the PCR test is close to 100% accurate ( but the antigen test giving 20% or so false negatives).  Now comes this article to say that the virus might not park itself in your  your nose at all,  giving you a false negative on the PCR.  Any idea how often this happens?"

2020-08-10 13:16:56,"Here's another symptom that I had not heard about - and was not mentioned in this story.  A close friend has been extremely fatigued, barely able to move, body aches, chills, and temp.  All normal symptoms.  But a sudden, weird thing is a need to urinate four or five times an hour.  So I googled it and, yep, first hit was of a study of males presenting with Covid symptoms.  7 out of 57 had this sudden and unusual increased urination.

He's waiting for test results but I think he definitely has it."
2020-08-10 22:46:49,Nationwide testing is a must for every student and teacher. Until everyone is tested we are all at risk. Out once great country should be capable of this simple goal. The stories of Covid 19 survivors indicate the seriousness of this pandemic.
2020-08-11 11:34:08,"@Tara Parker-Pope  Question,  but first, awesome work!.  My reads have me believing in viral dosage accumulation as necessary.  Mask is important both directions.  However, if you are somewhere with poor fresh air changeover--aerosol transmission will get you, mask or no mask.  So my question is:  Airlines should be accumulating data on this.  I used to fly often, understand HEPA filters/HVAC and simply don't believe the fresh air turnover is high.  Fresh being the key word, lots of air movement if not fresh is likely worse--more gulps of the little devil, eh.  Especially on the little 'regional' jets.  Who is tracking this data?  We should be able to answer this stone cold by now.  Data is an amazing tool and this should be very clean and discern-able data.  1 hour vs 4 hour flights?  High end HVAC vs jump jet HVAC?  I hope the airlines are transparent."
2020-08-11 11:59:06,"Two weeks ago I had a fever for two days.  Tested positive. But luckily no other symptoms other than some head congestion.  The rest, nada.  I feel very lucky, but confused about the disease.  And I’m over 70."

2020-08-11 15:17:58,"Does the fact that when the virus shows itself as primarily in the GI tract, NP swabs are more frequently negative imply that the virus might also be transmitted via the oral-fecal route, and therefore, it might also be food borne?"
2020-08-11 17:58:32,"Thank you for explaining the many symptoms associated with this virus. It helps to know what to look for. It is a concern that some with only gastrointestinal symptoms test negative. There should be more back up testing methods such a saliva, as well as the fecal test you mentioned.
 I currently go hazmat when in public, with a moldex 8000 respirator, and lab gloves. I used to work in a research lab, and still had my respirator which I rebuilt in February hoping I really wouldn't need to use it. It's now the only way I feel safe grocery shopping these days."

2020-08-12 03:44:35,"Very interesting report - thanks

Since this virus has the base RNA (tool set) of the SARS virus it always seemed likely it would infect the gastrointestinal tract some times.  Tests that focus on the respiratory infection are not going to be perfect.  

Similarly the infection is interacting with humans who are in varying states of age, health, stress etc.  It seems clear that our fast food system is encouraging inflammations that may be complicating the covid-19 symptoms and over-reaction of the immune response.  

I hope we will see more research teasing these aspects apart"
2020-08-12 14:30:25,"Wondering if I had covid. All of February into March sinus gunk, very bad cough, fever,tired. Treated for sinusitis,then bronchitis (3 rounds of antibiotics, inhaler,steroids)One UC Dr. told me lungs sounded ‘crunchy’ (?)
March 9 dr ordered X-ray for possible pneumonia, negative,but CT showed multiple(a lot)bilateral pulmonary embolisms. Hospital for 4 days ,no covid test just treatment with blood thinners.  5 months later, clots gone but I’m left with a very achy body,joints,still get out of breath ,and also have had hair loss(a lot more than normal) Feel like I’m 100. 
Did antibody test, negative;dr said they aren’t accurate.  Did I have covid?  Should I try another test?"
2020-08-14 00:48:34,"I felt tired one Sunday Evening.  Monday morning I was having trouble breathing, had a cough, and fever.  By the time I had a 5:30 doctor’s appt that day I had pneumonia and was septic.  BP 60/40 pulse ox in the 60’s. I spent a week in ICU.  I tested positive for the flu, but because it was mid Feb, I did not get a covid test.  I strongly suspect covid.  Could I have had both?"
2020-08-14 08:23:10,"The symptom variations among folks with Covid are fascinating to me and reports about it have been helpful in coping.  
Early on there were weeks of runny nose, some days of fever and diarrhea, but primary symptom for me was deep and persistent fatigue, a powerful involuntary drop into sleep, many hours of most days.  Then I'd have some hours of ""normal"".  Experienced less feeling ""ill"" than feeling sapped. And the recurring conjunctivitis is also worth a mention, for it contributed to fatigue. In mid-May, after 4 months, I can pinpoint the day the virus died because any fatigue felt ordinary, not overpowering, and, currently, my baseline strength is good."
2020-08-15 14:35:50,"My husband and I flew from NY to Memphis at the beginning of December 2019 to have a renowned surgeon remove a cancerous tumor from his abdominal area.  We arrived December 3,  the surgery took place a week later and was successful except that he started having trouble breathing.  The doctor insisted he was fine even though he was loathe to give up the oxygen cannula.  We barely made it home on December 1, 2019.  By the end of December he was in the hospital here on Long Island with a ""Mysterious Lung Disease"".  He deteriorated and passed away on February 10, 2020 a month before the powers that be decided that the first COVID-19 was diagnosed.  I will never know if he had COVID but my instincts tell me he did.  My husband survived 5 years of liver cancer,  a liver transplant and chemotherapy.  The first week in Memphis we went out to dinner every night and enjoyed Beale street and other attractions in the city.  He was fine.  He came back to NY barely breathing and needing a wheelchair.  Something went on there."
2020-08-16 04:46:32,"How often do the tests give false negatives? Two of my coworkers were very sick with high fever, sore throat, fatigue, cough, and headaches... they were both sick for over a week. Our workplace was at the exact time a covid19 cluster with over 100 known cases and 2 deaths... I have to wonder if there is a sizable chance that my coworkers also had it but tested negative. Do you know the false negative rates for the virus test? also for the antibody test, what IGG ranges are considered positive? A friend got results with IG counts but was told it was negative. Do we know enough yet to determine the ranges of positive or negative accurately for the antibody tests? Thanks!"
2020-08-16 17:15:00,"One thing I hope many people are learning as they move thru this new normal. I hope that more people are becoming more in-tune with their body and how its sends you signals of the issues its having. 

That a sudden ache might not mean much. But that an incessant pain, or chronic sniffle, etc., can be subtle signals of an injury or illness. 

Being fully body-aware is a huge help to not only yourself, but also a doctor when you seek their help. A generic; ""I dont feel well,"" aint much help. But a; ""Well on Nov 1, I began noticing...and by Dec 5, it was here, and then I started to notice that X..."" - can be great aids for diagnosing what ails you.

Learning how you move (most people move poorly) how you are effected by changes in environment, when you do things (are you a better AM or PM exerciser?) how do foods really effect me, or I have adopted intolerance's as a thing to do.

Being body-(self)aware and learning its nuances is truly taking personal responsibility for ones health and wellness. 

So I hope all the locked-downer's who started their yoga, dance, or other body practices are learning the larger lessons and not just plowing thru to kill time and distract from the other issues. 

Be better at inhabiting your body...be a better pilot, and diagnostician of your vessel."

2020-08-18 12:14:04,Someone should investigate whether or not people who only get gastro symptoms ingested the virus that was on their food.  That wouldn't be good news for restaurants.  It would mean you would have to heat all carryout food to kill the virus.

2020-08-24 14:48:19,Thank you for the list of possible symptoms. Your article has certainly made me more cautious and careful about mask wearing.
2020-08-24 13:29:28,"We are very sure that covid can be inhaled.  We are pretty sure that it can be touched and then ingested by touching and swallowing (Infected food, surface, theing, etc.

So to say that it is a mystery how the respiratory tract infection can be skipped is an odd thing in an article that purports to inform.  The covid ""finds itself"" in the digestive tract, and that's where it infects, there is no skipping, just a different point of attack - and hence different symptoms.

So you might pass the exhaust of an infected team of bicyclists who rode by twenty minutes ago, or a friend you were just chatting loudly with10 feet awayh with masks on.  (respiratory)

Or you might eat some fruit or vegetable placed on the shelf by an infected grocery store worker, without quarantining it or wasing it with antiviral.  Or you might touch that same fruit or vegetable, have a bowel movement, and wipe with toilet paper - - all without washing your hands for 30 seconds (note - this is a wash before, or wash yourself twice before and the fruit at least once before situation. (digestive)

Let's imagine how it gets into the blood -  that might be the most ""downstream/skipping"" path of infection - where we might wonder why it skipped one of the other two.  It might be necessary to take a hard look at how cellular matter from either the lungs or the intestinal tract interacts with the blood stream to understand that one. (blood infection)"
2020-08-26 07:50:24,I just got tested again I went to the community clinic about two weeks ago with strange hip and stomach pain plus chest pain. The nurse practitioner told me I had heartburn gave some pills for it. This past weekend I start having trouble breathing at work. I use my inhaler and finish the next day which is Sunday I get worse. They tested me at the hospital and now I am waiting to see if I had covid this whole time. The doctors have been calling me multiple times a day since then but I still haven't got my results.
2020-08-29 04:16:16,"I have been having stomach issues for over 2 months with loss of appetite. No nausea or vomiting. Just discomfort in my upper abdomen, belching (charming, I know). I went to a GI doctor a few days ago and he was planning on doing an endoscopy, but first I had to have a COVID test. I had the nasal swab and was stunned when it came back positive. Not sure what to expect in the coming days. I hope this is it and it eventually resolves."
2020-08-30 02:06:07,"All 4 members of our family had the virus in late March thru mid to late April (2-5 weeks recovery). Even now in August some weird symptoms linger. Hair loss for me and the Covid type pain behind my knees still comes and goes, my husband has not regained his taste and smell, one son has had bouts of eye twitching and tinnitus. My weirdest symptom when I was sick? I couldn’t wear a bra because my skin in the rib cage area hurt too much. My husband and son had vertigo. We all had mind numbing brain fog and awful fatigue. Headaches, horrible  gastrointestinal issues with lingering intense stomach cramps, blinding headache, shortness of breath, weird cough, dizziness, and more. Bizarre virus. I cannot fathom having this and being asymptomatic."
2020-08-30 13:11:03,"In the various comments, there were mentioning of C19 being present in the digestive tract and even blood.  How did the said C19 virus enter these routes since the harsh acid condition in the stomach is understood to destroy the virus upon entry (hence, the little to zilch evidence to support transmission through food and/or packaging).  From what I learned...so far, C19 is primary a respiratory transmitted disease. Or, are there insinuations indicating the virus bypasses the lungs, enters the blood stream and went to town from there? Great article by the way.  And thank you in advance."

After that I wasn't quite as tired, but the 3 toes on the outside of both my feet turned  black and blue.  I blew that off figuring I must have stubbed them and just didn't remember it.   Then for 2 days I couldn't remember how to use my remote for the tv.  (I could record, change channel, and everything else in the dark.) That ended THANK GOD!!  But for at least a month after that, nothing I ate tasted like it should have, and I got an horrific cough.  All the way to my feet wet cough.  
I did not get tested for a personal reason, but I didn't go out either.  Now only with a mask.
I really do not understand why anyone go out without one.
I remember that when our state turned red, and we joined the Pandemic thinking ""Oh so this is how I am going to die"".  So many have. I was lucky."
2020-08-05 13:52:26,"I’m not sure this helped any.  I think now I’ve had Coronavirus for the past 2 months. Or that nasal drip and eye pain could have been my allergies, the diarrhea from my period, the sore throat from the radiation I had there last year, the tightness in my chest anxiety…."
2020-08-05 13:57:23,This didn't alleviate any of my paranoia about symptoms. A lot of these are still shared with allergies.

2020-08-05 14:38:39,"In smoke the Carbon Monoxide shares the same binding sites as O2 in blood hemoglobin (Hg), and actually has 210 times greater affinity than O2. So when you smoke, the CO travels across and prevents some Hg from picking up oxygen. If one is a heavy smoker a pulse ox may not give a correct saturation reading."
2020-08-05 14:45:47,"I am not sure this helps more than it confuses. This almost looks like a hypochondriac's dream come true. It may help if you indicated that if only a,b, and c are there you most likely have disease A and not necessarily COVID. It is a probabilistic game, and showing that the confluence of various symptoms yields the highest probability for one disease vs another would be helpful."
2020-08-05 14:53:26,"I had most of these symptoms this spring--twice--what was at the time considered ""mild"" or ""not COVID19"" because I wasn't dying. Yet by the time I was able to get tested in June, not only did I not have COVID, I didn't have any antibodies either, so it appeared that I never had COVID (if I had it, it's impossible to tell). Yet I am still suffering inflammatory symptoms, which are exacerbated by almost any sort of challenge to my system.

It's pretty unhelpful to have a long list of symptoms, many of which are very common, and yet have testing be both out of reach and so slow as to be useless! 

Having fragile health in the first place, it makes it very hard to know how to proceed when I feel sick. The anxiety; however, is real."
2020-08-05 14:56:18,"This may have helped some, but not me. I have had many of these symptoms daily for the past several years. I never had problems with allergies until about age 60. Now I live with a wet cough day and night, causing fatigue and often a sore throat from post-nasal drip. The drip also produces an upset stomach. My sinus congestion gives me frequent headaches, and I sneeze. This all despite using an oral allergy medication, as well as Fluticasone and Azelastine. Maybe I was patient zero of Covid-11?"
2020-08-05 15:00:00,This appears to be a list of every medical symptom that I've ever heard of. Is there any symptom that does not mean you might have COVID-19?
2020-08-05 15:05:56,"The article's graphic approach fails.  Even though the symptoms are revealed in order of their importance, by the end, all the reader gets is a bunch of possibilities, most of which are commonplace.

At minimum, someone should add a concluding graphic underscoring the symptoms to worry about the most.

And in the future, when trying an innovative graphic approach to an important problem, try it out on someone first."
2020-08-05 15:06:00,"Several comments blame this review for being confusing because it lists too many symptom that are not unique to COVID. That unfortunately is the issue with this virus--it can manifest itself in many ways, and many symptoms are, by themselves, not diagnostic. But in combination with others they probably are. It is good for the readers to be aware of this, and this review sums it up very well."
2020-08-05 15:06:01,"""Am I coming down with a cold, the flu, or COVID?"" That's the question that I expect millions of Americans would like to be able to answer. 

This article seems to list almost everything as a symptom. But a closer read shows that you list four symptoms - fever, loss of taste or smell, dry cough, fatigue - as very common among Covid patients. 

Since fever, cough and fatigue sound like flu symptoms, loss of taste or smell takes on profound importance. Then you provide your supporting data: ""In one study, 87% of patients lost their sense of smell, and 56% reported loss of taste.”

One study?  There have been hundreds of studies on the initial symptoms. If your evidence is one study, it's time to rethink this article."
2020-08-05 15:15:56,"Thank you to the journalists and the excellent graphics team at the NYTimes for this easy-to-understand approach, and to the scientists and health experts who contributed their knowledge.

2020-08-05 15:29:39,"This infographic is very helpful, especially with the 'lesser known' symptoms.

My sister almost definitely had Covid, but because she  tested late, she tested negative. 
Her doctor suggested she did indeed have it.

Her main symptoms were: cough, tight chest, loss of taste/smell, fatigue. Now almost 3 months later, she still has some 'after-effects' such as weird rashes, and other inflammatory symptoms.
Just because you test negative doesn't mean you're Covid negative.
So imagine how many people really do have it, considering many who've tested negative or had mild symptoms?"
2020-08-05 15:30:46,"I guess we all want some clarity and certainty in this most dangerous time. But what if there isn't any? The list of symptoms keep growing,? The virus keeps changing? The control and cure impossible to nail down? 

We've placed ourselves at the mercy of man made systems ill equipped to deal with forces of nature that will run their course no matter what we do. 

Look at every single thing we've tried to do to stop infection, disease, death itself and all we've managed to do is create ever more drug resistant pathogens, ever more people on this earth, ever more consumption, more and more, just like mice when times are good and we will go just like mice when things reach the tipping point. We're not exempt. We're not special. Not in the grand scheme of things. 

We've made a pretty complicated mess out of things and there are no easy answers anymore. This virus is also complicated and will continue to get more so. Even if we find a vaccine for this one, the next one will appear right behind it. 

Good news is that the cure for all of it is obvious and available to all.  Bad news is that most of us are too invested in the very thing that has brought us to this pass. So be it. We will learn the hard way."

I am taking heart that so many scientists in Universities the world over are focussed on this virus. The understanding of this strange virus that seems to take immense control of our physiology from inside, is fascinating. In a strange way it mirrors the Republican government we have at present that is eating us away from within the country and severing internal connections and signals between the executive, judiciary and Senate, leaving us all in panic, disarray and quite fatigued."
2020-08-05 14:34:52,"instead of focusing on symptoms or pills maybe instead determine who can get sick and who wont. and thats people with *compromised immune systems*. two new study confirmed what I've said for months;

1. first states ""a reason SARS is so successful and dangerous is that it suppresses non-specific immune response"" ie that it weakens immune response. in people who *already* have weakened immune systems. 

2. second says ""One of immune system’s oldest branches, complement, may be influencing the severity of COVID-19, according to a new study from Columbia University."" ie weakness in complement (caused by already compromised immune system) makes it alot worse and in many cases, also a kiss of death in those people.

and who exactly is this compromised group? 

1. type 2 diabetic, prediabetic (70% have undiagnosed  pre conditions, one of the most egregious failure of the US health care system to identify these people. all it takes is an A1C glucose test. they people make up largest majority of the most susceptible cases except for.....
2. the morbidly obese. this  *alone* is a THE biggest factor. excess body fat is a huge factory of endocrine disruptors. with a compromised immune system, its a deadly combo
3. older folks and ones with high blood pressure, serious lung issues are at risk too just not as much as above. but noting diabetics and fat people are at far greater risk might risk offending them. we dont want to do that, we'd rather kill them and the economy. great strategy!"
2020-08-05 14:43:46,I think its extremely helpful to have this information all in one place. For some this site is the window to the world and it just makes sense to have this information here. It clearly shows the combination of symptoms that may be cause for concern.

2020-08-05 15:37:53,"If we'd had a strong nationwide testing program, one that was pushed off the ground in March/April, I'd feel better about getting tested.  After seeing the excellent graphics and symptom list, however, I wonder if I've had Covid already, as many of theses signs have come and gone over the past 6 months.  My personal question: why should I bother to get tested, as the results take so long (up to 10 days)? I see more risk exposing myself to those brave souls administering the test than just staying home.
I don't go out, etc., so unless there's an antibody test available, I don't see the value (just speaking for me)."
2020-08-05 15:42:00,"Nice graphics, but the info could've been a bit more tailored by showing the major symptoms reported in the majority of cases as oppose to any symptoms popping up everywhere."
2020-08-05 15:49:20,"This article and associated infographic was useful. It appears that some commenters are deflecting their frustration with the complexity and unpredictability of COVID-19 to the authors. 

If taken alongside other information such as the importance of contact tracing, the article is particularly helpful. It doesn't calculate the risk for you, but it does present comprehensive risk factors in order of significance.  If the standard for usefulness is a reliable risk calculator, push-button/get-banana, then good luck finding a useful tool."
2020-08-05 15:57:37,"And I see all those ""show my nose over my mask"" people-- usually men of all ages and ethnic groups--on my buses, sidewalks, grocery and pharmacy store aisles.  
How can we get through to them that this nose showing is not any kind of political  or identity statement but is dangerous to Them for Their  getting COVID infection? How has our U.S. education system failed them in the teaching of basic science about infectious diseases? Or in some schools is this information still seen as ""germ theory"" like ""evolution theory.""  Or should I not care any more  as I wear two full covering masks (one a medical mask) and given these days my own health is being jeopardized by  higher than normal stress related blood pressure readings?"
2020-08-05 14:56:19,"Once again the typical human is depicted as male. If you can show a child that is gender neutral, you can do it for an adult. Very disappointed."
2020-08-05 15:34:19,This works both ways my mother had fever lower chest pain and loss of appetite Googled her symptoms and came up with gall stones phoned gp who went through check list and said no you have the virus you must go for the test after a 10 min argument she reluctantly went for the test luckily the A&E doctor did other tests it was an infected gall bladder if she had just gone to a test centre she probably would have died waiting for the results
2020-08-05 15:40:23,‘Painful headache’? Has anyone ever had a headache that wasn’t painful? Is this term not a pleonasm?
2020-08-05 15:48:55,"Too fancy by a half, my computer screen would not show all of the graphics at one time even on full screen, so a lot of the captions, parts of the body, and explanations were off-screen, which isn't the easiest way to read them."
2020-08-05 15:51:51,"People, people, people:

The reason that this piece confuses you is that the missing part is what medical professionals are trained to do:  use clinician examination, testing, and  a diagnostic ""tree"" to determine if you have an allergy, strep, flu, asthma, a stroke, or COVID.

If we could all self-diagnose, there would be no need to go to medical school or do a residency.  We could all go to the beach instead of taking organic chemistry....

Every symptom of COVID, on it's own, can be another disorder or illness.  Understanding medicine takes more than reading a few articles.

Use this as a resource, but if you think you have been exposed and/or you have serious symptoms, see a professional.  If you are in a vulnerable category, be very careful and consult your medical provider.

But please don't complain that the NYT is making it harder for you to diagnose yourself."
2020-08-05 16:05:14,"All the more reason we need to keep informed about changes in the virus and symptoms, as well as being very vigilant about our own health."
2020-08-05 16:07:39,"I agree with all of the other comments regarding this article not being helpful in differentiating symptoms of allergies vs. cold vs. flu vs. Covid. All it did was serve to add to the confusion, anxiety, and paranoia regarding symptoms. Only the first graphic stating the three most common symptoms was helpful but then again, anyone paying any attention to Covid news already knew this info."
2020-08-05 16:16:14,I bought a pulse oximeter for psychological reasons.  It helps me avoid panic when I feel any of the myriad of secondary symptoms listed which I can conjure up.  So far it is keeping me sane.
2020-08-05 16:16:43,The most important item is whether the person has had contact with others in unventilated areas especially while unmasked. With the virus as widespread as it is now anyone outside a person's bubble can be a silent source of contagion. We know we are negative because we dont talk or remain in the vicinity of anyone unmasked and limit our conversations to masked people outside and at least 6 feet away.
2020-08-05 16:18:31,"Protect the vulnerable.  Keep your hands and face clean. If symptoms persist then contact your doctor, or get tested."
2020-08-05 16:30:49,"If everyone who presented with one of these symptoms self-isolated for 10 day (current recommendation in Indiana) then there would be no one who wasn't self-isolating.

The CDC's current recommendation for return to school of children who present with one of the symptoms is to follow pre-Covid guidelines in place for the school (e.g. 24 hours after cessation of fever) UNLESS the child lives in an area with high community transmission OR the child was exposed to someone who was infected.

That guideline also suggested ""cough"" should be interpreted as a significant one and that represented a change from base for people with asthma or other breathing issues.

See the CDC guidance by searching for - 
""Screening K-12 Students for Symptoms of COVID-19: Limitations and Considerations"""
2020-08-05 16:48:18,"I appreciate the thoroughness of this article, and maybe it's just testament to the virus's wiliness, but good lord, this list of symptoms suggests it could be anything at any time. My right eye has been dry and itchy: allergies or the rona? I might more out of breath than usual on the treadmill: recent sloth, or the rona? Woke up yesterday with a headache: change in barometric pressure (thanks Isaias) or the rona? No way to know without a test, but with this range of symptoms, we'd all have to be tested multiple times a week."
2020-08-05 16:51:40,"I didn't find this article very helpful.  I often have a stuffy nose, post-nasal drip, and sporadic cough.  I have allergies.....I'm 65, so I have aches and pains on occasion.   Unfortunately I think unless someone develops severe shortness of breath they don't know what to think.  Getting a test still isn't easy or fast in more places.  The stress of second guessing every twinge and sneeze is almost as bad as the disease."
2020-08-05 16:54:35,Putting the right symptoms together with your own recollection of where and how you might have been exposed could help reinforce your conviction that you actually have this disease. It is highly transmissible but you are more likely to acquire symptoms from visiting a dentist office for an hour where staff does not wear masks than  if you are in a grocery store for 30 minutes with proper precautions.
2020-08-05 16:07:30,"I provide outpatient pulmonary care for patients with chronic respiratory infections. In my experience, airway clearance therapies including nasal saline rinses, oscillating positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) ""flutter"" valves and nebulized Hypertonic Saline reduce the lower respiratory burden of inhaled pathogens. These interventions are clinically proven to be effective in cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitis, but have not yet undergone controlled clinical trials in viral respiratory illnesses. An outstanding recent paper in Cell from Drs. R. Boucher and R. Baric demonstrates that COVID replicates in ciliated nasal epithelial cells and can inoculate the lungs by microaspiration. I suggest that airway clearance therapies might reduce the burden of respiratory pathogens and clinical illness. My pulmonary colleagues emphasize that fluttering must be performed in a setting that does not inoculate virus into others."
2020-08-05 16:54:48,"The responses here are examples of the confusion wrought by the pandemic, which has stricken our government, a large segment of the general public, and even health experts at times.  This confusion is what has allowed the Coronavirus to spread so easily.  Clever virus.  The point of the article should be: any prominent symptom not usual to your history, go get a test if that is at all possible. Tests being rationed in your area?  Why, that's all part of the confusion, isn't it? What part of 'widespread and readily available testing' do you not understand, health officials?  You know better!  Quit allowing the virus to dictate policy!"
2020-08-05 15:59:53,Sooooooo... basically anything and everything could be Covid-19...?
2020-08-05 13:34:59,I know your trying to help but you are describing just about every symptom known to medical science as being a possible Covid 19.
2020-08-05 14:25:37,It would be nice if we all could just get TESTED.
2020-08-05 14:50:55,"Incredible graphic BUT predictably, a male subject. I’m rooting for you NYT! Lead the way by not reinforcing the medical research practice of treating  deviation from maleness as deviation from the norm."
2020-08-05 14:18:54,Creepiest/funniest graphic I've ever seen in the NYT. Thanks!
2020-08-05 17:05:26,"6 weeks ago, I had an episode which was unlike  the common cold, flu, or allergies with which I am familiar.

For the first four days, I had a moderate to severe headache that lasted and faded over 5 days (I have never had a headache last this long). Had a sore throat present for 3 of the 5 days just inside the back of my lower jaw, near the lymph nodes of the front, upper neck. Note, this was not the classic, back of the throat sore throat. Lastly, had sudden fatigue hit late one afternoon which put me to bed, but was gone the next day.

This occurred too late in the season to be allergies in Maine and I highly doubt it was a cold or the flu. No congestion whatsoever. It makes me wonder if I had covid-19, but am thinking I may never know."
2020-08-05 17:13:12,"I had Covid and find the symptom list correct (no fever for me, body chills and aches, extreme fatigue) whereas in the beginning my symptoms did not seem to be represented in most articles. The significant item of information I have to offer to those who are wondering if this symptom or that is Covid is that I knew immediately what I was feeling was something other than a cold or the flu. It also began in my nasal passages with a burning sensation that wouldn’t go away for maybe 24 hours though I never had nasal congestion or a cough."
2020-08-05 17:15:38,Every time I read one of these articles I cannot shake the feeling that they are so general because the newspaper doesn't want to get sued for providing medical advice. Many commenters are right: these are pretty indistinguishable symptoms from most everything else. Fever's got to top the list though. At least for me. Don't get those very often.
2020-08-05 17:26:08,I read this piece thinking it would be helpful in sorting out my fears from likely reality. Nope. Any new symptom I have in pretty much any part of my body may be COVID-19. Yikes. I was already too focused on every twinge and sneeze. When should I be concerned? Pretty much always I guess. It's the kitchen sink.
2020-08-05 17:31:05,"My province has had a COVID 19 app. for many months, with all the stats. as well as a self assessment tool. After completing it, the advice pops up, either monitor your symptoms, call the COVID hotline for further assessment, or “Get a COVID test”. I had enough symptoms to get that response and got the test that day. I had my diagnosis online in less than 24 hours, (meaning I did not have to self-isolate long.) What was also comforting (I was negative) is that there is a follow-up questionnaire on the app, checking in, to see if I required any follow up. 

I am wondering if individual states in the U.S. have these apps, as it is so helpful to have."
2020-08-05 17:59:22,Know of any good source on whether or not wearing a mask helps protect the one wearing it? There might be more mask compliance if we didn't have to rely on feelings of responsibility for others and believed we were protecting ourselves.
2020-08-05 18:23:34,For some reason you have not given enough importance to headache which increasingly appears to be an important symptom. A UK study that is just out used 6 clusters of symptoms and each cluster had one common symptom - headache.
2020-08-05 18:26:26,"I know the severity of symptoms varies greatly, but my experience with covid was definitely unlike any other illness I've ever had. I spent 4-5 days in bed, so fatigued that I left the same tv channel run all day because I couldn't pick up my hand to get the remote. I had very strange bodily sensations like I had taken some bad acid. At night, I shivered so hard my body was jumping off the mattress and my clothes and sheets were drenched in sweat. Getting tested was out of the question until Day 5 because there was no way I could even get out to the car, let alone wait in a waiting room."
2020-08-05 18:27:24,"“the CDC says that congestion and post-nasal drip are common signs” 

I have definitely seen congestion listed as a symptom by the CDC, but not post-nasal drip.  In fact, when I search ‘cdc “post-nasal drip” covid’, I don’t seem to get any results suggesting this as a symptom for COVID.  Maybe this is a new development?  Could you link to the CDC guidance specifically mentioning post-nasal drip as a common symptom for COVID?"
2020-08-05 19:43:52,"I found the graphic interesting, but NOT helpful and sometimes confusing. Sometimes simplicity is better than trying to impress.

I have many of the symptoms at various times, but I don't think they are COVID."
2020-08-05 19:46:04,"It's a viral illness so of course there are lots of similar symptoms to other viral illnesses and different presentations that seems to run the gamut of mild to severe. The one outstanding thing noticed in most patients we've seen and in those who have been tested but not needed hospital care is the fatigue. To my experience, it seems to be a monumental, severe, a never experienced exhaustion in most. We've seen it in athletes, young and old, those with and without severe cough fever, milder symptoms etc. Several confirmed folks have had the nasal congestion sinus stuff and again with these particular folks it was not your simple allergy congestion (in those I've spoken with my N=3 sample ; ), but a burning all out assault on sinuses. Again, I suspect it could also run the range of mild to more severe depending on the person. How about we're still talking about not enough tests in August? Hard to fathom but here we are. My advice- keep physical distance, mask up if you are closer to others or have to be (essential work the only reason imo), outside is better but if standing and chatting outside you should also mask up and keep distance."
2020-08-05 20:00:47,"I was miserably ill for about a week at the end of February. At that time, you couldn't be tested unless you were hospitalized. I had a violent cough that was unrelenting, my head pounded very painfully, and my chest ached. At one point, it was all so painful, I just wept. My husband gave me his mother's home remedy to ease the cough as cough medicine wasn't working: a bowl of chopped onions to eat, with some honey drizzled on top. Since I could not smell or taste it, I ate it. It helped for awhile. If we hadn't had an inhaler for my mild asthma, I think I would have needed to go the hospital. A month after recovering, a thoracic nerve flared up for no discernible reason. The pain was excruciating. I can't help wondering if there was a connection between that and my likely covid infection."
2020-08-05 20:04:16,"So essentially it's just a variant of a flu virus, judging by the symptoms which are similar."
2020-08-05 20:12:32,"A lot of comments saying that this list of COVID-19 symptoms is unhelpful because it's so broad and because so many of the symptoms overlap with other ailments/infections. Yes, it would be comforting to have a short list of symptoms exclusive to COVID-19, but that's just not how the disease presents. It's not the fault of the NYT!  If anything, this round up of symptoms drove home to me how varied the symptoms can be and how difficult it is to diagnose without a diagnostic test."
2020-08-05 20:23:15,"I read the COVID patient and doctor forums, and the signs of infection I consistently see in those forums (in this order) are:

1. Starts with seemingly sudden headache and fatigue (sleep a lot, too), usually in the afternoon or evening, within about 3 to 5 days of suspected exposure. Usually wakes in the  morning feeling better and increasingly worse in the evening and at night. 
2.  Loses sense of smell and taste at around the one week to two week mark.
3. Develops either one (or combo of) cough, chest tightness, aches in legs and hips, difficulty breathing upon walking or talking, back and abdominal pain, GI upset. 
4. Not all have high fevers, but those who do usually complain that it persists or waxes and wanes for weeks

Some of the comments here state that the article is not helpful because it's too broad. But one thing that the forums have taught me is that when you get COVID you will know it. You will know the difference between other illnesses, a cold or allergies, and an infection with the SARS-Cov-2 virus. They all say it's ""different."""
2020-08-05 20:29:02,"Welcome to the world of the cancer survivor, where every odd twinge threatens the spectre of metastatic disease.

You've only had to deal with this for a few months, and a vaccine is on the horizon. Someone like me who was treated for invasive, hormone-positive breast cancer has to live several decades with this stressful uncertainty. My silver lining is that I'm already accustomed to it!"
2020-08-05 20:31:29,"As a teacher heading back to school soon, I have to say this doesn't help a whole lot.  

Almost every year, a mild respiratory bug spreads through the school within the first two-three weeks.  Fall allergies cause many of these symptoms as well.  

On top of that, most of us have a sore throat from using our ""teacher voices"" for the first time in months.  (We are also exhausted from the amount of time and energy that go into the first few weeks.)

What we really need is TESTING!  Quick and easy access to tests with short turnaround.

School will quickly grind to a halt if everyone is forced to treat these routine ailments like COVID, but it would be even worse if people ignored them."
2020-08-05 20:50:49,"Actually this is super helpful and very accurate.  I had no respiratory symptoms but many others and tested positive for antibodies.  The symptoms are numerous, bizarre, and come and go in pairs on a daily basis.  No smell or taste turning to bizarre smells that I don’t think actually exist.  Extreme soreness, covid eye, covid fingers and toes, confusion, slurred speech, random bruising without cause.  Today I slightly scratched my arm and started bleeding profusely.  Thinking is ok but I am super dizzy and barely able to type.  This is a neurological disease first and foremost for me.  The difficultly typing and speaking seem to be some sort of short circuit between what my brain is signalling and how my extremities are reacting.  After getting this virus in March, there is no sign of it letting up.

The issue with interpreting this article is that while the descriptions of the symptoms use the same words as other illnesses, they don’t actually feel the same when you experience them.  So say you are are confused, and someone will say you are menopausal.  Except I was already menopausal and know the difference between not being able to recall a name and suddenly not having any idea what I was just doing.  Sore muscles are different.  They hurt immensely and don’t go away with stretching or moving.  The random rashes appear suddenly and disappear just as suddenly.  I can function but things are clearly not right in my body and we don’t know why."

I was personally struck by the virus ""driving a wedge"" between members of the body that need to be working together and causing a communications breakdown.  Also that the ""body"" is mounting an incredible stress-response and turning against itself, rather than focusing on the real problem.   
Yes, I know that this virus is a real thing, and life is not a novel (or is it?).  But if it were - what would the virus represent?  (PS - I don't know myself, so all of you could potentially earn an ""A"" for this assignment.)"
2020-08-05 15:33:42,"Thank you for making such a complicated problems understandable clearly. This is really a typical work of a Ph.D in microbiology and immunology. 

The idea is not new and almost every physician has understood strategically. The issue is that our immunological system works a very complicated network, up regulated under certain condition while down regulated under another. We simply have no way to identify when it is up and why it will be down. So it is really difficult to find the tipping point the immune system shift its direction making doctors difficult to pinpoint a right time  to suppress or enhance."
2020-08-05 16:01:59,This article suggests to me her is another reason we need more and better testing. If we knew who was carrying the virus researchers could follow them and maybe  even treat them  earlier.

2020-08-05 16:49:33,"This makes me more concerned that testing of any vaccines be thorough, as they basically work by priming the immune system. Since we know so little about how this unusual virus works, we don't want vaccines that trigger severe immune or other responses in even a small number of people, or need a way of screening out potentially sensitive individuals from taking the vaccine (which can only be checked by thorough testing). 

I learned a lot from Dr. Iwasaki's other article debunking claims from some research labs that a vaccine is destined not to work because antibody levels drop (which is, in a nutshell, normal). I would like to read what she thinks about the specific potential problems that need to be investigated before a vaccine for SARS-CoV2 can be approved for human use."

2020-08-05 19:55:30,"I had previously read that some healthy people get very sick from the coronavirus while some unhealthy people get only mild symptoms. The theory to explain this varied response by patients with COVID 19 is the level of exposure to the virus.  Healthy frontline healthcare workers have gotten very sick and have died (high exposure) while some patients with underlying lung problems have only gotten mildly sick (low level of exposure to the virus).  Now, my question.  Does this theory regarding supercharged  immune response debunk this other theory?"

2020-08-08 20:33:32,Lovely article Ross.  It was so refreshing to hear a NY Times writer say ask God for help and keep asking etc - this could help  many.  After all miracles are just unexpected results we don't yet understand.  We're not quite at the Star Trek level yet unfortunately.  Thanks again!!
2020-08-08 20:34:12,"great column — personal, empirical, positive.  

i have not had COVID, hope never to try it. but you've touched on the point of personal responsibility and proaction. 

we hear alot about what leaders do or don't do, what congress will or won't agree on, about the difference between politics and science. 

we don't hear as much about personal responsibility and foresight, about respect to others, about the difference between liberty and freedom. in that realm there is more to be said."
2020-08-08 20:35:37,"Ross, thank you for this thoughtful article.  I hope that you are feeling better.  Yes, I will keep you in my prayers."
2020-08-08 20:46:49,"From an outsider's perspective, you speak often about how family values changed during an era that existed before you were born.  I disagree with pretty much everything you say about the church I was born into and into which you converted.  

Now, speaking from your own experience, your writing voice brings power to the page.  Reaching and not preaching often works.

I will keep you and your family in my thoughts."
2020-08-08 20:50:18,"Be well, Ross. Keep going in the direction you're going. Your family needs you, and well, we appreciate the journey you are on, and that you share it with us. Sometimes a different approach opens up myriad possibilities previously unimagined."
2020-08-08 20:51:23,"Ross. As a long time HIV/AIDS sufferer, including over a year in hospice over 20 yrs ago, I would add ""keep moving."" A body in motion stays in motion says my 94 y.o mom. I was so weak for so long I couldn't walk a block without losing my breath and needing to sit down and rest. A serious lung and body infection will do that. So I say again, keep moving. Start with short walks and maybe a few arm curls with 5lb or 3lb weights. Over time, you will regain most of your stamina. And be patient. Long term recovery takes time."
2020-08-08 20:53:54,"I really appreciate your writing this piece. When the crisis subsides, the dead will be tallied. But many unknown-and-unseen survivors will have lingering effects. Like those 'injured' in war or mass shootings. Survivors are mysterious, we need to get to know them better."
2020-08-08 20:55:29,"I am sorry that this happened to Ross. Even writing that feels empty. Feeble. I know we are throwing everything we have at this disease. I am not as confident as Ross. I only see dark days, darker shadows, and the rent is due.

We are renting our existence, and the question -- why are you here -- has nothing to do with landlords, and everything to do with all the voices of survival. I am here to be here. Through the murmuring of disease we find an inflection that is outside of our internal selves.

I am compelled to wonder when we might just buy the house. Versus renting it. Our bodies. Our anger. We all ask the question, why me. Why anyone. But we dare not look too closely at where such aberations of unleashed virulence comes from because it comes from us. For us. That intersection between the developed world and development itself. There we be. Reinventing hubris because that is what we do.

To be well again begs the question What Is Again. Were we ever well. The existentialist sees glowing horizons. I am glad for those people. Perhaps they will inherit the earth. But what I see is the earth inheriting us, and that means the cruelty and the havoc we have infected it with writ large. Writ one grand scientific day to save us. Nothing will save us because nothing can save us.

I like Ross' take that as we reinvent ourselves,  we can become our own healing. This restructures the magic from magicians to sharing power with what we do not understand. In the end, dark matter wins."
2020-08-08 20:57:49,"Thought I'd throw my two cents in here.  I have a rare swallowing disorder, achalasia, with inexplicable symptoms.  For years I went through the various seeking steps that Douthat outlines, including doctors, dentists, allergists, etc.  Finally my family physician ordered a routine test which created an odd result.  Following that like a trail of breadcrumbs led to one specialist, then another, until a specialist ordered the test that disclosed the disorder.  When being tested, the results were so obvious to the technician that (although medical technicians are not supposed to diagnose you at the time of a test), she let me know immediately that I 'flunked' basic swallowing. Once correctly diagnosed, remedial surgery helped greatly.  And praying to God is always helpful, pertinent and positive.  To paraphrase Luther, the just patient shall live by faith."
2020-08-08 20:58:12,"I understand, I think, where Ross is coming from. I had, for many years, a progressive muscle problem that no doctor could help me with.  I have advanced training in evaluating evidence and research, but I never ever assumed that I could assume the role of medical doctor. Still, my skills and reading allowed me to ask better questions, which led eventually to a simple blood test that showed a vitamin deficiency. Some vitamin supplements followed by another test to fine-tune the dosage resulted in an immediate improvement and a long-term reversal.

My research training and personal initiative helped me ask real doctors useful questions. I did not diagnose myself, nor did I find a non-doctor ""expert"" to make diagnoses. I know that Ross doesn't approve of injecting bleach or whatever. Nevertheless, when a conservative starts advocating alternative medicine, I am immediately reminded of Flouride and Laetrile."
2020-08-08 21:01:24,"One problem with being a ""creature"" is that while there are an infinite number of possible pathogens floating about, there are only a finite number of ways of feeling lousy. Describing your symptoms to a doctor will barely pare down the number of suspects. Unless you're extremely lucky, no test will identify what's bugging you, and testing itself becomes prohibitively expensive after a point. Perhaps in the future, there will be a cheap way to identify foreign DNA or RNA in our bodies and at least give these illnesses a name. Treatment remains another matter. Traditional, herbal medicine, honed over thousands of years, operated on general principles because it preceded germ theory, and is continually being validated by science, so it probably couldn't hurt to add it to your regimen, despite the hostility of the medical establishment."
2020-08-08 21:13:34,"Someone close to me has had Covid-19 pneumonia since early March, at which point he had to be taken to the hospital , gasping for breath.He couldn't breathe on his own ,ran high fevers, coughed & choked uncontrollably, suffered from extreme nausea & vomiting, hallucinated &  experienced cognitive impairment .

A psychologist whose  ability to make a living is predicated on his cognitive ability could not remember that he had been hospitalize three time, or why the family was not allowed to leave the house.

Thankfully, his cognitive abilities were restored ,while his ability to breathe without difficulty has not .He is suffering from debilitating  fatigue as well as well  from Covid-19 pneumonia five months after contracting Coronavirus.

None of his doctors has suggested vitamins or herbs, nor has anyone suggested that he is a hypochondriac, considering that he is struggling to breathe, his X-rays indicate  that he has pneumonia,& his bloodwork is abnormal.

 I know what it is like to have doctors after doctor say :""It's all in your head."" I endured years of :""It's all in your head"" until I awakened one day with itchy designs and impressions covering my skin. I went from :""It's all in your head."" to ""I have NEVER seen anything like that in my life"".

Professors of Medicine and Chiefs of Departments have never come across what I have. I've spend  over six years unable to wear clothing, clawing my skin off, my skin  having been turned into the equivalent of itchy Silly Putty."
2020-08-08 21:21:39,"Thank you for sharing your story, Ross.  I think your grounded recommendations were very timely, particularly the difficulty of dealing with a medical community that itself is frustrated by all the great unknowns of Covid-19.

Nobody wants to hear ""we can't do anything more,"" or ""I think some of this is subjective.""  Part of getting well is trying to regain a semblance of normal, of activity, or pursuing knowlege that can give you hope, not throw you into a stolid passivity.

Again, as you point out, within reason.  Even if just one or two things work, you'll certainly feel better for trying.  As I did when pursuing every option I could to alleviate chronic pain from a serious accident.

Recovery from anything requires action, not wallowing.  I hope this piece gives others incentive to keep on trying."
2020-08-08 21:23:45,"Ross, thanks for sharing and the encouragement on physical ailments. I have my share but what I’m facing now is heart sickness over the condition of our country.  I don’t see any mitigation or a game plan for getting well.  We seem willing to expect the worst from others and accept the worst from ourselves. If it goes on much longer, I’ll just give up."

2020-08-08 21:26:59,"Accept that life is not fair.
Yes, it's a bitter pill to swallow.  But it's one that I have learned in the span of less than 1 year when I went from a (seemingly) healthy 41 year old to being unable to work.
 I had done things right all along.  Ate carefully, exercised religiously, never smoked or used other substances.  But, unbeknownst to me for most of my life, I had autoimmune conditions.  My body was hitting itself.
My first odd neurological symptoms started a week before last Thanksgiving.  Things devolved so rapidly that by the middle of January, I could no longer work.  I went to every specialist and took every diagnostic under the sun, spending most of what I even had.
After the incredibly kind, supportive replies I got from so many of you to a prior comment, - I believe that all your good thoughts worked and I thank you deeply- I won a long struggle with my insurance company for treatment and am partway through a course of antibody infusions.  The goal is to calm my overactive immune system.  I have felt some improvements, but it's uncertain what the long term outcome will be.
I'm tuned in closely to what my body is going through.  I never stopped seeking treatment.  I listen to others' experiences.  I beg God, or the universe, that if I can just work again, I will use my abilities to work for good.  I fight.
But I also know that there are just no guarantees, and my future may not be what I had hoped for.  No matter what, I will be OK."

Especially the sentence ""ask God to help you"" and keep asking when He doesn't seem to answer. 
I've read some of the comments people write when God is mentioned here on the Times. They can be brutal. 
However, having chronic illness helped build my spiritual life to a deeper level yet brought me to a place of accepting my body's mortality. 
Having good days with energy are gifts. 
And I don't take them for granted. 
I so appreciate this article. People with chronic illness need understanding and if normies ""get it"" that we often function on a different groove then hallelujah! 
Hoping so dearly we get a handle on this virus and better days are around the corner."
2020-08-08 21:50:26,"My heart goes out to  those with lingering Covid-19, and to anyone with any little-understood chronic condition. I agree that our doctors deal much more effectively with acute illness than chronic disorders. 
Having faced nightmarish situations with two family members over the last 9 years, I can say that  what made all the difference was keeping up the search for a medical professional with the intellect, interest, empathy, and perseverance  to figure out what was going on and how to address it.  This is New York—we have everything here, All I needed was one person who could figure out how to treat something they DIDN’T learn about in medical school. A tall order, but I found the person eventually. From her, I was able to find other doctors capable of and willing to think outside the box when the need arose. 
NYC has a hidden network of very interesting doctors who don’t reject orthodoxy but can go beyond. I have found that they are also exceptionally moral people.
Keep looking and don’t give up hope."
2020-08-08 21:59:45,"Amen. The only thing I’d add - lean on those who love you, and endure for those you love. As the saying goes, believe it will get better - but fight like an animal to make it so. Convince yourself you will get through, and hang on until the next day. Endurance is a blessing. Ask for strength, have faith you’ll get it, and never give in."
2020-08-08 21:59:51,"When you are diagnosed with a long term degenerative disease that has no known treatments or cures, you come to accept the reality of your situation. They tell you we can't find a causative agent, it's probably hereditary, although we can't be sure. There are things you can do to prolong your ambulatory status but in the end there is no stopping it, a certain calm comes over you. When asked what the consequences of contracting covid 19 would have on you, they use language that is meant not to shock. In the end, I'm a toe-tag in waiting."
2020-08-08 22:00:22,"Suffering with a long term illness that seems to respond to nothing is a very personal and often fearful experience.  We live within the bounds of medical science which turn out to more limited than we expect.  But stepping out into experiences beyond those limits may give one a sense of control that may or may not be true, but helps us deal with the suffering.  It makes you more human and connected with others who suffer if we do not turn in on ourselves.  Mr. Douthat thank you for sharing your journey which is both physical, mental and spiritual.  Sometimes if we are open to it, we can find healing and grace especially when our preconceptions are shattered."
2020-08-08 22:02:46,"Great piece. Informative, honest and heartfelt. Thanks for including the idea of hope and the possibilities of prayer. Very brave."
2020-08-08 22:03:55,"I'm all for some experimentation, when standard medical practices have nothing to offer - everything from vitamins & herbs to physical exercises to mental imagery & even prayer (which, as an atheist, I personally eschew, because I can't take it seriously- but, hey - maybe it'll work for you, & all the better if it does). The one limitation I recommend though is to be sure that whatever it is you're doing just be sure it is not going to cause harm - as the good doctor Hippocrates instructed us. So, for instance, do not attempt surgery at home; or putting carefully metered amounts of rat poison in your food."
2020-08-08 22:05:07,"For readers who may not be religious, or of the same religion, or even if you are,  cognitive therapy can be extremely beneficial.

2020-08-08 22:09:15,"Political differences are not enough to make us feel disunited  in the need to care about one another in truly important circumstances.  I feel very grateful to you, Ross, for this inspiring column today.  Especially the part about becoming your own doctor.  Three years ago I got very ill with something that had some similar symptoms to the covid virus.  I am still dealing with after effects and 5 doctors don’t really know what happened.   

Your story is helpful, I realize I have made progress.  Good health to you."
2020-08-08 22:15:13,I would also recommend Ed Yong's more recent piece in The Atlantic about our response to the virus. It seems very well researched.

I don't typically agree with Mr. Douthat's perspectives and opinions, but certainly wish him all the best and a more complete recovery."
2020-08-08 22:31:05,"The undercurrent of Ross' column is that, no matter what conditions you  may have, or what health care system you may live under, you have to become knowledgeable, so you can be your own best advocate.

Medical professionals are expert (well, some of them, anyway), but they are not prefect; they are not gods.  No one is going to be as expert in your own situation as you--and no one will be more motivated to expand your knowledge of your situation as you.

So, don't be afraid to research.  Stick to reputable sources of information, and shun the less reputable--it is not that hard to tell them apart (NIH and WebMD and websites of major medical centers are better than uncurated message boards).
And, if possible, find doctors who are not intimidated by knowledgeable patients--I know in some non urban locations this is not always easy.

You are the patient.  The experience, the treatment--it's yours.  Ultimately, you have to take responsibility for being informed and for making decisions."
2020-08-08 22:31:18,"If you come down with Covid 19 symptoms and signs,  you should consult a primary care physician who has long experience with infectious diseases like influenza.  He or she should  have privileges at a top university hospital that has other outstanding clinicians and researchers that that he or  she can consult with. If you have lung or blood vessel complications, you should have a consultation with a pulmonary specialist, cardiologist or vascular surgeon.

These experts know a lot about the Corona virus,  its relation to other viruses such as those that cause influenza and polio.  Although there are palliatives, such as remdesivir, their most important task is to make an accurate diagnosis.
Every patient is different.  The PCP should know your history, what you are allergic to, etc.

Don't rely on friends, self-help groups or God."
2020-08-08 22:36:51,"Oxygen saturation is a critical part of keeping the heart working at an appropriate level, as well as keeping the brain working without hallucinations. If you have any coughing during this pandemic, get yourself an oximeter to see what your level,of oxygen saturation is, and use it while walking to see if it goes down. Breathing exercises to strengthen your lungs are ways to keep the lungs working later when it is attacked by those viruses, especially. COVID-19. Scarring of the lungs is a real issue."
2020-08-08 22:39:53,"This was a touching and moving column from a writer with whom I find myself often disagreeing but also grudgingly respecting. (Speaking from the left-of-center, I think America would be much better off if those on the conservative side of our political spectrum were more like Ross Douthat.) Thank you for this frank and revealing column, and best wishes for your full recovery!"
2020-08-08 22:46:46,"I wish Mr Douthat, your conservative friends would read your column and listen to you. Or maybe you need to shout to the right people.

Yes, more Republicans and people who agree with you politically believe Covid (and Lyme disease for that matter) is a ""hoax"", ""like the flu"", that ""children are immune"", that ""it will just go away"", and ""I just don't know anybody that has it so I don't believe it"". 

Why is this view so prevalent among Republicans and conservatives? 

Because of this attitude, the US will never get the number of cases, and the number of deaths, to a level that has now been achieved in Italy, German, Korea. 

Why to conservatives and Republicans accept 1,000+ deaths and 60,000+ new cases a day? Why do they believe we just test too much?

And our economic pain is tied to the presence of the disease in the country. 

You need to reach out to your lonsman Mr Douthat."
2020-08-08 22:48:09,"Mr Douthat, I wish you and your family good health. We are all in this together and need to support each other: every day. I thank you for your honesty and efforts in ensuring we all protect each other by wearing masks, employing physical distancing and not becoming complacent."
2020-08-08 22:51:14,"Oliver Wendell Holmes had a long productive life. He wrote Supreme Court opinions while FDR was president. During the Civil War he’s said to have grabbed Lincoln, visiting the battlefield, and pulled him down into the trench while calling him a fool for exposing his distinctive profile. Looking out his office window at age 90 at a comely woman he’s supposed to have said “Oh to be 80 again.” And when asked the secret of a long and active life he supposedly said “Have a chronic disease and take care of it.”

I think it took me more than a decade as a young man to get over the effects of mono. I had digestive problems that were sometimes debilitating for decades. Wish I’d eaten a better diet the first 30 years of my life; and figured out much earlier how to exercise in ways that were a tonic rather than injurious, not seethe with ever building anger while following the biblical injunction to turn the other cheek, and not become so warily self-protective towards people with whom I had problems.

You’re right about making the effort. I’m sure acupuncture helped me. Changing my diet helped but that can take awhile. Taking a daily constitutional by walking natural ground seems to be a tonic for me. Making an effort to deal with my signature idiocies and reaching a point where the apparent benefit exceeds the intensity of my efforts and the quality of my understanding is a mysterious blessing.

Find what works for you."

I'm glad to hear he's substantially better and appreciate his ""things to do"" list if one is suffering from the longterm effects of a debilitating illness. Ross, I hope you continue to get better and am gratified that your faith has helped you in your healing process. Note to readers: if you have covid symptoms and have a test with negative results, get retested and try to get an antibody test, too. As Ross points out, such was his scenario in March....it was probably a false negative."
2020-08-08 22:54:54,"""If you feel like you need something else to get better, some outside intervention, something more than just your own beleaguered body’s resources, be impatient — and find a way to go in search of it.""

This could've been a call to arms for universal health coverage.  What a wasted opportunity."

2020-08-08 23:00:06,"Ross, your advice is indeed timely.  And as you write, it is not only Covid-19 but also other chronic diseases that I would say most Americans are afflicted with.  In my case, it is Thalessemia, aka Mediterranean Anemia, for my daughter, chronic hypoglycemia.  But I would like to focus as an RN on what you have written.  First, I can not emphasize enough the importance of trusting our own bodies.  More than anyone we know when our bodily homeostasis is off; we know when something is amiss.   We should never be ashamed to persist and insist with our doctors if we are feeling lousy.  Now, as to experimenting, I say please be careful.  Before anyone wants to try what one has heard may assuage symptoms, be darn sure it does not exacerbate that very malady.  Which brings me to the next point:  the internet is not alway our friend.  There is a lot of crazies out there and a lot of quackery, too.  And I am not just referring to politics.  Again, if you read some form of treatment that may just help your malady, check with a reputable physician first.  Finally, for those of us who are believers, sure..we can ask God for help.  But remember that God expects us to not only help ourselves but also to think rationally, with common sense and reason, and wisely."
2020-08-08 23:04:08,"I'm really sorry to hear of your illness, both the more recent COVID related and the one you have suffered for over 5 years now. I am an agnostic, but totally see the value of having faith in helping survive and recover from the illnesses. I wish you the very best and a fast recovery!"
2020-08-08 23:37:17,"I read this article, see pictures of graves by the hundreds dug in Brazil, listen to bike riders in Sturgis w/o mask (it’s our freedom man). The suffering in Beirut, kids crammed into hallways in Georgia, heat increasing, ice burgs melting covering costal lands, resources dwindling and the top twenty percent holding on to there wealth like they know the jig is up........has this world gone mad."
2020-08-08 23:43:04,A good attitude or faith (if you believe) helps but -when a doctor and/or specialty doesn’t provide any improvement or answers keep going to different doctors and different specialists until your health improves. Don’t stop. Keep a detailed record of all test results and symptoms. Make copies and give it to every doctor. Also talk to everyone you know about your symptoms. Sometimes someone knows someone or something. Friends and family may lose interest but you shouldn’t. You are your best advocate.

And unless 4-5 GOP senators are also sent home, anything a new Democratic President tries to do will be stalled in the quagmire of the senate."
2020-08-08 23:47:21,"Good luck, Ross, in treating your long-term illness. Ayur Veda medicine is the longest extant medical tradition in the world. Chinese medicine similarly has a long history. The language and ""science"" of those traditions sounds strange to Western ears, but may be efficacious for some people. 

Oh, and prayer - your own and those of others for you - is beneficial. Western science tells us that is true - although it is agnostic about whether there's a ""God"" intervening in our world to answer those prayers."
2020-08-08 23:50:17,"Most modern medicine is a relatively recent phenomenon. Aspirin wasn't on the market until 1899. That's practically living memory. For the oldest living today, aspirin was a still a novelty when they were born. Diseases like tuberculosis, syphilis, polio, were all things you just lived with. Unless of course you didn't.

It's a bit callus to walk into a doctor's office expecting them to produce a treatment on the fly. Hearing ""I can't help you"" from a doctor is alarming and frustrating. However, mysterianism is more honest than it seems. For all we know about medicine, the field of what we don't know is far greater. The universe of what we don't know we don't know is infinite.

Expecting a doctor to produce infallible knowledge on any subject, is like walking into a bakery and asking the chef to shoe a horse. That's not really what they do in bakeries. Sorry for the misunderstanding. You need to adjust your expectations a bit."
2020-08-09 00:13:30,"I like to joke that I am 17 years into overtime. There was nothing wrong with me until the age of 56. Since then, it has been a slow-motion roller coaster ride, up, down, upside down, with the twists and turns of pain and relief. I am thankful for the doctors, nurses and medical technicians who pulled me from the abyss three times. The strangest thing I have learned is that God has a sense of humor. I am now in love with insomnia. Late night TV, 1 AM to 5 AM, is my fun house: film noir, Scandinavian crime dramas, the talcum powder helpline, Reduce Wrinkles Now! Albert Einstein and I are on the same page. He said, ""I believe in Spinoza's God, who reveals himself in the lawful harmony of all that exists, but not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and doings of mankind."""
2020-08-09 00:25:57,"Ross, thank you for sharing this.  As you mention clearly, the best treatment is ""patient heal thyself"".   Doctors can help us with the crash effects of disease (or injury), but the long-term recovery is a process of our own, and sometimes we know our bodies and reactions to treatments better than anyone else.  Please continue to write on this topic.  Perhaps next time write about spirituality as a part of this process."
2020-08-09 00:31:55,I had a dreadful illness in 1995 when I was 44.  It took me two years to feel normal and back at full strength.  Patience is key.
2020-08-09 00:34:01,"I have a catch-all diagnosis of fibromyalgia, which is most likely chronic Lyme.  I have spent about eighteen years thinking I am smart enough to find a cure, but have now come to the conclusion that the best I’ll be able to do is manage this illness.  I have gone as far as having three people standing around me, talking in tongues!  You get desperate after a while.  And, of course, it’s one of those “you’d never know to look at you because you don’t LOOK sick” diseases.  Everyone has ideas for me as I’m sure they have for you, Ross.  Sometimes the unsolicited advice gets tiresome, even though I know people mean well.

Good advice about connecting with others who have similar symptoms - and that goes for all illness.  There’s power in group energy.  There is so much that doctors don’t know about Covid-19.  They will be working on understanding its effects on the human body for years.

That’s why I get so furious at people who refuse to wear masks.  How can they live with themselves, knowing that they just might pass Covid-19 on to someone who might get very sick or die?  I wish all the long-haulers well.  My heart goes out to them."
2020-08-09 00:40:41,"Ross, thank you for sharing your journey and I hope you health continues to improve.

I am 66 and was recently was diagnosed with Lyme.  Symptoms began with high fevers, aches, extreme fatigue, chills, vomiting.  Everyone thought Covid even though I’ve been extremely careful. I tested negative, but my doctor advised quarantining for 14 days.  Since the symptoms persisted for that entire period, I was tested again.  Still negative. So my doctor ordered some blood work. 

I was more devastated by the diagnosis of Lyme than if it had been covid. I am still on a course of antibiotics and slowly recovering.  I hope we treated it in time. I know too many folks in these parts who have suffered with chronic Lyme for years."
2020-08-09 00:43:42,"Ross, I wish you well, and I was with you up until the last two points. There are very likely some people who will never recover from these long-haul symptoms. I hope very much that you are not among them, and that you're right and you make a full recovery. But please don't suggest that they are less lucky because they haven't asked God for help."
2020-08-09 00:47:13,"Thank you, Mr. Douthat, for your thoughtful column, and best wishes for your recovery.

'Tis said that we all live under a death sentence; it's just that most don't know the date of execution.  Those of us with a chronic and ultimately fatal disease may have a bit better inkling than others.

Under such circumstances, one of the things that his brought some amount of peace is having put my affairs in order, so as to minimize the amount of mess left behind for those whom I love."
2020-08-09 00:48:52,"Ross Douthat, thank you for sharing your struggle with Lyme Disease and your siege with Covid-19.  Your advice is sterling. I know, because I've lived through decades of a debilitating disease that was called ""a wastebasket diagnosis"". My trust and faith in doctors was eroded over the years by inept practitioners in every field of medicine. Yes, we can get better when we trust our body's experiences and our minds and learn it's not ""just in your head"". 

Fear and anxiety shadow us as illness invades our bodies. The long haul is life itself. If you don't trust your doctor, primary or specialist, beat feet to leave him or her and find a better doctor. You learn from your own body's trauma.

Yes, the Internet is our friend, not social media. We can find answers and communities of people online striving to get well. Be leery of fake treatments like our President pushes for Coronavirus. Bleach and bright light inside our bodies isn't the remedy. Believe that your health will get better, and your body will follow your mind.  Mens sana in corpore sano is the ticket from ancient Greece right down to our days in America. Living is stressful, and we learn to take our lives, well or ill, one day at a time."
2020-08-09 00:49:32,"Ross, while reading not only your essay but also the words of your readers, I think of that wonderful Serenity Prayer:

""God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.""

By the way, one further helpful hint:  Yoga.  It does wonders.  Namaste to all."
2020-08-09 00:51:34,"I agree 110% It may have been said already, but worth repeating:  find a good naturopathic doctor.   If they can’t find a solution, find another one who won’t give up.  If one doesn’t believe in God, then one should ask whatever higher power they DO believe in, including their own innate wisdom, to help."
2020-08-09 00:51:45,"Thank you for this article. I read Ed Yong's article as well. He is one of the few people I've seen in the mainstream media who've mentioned COVID-19 possibly morphing into ME/CFS (myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome). Which has many similarities to Lyme disease.  But I'm not surprised the medical community seems to be almost ignoring this possibility, though Dr. Fauci did mention it once. I've had ME/CFS for over 20 years, and was told by doctors multiple times that it was all in my head. I was lucky to get a diagnosis from a specialist at UCLA in pretty short order. The advice you give for dealing with Lyme is the same I'd give for dealing with ME/CFS. I was very alarmed to hear some doctors telling COVID-19 long-haulers to exercise. No!!! If they do that, and they're dealing with ME/CFS, they could permanently worsen their condition."
2020-08-09 00:53:35,"Back in March, I was able to link all of my strange symptoms to some of the reports coming out of China.   After one day with a fever, I had absolutely no chest or respiratory problems, the virus made its way straight to my digestive system and caused various symptoms including inflammation around my abdomen and lower back.  Now we know that 38 percent of people have only digestive symptoms, but I had to figure out that I needed a fecal test to diagnose covid after the nasal swab came back negative.

Without internet searches I never would have realized that my best relief would come from Pepcid Complete and eating very mild foods like toast and white rice for a week.  But I figured it out via searches - you are correct!"
2020-08-09 01:02:59,Thank you for sharing openly about your personal experience with illness.  I wish you continued recovery and health.
2020-08-09 01:06:49,"Ross- 
I am sympathetic to your plight.  Recently retired from a 40 year medical career, I recall the thousands of times I heard your phrase ""maybe it really is all in my head"". Usually delivered with some anger and a question mark.

Over decades I evolved the following response.  No, your illness is definitely in your body.  BUT, every part of your brain is connected to every part of your body, and nerve impulses travel in both directions. Not only can your brain influence what you feel from your body, but in many cases what is actually happening in your body.

While we can give drugs that bind to cell surface receptors, blocking them or activating them, we can also activate receptors with voluntary and involuntary nerve impulse output originating in our brains. Some physicians actually think of the ""placebo effect"" as a form of medication that can be as potent as any pill.  For example, in a placebo-controlled trial, if the effect of a drug is no different that the placebo, the drug is considered a bust, ""no different from placebo"".   But, the placebo patients often also improve symptomatically from baseline despite not having gotten the active drug. The mind-body connection is real and can be used to your advantage. If you believe that something may help, if it's not harmful, then try it and believe."
2020-08-09 01:13:47,"Thank you for this piece. I was sick with fibromyalgia for 20 years, and accelerating neurological symptoms, and now I am not. I kept searching, and never gave up. I found other patients to share experiences with, and finally found doctors, dentists and health professionals who helped unravel and treat the multiple and synergistic causes. A helpful book for those on a health journey is AcciDental Blow Up in Medicine: Battle Plan for Your Life."
2020-08-09 01:24:01,"""But the internet also creates communities of shared medical experience, where you can sift testimonies from fellow sufferers who have tried different approaches, different doctors, different regimens.""

""Testimonies""?  That's the problem Ross.  What you read on the internet is not even close to ""testimony"".  You have no idea who, if anyone, actually is ""testifying"" or whether their ""testimony"" is honest.  It's important to keep an open mind and not lose hope, but anything you read on the internet should be taken with a salt shaker full of salt."
2020-08-09 01:25:40,"The reason there are chronic diseases is because doctors don't know what to do with them.  Seems obvious, right?  But society and too many doctors don't admit this and too ready to call it hypochondria.

Seems to me there are many parallels with lyme disease and this virus.  Testing not reliable, actual numbers of people who have had or still have the disease, treatments either absent or not curative.

Mainstream medicine is mostly not happy about admitting this.  And our health care system does not cope well with chronic disease.  Insurers do not pay enough for doctors to deal with them  because it take too much time.  Diagnostic skills have waned, if one or more of the expensive scans don't find it and it doesn't call its name loudly from blood testing, you are sunk.  We are heading for a two tier system where people with complex or chronic disease will leave the insurance coverage to find help in self pay.  Those that can afford it, anyway."
2020-08-09 01:31:47,"Aptly put.
There will be a big aftermath.
The chronic physiologic sequelae 
The lack of scientific understanding for proven cures.
The psychological and cognitive impact on children’s educational disruption.
The delayed and incomplete grief from losing loved ones who had to die alone in hospitals and nursing homes.
The stress of unemployment.
The PTSD.
Global mistrust."
2020-08-09 01:32:18,"Wow. Reading through the comments, I'm struck by the disconnect between what we preach for public health (trust the science, follow doctor's orders, wear your mask) and what you propose for once we are sick (follow your instincts, get information from anybody on the internet, the experts don't know anything.) Which is it going to be, people? The reality is that we collectively don't know everything, but we can make better decisions by learning the science, learning to value expertise, and keep working with the experts to improve our knowledge.  Instead you suggest going your own way and pray? Humph. Not impressed."
2020-08-09 01:33:32,"Just a report:  mild covid symptoms for me began around July 4. Negative test around July 16.  Continuing symptoms until end of July and now reappearing every few days. Neurological symptoms were enough during my “real”sickness that I can hardly remember the month of July.  I now read of new symptoms-tremors, eye flashing-that I thought were merely a coincidence in mid July. Long haul is definitely my e￼xperience even with never having fever and loss of smell. This is one weird virus. Do not trust a negative nose swab."
2020-08-09 01:34:09,"Just when things were ramping up in the US with Covid in the early spring, I was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, an incurable cancer of bone marrow plasma cells leading to a fatal (if untreated) glut of proteins in the blood along with pathologic bone fractures that never heal.  Fortunately mine was caught early, and I was told that with immunotherapy and stem cell transplant I could hope to manage the disease for up to ten years.  Being as I am 72, that seemed like a worthwhile trade-off.

The chemo itself has been tolerable so far:  None of the classic hair loss, vomiting, mouth sores, etc. from ""traditional"" chemo for lung and breast cancers.  Also, radiation is not indicated for this kind of cancer, so I am not suffering burned flesh.

What is difficult is having a severely compromised immune system - and particularly during the Age of Covid.  A week after I began chemo, I woke up in the middle of the night with a high fever and wound up in the hospital with a pneumonia of undetermined origin.  Covid testing was negative (I cried when the test came back, as my wife was waiting in the car and, given my health status, had I contracted SARS-Cov-2 I likely would have never seen her again).

I've been out of the hospital for a month.  Follow-up x-rays have shown clearing of the pneumonia with some residual scarring. I am back on my six-month chemo regimen, having lost 30 pounds but feeling like I can do this.  

It's going to be a long haul.  But I'm home.  

Best to you."
2020-08-09 01:35:05,"I hope you continue to heal from the Lyme (etc) symptoms, and thanks for this extremely sensible column. I hope it's helpful to people who've been doubted by doctors, friends, and family."
2020-08-09 01:35:11,"Thank you for sharing. Another aspect: those of us who are lucky  to remain healthy are faced with long-term precautions. Especially those of us who are old and who have accumulated life's wounds. We would welcome a line of PPE that is easy to don, comfortable to wear for hours, and inexpensive."
2020-08-09 01:43:14,"Good luck going forward Mr. Douthat. I hope that you will be able to make a full recovery.

And I hope you will add your voice to those seeking to ensure that all Americans have access to the healthcare they need."
2020-08-09 01:45:47,"As another long term, chronic lyme suffer (12 years before I was diagnosed; another 6 years to get better) I concur with all Ross says.  Additionally, I would say one of the keys to addressing any chronic health issue is to address your immune system and the primary ways it is compromised: bad diet, sedentary lifestyle, environmental toxins, chronic stress, insufficient sleep, negativity.  It's a big job to improve upon all those things, but gradually I did, and not only did my health get better....well, everything got better."
2020-08-09 01:49:47,"Thank you Mr. Douthat for this thoughtful, considerate piece of journalism.  I rarely agree with you, but your sincerity came through and touched me.  I am so truly sorry for the ill health you have suffered through several years.  I am certain it has been stressful and debilitating to say the least, yet you kept doing your job.  Others who read this and are suffering from any disease or the after effects of a disease, would find comfort and encouragement from your discussion of your own journey.  Again, thank you.
I wish you and your family wellness."
2020-08-09 01:53:28,"What a lovely essay.   This sums up what I learned from patients over the years.  It brought me great joy to see it all wrapped up with a bow.
Stay well sir."
2020-08-09 01:53:32,"I too am a long-hauler, sick since March 16 with a variety of symptoms, from numb limbs to . The disease comes in waves, and improvement has been slow and anything but steady.

I currently take a cornucopia of supplements, vitamins, inhalers and pills. I rest, drink ginger tea and coconut water, walk in the sunshine, stay home and pet my cat, and try to avoid stress. Until more research brings theraputics, there's not much else to do.

To feel support in this confusing, scary time I rely on my husband and on Covid Facebook support groups. And I switched primary care doctors, to one who listens and tries to learn. Right now we patients are the ones  who understand the symptoms and how difficult this new virus is. And an open-minded doctor is not always easy to find. 

I wish more people knew about this difficult, chronic factor of the virus, affecting maybe a third of covid-sufferers, young and old. If so, it would be easier to convince them to follow guidelines!"
2020-08-09 02:05:49,"Mr. Douthat,

I hope your recuperation is swift and complete.  I seldom agree completely wth anything you write but almost always appreciate the care you give to examining things and carefully, and temperately, expressing your views.    That you have taken that customary care to share your experience to help others says so much about your character.  Thanks."
2020-08-09 02:07:32,"Thank you Mr. Douthat for your candid report about struggling with chronic diseases.

2020-08-09 02:20:58,"Mr Douthat:  I am sorry for your suffering, and thank you for acknowledging the existence of chronic Lyme infections.  Most western doctors are trained to deny the possibility of chronic Lyme infection, leading to untold suffering.  Bartonella is actually not tick-borne, it is spread by cats (40 percent of whom are infected) and makes itself at home in an immune system weakened by Lyme.  Other bacteria and viruses do as well, which is one of the reasons chronic Lyme treatment is so complicated.  One is rarely coping with simply chronic Lyme.  Please write more on this topic."
2020-08-09 02:33:03,"I appreciate the New York Times carrying this article.

2020-08-09 02:39:12,"Ross you are my favorite conservative columnist and I really want to thank you for putting together a holistic list of approaches for long haul illness. 

I was diagnosed with Epstein Barr virus in 1986 and I've had dormant and active periods of dealing with it ever since. I do all you suggest and more:  acupuncture is a real life saver, too. And not getting overly identified with ""being sick"" while still being very mindful of what I need to do to take care of myself, is a fine line to walk yet I find it helpful, too.

May you continue to heal body mind soul and put forward your wisdom. Thank you!"

2020-08-09 02:44:12,"So well said, Ross. I almost died from lyme disease after a week of very high fever, but managed to recover. Now I live in dread of corona. I strongly advise an organic, vegetarian diet, with organic milk and eggs raised in animal-friendly ways. I'm now healthy (knock, knock) and I do believe the change in diet is responsible. It's also gratifying to know your food doesn't involve torturing animals and destroying their habitats. Shutting down the wildlife trade and wet markets are the only reliable ways to stop the zoonotic pandemics that  have been launched from Asia for over 100 years.

2020-08-09 02:50:34,"Having a chronic condition is different in the U.S. from Canada, the U.K., and much of the industrialized world.

For that matter, two Americans with the same illness can have vastly different experiences from each othe. It's because of our crazy patchwork health coverage/care system.

In the U.S., there are dozens of reasons why people hesitate to see a doctor: they won't be covered until x date, or they just lost coverage, or their deductible is enormous. Our providers spend almost as much time dealing with coverage authorities as on direct patient care.

Some patients seeking a diagnosis and then a course of treatment have to start over two or three times if they change insurers or providers. 

Because the economics vary so much between neighbor and neighbor, friend and friend, cousins, etc. and because we're more likely to share the existence of a health problem than the personal economics that guide decisions related to that problem, a lot of us look crazy to a lot of the rest of us. 

That was before the pandemic made it worse."
2020-08-09 02:52:47,"Mr. Douthat is spot on that conventional doctors are great with acute disease but are often lost when it comes to dealing with chronic conditions that are linked to diet and environmental issues. 

I speak from my own experience. My doctors always tried to explain my medical difficulties by saying they were ""genetic."" Bit after about years of puzzling health issues involving heart and brain problems, my mystery illnesses resolved thanks to the help of an herbalist who identified the foods that were making me sick. Afterwards, even my cardiologist had to admit she was right."
2020-08-09 03:01:46,"Please be careful if you choose to experiment with herbal supplements, which are poorly regulated, may not contain the substance they purport to contain, and may lead to dangerous side effects, including drug induced liver injury."
2020-08-09 03:04:29,"Thanks, Ross. 

Although I have found elements of your commentaries in the past, shall we say, less than helpful this one is excellent and it takes some personal sacrifice to share your own experiences. Being ill, of course, is not a personal failing.

I have been something of a longer distance cyclist and an enthusiastic climber of hills and a few mountains on my bike. Joy to be found in suffering? Perhaps. Following my own case of Covid-19 through March and into early April, my cycling is sharply curtailed. No more hills or mountains, not even neighborhood rides till I am fully well.

Went riding for a second time following what I thought was recovery, up a small mountain in Maryland called Sugar Loaf (one can see it a few miles passed the DC line). Made it up the mountain, no big deal, but after that I was totally out of gas. Could not do the long and challenging hills on the way back to the car, had to walk. At the end, it felt like I had ridden 60 miles instead of just under 13. Exhausted.

Your advice about trying to serve as your own doctor is excellent because it might be the only choice. Since ""post-Covid syndrome"" is not yet in the literature, medical doctors are not likely to treat it at all and look for some more common maladies, chasing the wild goose.

Harvard Medical School, however, has recognized the potential of ""post-covid syndrome"", publishing a list of possible symptoms, including slurred speech and heart trouble, among others. Evidence is growing."
2020-08-09 03:07:06,"My teenage son got Lyme last summer, did the antibiotic treatment but was designated a ""rare"" case where it turned into Juvenile Arthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lyme arthritis; numerous other names which get lumped together just because they have the same treatment.  We had months of interactions with doctors where my son was spoken about in his presence as if he couldn't hear what was said, as if he had no feelings about the ruin this disease had visited upon his life.  
I really can't imagine what it's like to be a patient right now in an overwhelmed system.  What I've seen is a medical-industrial system which is not designed to take care of people."
2020-08-09 03:08:02,"Ross, I watched two family members suffer for years from Lyme disease. Only through relentless research and advocacy were we able to source treatment for their conditions. Both suffered from multiple symptoms - brain fog, lethargy, depression, numbness, pain. My wife has been largely symptom-free for several years following her treatment. My 25 year old son has not been as fortunate. While many of his unexplained aches and pains have disappeared, his mental health has not yet recovered. We remain hopeful and continue to seek treatment for him. We can add voices to your sage advice, Ross. For those suffering with lingering symptoms: never give up, never lose hope and always be kind. We wish you continued improvement in your own health and await your book expectantly."
2020-08-09 03:12:35,"Thanks for this piece.  It's important.  For covid, and not just for covid.  Doctors do what they can for as many people as they can.  But when they do not know what is wrong with you, some will take the easy way out and say its in your head.  Some won't.  When I was a child, asthma was poorly understood, and it was suggested to my mother that her three year old was neurotic.  Later, we came to a fuller understanding of allergic asthma, and much better treatments.  With Covid, we have a great deal of ignorance still, but we are learning.  Keep learning, both on the internet and about yourself.  We are all explorers now.  PS: I had covid all of March and really wasn't capable of doing much besides sitting around until June."
2020-08-09 03:23:23,There is mounting evidence suggesting SARS-cov-2 can infect immune privileged sites in the body and from there results in chronic persistent infections.
2020-08-09 03:28:05,"Thanks for the sound, reasonable,  optimistic game plan.  So far, we’ve been lucky, or at least careful enough to avoid the virus.  We are definitely high-risk, elderly folks, who by necessity work in a retail-type environment requiring many contacts in a typical workday.  Should the need arise you’ve armed us with what appears to be an arsenal of weapons to survive an infection."
2020-08-09 03:33:24,"Good advice Ross.  I’ve struggled with Lymes several times, once it was so bad I wondered if I could continue.  Having the medical community divided sure doesn’t help.  Lyme is well known where I live but treatments depend on whom you consult.  You must advocate for yourself.  Our pandemic is leaving a trail we haven’t traveled.  We are learning something, hospital stays may be shorter but as you point out it is very early in this crisis.  And when you pray I hope She is listening."
2020-08-09 03:40:53,"One minute: did Mr Douthat write that maybe it's ""all in my head""?  You mean the pains and hard-to-breathe and the fatigue that sticks around for months after the virus hits maybe be ""psychological"", hence not real and not something for which to seek help and professional intervention. 
 I don't agree.  That attitude is primitive and old-fashioned.  Going around with any of these symptoms without being able to shake them off needs  attention whether real or ""in the mind""; only the method of treatment would differ."
2020-08-09 03:43:55,"Ross, you have my undying sympathy. I'm pretty sure that I've had Covid-19 since late last year and early this year. Didn't have the test because there were no tests for regular people, and I quarantined at home. It took until April before I started feeling human again. Eight months from the onset, I still get relapses, so I think that they're going to find that for some people, this thing is a chronic condition. The good news is that, at least for me, each relapse is less severe than the one before it. And by the Grace of God, I am still here."
2020-08-09 03:56:23,"What to do when what feels bad doesn't go away is not discussed enough.  Lyme disease is the classic of missed diagnosis in cases like that but there are others.  Too many of those suffering fall into the hands of charlatans or endure phony treatments.   Doctors may fail to consider genetic disorders, including those that are rare.  Genetic testing as part of a work-up for an illness that doesn't go away and lacks revealing symptoms should be essential.  Patients may have to advocate for it.  It may unlock the secret to feeling better."
2020-08-09 03:58:27,"I became suddenly sick on the morning of February 10th with fever hovering close to 103, mild dry cough, severe body aches and nausea. The worst of it lasted 4 days-body pain everywhere. My teeth hurt. My little toe, my scalp. I’ve never been so sick. I couldn’t move from bed. After it passed, I felt better for a week and then the fever (100-101), nausea and body aches returned, not as bad but bad enough that I struggled to manage daily activities. Almost every night at about the same time for 5-6 weeks the symptoms would come on. Then there was a debilitating fatigue that I’m still struggling with six months later along with a sudden rapid heart rate that comes out of nowhere and feeling winded-some days just making the bed is an effort. I don’t know if I had Covid. Access to testing was almost nonexistent then. I did have a flu shot, but at the time I still thought I had the flu. I’m not so sure now. I’ve had a full cardiac workup, chest X-ray, blood work-nothing unusual has shown up. My symptoms are very slowly subsiding, but any given day can be a rough one, like trying to walk through quicksand. Did anyone get sick this early-late January/early February? Do these symptoms sound familiar to anyone?"
2020-08-09 04:04:31,"It was very generous for you to share your experiences with chronic illness, and how you have found support.  Someone wise told me that ""medicine is what works.""  As you suggested, besides western medicine there are other extant paradigms that have long histories: Unani-Tibb, Chinese, Ayurveda, and Tibetan being significant examples. For my own struggles with a chronic illness that was intractable for western doctors,  I have had good success with Qi-Gong and significant changes to my diet.  And as you said, we must take action to help ourselves, but asking God for help, with patience, and trust that the help will come, is the heart of the healing process.   I wish you well and a continued recovery, and thank you for your opinion writing."
2020-08-09 04:04:49,"It takes a lot of courage to write about a contested disease, especially one that is chronic. I appreciate the article and the NYT for publishing it. Recovery can take so long--I thought I had recovered after four years, but realized later that it really took eight. But you have to never give up, as the column says. And as so many have written, doctors are not necessarily trained to diagnose or treat such complicated diseases, and they usually don't have the time it takes to coach patients through them. Dietary changes and a lot of regular physical activity helped me, but it also took a huge amount of patience with the effort required, the many relapses, the lack of understanding by others, the lack of resources, and on and on. I was lucky that something in me always believed that I would get better, even though there was no evidence that I would. I am grateful that I had that tenacity.

During this challenging times, I think often about the long-haulers and others who are struggling as I once did, and I hope the best for all."
2020-08-09 04:08:54,"I know the struggle of  living w/ chronic illness that the rest of the world would prefer to dismiss as a bizarre delusional mental state. Why is it so hard for the healthy to find empathy in their hearts for those of us with Chronic Lyme or the countless other ""controversial"" illnesses? And how did being sick become a controversy anyway? How is it acceptable to disregard our pain & suffering because there isn't a test to ""prove"" it?
As if, we chose to lose our health & gave up on pursuing our hopes & dreams in exchange for the crushing existence of having an illness that never goes away. This isn't a lifestyle choice & it certainly isn't all in our heads, yet our pain & struggle to make the best out of life, we are dismissed, ridiculed, humiliated in an attempt to shame us into silence. To deny the experience of another as being unworthy of compassion is the most devasting thing you can do to a person, but it happens all the time.
Our society frequently marginalizes the pain & suffering of those who ""don't look sick"" & whose illnesses don't follow the expect timeline of recovery without regard for their humanity & sadly, I've found doctors are the worst offenders. 
The harm inflicted by drs denying care to us is unimaginable...so much for the Hippocratic Oath.
I truly hope Covid Long-Haulers will open the eyes of drs & to get the care you need & deserve. I wouldn't wish the way I've been treated on anyone & I am not alone in this experience.
Thanks for writing this article."

2020-08-09 04:19:06,"I was on a 3 year “doctor train” of them treating my symptoms without finding an underlying cause. After 3 years, I had 5 NEW diseases, from the side effects of the drug treatments they prescribed.

When they handed me medications to treat those new diseases and/or discussed how to best do so I had an epiphany. Their treatment of me served them, not me. So I fired them all, quit all my medications, did what none EVER suggested to took an interest in. I was symptom free and disease free in 2 years. No more doctors, no more drugs. How...

Nutrition and movement. I ate only unprocessed foods, no animal protein, no processed foods, only fermented, if so bread rarely and I ate as much as I wanted of it. I also began exercising, at first around the block, painfully, slowly and after 2 years walked the NYC marathon.

2020-08-09 04:36:31,"I've lived with Type 1 diabetes for almost 60 years since I was 9. While I admire and need doctors, to a patient with a chronic illness doctors are like the auto dealership where you go for yearly check-ups, recalls and major work.  But you learn to quickly become your own local mechanic, the one who knows how your car/body works better than anyone else, how it varies, what it needs. You learn that everyone's body is different and while there are some basic truths to follow, you must learn how your own body works."
2020-08-09 04:44:55,"Ross, thank you for writing about your own experiences, and I hope things continue to improve for you.

I've done the kinds of things you suggest for years with good results.  I've had doctors label me a hypochondriac, but that was because they weren't good at diagnosing what was going on.  Until it got worse.  Several autoimmune disorders, including Hashimoto's.  How much better once it was treated, but it was ignored for a long time.  Plus food allergies which became the life-threatening kind.  

Most of what was helpful to me was going online to these communities and then finding a doctor who would test for them if there was a test for the illness.  Even specifying the best kind of tests based on what had worked for others.

My rule of thumb is that I'm willing to try something on my own if it's likely to carry little or no risk.  Most vitamins and minerals and some other supplements fall into this category, though a person should do the research.

Life-long liberal here, but I appreciate hearing what intelligent conservatives have to say.  A belief in something higher/greater than oneself does seem to have healing power, too. There is even research correlating things like health/longevity and church attendance, for instance.  

Wishing the best to you (and everyone) in regaining health, managing chronic conditions."
2020-08-09 04:46:12,I survived cancer and much loss beyond that. My wife and I emerged resilient. We wonder at the the so called rugged individuals who care not to wear a mask or whine about the loss of work or the emerging racial diversity. We failed and persisted on our own. We are the genuine conservatives.

2020-08-09 05:09:01,"This article was wonderful, with great advice, and I thank the writer for relating his personal experience with chronic illness.

I have had antidepressant discontinuation syndrome, leading to debilitating symptoms, reinstatement of the drug, and now the slow process of tapering off.  It has been devastating to my health and quality of life.  Yet I once had a doctor flat out say my symptoms were simply “not possible”, and others just want to give me more drugs.

Yes, you can get better; these are just not kind, reassuring words.  Hasn’t happened for me yet, but I do know through others’ experiences that recovery is possible.  The body and mind have an amazing resilience, and know how to heal when given the chance."

Please consider this when you're writing what I trust will turn out to be an important book, Mr. Douthat.  And by the way:  This is a fantastic column -- a great contribution."
2020-08-09 05:41:27,"Ross, this was moving and inspiring to read, and I am so grateful to you for sharing it.  I admire your honesty, your courage, your insight, and your wisdom.  Thank you."
2020-08-09 06:22:30,"Thank you for being so open and vulnerable about your long-term illness. Medical knowledge is still very limited - we have very little idea what physically causes you to feel energetic or fatigued, clear-headed or foggy, to feel chronic pain without a currently measurable reason. But all of these unknown systems can malfunction. This means that it is inevitable that people will present with illnesses for which current medicine finds no measurable reason. When that happens, doctors too often believe their current knowledge covers everything and so declare the illness psychological. ""Psychosomatic"" is the garbage diagnosis that completes the system. With it, every illness can be diagnosed and doctors do not have to face the the fact that something is physically wrong with someone and current medical knowledge cannot diagnose it. Healthy people also don't understand and are likely too often to come to the same conclusion. Under these conditions, being open about such a chronic condition is to be very vulnerable. Thank you.

Many people, like you, suffer whether for physical or economic reasons in ways that are invisible to others. Government can alleviate such suffering by providing universal medical care and a basic economic floor and/or job  guarantee. You do not need government economic help, and so perhaps cannot understand that the need of others is not due to character or psychology, any more than your suffering. How is this compatible with your conservative positions?"
2020-08-09 07:15:03,"My comment is not CoViD-specific, but it might be helpful.

At one point, I was ill for an extended period with a long-lived virus, followed by prolonged digestive problems and, ultimately, anxiety symptoms.

It wasn’t until I traversed these problems that I realized that my illnesses had, at minimum, been exacerbated— and possibly rooted in— life stress, in my case a toxic work environment.

I am not suggesting that my physical problems were not real. They were real and warranted medical treatment. What I am suggesting is that stress undercuts immune response. 

What I would therefore recommend for those with long-lived illnesses:
  -Extricate yourself, to the fullest extent practicable, from problematic relationships and environments.
  -Give yourself the best possible nutrition, including vitamin supplements.
  -Exercise as much as you can comfortably.  Don’t do more than you can handle (and exercise might not be possible for some time), but know that even a very small amount of exercise a day is a good start and that you will get stronger gradually. 
  -Get sunlight and fresh air as frequently as possible.
  -Do your best to rest as much as you need. 
  -Find family and/or social support networks.  You need positive people around you.
  -Find a doctor and/or a support community who listens to you respectfully, and who will help you shoulder your worries without being alarmist.
  -Spend some time daily doing something that brings calm, pleasure or joy."

But please, as a graduate of Union Theological Seminary in NYC, with deep feelings about God and the Divine in life, may I ask you to stop referring to God as ""He""? At Union, God was always God. God's will, God's presence, and in your sentence - and exhortation to faith and its power in times of distress - it would be,
""Ask God to help you. And keep asking when God doesn't seem to answer.""

I have a feeling that your experiences will help you understand that healthcare for all is not a 'left-wing' - 'socialist' or 'communist' thing. Healthcare for all is a 'human' thing.
You have the resources to help yourself through this very difficult period in your life. Many people have not. Many people do not have your intelligence to get through a lifechanging, life threatening phase. They need help and that help costs a lot of time and money."
2020-08-09 08:59:27,"Excellent and timely article.  As a 77-year old with a chronic auto-immune disease that involves a great deal of care, many pills, fatigue and muscle weakness, I endorse all that you say.   I'd add the following: 
(1) Exercse - you have be make yourself do it, push yourself.   Find a gentle regimen and just do it, regularly.
(2)  Natural surroundings, outdoor air, daylight - absolutely essential in my case for morale and sanity.
(3)  Eat well, get a full night's sleep, keep your weight in check.  Extra pounds are a terrible drag in so many ways.
(4)  Enjoy friends, family, work associates to the extent you can.  Reach out.  it reallly helps to keep up relationships and stay connected.
(5)  Do not dwell on your disease - you manage it, don't let it manage you.  You are your own care manager.   Determination and belief in yourself helps - it's hard, but every day you rise above you bug, you beat it.  It's a good feeling.  Not giving up means enjoying life at least incrementally - small victories every day matter.
(6)  If you have not been infected, be personally very careful to avoid Covid exposure and enlist those around you to respect CDC guidelines.   Shockingly, we all have to do this because of Trump's abysmal failures that have metastasized into political-medical catastrophe for tragically mistaken followers.  These folks need are making it so hard for all of us to rally as a community - but I have faith we will prevail)."

2020-08-09 09:30:17,"Thanks for sharing this, Ross. Having been through an intense and chronic bout of Lyme disease in the early 2,000's, I have great compassion for your experience.

My journey led me to success with an ""intuitive healer."" She showed me the wisdom of outwitting a devious invader through a series of counter attacks, alternating between combinations of anti-biotics, natural remedies, and whole food strategies, including a concentrated phase of ""red"" foods. (Yes, it works.)

Some of it sounded batty at the time, but I was ready to try anything.  Eventually, the evident effects of increased strength and successful healing over time turned me into a true believer.

Two tools remain in my arsenal: Paul Pitchford's ""Healing With Whole Foods"" and, most important, the power of our own mind, will and intention through meditation and other forms of energy work to stay attuned to optimal health and well-being.

The experience has led me to a life of robust strength and vitality, rarely, if ever getting sick and recovering very quickly if I do. I highly recommend it."
2020-08-09 10:19:59,"Ask God to help you. And keep asking when He doesn’t seem to answer.
I mean this very seriously.

This is excellent advice, even for non-believers. Just pretend there is spiritual help waiting for an invitation to help. But even better, ask it after you try a simple pranayama practice--there are many excellent online tutorials for free-- or the Western version called overbreathing. It is simple, but powerful. 

Do this three times a day: Set your phone on three minutes. For those three minutes, draw in deep breaths all the way to your abdomen, shoulder to shoulder, exhaling fast, flooding your body with oxygen. When the timer goes off, hold your breath on an inhale. Relax into the breath retention. This alerts your consciousness to a shift. This is when you ask for help. Do this three times in a row, three times a day. I guarantee you will experience a shift to health."

I found this completely abnormal...they should have just told me that they have no idea how to treat it. My husband has ALS, which is another disease that mystifies western doctors and for which they can do very little. At least they have admitted to us that diet is very important, when most western doctors don't even ask what people eat. I had to find out on my own that silver fillings and metal crowns are filled with neurotoxins. Not one medical professional or dentist or psychiatrist has ever warned us of this over the years... And I am talking about dozens of doctors over decadess.Thus, we have come to understand that western medecine is deeply flawed and good only in extreme emergencies such as surgery. We have found great comfort and help in other sources such as biological dentistry and nutritional balancing. Both address that where western dentistry and medecine has failed us. It is refreshing to see the NYT, once in a while admit the severe limits of western medecine. Doctors are not gods and each one of us needs to take responsibility for our own bodies and health...and that is a good thing."

There are groups of patients out there who are afflicted by these strange sets of symptoms that often have no easily identified etiology.

Too many doctors (in fact, all of mine) pooh pooh Google and have spent most of my precious five minutes with them ranting about Google, rather than listening to me to talk about my symptoms. But I find that whenever I have some oddball symptom that my doctors just shrug at (“Meh.”), there is a community of people on Google struggling with the same symptoms. It’s not just the solutions they sometimes provide, it’s also the confirmation that you’re not crazy, nor are you alone in your fight to get your doctor to take you seriously. I had to once insist that we are partners in my healthcare when a kidney doctor went on a 10 minute rant about Google but did nothing to help me figure out why I was having particular symptoms. No pun intended, but I’m sick of it. Do your job, doctors, so I don’t have to do it for you."

2020-08-09 10:48:23,"I was diagnosed to have an ulcer in 1992, when a doctor in Australia was struggling to teach the world that it is usually cause by a bacterium called helicobacter pylori. As an avid reader of Science Magazine, I knew about it. My doctor, who incidentally was much later involved in the death of Joan Rivers, wanted to operate. I instructed him to prescribe the Australian doctor's combination of 3 drugs to knock out helicobacter first. Together they cost less than $100. They worked and I was cured. Others who were operated on at the time have post-operative complications that endure for life.

2020-08-09 10:52:07,"Thank you, Ross, for talking about the realities of dealing with a chronic health condition that our doctors are at a loss to understand. As someone who also went through years of confounding symptoms following a young sick child coughing full in my face, I too was forced on a journey of alternative therapies—something I would not have considered before then but was desperate enough for any hope of relief. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that there is some degree of help in most of them. I echo many of the other commenters recommendations but I would add one more. Traditional Chinese Medicine is a 5000-year-old medical practice—a vast history of accumulated knowledge. Their paradigm is very different from ours so it can be incomprehensible at first. However, it is superb for managing chronic illness. Each patient’s body is assessed individually, not as a prescribed disease. The belief is that the body works perfectly when in proper balance. The techniques are to pull the body back to the balance point so it can heal itself. For those suffering mystifying, post disease symptoms, it can help get your body functioning better. I have used it now for over 30 years whenever my body gets “out of sorts”. I highly recommend it."

It’s difficult to understand and not underestimate the struggle of those who don’t have their health if you’ve never experienced it personally, like the terror of not having access to healthcare, or not being able to pay rent, or feed yourself if you feed your children, for those who are making decisions in our names in Washington now.  I joined a Slack group of “COVID-19 long-haulers” so as to not lose myself to depression in isolation.  Thank you for sharing your wisdom.  Every bit of it and good will helps. I love everyone who is trying to help to the best of their ability.  Thank you."
2020-08-09 04:28:54,"I have lived with a chronic illness (Crohn's) for 60 years. Doctors tend to be amazed because for the most part, I refuse to let it dictate my life.

I echo Mr Douthat's suggestion about finding an online support group. Patients often know far more about about symptoms and treatments, especially since we are often ahead of current medical wisdom.

Try changing your diet. What you eat has a huge impact on every aspect of your health and the standard American diet is horrible. I cut out all processed foods years ago and immediately felt better. Additionally, I rarely eat starch (so no grains), no white sugar and only certain forms of dairy. I also try to eat a variety of fermented foods.

Finally try to keep a positive attitude. It isn't easy, but try each day to have one victory, no matter how small."
2020-08-09 11:15:21,"Thank you for sharing your personal battles with long-term illness. It is something to make all of us remember- ""there but for the Grace of God go I"". Imagine all those folks who cannot work, have no family support, no insurance, and (maybe even worse), no faith to fall back on. The world is NOT about making money, as anyone who has ever had a chronic condition can tell you."
2020-08-09 11:18:16,"If you believe you had COVID in March, but the test was negative, I'd suggest you get an antibody test.  Persistent symptoms in the face of a negative diagnostic test should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses, so it's more than a point of curiosity."
2020-08-09 11:26:00,"Thank you for sharing the benefit of your experience! I was a Covid long-hauler with a 6-week recovery period and several ""relapses"" of progressively milder Covid symptoms after that. 

I was shocked at how long I was sick. Stunned. People compare Covid to the flu. I shook off the flu a few years ago in 5 days. But Covid kept fighting. 

So I joined a support group that I learned about in the NYT-- The Body Politic. There I got treatment ideas and support. It helped tremendously. My energy has returned to about 95% of my old normal. I am very grateful to feel well again."
2020-08-09 11:34:30,"Thanks Ross. I second the many commenters that know from experience the fall from invincibility to disability. And the long and tortuous path to recovery. A recovery that may not come, but sometimes does. 

I have been given a second chance. Because exploration with the help of others got me, finally, to a treatment that partially worked. One needs to be careful (not Covid on my end, but no need to drink Clorox or swallow a UV lamp). But one needs to be fiercely analytical. Study, study, systematically keep inching forward. And in the end you become a better, less self centered, more empathetic person. Pain and recovery can do that to you."
2020-08-09 11:38:47,"I was sick with Covid19 in March, it took me around 3 weeks to recover. I tested   for antibodies. I’ve been suffering from psoriatic arthritis for over 15 years. While sick with Covid19, I had 0 pain from arthritis (which felt like a miracle honestly. Arthritis pain is exhausting because it is permanent in my case at least). 2 months after getting sick, arthritis’ pain is back and way worse than it was before. Anyone experienced the same thing?"
2020-08-09 11:44:39,"Thanks for the frank and illuminating story.  My own plan is not to get the thing at all -- which is easier now that it's better understood and the means of prevention are if not universal at least widespread and available.  In my small New England village (one active case today) it's possible, and even if not as easy elsewhere in the nation (stay away from big motorcycles and the guys who ride them) it works.  I hope your account will make more people aware of a disease that can be survived but not -- for a long time -- defeated."
2020-08-09 11:45:13,"""Now I’m better, substantially better — and I believe that with enough time and experimentation, I will actually be well.""

Between depending on time and experimentation to resolve some chronic condition, depending on time is the better bet. Experimentation may occasionally provide a solution but most often it just keeps you busy while you're waiting for the effects of time to set in.

Depending on time doesn't mean it will eventually yield a  cure for a chronic condition but it will allow the process of adapting to it to establish itself. Chronic back pain is a good example of this. Short of regenerating your spine nothing much is going to cure it, but over time the pain becomes so much part of you that you don't remember ever not having it.

So by all means keep experimenting, hope is always the thing you want to hold onto. If nothing else, it will keep you busy while time does whatever work it does. However, I'd take a pass on magnets because you don't want to look silly while time does its work."
2020-08-09 11:49:07,"Thank you for writing this article! As someone who has struggled with chronic health conditions that medical doctors don't seem to understand very well, I agree with your approach and the mental/emotional outlook that is needed, plus the spiritual component.

I've read in a medium.com article by Lisa Jensen,

that Dr. David Putrino, who is the Director of Rehabilitation Innovation for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York, has been running a center for post-COVID care, and says that the dominant theory among researchers at Mount Sinai is that this is some sort of post-viral dysautonomia. The virus seems to cause normal autonomic nervous system function to be disrupted. 
So there are resources out there to help!
Thanks again.

2020-08-09 11:53:27,"COVID-19 is so disabling because it is a novel virus.  Meaning that humans have never been in contact with the virus before  Hence, our immune systems have not developed any antibodies to combat the virus.  For that reason, so much attention is given to the development of vaccines.  Some big pharma companies have made progress.  Meanwhile, some patients are being treated with blood plasma donated by people who have survived and recovered from COVID-19.  There is information from Chinese researchers that using plasma with COVID-19 antibodies is effective.  However, what awaits is the final proof of efficacy using the double blind model of intervention.  Let us hope that where, when and how such studies will be determined imminently."
2020-08-09 11:54:14,I haven't had COVID19 but I observe how few people who have had it seen to actually recover. When I looked at the numbers it seemed that may be half were better after a few months.  What is going to be the medical condition of  these people in two years or five years?
2020-08-09 11:55:14,"There's another aspect of chronic disease: adaptation.  I had polio in 1953 and have a left leg without most of its muscles to show for it.

I found it necessary to adjust how I did things.  Instead of jumping over a wall, I needed to go around, break through, tunnel under or get a ladder.

I found I could ride a bicycle most easily by combining such force as I could master with my left leg with properly timed left and right leading on the handlebars.  I could most easily ascend a hill by traversing it at an angle back and forth.

These things worked and throughout life I mostly used my brain and not my brawn such as it was.

In a strange way I found my relatively minor disabilities comforting.  When facing a stressful experience such as an examination, a part of my brain said however bad this might be, it would not be as bad as paralysis from which I had recovered.

In my field of medicine, we doctors often start our patient descriptions with a descriptive chief complaint.  Dyspnea (shortness of breath) is a common one.  All my patients taught me about medicine.  One old man with limited intelligence came in with breathing issues and was most concerned because he could not play his harmonica.  He had heart failure and shortly simple medicines helped him.  Later, he returned and I heard him serenading us from the waiting room.  Hence: ""Dyspnea on harmonica"".

Long-haulers take heart.  What is left in the wake of disease is almost always more than expected and is enough.  QS."
2020-08-09 11:56:59,"Chronic illness, illness, healthcare, women’s healthcare and privacy, imposing religious dogma on Americans are difficulties for Republicans. Why? Priorities. Tax reduction, de-regulation, and maintaining patriarchal white supremacy and appointing SCOTUS justices that will enshrine oligarchy, profits over all other concerns, and establishment of Christian patriarchal doctrine are the Republican priorities. 
Do Republicans, and Ross Douthat imagine that they are pursuing a goal of government of, by, and for the people?"
2020-08-09 11:57:04,"Drawn to the essays of Ross Douthat, like a moth to the flame, although our respective thoughts are seldom on the same line, only to read of his long illness, and the testimonies of other courageous souls here.

Africa wrote what a sad world this has become, and she is the most devout friend of all.  Little did we know a decade ago that we would be living in the age of coronavirus, and I replied with a love for America, 'If We Believe'.

The Emperor Charlemagne is waiting with his army in the mountains for the sound of his nephew's call to arms, Roland, who is dying in the valley, but his soul is heard calling on all good people not to surrender, not to give in, but to rise to the challenge of living.

Gitti in CT. has forwarded a warning about bears in our midst, and in turn, she is receiving Ross Douthat's essay.  A young man, a gentle giant, was in the garden here earlier, showing a photograph of his little girl on a magnificent elephant.  (India has 'Ganesha', an elephant-headed deity worshiped as a remover of obstacles and patron of learning).

Thank you, Mr. Douthat, for your latest, leaving solemn notes in the air, and wishing you many more true blue  dawns.  We could all use some joy in our daily existence, and this focus on the Pauper in The White House appears to have taken it all away. 

Stay well."
2020-08-09 11:57:29,"Lyme Disease is, in a way, a disease of the wealthy who live with lawns and woodlands.  However, Lyme patients are often treated very badly.  It is not uncommon to be told that it is all in your head and you should see a psychiatrist.   Finding a physician who will treat tick-born diseases aggressively is difficult, and often insurance will not cover it.  Why??"
2020-08-09 12:00:22,"After two years of fruitless visits, a specialist told me “maybe it’s not physical.” My GP, who knew something was wrong, suggested the Cleveland Clinic where a great doctor diagnosed my MS and the specialist who treated me said early on, “You know your body and I know what it means. We’ll be a great team.”  He shared his knowledge with me, guided me through treatments, was honest, and when I told him about alternate treatments I’d tried said, “If it helped keep doing it.”  I credit everyone at the CC with how well I’m doing now.  Find good partners, be open—but cautious—about alternative treatments, and most of all, don’t let it be the center of your life. I’ve been blessed to have escaped COVID but I really get what Russ Douthout is saying. Good advice."
2020-08-09 12:03:19,"Humans have with our over-developed brains, evolved to find meaning in what we experience.
Whether intro- or extroverted, we all take note of both what we might sense or objectively measure outside ourselves AND what we feel or intuit within.

That we seek to find answers for and relief from any of our chronic symptoms is simply human nature.
I would apply this to all manner of ""chronic symptoms"" that effect us beyond the medical including the interpersonal, societal, environmental and spiritual.

I have seen as a medical provider, too often in our proclivity to find meaning in our joys and sufferings, too many will jump to assigning blame or creating a kind of subjective belief which may not indeed be factual or even provable.  
This may help some but can lead to an aggrieved victimhood or empowered sense of perceived disability which can be more life limiting/defining  than the initial symptoms/illness. 

None of us can truly feel another's suffering.
As there is power and even healing in telling our stories there lies a risk of power lost and perpetual dis-ease when suffering becomes us."
2020-08-09 12:04:44,"Thank You!
Good advice for when the rest of us get the virus, which we all will. It is a respiratory virus, after all."
2020-08-09 12:08:17,"It's not a ""chronic illness.""  It's a contagious illness that could be defeated if people in this country had the maturity to stay home awhile and if the government gave a darn and supported people in doing so."
2020-08-09 12:11:57,"I am a newly-retired biomedical researcher.  Mr. Douthat is correct: we are far better at treating the acute phases of illness than we are at working through chronic aspects.  The medium- and long-term consequences of COVID-19 are frightening - perhaps more so than those of tick-borne illnesses, with which we have more experience.  But the non-specific symptoms of any chronic illness - e.g. headache, mental sluggishness, ""subconscious miasma"" - are particularly difficult for 21st century medicine.  Unfortunately, some of Mr. Douthat's prescriptions (Experiment, Look to Google for ideas) work for a small proportion of patients with chronic diseases, since many may not have the education and intellectual wherewithall to plumb the particulars of abstruse recommendations.  Fortunately, whether patients are believers or not, Prayer is available to everyone: ask for help, even if you fear that no one is listening.  There is nothing to lose, but your worldview may expand enormously."
2020-08-09 12:13:24,"Is there data tracking the number of COVID-19 patients who don’t make a full recovery? It seems like the death rate may be declining, which makes sense as doctors are now better prepared and know more about how to treat the disease, but how many people afflicted with the virus never fully recover? This is vital information, especially at a time when Republican politicians have started touting the declining death rate as evidence that the situation is improving. Just how many “long-haulers” are out there?"
2020-08-09 12:15:17,"All good - but the article omitted chronic illness associated with mental health issues. You live sixty four years, and you are bound to at least experience bouts of both physical and mental illness. And which, if you embrace these troubling experiences with intelligence, grit and imagination, will drive you into an endless process of self-discovery - and better health. Dealing with two debilitating years of chronic pelvic pain, and prior to this a ten year bout of random and uncontrollable tachycardia (core anxiety) led me not only back to the fundamentals - healthy diet, sacred time away from the din of modern life, and avoidance (whenever possible) of prescribed medications - but also to a much clearer understanding and acceptance of where I come from and who I am. I agree with Mr. Douthat that God plays an important role in the healing process, but so too, in my case, did Freud. Our considered choices in the healing process are not binary: illness, good health and life itself is too rich and messy for such rigid thinking."
2020-08-09 12:19:38,"Thanks Ross, I'm amazed at how you've been able to produce columns in spite of these lingering maladies. I rarely agree with you politically, or religiously, but I do find your articles invigorating and I usually learn some new vocabulary. I too was bitten by a tick 7 years ago and nearly died in the hospital. It wasn't until this year that forensic hematology revealed that I had experienced Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. It goes to show you how wrong it is to construct a health care system based around profit. Vaccines are another case in point. Why would a pharmaceutical company invest in a medicine that people would receive only once? No wonder vaccines historically take so many years to produce. Better to develop blood pressure or cholesterol treatments that patients take for life. Lyme disease is too rare to be profitable. Please, with your position of influence, help us move to a more rational health care system."
2020-08-09 12:25:45,"It is really hard to overcome the disease as it has different symptoms. I have personallly recommended and tried some kitchen herbs( basil, turmeric powder, ginger, cumin seeds, cloves, cinnamon, black pepper)  There is a way to use them. just understand if you are coughing a lot, any kind, keep two cloves in mouth and give small bite, not the top part, and coughing will ease within a minute. has to be used as soon as u feel something is wrong within your body. so that you can start simple things and if it reaches to breathing difficulties you need to be more serious and more concerned for additional things of steaming lungs with these vapour.."
2020-08-09 12:30:23,"Mr. Douthat and I agree on very little politically. How pleasant, then, to read one of his columns that I can agree with completely. 

A year ago, I was ill but having trouble getting doctors to pay attention. I had had two rounds of pneumonia within a few months and other health issues as well, but they were dismissive. I kept insisting that something was wrong, and with the coaching of a long-distance friend who is an M.D. got one of the doctors I saw to write a script for an ultrasound if I did not improve within a couple of weeks. It was actually the ultrasound tech's error that made it look like I had an ovarian tumor that got everyone's attention. A CT scan, an MRI, and a PET scan later, I was diagnosed with cancer in an entirely different location. (I am cancer-free 8 months after an operation.) In addition, a later bronchoscopy showed that I had a chronic lung infection that is hard to treat. 

As Mr. Douthat points out, modern American ""works marvels, but it’s built to treat acute conditions and well-known diseases."" My maladies, including an underlying neurological condition diagnosed about ten years ago, are all listed on the NIH rare diseases website. Most doctors know very little about them. If you know something is wrong, but your doctors are telling you otherwise, keep at it. Don't let them lull you into complacency."
2020-08-09 12:37:32,"I rarely if ever read anything about the value of nutrition in staving off and fighting disease.  We live in an age of pills, pharma and ""miracle"" cures.  ""Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food"" attributed to Hippocrates.

Foods to build the immune system and fight inflammation?  
 Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts and seeds.  Beans, greens, berries, foods such as garlic, turmeric and ginger to fight inflammation.  Sorry but Americans eat too much processed, fast, and junk food, too much sugar and while this might stir controversy, there is more and more evidence that foods such as meat and dairy do not help the immune system and do not fight inflammation.  As the US leads the world in Covid-19 cases, I suspect that while generally food is plentiful, poor nutrition habits and high obesity rates are major contributors.

There are always diet and nutrition books that simply validate bad habits and promise miracle results, often popular and lucrative.  Unfortunately they render the whole concept of good nutrition a subject of debate.

Good nutrition should be our first defense against the virus, as well as our first antidote to counteract the disease."
2020-08-09 12:40:33,"Ross seems to have found some humanity.  Where we live, it is estimated some 35% of the population have lyme or west nile antibodies and the cases of full blown disease show up every year.  I recall a time when complaints of either was dismissed by the medical community and that has now changed and routinely tested and treated.   Covid seems to be different and has a huge dose of quackery adherents and thanks to this country's leadership, a huge dose of politics.  Neither of which is helping contain the virus.   On the other hand, survey after survey of the general public shows scientific illiteracy  is on the rise.   I hope Ross finds some methods to ameliorate his symptoms but wish the public would stop believing the politicians and quacks that are preying on the public in the time of covid."

Health issues, after a certain point in time, become less medical and more management problems. We learn how to manage the problems we have that medicine has not been able to cure.

The difference for Covid-19 is its deadly nature and our ability to pass it on to others, contagion. Staying alive and not passing it to others are very important parts of our efforts and responsibilities."
2020-08-09 12:52:08,"""My whole family was sick in March with Covid-like symptoms, and though the one test we obtained was negative, I’m pretty sure we had the thing itself.""

Mr. Douthat,
There's a topic for your next opinion piece. Why do so many obsess over testing, when you aren't sure it's any good?

A widely available testing does not comfort me any more. It concerns me more because public health officials are using incorrect statistical data. The one reason I would need a test is when a cure is available so I know when to take the drug.

I look forward to your opinion."
2020-08-09 13:01:25,"Nice work Ross. These steps should be on billboards across the nation. I have Type 2 diabetes and I'm also a cancer and stroke survivor. I follow just about the same strategy. In particular, if you are taking a drug that makes you feel poorly- Make your physician change it!! Daily habits like diet, exercise, meditation and sleep really matter. Thank you for a great column."

One of my friends (over 60) who was in the hospital for over a month has severe lung damage & will no longer be able to sing alto with us. Another, younger one, was doing art lessons at the retirement homes in Kirkland & Redmond. She says that her breathing is still hard & feels woozy every now & then.

2020-08-09 00:40:08,"Today some advanced countries are well along in eradicating the SARS CoV-2 Virus by identifying the infected individuals and then isolating those infected and those who may have been in contact with those infected. To some extent, it might be said, that the USA is betting on a vaccine, rather than undertaking the vigorous efforts that eradicating the virus with massive testing and contact tracing would entail.

With the other coronaviruses MERS and SARS, the companies that were developing vaccines never got to commercialize them, because, in the developed countries, the outbreaks were ended by identifying those infected, tracing all of those in contact with anyone infected and isolating those individuals as necessary. That is occurring now in the countries that are making good progress towards eradicating the virus. 

By the time any vaccine is fully available and commercialized, it will be mainly for use the countries that never had enough resources to completely eradicate the virus. That may or may not include the USA. With MERS, that still has occasional outbreaks, there was never any developed country that was both able to afford a commercial vaccine and had the cases to need it.

Most of the rest of the developed world will join New Zealand  in having the virus so much under control, that no social distancing or masks will be required and all types of sporting events will be permitted with the full number of spectators...""

I've seen a hematologist to make sure clotting wouldn't be problem (there's a pattern of COVID patients throwing clots) and had a battery of cardiac testing done.  All those tests were negative, but symptoms remain.

As you describe, I research the Internet daily (full disclosure, I work in drug development) but I'm increasingly of the opinion that we don't know enough about the virus's entrance into the body (besides the ACE-2 receptors in lungs and heart) and how it replicates to know how healing  will work.

But having lived with Addison's disease and other immune system failures, I'm exhausted by people who think I have to deal with their attempts to infect me.

I do, if I can, by avoiding them. I've traveled for years and found Americans uniquely intent on spreading disease. It's a risk you have to take, they say. No, if you are ill, tell me and I will avoid you for everyone's sake.

I am watching people who think it's a fun idea to spread COVID 19 so we can get herd immunity even if it kills those of us who won't ever get herd immunity.

I don't wish anyone harm, but being careless around everyone you know makes me wish that perhaps you face the same dilemma. I'm healthy. I can stay that way. Just don't insist on spreading your contagious disease.

Think about it, Mr. Douthat, millions of uninsured people whooping it up, coughing on others, not wearing masks, and who would never spar a dime for a health insurance policy, the kind their cheapskate employer would never spring for. When they come up with symptoms, do you think they will spend their barista wages on a test, or go to a doctor, or visit a hospital? Answer no, which is why America has performed so poorly on containing the virus.

Now you can help rectify this dismal situation by using your refined writing skills to convince our government to embark on a universal healthcare plan like Medicare For All."

Thanks for sharing the pain of both Covid and the tick-borne infection, Bartonella.

Now, put on your gigantic thinking cap, and imagine what the whole ordeal would have been like had you been a person bereft of health insurance?

Sunday after Sunday, we read this impeccable wordsmith supporting conservative causes, and much of it lacks both compassion and common sense.

The attitude of the writer seems to be, ""I've won the debate in the National Forensic League, and the rest of you can go do the impossible coital imperative."""
2020-08-09 02:08:21,"Thank you, so much, for. writing this. I too am a long hauler."
2020-08-09 10:19:22,"I never ask God for anything. Compared to a hypothetical being who knows everything, I am but a gnat. If it is for real, I don't want to be swatted for buzzing in its ear."
2020-08-08 20:58:09,"Though I often disagree with Ross Douthat, I always read him. Especially just now, I appreciate a Conservative with three-digit IQ, an education and a conscience, which tends to make one an anti-Trump Conservative.

As a roamin' (former) Catholic, currently checking the ""deist"" box on the religious-preference form, I won't promise prayers, but I certainly hope for a complete recovery for him, as I would for anyone.

One thing regarding a nugget of sage advice he offers:

 ""If you feel like you need something else to get better, some outside intervention, something more than just your own beleaguered body’s resources, be impatient — and find a way to go in search of it.""

Until embarking on that ""search"" is an option for all of us, we need to recognize just how our abysmally bad our health care system is, and we need to get about fixing it."

I don’t doubt you and your family were ill. Without evidence (positive swab, positive antibody) you have no evidence you had Covid. Deal with the symptoms, advocate for one’s self, work with a qualified healthcare provider.  There will be a lot of charlatans willing to take your money and you will be no better off. Good luck."
2020-08-09 03:10:31,"Articles like this make me nuts. They imply that somehow if only you had more faith, ate right, and were more adventurous in experimenting with quack cures on the internet you would get better.

You can do all the right things and still get sick, stay sick, and even die.  It isn't (necessarily) your fault.

If grandma or your father or your sibling gets sick or even dies it isn't because their will wasn't strong enough to make them live or because they didn't love you enough.

I will never forget my daughter coming home in tears, age 9 or 10, because a teacher told her class that when people truly want to live they can survive. My father had just died. He was a strong and strong-willed man who wanted to live and he loved us all beyond reason, but no strength of will or love was going to stop a blood clot from stopping his heart. My daughter's heart was broken because she had been told that he could have lived if he loved her enough to want to try.

Please don't push this deadly and wounding nonsense, Mr. Bruni. Death and sickness are hard enough without baseless guilt and blame."

While they both got excellent medical care, and in my uncle's case access to a clinical trial, I attribute their results to their mental attitudes.  Both insisted on never allowing the illness to interfere with their lives.  Instead, they both believed that you are never sick, you just die.  

What I learnt from both of them is that serious illnesses are as much a head game as anything else.  If praying to God sustains you, go for it!"

Why do I have limited control over these things? The pat answer is, of course, the phony answer, as pat answers always are."

Real practitioners of alternative treatments, if honest, will  tell you they don’t have answer either. They may decrease symptoms temporarily, but if King Cobra entrails were really the answer they’d be a more endangered species than they are now."
2020-08-09 05:07:27,"This is all testimonial stuff with no basis in fact other than the alternative facts of one individuals feelings.  Not saying it is not true or that the individual does not have real feelings of 'sickness', only that modern medicine does not have the answer yet. 

More importantly, modern medicine should not pretend to have the answer because modern medicine tends to be science based.  Once one delves into magical thinking and cures we get into the trump universe of altered reality testing and the insanity that goes with it.

Then the kooks really come out with hydroxychloroquine, alien sperm and drinking bleach while 160,000 Americans are dead.  Rapidly moving toward 400,000 before inauguration day (more than the total of American soldiers killed in WWII).

Keep it to yourself Ross instead of giving more ammunition to the conspiracy theory crowd."
2020-08-09 13:15:02,"Dr. Fauci has now pronounced that even with a vaccine(s) Covid is never going away.  Just like the flu and the common cold Covid is here to stay.  So, where do we go from here?  Come to grips that assuming you have years of life in front of you, you will eventually contract Covid, and probably multiple times in your lifetime.

I am 61 years old and have had the flu shot every single year since I was in high school.  Most years I do not get the flu, but every few years I do get the flu, which brings me to this conclusion.  If I live long enough, even with a Covid vaccine and extreme social distancing, I will eventually get Covid, if I haven’t already.  Meaning, there is no outrunning Covid, just like there is no outrunning the flu even with a vaccine.

So, where do I go from here? - continue to maintain a normal weight (BMI less than 25), exercise everyday, eat whole unprocessed foods, focus on stress reduction, maintain a positive outlook, help others, practice social distancing and wear a mask.  But, also realize that in time I will contract Covid as it is an inevitable fact of human life, just like the common cold."
2020-08-09 13:17:43,"Add COVID long-term effects to chronic fatigue syndrome - it's very much the same ""all in your head"" reaction from everyone.  Six months on from COVID I've lost probably 10 years of gains dealing with the chronic fatigue.  I'm back to having maybe 2-3 productive hours a day IF the brain fog doesn't preclude doing useful things.

I've been approaching this recovery the same way.  Painfully slow increases to activity, focused on doing the necessities of living first.  Vacuuming.  Minor gardening.  Raking a few leaves and putting them into the compost bin.  I'd push to go faster, but I know from the chronic fatigue recovery that pushing too hard can cause major setbacks and reduce the scant energy/focus that exist in the present.  It's hard to start again, over and over.

Best wishes to everyone."
2020-08-09 13:22:03,"Mr. Douthat ignores a very big elephant in the room.

Even before anybody ever heard of corona virus, there were many Americans who were afraid to seek medical care because of financial concerns.  In a country where just going to an emergency department can result in a bill of thousands of dollars and where many people are financially challenged, it is no surprise that many would try to avoid interactions with the healthcare system.

It is fine for someone like Mr. Douthat, who no doubt has excellent health insurance through his job at The Times and makes a very good salary, to tell people to do what he can easily do.  But I guess that's why he's a conservative; he believes that if he can do something, everybody should be able to do despite challenges that they may face that he doesn't.

And he might have mentioned the psychological issues faced by many of those with chronic physical illnesses.  But, of course, many conservatives believe mental illness is just a reflection of a person's own moral weaknesses so people who suffer from them should just pull themselves up by their own bootstraps."
2020-08-09 13:22:17,"Thank you for sharing this, Ross.  When I had severe lower back problems, that would leave me writhing  on the floor in unimaginable pain, I spent four years going back and forth between physical therapy and pain management specialists, praying for death.  I made one of the mistakes you mention here.  When asked ""did this help"", I would say ""a little"".  So they just kept upping the conventional treatment (on the good side, I'm now even buffer than my physical therapist, who had to struggle to think of harder exercises for me).  I asked about a surgeon, but they said ""better to stick with conventional"".  I eventually passed out from pain in a foreign airport, and when, sitting with my pain specialists, I asked again if I could see the surgeon (I had to ask, they didn't suggest).  They grudgingly let me go.  The surgeon smiled and said ""I can fix your problem"" and he did in one surgery.  My pain is gone.  I spent four years in excruciating pain because I tried to be a good cooperative patient.

The bad thing is, because of the assembly-line medicine practiced in the United States, I doubt any of the physical therapists or pain specialists I saw know that the surgery fixed me.  So they will go on keeping this option off the table for too long.  They won't even know that my problem was not the typical one they work with, where conventional treatments work."
2020-08-09 05:38:45,"Thanks for sharing your personal journey and advice, Ross. I hope it helps many."
2020-08-09 06:31:23,Beautiful heartfelt wisdom for sufferers of this COVID-19. Thank you! Sharing your own terrible suffering and your own vulnerability has changed my view of you. I am deeply impressed.
2020-08-09 06:03:02,"Great advice, Mr. Douthat, and sorry about the Lyme disease, which I have heard can be devastating.  Glad you are getting better from all afflictions.

I had the coronavirus and it took me a good three months to be 100% again and I thank God I made it back.  I have never been so sick in my entire life and that includes having tuberculosis as a young lad.  I could not figure out, for the life of me, what was wrong and why I wasn't completely recovering.  I would feel better one day, then sick as a dog the next.  I had serious brain fog - I do a series of brain puzzles every day and I could witness for myself my deterioration.  I had terrible leg cramping like I have never had before and ugly skin rashes that would not leave me.  I had night sweats for weeks on end.

Frankly I think as Americans probably most of us are used to finding our own cures due to our incredibly substandard healthcare system.  I have been an athlete my entire life and have worked out five days a week strenuously for decades.  It is a discipline I have never given up and when I had the coronavirus I still did not lapse from my routine.  There were days and weeks when my workouts were pathetic, but I got on the bike or lifted weights anyway for the same duration of time I usually do.  Glad to report that recently I have been setting all time personal records on my bike and lifting weights.

I am back, thank God, and for me prayer helped immensely.  You will get back, too.  Just never, ever, ever give up!"
2020-08-09 13:28:45,"I worked for years in a physically demanding job after being diagnosed with COPD, and once my pulmonologist told me he had seen paralytics with higher lung capacity than mine. I just learned to adapt, as I had no choice but to work. Later, I was treated for kidney cancer and went through a six month recovery, then I was finally felled by oral cancer, undergoing several life changing surgeries and forcing my ultimate retirement. Now, several years later, I am still dealing with the emotional and physical changes caused by these long term problems and will be all of the remainder of my life. I never used any tobacco products and tried to live a healthy lifestyle, even though I dealt with hazardous conditions in my profession on a daily basis. I often questioned why I had to endure such an unfair fate, either by destiny or God’s will. I once asked one of my physicians, a highly respected surgeon, this question. His answer was, “Everyone is born with a target on their back. Most of the time the arrow misses, but sometimes it scores a bullseye.” That has provided me with strange comfort and a strong desire to work toward a more normal life over time. All I can say is, never give up."

2020-08-09 02:18:52,"Thank you so much for this essay. We’re chasing treatment for my child for one of these “I don’t believe in it,” illnesses—an immune modulated encephalopathy. Few docs nationwide and none locally “believe” in it unless it’s just showed up and the kid is under age 11. This despite ground-breaking research ongoing at Yale, Mass General, Columbia, Stanford and our own local U. My kid’s insurance doesn’t “believe” in it either, which doesn’t matter, because no local doc will treat and no expert who’ll see him will take insurance. A local immunologist even said he does not have an immune deficiency despite low levels and recurrent MRSA infections—almost every month—that cause flare ups of encephalopathy. I’d love to work with you on a series of pieces for print and radio, on the many issues in the way of appropriate treatment for new or disbelieved diseases, everything from doctor arrogance;  to medical confirmation bias; to medical office staff too busy fighting for insurance pre-authorizations to take on what they know will be a long risk fight; to insurance companies or prior auth companies who pay their staff bonuses for each claim they deny—and the states that employ them. 

Until we can shine some light on this blindness and sometimes corruption, everybody who has one of these conditions needs a Medical Mama Bear to fight for their care.

2020-08-09 11:12:03,"This column shows real compassion, real humanity, real sanity. Somethings that seem mostly missing in conservatives and definitely missing in the Trump-Republican Party.

The primary thing to note is the critical role of science, which is the foundation of our healthcare and pharmaceuticals.  Yes, there are treatments and remedies outside of that realm, but only the foolish choose to light candles to mystical beings over a polio vaccination, or ask for others' prayers instead of going to a hospital to have a broken bone set.

So why, Ross, don't you use your voice to take anti-science conservatives, especially Trump-Republicans to task? Is it because you would then open the door to the reality that climate change is real?

Yes, science is not always perfect, but it recognizes its limitations, its mistakes, and it continues pursuing the truth.  When the vast majority of world scientists reach the consensus that man is contributing to the earth's warming, it is time to accept that as more likely than not. Ross, it is time to take on your party's haughty denial of climate change and science's proscription to stop it. Because time is running out.

Just ask the people who use them."

""Innocent until proven guilty"" is a poor way to judge a novel disease. Which is why ""it's like a cold"" or ""like the seasonal flu"" was such a stupid way to characterize it in the first place. Yet Trump and his followers continue to talk this way. The surgeon general tells us to do one thing and the President and his fans model the opposite behavior. 

If I were to experience an illness that isn't responding to standard treatment I'd be inclined to look for second or third opinions within conventional medicine. That's particularly because I already take a couple of potent drugs and I wouldn't add anything to the mix without clearing it with a doctor or at least a pharmacist. And alternative medicines, herbals for example, don't usually have standard dosages of active ingredients.  A pinch today might equate to a spoonful tomorrow. 

I adhere to the belief that alternative medicine that works is called medicine. Having said that, aggressively researching symptoms and treatments for discussion with my doctor is something I feel completely comfortable with. It's psychologically healthier than passivity and that's a good in itself."
2020-08-09 13:31:06,"Another thing that happens with chronic illness is that you learn to manage your life when you have symptoms and when you don't. There are times to ""give in"" and seek out whatever activity is most pleasant or maybe just passes the time the best way: it may even be possible to notice bit of enjoyment in those times. (For example, if you're up in the middle of the night, don't forget to enjoy the quiet.)

Many difficult circumstances in life are shocking and depressing at first, but then settle into a type of normality as ""best practices"" are discovered and everyone's emotions return to an equilibrium. If something seems hopeless one day, the next day may bring an idea or resource out of the blue to smooth out the struggle.

This is how we have ignored climate change for 50 years, creeping closer every year to the global warming abyss. It’s why a significant portion of the population refuse to vaccinate their own children.

What’s the common thread?  It’s the willingness to believe without evidence – on faith. More than three-quarters of the people in this country grew up being told that religious faith trumps evidence.  We are uniquely high among developed nation in the percentage of our people who are religious, and our failure in handling this disease is uniquely spectacular.

Germany has had about 9,000 COVID-19 dead in total.  New Zealand had had 22. Yes, 22. Meanwhile, here in the faith-based U.S., we will have another 1,000 dead before this time tomorrow morning."
2020-08-08 22:11:59,"Ross. I’m a fan. Sorry to learn about your woes.  But, “experiment, experiment, experiment”?  That sounds entirely too desperate and unscientific.

My prescription for you is three weeks sitting on a beach in Maui.  No phone, no internet, no writing, no nothing - just soft breezes and fresh food.  Consider this your ""beach experiment.""

If you aren’t feeling better by then, switch doctors."
2020-08-09 13:37:53,"Russ, thanks for sharing your thoughts.

I personally do not believe in a God who is intimately involved with our lives, knowing our thoughts, what will happen to us etc.
I do pray, sometimes in a moment of thanks when feeling grace,  beauty or a glimpse of some underlying truth or reality.  Often I repeat one or two prayers I learned way back in the day. When things are not going well, I try to reach deeper and ask simply for clearness of mind and spirit. 

We have come to exist in the best and only world possible. Grasp this reality. Contemplating what underlying order (God) there may be, and how it is reflected in us, will give us some perspective and peace."

Also, we know you're a Christian and we know how you feel about God.  We also have already assumed that you and God have frequent conversations even when you aren't sick - he probably thinks you're pedantic too.  One request, however: 
 I'd appreciate your NOT advising all of us to talk to the imaginary Man when we're feeling lousy.  You do what you have to do, and we'll do likewise."
2020-08-09 13:43:18,"I had a two-year illness when I was completely disabled from a back injury.
I spent those two years searching for a way to regain a pain-free life. What I found was the raw vegan diet. I am no longer a raw vegan, but for a healing intervention, it is incredibly powerful. 

The raw vegan diet involves eating only our natural primate foods which are green leafy vegetables, fruits berries melons, and nuts. The theory is that this is the diet that we, as primates, were designed to eat over billions of years of evolution and as such gives our body perfect nutrition with the least cost in terms of energy required for digestion and elimination of toxic byproducts..

Because this diet delivers the most nutrition in the form easiest for our body to assimilate, it frees up tremendous energy for our body to focus on healing. Fasting is another short term technique that does the same thing, but this is not safe to undertake alone when you are already in a compromised condition.

Also, something about eating only living things seemed to have have a supercharging effect. 

Of course, no one thing fits all people, but this was my healing Magic story. I'm no longer a raw vegan, but fruit and greens and nuts still make up the vast majority of my diet."

It fuels the fire I hear from the religious right that mask wearing is unnecessary as faith will save us. I have certainly seen and felt the advantages of acupuncture, massage, etc on muscle pain and other imbalances, and I support being an informed and pro-active patient, but this text needs far more caveats to make me comfortable with its presence in a reputable newspaper."

It is irrational to flail back and forth from one quack remedy to another. Chinese herbals espoused by Drs. Carson, Oz and other celebrities for lucre are as toxic and useless as they are mislabeled. Laboratory testing by the FDA has proven that.

There was a time, not too long ago, when I regarded your pieces a bit staunchly positioned; perhaps even a token voice from the right to add ""balance"" to the NYT op eds.

Then, around two months ago, I heard your voice on a podcast, and felt your thoughtfulness, consideration decorum, and a bit of humility...

You seemed to have found your voice from a more grounded place.  I wondered if this personal experience had something to do with it.

Politics or ideology aside, you inspire me to explore and reflect. That's what authenticity does.

Thank you, and keep on keepin on!"

I've discovered when you get old, no illness goes away quickly.  None.  Got a cold or flu?  You'll be fine, but it could take months.  Knowing this helps because it can keep you from panicking. 

One small disagreement, Ross.  Your profession is not obsessed with the dangers of Covid misinformation.  When the president speaks, his remarks are followed by ""without evidence"" which is true enough, but in an era of conspiracies, the proper thing to say is: ""he lied.""  

All my best to you.  Hopefully, it's some consolation that you are able to function with a partially understood long term illness."

Better, Douthat has personal integrity and is intelligent -- two qualities sadly missing in most conservatives I read or meet these days.

This column is right up down the track of what I expect of Mr. Douthat.  He is practical, he is frank and, when things go badly, he turns to God.  

As a liberal I like to think that I am practical and I am frank but it would never occur to me to turn to God.  Of course, I have no problem with his turning to God...it just doesn't work for me.

2020-08-09 13:54:20,"More than 50 million Americans live with a chronic disease, most being autoimmune. Long before Covid, holistic doctors warned that it was an ignored pandemic that would sink our publicly-subsidized private, for-profit healthcare system. And it’s a preventable pandemic, because autoimmune disease is caused by inflammation brought on by processed food, and super-fueled by stress, sedentariness, and toxicity in our water, soil and air. A for-profit “health” and drug industry likes nothing better than chronic disease. It doesn’t pursue cures, it pursues drugs that tamp  down symptoms because those are the super profitable ones. This country will need more than prayer to get healthy. It will need a true national health system that doesn’t enrich drug and insurance companies. It will need to have pols stop taking what are essentially corporate bribes. 

I have an autoimmune disease that I am able to control with diet alone. But I am middle class and had the time to do the online research that gave me a life without pain or fatigue, and the money to buy the fresh and organic foods that my body needs to keep symptoms at bay. The poor do not have these options. Ours is a penny wise and pound poor society."

If you were an African American bus driver you'd be out a job and possibly nearing bankruptcy. Time for universal health care don't you think?"
2020-08-09 14:04:30,"If you've lived with a chronic illness, you know the frustrations Douthat is writing about.  I've been told by doctors that I will feel better ""once I decide that this is within my control"" and have had the same useless antidotes prescribed to me a million times.  It is very hard for health providers not to be able to treat, and unfortunately when their treatments fail, they start blaming the patient (it's in your head, you aren't really following my treatments, etc).  It's dispiriting.  

I have deep sympathy for Covid long-haulers, and any long-hauler. I know that it is hard to support someone who doesn't get better. It is worse, though, to live with an illness long after the concern dries up and when you know that people see you as a drain and think that you could reverse the course, if only you tried harder."
2020-08-09 14:05:41,"A number of commenters take issue with Ross for ""asking God to help you"" and point to the election of Trump and the hypocrisy of evangelical Christians as the reasons for their derision.  

I don't know whether God exists or not. Some assume he/she must not because bad things happen, like Trump. But another way of looking at it is that perhaps God exists and allowed Trump to be elected so we homo sapiens could all see how bad it could get, in such a short time, unless we start working together collaboratively to solve our collective problems.   

Almost every significant global challenge has worsened since Trump's election: Deterioration of diplomatic relations among nations; increases in hostilities world-wide; global trade disputes; mass migration; climate issues leading to more extreme weather, fires and floods; worsening of global poverty; and, now, a planet-wide deadly pandemic.

Perhaps this is God's way of reminding us, as the history of homo sapiens has shown, that no egomaniacal despot alone can solve everyone's problems (as Trump claimed he could), and that organized religion as practiced today, as a political weapon to control others, does not honor Him/Her. 

Perhaps God is showing us these things and hoping that we, a species that he/she has allowed to determine its own fate, can correct our mistakes before it is too late."

2020-08-09 14:08:33,"I had a similar experience with the flu, 1990- 1991. 

This was started by the doctors: I had a bulged disk in my back,
exceedingly painful. Three doxs refused to treat it, point blank,
saying ""it will get well by itself"" (which it did), and refused to giv3 me real pain medicine, instead prescribing an NSAID called Feldene. But they didn't tell me that that drug causes ulcers 100% of the time! I got an ulcer, with no onbious symptoms (any pain was submerged in my bad back.) 

I then got the flu, which was made worse by the ulcer,
which was diagnosed ex post facto.  Doctors refused to treat the flu (or the undiagnosed ulcer.)

I felt bad for six months. I got to feel OK at an exact instant in time, July 9, 1991. I was in Costa Rica for the great eclipse two days later. I sat down in a French restaurant and
ordered French Onion Soup (as in Julia Child cookbook) and Lapin au Vin. Three spoons into the soup I felt very odd, sort
of tingly and lightheaded. 2/3 of the way through the soup I felt 100% OK, and remained so permanently. The rabbit was delicious.

I would add, if you have experience in tuning into to your own body, then trust it. If you don't get/feel better, seek medical help, and keep seeking it. If you can't find or afford good medical help, then try those things that make you feel better, as long as they are known not to cause harm (no crazy nonsense touted on the internet, no drinking bleach, etc.)  Palliative care is worth pursuing when no cure is available. (I have had fibromyalgia for almost 25 years, so I have some experience in dealing with a chronic condition.)"
2020-08-09 14:10:48,"I had what was in hindsight diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome for18 months before it reached the news.  It started with the flu, but could not rest because I had an independent consulting contract.  Some of my symptoms were similar to COVID patients -- cough, chest pains, and extreme fluctuating fatigue. The term ""post-viral syndrome"" which seems to fit.  Intermittent chest pains and cough remain 30 years later -- now diagnosed as tracheomalacia. 

 I was treated as a psych case by some doctors and my extended family, I had no immediate family. Though I had an income from a steady consulting arrangement, I lived in terror that I could keep up the work (luckily at home).  I had no disability insurance.  To get out of my HMO, I did not divulge my symptoms on an insurance application -- I knew I was uninsurable.  

1. Many illnesses are made worse not only by the stress of disability , but also by the demands of fighting the medical and insurance system, and the social, financial, and career implications.  Long term stress hormones can cause inflammation and chronic diseases.

2. Those without family support and a job with benefits are most likely to get ill and most likely to suffer chronic consequences of illnesses.  

3. The U.S. has no financial support systems for ""short"" term illnesses, which could mitigate disability.  

4. The U.S. citizens, with lead more insecure lives and are much less healthy than other developed countries and have more chronic illnesses."
2020-08-09 14:12:08,"Doctors are by training neither scholars nor scientists so almost all are ignorant of one of the lessons of medicine: syndromes dismissed as as psychological keep turning out to have a physical basis that biomedical technology of the time was not advanced enough to detect and treat, or more likely medical practice had failed to keep up with existing technology. This is especially true with syndromes which predominantly afflict women. So instead of saying ""I don't know"" or trying to find a specialist who might know, they say ""It's not real."""

2020-08-08 21:13:16,"My advice after 7 surgeries, five implants, 4 hospitals, 5 SNFs and chronic MRSA still alive after 7 yrs. :
 If at first your doctor does not succeed in aiding a condition, change doctors!!!  Old doctors have in depth knowledge to diagnose, but young doctors have more breadth of knowledge about cures and are less jaded and pessimistic about successful treatment outcomes. Third world doctors transplanted to the USA are simply not competent, except about diseases endemic to the third world.  If 3d world MD's served in psychiatric facilities for more than 3 yrs and your condition is not psychiatric, get rid of him/her.
Make your doctor stand up in to your direct line of eyesight when you are bedridden to get straight answers.  Ask lots of questions and make them think. 
Do Yelp your doctor or hospital for info and search Google for success rates and choose accordingly.  Change hospitals, you have the right to choose. Choose the best reputation and biggest budgeted facility for your malady. 
 Do watch your meds and take full notes on your treatment and quietly let it be known you are tracking all your treatment - everything and everyone by name and their representation of rank, date and time. 
Have visitors so staff know someone, anyone, seems to care about you. You'll get better treatment and care.  If you have to, use a delivery service and send yourself a gift and misrepresent it to staff as from someone who is interested. Something visible on your bedside table - oranges."

Then the flu symptoms came back again along with severe abdominal pain.  Her appendix and part of her colon had to be removed due to damage resulting from the virus.

2020-08-09 10:38:30,"So there was this world famous medical clinic in Switzerland .....

And one day the top doctor in the place called three of his patients into his office for a meeting.

One was an Englishman, one was French and the other was a Jewish guy from Cleveland. 

And the doctor said: ""I have bad news and good news for all of you.""

""The bad news is I have evaluated your cases thoroughly and unfortunately there is nothing more I can do to help you. All of you will die within a month.""

""The good news is that I can grant each of you one wish and this can be anything you desire.""

Hearing this, the Englishman immediately began to describe a month-long series of elaborate meals that he wished to have prepared for him by the most famous chefs in Europe.

Not to be outdone, the Frenchman asked that the ten most beautiful women in Europe be brought to the clinic so that he might be suitably entertained by them in the last month of his life.

Finally, the doctor turned to his Jewish patient from Cleveland and asked, ""And what sir, may I do for you? 

To which the Jewish man replied, ""Well to tell you the truth, I'd like to see another doctor."""
2020-08-08 23:54:02,"“Ask God to help you. And keep asking when He doesn’t seem to answer. I mean this very seriously.”

This is the most dangerous part of Douthat’s column. I mean this very seriously. 

Time and again evangelical and other christian conservatives talk about god protecting or healing them from Covid (& other diseases etc). It is used as justification for ignoring masks and social distancing, it underpins their faith in prosperity gospel frauds, medical quacks, faith healers and Trump. Its why they think thoughts and prayers are the proper response to tragedy and calamity. 

It is disingenuous nonsense. God will not save you, heal you or protect you. You are not remarkable because of your prayers nor blessed because of the creed you believe in nor the wealth you accumulate. Jesus (Mohamed, Buddha, Krishna etc) is not your personal friend. 

Get over it, you’re not that special. No one is."
2020-08-09 14:16:59,"The simple answer is effective treatment. There are lots of diseases that ""won't go away."" 

Hepatitis C is a viral infection that over time causes severe liver diseases and even death. But we finally have a successful treatment that eliminates the virus.

I hesitate to say ""cure"" since using that word when discussing SARS CoV-2 will get your post removed. You would think that the owners of FB, Youtube and the like don't really want to see a successful treatment.

But treatment may be much closer than the miracle vaccine that everyone is being told is right around the corner.

Even if a covid vaccine is as effective as the annual flu vaccines, according to the CDC that would only immunize between 15% and 60% of the population and would require annual shots for millions of people, costing billons.

Effective treatment, along with herd immunity might bring this disease almost completely under control.

No method that we currently know of will be 100% effective. Every year despite vaccines thousands die from flu. 

So let's have openness and transparency about our options. Many front line doctors have treated their seriously ill Covid-19 patients and they have all survived. 

These are called ""observational studies."" They don't meet laboratory standards, but they have saved lives. Effective treatments also can become effective prophylactics.

So rather than censor them, let's hear more from these doctors.

They may have the answer to ""what to do."""
2020-08-09 14:17:10,"This article hit home for me.  My sister has lived in California for years, but she visited us in CT many summers.  During one of them she was bitten by a tick, but when she got back home and became sick no one knew how to help her.  It was in the early days of tick-born illness becoming commonly known.  She never got early treatment and was even told ""We don't have Lyme Disease here.""  As you suggested, she became her own doctor.  She did everything Ross did, including trusting her own body, experimenting with things that seemed weird, and exploring the internet to find others with similar experiences.   She did eventually find doctors who listened and cared.  She was not herself for many years, and still isn't, really.  She used to finish reading one book and pick up the next one moments later.  She can't read like that anymore.  But now we can have a whole conversation and not talk about her illness at all, its no longer her primary focus.  It changed her forever, and what an up hill struggle it was for her to get to where she is today.  She just never backed down."

You've done a public service with this column, Ross."

2020-08-09 14:24:43,"Mr.  Douthat:   we need to rethink health care.  First we need to recognize that the best health insurance cohort would include everyone.  That's the fairest and most efficient way to handle health care.   Yes, it should be funded by taxes.  COVID19 has reminded us that the poorest most dysfunction person in American can pass on an infection.   Only we take of everyone will our risk decrease.  This is recognizing that all Americans matter and the total health of our community affects us all.  
Next we need to concentrate on mental health:  your column reminds us that the patient is the first provider of care:  unless you can care for yourself, the entire medical establishment can't help you.  We need to reduce gun violence as treating gunshot wounds is expensive and witnessing or experiencing gun violence is a trauma that blooms into mental illness.  We need to take health seriously including diet:   Sugar taxes could go directly to health care!!
Turning to God for inspiration and guidance is a great comfort but God gave us brains and expects us to use them.    Jesus also told us to love our neighbors:   and his example was health care!!
An American national health service,  well designed and well funded would be a very Christian national response to COVID19."
2020-08-09 14:25:20,"Hello,
 As an older RN with my share of physical challenges, I have fond the approach that Mr Douthat  suggests to be very useful. Open up your thinking, consult numerous sources, ultimately, take responsibility for treatment choices, be aware that traditional doctors don't have all the answers, that your situation may have unique aspects and act accordingly. 
Praying isn't such a bad idea but it's up to you to pull through. I believe there is some kind of logic, some set of reasons behind virtually all illnesses and that it  is up to us to sort it out."
2020-08-09 14:25:42,"In my 30s I developed some painful throat and ear symptoms and went to the emergency room where the doctor diagnosed it as stress! In the middle of the night a white pustule formed and eventually pus came out.  I called an ENT hospital and was treated for a peritonsilllar abscess.  Thus began my going beyond just buying vitamins in the health food store.  At first I had to get beyond thinking that people who did this were weird - it was very hippy back then.  Then I learned about homeopathy, herbs, oils, etc.  When the abscess started coming back, I took a homeopathic remedy and didn't have to have my tonsils removed.  Same thing years later with a gynecological problem for which I was scheduled to go to Johns Hopkins for surgery.  My GYN was amazed and we talked about all the remedies being discovered from plants in the world.  Our bodies are miracles of healing that we sometimes can help to do what they do best.  I am my own first doctor.  We experience our symptoms 24/7 vs. 15 minutes with the doctor.  Johns Hopkins and Medscape and Medline and the NIH and Dr. Weil are sources for accurate complementary medical information that can help, among others.  It is a lot of work vs. just taking prescriptions and having surgeries, but it is worth it, especially in cases like Mr. Douthat's.  We have different political leanings, but I support his looking beyond the mainstream in his quest for health and wish him well."
2020-08-09 14:29:20,"Republican voters are simply truth deniers. They believe the fantasies that their church leaders have been telling them for decades. They believe the fantasies that the likes of Reagan and Trump have been telling them despite the evidence to the contrary. As their standard of living goes down they blame others instead of the those they voted into power for the failings of their government and the religious belief in the those they follow. The evidence of how to achieve a better life for themselves and their families is out there. But they would rather ""cling to their Bibles and guns"" than look at the evidence from other countries where average citizens live much more comfortable lives than Americans who continue to vote for incompetents who promise to keep their failing health system, their Bibles and their Second Amendment ""rights""."
2020-08-09 14:29:47,"There is something here for anyone to fault, including that it's coming from who it's coming from, but I think Ross makes a sincere effort. 
He's trying to find a way (don't know if ""middle"" is the best adjective, so don't use it) between science and (similarly, whatever modifier put here could also be problematic) anything else as ways to pursue knowledge, understanding, helpful guidance when nothing else is available.
He's addressing a void which most don't want to touch. Like other social untouchables, it doesn't go away if people won't, or are afraid to, go there.
He could be more direct about the primacy of science, in so many ways, but he's right that science doesn't know everything (indeed in its very definition, although that is sometimes forgotten).
He knows some alternatives to science are off-the-charts wacky, and tries to offer guidance on distinguishing between them.
I once went looking for this when a student in my course at a technically oriented university defended a position based on anecdotal evidence. I responded with the standard answer that in academia and science that kind of thing is worthless,  but added we need something better than that. Perhaps a scale or continuum (unless that creates its own problems) that locates science, anecdotes, the mind/body area, quackery, while opening space for discussion.
My search for a reference found almost nothing, which I told the students.
So I welcome Ross' comments, and would like to see more on this from others."
2020-08-09 14:34:32,"I thank Mr Douthat for reassuring those with chronic diseases that there are ways to feel better, including help from the nontraditional (Naturopathic for me) medicine. I have lingering effects from both Lyme disease and COVID. These symptoms come and go but learning about them and seeking empathetic care goes a long way to smooth the frightening road ahead."
2020-08-09 14:36:17,"Hope you continue to get better.

Here's my own probably not very helpful experience with Lyme: A couple of years ago I began to feel a bit off and also began to have high fevers that came and went. No other symptoms. On the fourth day of this, I went to an urgent-care facility and the people there, after consulting with a doctor, told to me go the to the ER.

There I was fortunate to be treated by a doctor with Lyme experience (we live in an area where the disease is common, and the doctor's daughter had had it) who took 10 blood tests that turned up nothing. Lyme, however, doesn't show up in the bloodstream until it's too late to be treated effectively.

So the doc assumed I had Lyme and prescribed a week's worth of strong antibiotics to be taken twice a day, exactly 12 hours apart. I followed instructions to the letter and minute (many patients don't) and began to feel better in about a day and a half. Four days in, I was back to normal and have had no symptoms since -- though, importantly, I continued taking the antibiotic for the full 7 days.

The lesson: Lyme can be treated effectively, but it has to be diagnosed BEFORE tests reveal it's presence. That requires a savvy doctor, but patients should be aware of this key fact and act as their own advocate.

However, it occurs to me that if I had come down with Lyme during the Covid pandemic, it might well have been misdiagnosed. I shudder to think what that would have meant."

2020-08-09 14:38:29,"God is simply what exists in the hearts of other people. Faith is simply a belief that the good in others’ hearts will outweigh the evil. 

Some may find this good immediately. Others may seek it for a lifetime. What you find is partly due to where you start in life, and partly due to what is brought to you by chance. 

The great tragedy in Ross Douthat’s thinking is that he writes about “asking God”, when to do so is entirely about asking other people. 

He rightly sees that when a doctor says “it’s all in your mind”, it’s mostly to avoid the hard work of chasing evidence and correlating results, which is mostly the work of talking to more and more people with no guarantee of finding anything helpful. 

What Ross and co-religionists fail to see, is that the imagining of an “interior god” is also an act of avoidance. And when that interior god doesn’t answer (which is no surprise), the correct response is to keep on looking on the outside."

2020-08-09 14:41:00,"You know who is also asking their God's help?

The Dominionists, the powerful cabal of Evangelicals, who have swarmed to Trump and his cronies in order to (they hope) finally get what they have been trying to buy from the GOP for decades. More power, more money and to basically own the US Judicial System. Which is what Trump,thru McConnell and the Federalist Society are facilitating.

There's another article in today's paper, trying to explain the vexing Evangelical support for Trump. That due to their  ridiculous claims of feeling threatened (by the World at large, and secularism specifically in the US) and because Trump has promised to protect them, and give them power - they swallow their moral antipathy, and vote for him.

But that article, like this column, and every other piece the MSM media writes about Trump and The Evangelicals, fails to mention the Dominionists near stranglehold on now Trump and the GOP agendas. 

DeVos, Jones. White. Falwell. Among dozens, hundreds of others with easy access to the WH. Card-carrying members, of what some call ""The Family,"" are all of the Dominionist sect of the White Evangelical sect, who are in fact nothing but a political action group, who seek to further their White Christian Nationalist ideals. Ideals that are wholly racist, sexist, antisemitic, anti-every other Religion, anti-LGBT, anti-science, etc.

And it caused horrible guilt in those dying. 

Prayer isn't the answer. Taking simple precaustions is. Prayer will bring nothing but personal comfort. If you believe, that's great. But it will not cure anyone, no matter how hard you pray...or how much people laughed in the face of terminal cancer. Shame on you."

His constant  denial is akin to the needle being stuck on an old LP record as well as his irrational attitude towards mail-in ballots.    He knows he's in a slump; he knows many GOP's have turned their backs on him.   Woe is trump."
2020-08-09 14:28:09,Ross- just remember the only national health care plan the GOP has passed is EMTALA which can give you free health care at any ER if you do not die or get contaminated further in the waiting Room. Thank Saint ronald for that plan. Oh by the way it was an unfunded mandate which eventually bankrupted many state hospital reserves like Massachusetts.
2020-08-09 14:29:08,"I agree with the headline.""when covid doesn't go away"" both the disease and the symptoms individuals experience. We are going to have a pro-longed infection rate in this country for years. We are also going to have a health-crisis of people who have chronic covid-19 for the rest of their lives. 
   People have been praying to God incessantly for centuries now. If he exists, she (or he) is isn't listening. If it comforts those who pray in some way, then good for them. It is doing nothing for the world or for those they are praying for."
2020-08-09 13:51:54,"""Ask God to help you.""

Therein lies the problem with modern and materialistic Christianity. The selfish request that God heal you, God provide you with a good job and nice house and a new car, God provide you with all the stuff you desire. ""The God of prosperity"" will make you happy and successful.

God cares little about these things. And while prayers for healing and health go unanswered for so many with legitimate and heart-wrenching requests, others swear that God answered their prayers. Really? Is praying to God like playing the lottery? Some win, many lose?

Try thoughtfully praying to God to help you lead a more moral and Christian life - what would Jesus do? I don't think God cares much about how many years you live or how much stuff you have. If God did, why would there be death at all?"

And then there's the persistent cough, shortness of breath, chest pains and other remnants of the virus's respiratory devastation.
Doctors and Medical experts may all agree that this is normal after recovery from this sickness, but none can agree (or predict) how long these symptoms last.
Of course, one is thankful to be out of the hospital and the time spent at rehab, where learning how to perform the  easiest physical tasks can often be daunting.
And yes, one also learns about faith again.
Just like one learns how to truly appreciate the goodness in others, especially when one is so ill and helpless for so long.

2020-08-09 14:38:48,"I conclude the following from the quality comments in this article. COVID is a complex problem, and it affects people differently. Those with preexisting illnesses will fare much worse because COVID aggravates their earlier problems. There are limits to scientific remedy due to the lack of scientific experience but that will change over time. As we collect more data, additional, successful remedies will appear as a result of that experience. But during this learning phase, indecent people, opportunistic people, specifically Trump, will use the uncertainty to their own advantage and profit. Trump sows distrust in science so people discard truth and align themselves with his despicable failed management. 

The single greatest boost to science in America would happen if we impeached Trump. Hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved as well as our economy if the useless noise Trump spews was sidelined."

After vacationing in the Italian Alps at the end of February, we all fell ill with persistent flu symptoms. We simply nursed our illness at home. My children took respectively 3 and 7 days to recover from a high fever. I had no cough but a persistent low-grade fever and a heavy chest that lasted for two weeks. My first attempts at physical activity after the illness were met by chest cough and a lot of phlegm. A ""normal"" cold it was definitely not. But after that, I was ok. No more symptoms, no long term consequences. 

At about the same time, the wife of my cousin was exposed to huge viral loads while working on the front line as a doctor in the city of Bergamo. She had virtually no symptoms and was simply quarantined until her test proved negative. Not so much my cousin, who experienced ""the nastiest flu of his life"". Both have long since recovered, but their experiences were vastly different. 

Having traveled extensively for business through northern Italy and having hosted guests from China through the early phases of the pandemic, I am convinced I was exposed to the virus multiple times. And so were millions of people like me. Still, I it appears that the majority do not show any symptoms, or only very light ones. This is what makes it more worrying: because without precautions, we can unwittingly spread this nasty disease to more susceptible people."
2020-08-09 15:12:15,"From the title I was expecting a different topic than :what if we just stay sick?  The more important crystal ball gazing is this. What if the virus continues to ebb and flow throughout the nation, unabated by our half measures and the refusal of enough people to live as if we are all responsible for one another.  What if the virus is not stopped by a vaccine.  Polio was mentioned and HIV has been around for 30+ years without a vaccine. So, what is the game plan if what we have today is what we have a year from now?  Check with God on that one."
2020-08-09 15:13:41,"If you feel like you need something else to get better, some outside intervention, something more than just your own beleaguered body’s resources, be impatient — and find a way to go in search of it.

2020-08-09 15:15:44,"You're absolutely right about Lyme's disease. I had a childhood friend who contracted Lyme's disease in the early-1970's, long before it was commonly known, even among doctors. The disease went unidentified and improperly treated for years. The effects were severe came, and never truly went away. She's now 61, still struggling with the disease's after-effects."
2020-08-09 14:55:53,"I wouldn't take medical advice from Ross Douthat any more than I would from Donald Trump.  For one, Douthat mistakes COVID for a chronic illness."
2020-08-09 15:16:29,"Yeah, I feel for you Ross. My brother-in-law has been dealing with chronic Lyme for well over a decade now.  Had to pay tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket to get IV antibiotic treatments that finally got him his life back somewhat.  Wiped out the family's finances, and treatment would not have been possible at all if not for his wealthy parents.   

So my question to you, Ross, is why do you still support a political party and political ideology that leaves everyone on their own to deal with stuff like this.  Not everyone is smart and ""bootstrapy"" enough to pick rich parents to be born to.  Should we consign them to lives of pain and suffering, as per your party and ideology?  Or, as per your professed religion, should we take care of each other?  European nations do this, with better outcomes and lower costs for everyone - why not us? Oh yeah: conservatism, we're soaking in it."
2020-08-09 15:09:48,"About that bit of God advice at the end of the piece, use it carefully...if at all. When He doesn't answer go to your doctor. My grandfather chose to rely only on God when he developed cataracts and refused to have them treated. He went blind."
2020-08-09 15:13:27,"My wife was sick, and after several tele-med visits with different doctors each time they decided to let her have a coved test. Two tests were negative but they decided that it must be covid because the tests are so inaccurate. We started quarantine. 14 days later she still was spiking fevers of 104 and had lost 14 pounds. We tried to get more tests, but they didn’t want her to come in because of the pandemic. Well we kept calling and calling and finely they consented to let her have a complete blood work up and guess what? Not covid, but anaplasmosis! A few days on antibiotics and she started to recover. I don’t blame the doctors, I blame the bad tests. It’s like we’re fighting this disease blindfolded with both hands tied behind our backs and our own government attacking us from behind. But she didn’t die so I guess everything alright."
2020-08-09 15:20:43,Well done.  You've described the frustration and difficulties that those with chronic diseases that are met with skepticism face.  Lyme has been pooh-poohed for years (mostly women have been attacked and accused of making it all up) and people have suffered.  The long term sequelae of Covid are no joke and cause life upheavels that most of us can't imagine.  But we still see resistance from Republicans to universal health coverage.  Why is that?   Everyone deserves access to competent medical care.  Everyone.
2020-08-09 15:17:38,"I couldn't agree with Ross more, particularly regarding the idea of ""being your own doctor"" and listening to your body.  My family too has a history with Lyme/Bartonella. It derailed our daughters college education while the mainstream CDC guided doctors of this country (to this day) continue to deny the existence of chronic Lyme.  I fear the same will happen with Covid-19. Why? Because the insurance companies who control our healthcare system simply don't want another chronic illness to damage their bottom line.  So with their mammoth lobbying power they will fight tooth and nail to make sure the CDC and NIH insist that chronic Covid is
a ""made-up disease"".  And when proof of the contrary arises (ie; Embers Monkey Trial <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029914"" target=""_blank"">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029914</a>) they will ignore it or fund their own ""studies"" to debunk it lest they have to admit they were wrong and face the music. (And the lawsuits)"
2020-08-09 15:21:20,"""If you don’t have a history of imagined illness, if you were generally healthy up until a few months ago, if your body felt normal and now it feels invaded, you should have a reasonable level of trust that it isn’t just “in your head” — that you’re dealing with a real infection or immune response, not some miasma in your subconscious.""

Or is it? Could it be possible, that uncounted thousands and thousands of people were already on the verge of a mental and physical breakdown, pre Covid-19? When the jamming on the brakes at the last second sort of sudden - simply forced time on them to break down? I think it is. 

The last few years have been one assault on our senses and National mind-set after another. We've been assaulted by lies/crimes from the WH. Apathy from one Party, flubs from the other. We're fighting Nazi's again! Racial animus, misplaced blame. Distrust at an all time high. Families torn up over Trump. 

All compounded by tough personal events in all our lives. Many peoples jobs were already on the line before Covid struck. Many students, of all ages, were long struggling with school and social pressures when Covid sent them home. Many relationships were on, or heading to the rocks - before partners were forced to shelter in place...""a place"" many couples were avoiding. (some weathered it, how many have not?)

Maybe many people have simply crashed and burned? Where forced down-time made it so the broken parts couldn't be ignored? 

Isn't that ""God"" talking?"

2020-08-09 15:36:16,"My suggestion would be to not read the mainstream press about the medical effects of Covid-19.  In a determined effort (apparently) to ratchet up the pessimism about the pandemic, they have rushed to post and publish every possible symptom or side effect of the virus no matter what the sample size or source, despite their tut-tutting about misinformation.  They also persist in reporting on pandemic modeling, despite the fact that the models are almost invariably wrong.  Trust and listen to your body, but not the press when it comes to this disease."

""In this study of a cohort of German patients recently recovered from COVID-19 infection, CMR (cardiac MRI) revealed cardiac involvement in 78 patients (78%) and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60 patients (60%), independent of preexisting conditions, severity and overall course of the acute illness, and time from the original diagnosis.

2020-08-09 15:41:34,"Mr Douthat, you need to talk with my brother before writing your book about Lyme disease and its aftermath.  He experienced much of what you did, later getting an infection that ended up taking his lung, and now he lives in terror of getting the coronavirus (and because I live with him--I was his caretaker for a couple years--I too must live under this quarantine too).  We have a lot of information that would be confirm and deepen some of your data on Lyme, and we desperately want to share it so it helps somebody.  Just email me."
2020-08-09 15:50:24,"It is refreshing to have someone talk about long-term illness.  The hazy boundaries between what is experienced and what can be fought, the dreariness for both the ill and the friends and family, is not often appreciated.  The internet can indeed be one's friend, and not only for suggestions.  Reading a long series of complaints can first reinforce a grievance, but eventually can lead to a desire to leave the chorus and try something else, if only a desire to work on what can be improved."
2020-08-09 15:51:06,"Great column Ross. I’ve had multiple relatives that suffered from Lyme disease for months while being repeatedly misdiagnosed by their doctors. It was only their persistence that finally convinced the doctors to actually test them for Lyme and receive proper treatment.

And to all those commenters out there maligning Ross’s recommendation to ask for help from God. A healthy spirit aids a healthy mind. Some people feed their spirit in different ways, but this liberal, like Ross, still turns to God and meditation. Keep an open mind."

2020-08-09 16:03:55,"I went on a similar health journey many years ago. I was lucky that I had the confidence, strength and research skills to get past many obstacles. After two years of Western medicine and many blind alleys, I was about 80% of my usual self. I shifted to Eastern medicine as a way to augment Western. I did most of this based on my internet research but by then I had a primary doctor whose attitude was, ""Why not?."" Although I was not prepared to believe it - and frankly desperate to be my old self - acupuncture brought me back to nearly 100% after just a few sessions. I continued it for four years and I continue to take drugs but occasionally research the internet to see if there's something new on the horizon. My doctor simple doesn't have the time or curiosity. One thing the acupuncturist said was, ""You have to learn to make peace with this. You can't reason or fight your way out of everything."" He is partly right but I would be a wreck of my former self if I hadn't taken this head on in the beginning."
2020-08-09 16:08:50,"Thank you Ross for this brilliant and heartfelt essay.  Although your primary focus is on people who suffer long-term Covid symptoms, your words are equally true for all persons who suffer from chronic conditions that are ignored or poorly understood by Western medicine.  Suffering through any poorly understood chronic illness is in fact a lonely journey full of self-doubt and doubtful doctors.  Your essay shines a light on this experience, and that in itself is a kind of healing."
2020-08-09 16:10:52,"Thank you for this. Like many others I too have experienced chronic illness. I’ve broken down in tears at my doctor’s office wondering if I’d ever get better, and I’ve spent long nights on internet forums seeking support and advice from fellow sufferers. What you describe is an accurate reflection of my experience, especially the need to hold out hope for healing above all. We can only hope that as more of the population experiences chronic illness from COVID, that collectively we learn to hold a little more empathy and compassion towards one another. Together we must build a society — and elect political leaders — with empathy and understanding for our fellow humans across a range of issues, not just chronic illness and disability but race, poverty, and addiction, to name a few. I hold out hope this is possible."
2020-08-09 15:45:55,"Please don’t do this “So to some uncertain extent, you may need to become your own doctor.” Doctors have a lot of knowledge and experience that helps them make informed decisions even with an unknown illness. You do not. Even if you do your ‘research’ it will not compare to the knowledge of medical professionals and the research and collaboration they are doing to combat this virus.

There is only one thing you know BETTER than a doctor and that is how you feel. You know how you feel. They do not. Let them know all the details and they can help you better. Communication is key."

As a physician myself, I agree that my profession offers little for chronic symptoms. And I believe you, they are real and they can be debilitating.
I do have a thought, a non-medical one to offer you.
All of us can remember a time when we were stressed out and then, we got sick. We have all experienced that relationship between our mind being in a bad place and ill health as a result. 
Well, there is nothing more fundamental to the natural world than balance. Balance is particularly important and characteristic of living organisms such as ourselves. So, if a mind in poor balance can make you sick, well, a mind in a good place can help make you well. This must be the case given the importance of balance to sustained life.
That is the easy part, the hard part is how to get your mind to that healing place.
There is not likely yo be one answer as we are all so different. Ah that patients were all the same DC-10!
They are not so YOU need to find what nourishes your mind and thereby, your health. For you it might be God, and faith in God. For me it is more likely to be the natural world and the wonders therein. I feel that love is big, the ability to share love and feel love from others. Movement tends to be important as does healthy food. 
These are just suggestions, you know what nourishes you the best. 
Have at it, I believe in you."

2020-08-09 16:33:28,"This is excellent advice, particularly the first suggestion that ""Impatience is your friend."" Too many people have been told to live with illness and pain that are treatable. 

I would add that not all doctors are up to date on the latest treatments for chronic illness, so consider getting a second opinion. I was told by a specialist that in the 1980s, I would have been prescribed strong painkillers for my illness; in the '90s, it would have been antidepressants. Instead, he recommended that I take a daily probiotic and change my diet, and he estimated that I would start to feel better in a month. He was right. Meanwhile, other doctors are still prescribing opioids for the same condition, with all their addiction risks and harmful side effects."
2020-08-09 16:33:56,"Ross
You totally miss the white elephant in the room.  America does not  truly have healthcare, when this pandemic finally fades, the reality will be laid bare.  Who will pay for this unpaid bill?  Probably most If not all affected Americans lack the coverage to pay and hospitals will lack the ability to cost shift.    Praying would not alter this dynamic either.  

Finally will we as a Nation finally address the reality of universal healthcare?  All of the world understood this truth decades before."
2020-08-09 16:35:51,"Ross frequently is a little ""too deep"" for me.  This was good, practical and sincere advice.  Thanks."

2020-08-09 16:37:26,"Having just experienced a short but gruesome bout with Lyme disease - cured now - I can more than sympathize with what Russ has been struggling with. I was healed not by prayer but by four weeks of Doxycycline. So I ask in all seriousness, why ask God to help cure you when he could - and should - have prevented you from getting in the first place?  From what I hear, he's omniscient and all powerful and yet he allows all manner of tragedies, large and small, to happen. So to then be advised to turn to him for consolation makes absolutely no sense to me.  I continue to believe that we're on our own here on Earth and that reason and science, informed by humanism, are what we must turn to save both ourselves and our planet."
2020-08-09 16:37:52,"From my own experience of chronic illness, and eventually recovering from it, one thing that will absolutely help your body is to try to get systemic inflammation down. Your body wants to heal, but it is difficult if the whole body is irritated and inflamed internally. One of the most effective ways to do this is to seriously clean up your diet and remove all processed foods. From there, a 30-day elimination diet will help you pinpoint if you are eating any foods that normally would be healthy, but you have developed a sensitivity to. It sounds daunting from the outside, but controlling illness and achieving health through the food you eat is very empowering. Plus it gets easier and easier to follow once it becomes your new normal and is restoring true health, not just masking it with medicines. Realizing I had tapped my (truly helpful and considerate) doctors out as far as getting me back to health was the push I needed to try something else. I am so thankful for that."
2020-08-09 16:40:11,"Everyone has forgotten the HIV pandemic and why is that? There is no vaccine and there is no cure for HIV infection although it still remains a chronic illness that requires life long treatment with highly active anti retroviral combination drugs.

COVID does not need to be a chronic illness if treated by professionals. The big difference is COVID is CURABLE in 96% of the below 55 cases and those above 55 can be treated promptly from becoming a chronic illness id it progresses to hyper inflammation or worse to blood clots in organs and to multiple organ dysfunction and to death. The standard of care is vastly improved with the knowledge gained in the past 5 months. I expect the overall fatality rate due to COVID-19 to go down to 1% from the current 3% because most of the spread has been in those below 55. Currently, there are 160,000+ deaths due to COVID-19 and I would very surprised that even with the spread and the surge no more than 10,000 would die in the coming months if they receive the best health care to ensure their survival. Prevention is better than cure but with no vaccine on the horizon until next years, those above 55 who want to live longer should not let COVID hasten their death. With uncertainty as to what happens in some kids, it would be best if all persons irrespective of age are kept safe especially if they have underlying chronic illnesses/conditions eg diabetes, obesity, hypertension, genetic or acquired immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease condition."

Maybe there is a next step of this: Utilize your own intelligence? Absolutely. But exercised long enough, a wisdom emerges that transcends just your little human time lines, and you participate in a Wisdom for all, shared through entitlement. All I would add to RD's excellent article is this: If you can not pray to God, and many find this hard, then understand by prayer we mean a communion, call it Nature if you will, call it whatever you want, but understand that suffering is not what you deserve, for life has given us what we need, if we are still enough to hear. The truth will set you free, with the freedom to chose a Wisdom, that far exceeds what seems to be very real human limitations. We must proceed in faith and trust, however we define that or call it, expecting that an answer will come."

When I told her about it, she just said, ""Sometimes viruses can be like that."" In fact, when I had my blood work, my white cell count was low. When it was repeated a month later, it was back to normal. Strange little devils those viruses."

So it may help to eat foods that decrease the inflammation. Load up on omega 3's- plenty of salmon and sardines (a can of sardines for breakfast every morning), olives, olive oils, walnuts. Cut out all seed oils (or as  much as you can) You do not have to eat soy oil (the major culprit in everything), safflower, sunflower, corn oil. These oils are unstable and can create severe chronic inflammation, that is exacerbated when one is ill. Butter is fine. Avocados- as many as you can eat. Good luck."

I hope that people read it in the spirit intended, not as an attack on science, but a call to listen to yourself and persevere.

I went online and searched resources after resource to find the constellation of symptoms she had, as well as the only know effective treatment. Of note, there were multiple sites espousing treatments too numerous and bizarre to list. I brought that information to her neurologist, he ordered the therapeutics, and it worked. Mr. Douthat is correct in his assessment that persistence is absolutely essential. As is knowledge of your own body, faith in yourself and whatever power you identify with. 
Just note, the internet is a swirling maelstrom of untested theories, treatments, and beliefs on ALL diseases. Carefully vet any ""authority"" espousing ""the cure."" We only get one life, use critical thinking and decision making in your assessments and actions. Injecting disinfectants or inserting UV light sources won't work."

I am a liberal. I am an atheist. I am for a strict separation of Church and State. But I do not find it a crime for Ross Douthat to offer that prayer has helped him and may help other people. To criticize that is not only quite intolerant, but also ignorant of the reality of religion.

Are atheist liberals condemned to being morose and pessimistic? If we defend reason for ourselves, why forbid the religious from reaping the advantages of hope? Maybe there is something scientific to the idea that faith can transfrom into hope no matter how fantastical the belief.

In the mid 70's I was feeling awfully tired, weak with joint pain.
I actually walked into a Dr.s office near the Lee monument in Richmond Va.(Dr.s row). The Dr. was retired and just had office open for the poor and street people. We talked and he sent me to another Dr. across town, even gave me a little cab money. The new Dr. was expecting me. We talked and he did some blood work(lab in office then). That afternoon I was checked into hospital and spent more than a week. My Dr. was trying to figure out the problem with tests and regular blood work. Finally, he received results from a lab in California that had new diagnostics.
He said I had Reiters Syndrome which was related to Arthritis
and auto-immune disorders. He started with many non-steroidal anti-inflammatory treatments to no real avial. He then suggested a steroidal treatment. Was early 70's but he realized the potential dangers of steroids. After discussion I made the final decision for short trial of steroidals(3yrs?). He had me in his office twice a week doing blood work. It was amazing the difference. Yr later moved to Me.. First visit to young local Dr., he asked what is Reiters Syndrome? He had a Harvard Med. degree! He would not fill the script but after talk to my doc he did and said my dr. was an excellent DIAGNOSTICIAN. That is what is missing today.
My doc is 84. Still working. loves it!"

2020-08-09 16:52:15,"We need to fire Donald Trump, who denied and then neglected coronavirus.

170,000 Americans have died.  Millions have lost their jobs.  20 million people are facing eviction from their homes.

In Beirut, the negligence and gross mismanagement of the government led to last week's blast at the port which killed 160 people.  Thousands of people in Beirut are in the streets demanding the resignation of the government for not protecting the people.

Why are people in Beirut demanding the resignation of the government after 160 people were killed due to government negligence when, in the United States, government negligence has killed 170,000+ and nobody is demanding Donald Trump resign? 

Why are the people in Beirut enraged that citizens were killed because of the mismanagement and indifference of the government but Americans have been passively, if unhappily, going along with Trump's lies, mismanagement, negligence and indifference for 6 months while the coronavirus continues to spread?

The American people and its representatives are too afraid of
Donald Trump to demand his resignation for allowing a pandemic to spread among us unchecked while our economy and social safety nets have been destroyed.

How bad does it have to get before we hear demands for Trump's resignation?

How bad does it have to get?"
2020-08-09 16:45:32,"Just to underline an important point: Often - in general, and especially with a new disease like this one - doctors simply do not KNOW what is best to do. It isn't just that they are often poor communicators, tend to pooh-pooh things they don't understand, can be a bit arrogant, etc. In many cases, they are as much at sea as anyone! So (carefully - with attention and judgment) looking to other sources of information, and trying out different possibilities for relief, can be a very good idea."
2020-08-09 17:27:58,"Thanks, Ross. This is generous of you, and provides more real support than we're accustomed to finding online. Furthermore, you're demonstrating in simple fashion how we can help each other and why that matters more each day."
2020-08-09 18:47:13,"I thank Ross Douthat for sharing his experience with readers. His advice will be valuable to many. Unfortunately, many of his practical suggestions require time, resources and money that aren’t available to most Americans. It’s very important that we remember that truth."
2020-08-09 18:48:54,"Ross, my sympathy for your struggles with chronic illnesses.  I’d add that you need to keep your brain busy on other pursuits, not only because the diversion can be good, but also because we are wired to keep our minds busy, and heeding that call simply makes us feel better.  I’d also be extra cautious about relying on the internet.  You duly note that web searches should be used carefully, but I’d add that strict discipline is needed to avoid an over-reliance on the web, and extreme caution is needed to avoid (or discern) wacky and downright dangerous content.  In the wrong hands - which includes ill people who are desperate for answers - the web’s awesome but blunt power can make a challenging emotional situation a lot worse."
2020-08-09 18:51:06,"whoa! online research is a learned skill. its takes serious efforts to ferret out true, data based medical information. the avg. sick person likely doesn't have the time, energy or research skills to find alternative answers to what ails them, that are not only safe, but effective. the reality is, we all should be forced to take a few research science classes."
2020-08-09 19:00:55,"Chronic illness lacking all effective treatment was a common reality until the mid Twentieth century. Whether understood or mysterious, no cure was possible. Somehow, victims coped until the very end. FDR’s paralysis and untreatable hypertension come to mind.
There are few fates as terrifying as chronic suffering in which scientific medicine can define no cause—think chronic fatigue syndrome in the last decades of the Twentieth century.
Humans fear the dark because we fear the unknown. That is why seemingly endless inexplicable suffering Is so much more disabling than equally disabling ,but well understood, chronic Illness. The fear of the unknown multiplies suffering.
The Cartesian mind/ body dichotomy in chronic  falls prey to the fallacy that if medicine cannot find an explanation in the body then the cause must be located in the mind. 
In fact, with respect to chronic illness, the psyche and the soma—mind and body—are a unity. Mysterious. disease without diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment affect mind and body simultaneously.
Mr Douthat is correct to advise that desperate disease justifies sufferers to  pursue other  strategies than science based medicine. 
With due diligence to avoid fraud and risk, “Alternative Therapy” does not compete with science when science has no answers. Even if the results of such treatments are limited and based on the placebo effect, it is improvement however limited that is the acid test of utility."
2020-08-09 19:08:01,"Online communities filled with personal anecdotes are *not* evidence. A basic understanding of science and statistics will show you that these online communities easily become conspiracy-theory-driven echo chambers due to “self selection bias.” (Google it.) Instead, we need to invest in scientifically valid, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trials and virology research. Facebook and 4Chan are the exact opposite of evidence and science."
2020-08-09 19:21:27,Thank you for sharing. I’ve had a form of chronic fatigue syndrome for 16 years and have experienced many of the same things as you.  Some people seem to have this post COVID. It gives me hope that now more research will be done on this frustrating ailment.
2020-08-09 19:39:06,"Thank you for sharing your experience with chronic illness.  Chronic illness is something that cannot be fully understood except by those who have experienced it.  And the cost, personal, financial, social and on every level cannot be fully understood except through personal experience. 

As someone who has lived for decades with a progressive degenerative incurable neurological disorder, I have seen or experienced what most people with chronic illness will unfortunately experience. That experience will be that others, including doctors will doubt or discount your condition, you will have large expenses and damage to your credit rating (even with having both Medicare and private insurance), people will ghost you and many will continue to doubt your condition and experience, let alone understand it. As a person with a relatively rare and hard to diagnose condition, I'm sure that Mr. Douthat, even with his background, had to endure doctors and others who claimed that it was all in his head or a ""somatic"" condition. The difference between acute and chronic conditions is not understood by most people. Acutely ill people, which our system is designed to treat, get well. Chronically ill people, do not get well. They are seen as whiny and depressing and often blamed for being sick.

The chronically ill usually learn over time what helps them. The rest of society could help by understanding that there but for the grace of God go themselves and substituting empathy for judgment."

And to top it off I hurt my neck walking to the tee box in between. So all the advice in this article is excellent  - my version of it brought me back to functionality. A little fatigued still, but a big improvement since last summer. One thing I would like to say is don’t take synthetic opiates if you can help it - they cause even more pain if you can recover from addiction. I’ve been healthy my whole life so I’m not out looking for symptoms or excuses, so it was real and diagnosed. Finally a non-PC comment, prayer and forgiveness really brought me reassurance."

2020-08-09 20:50:12,"Please be extremely cautious in assuming that ""keep moving,"" which is commonly recommended and usually beneficial for other illnesses, will similarly work for  Post-Covid symptoms. My wife has had ME/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome for over 15 years; the illness that Dr. Fauci says most closely mirrors Post-Covid. Until the past few years, exercise was commonly recommended. Tragically, as my wife learned,  exercise is usually significantly harmful for those with ME. It amplifies the pain and debilitating fatigue, complicating prospects for recovery.  Equally concerning is that most Doctors are not trained about ME and misdiagnosis is very common, leading to ""keep moving"" recommendations that inadvertently cause harm."
2020-08-09 21:04:04,"Perhaps one good thing thay will come of Covid-19 is that doctors and insurance companies will start taking post viral syndromes seriously. I for one have endured decades of tinnitus, tremors, brain fog, headaches, fatigue and chronic pain—all starting after a strange bout of the flu (?) in the summer of 1991. I learned very quickly, as mentioned in this article, that when there is no scientific explanation doctors are very quick to say it’s all in your head. It wasn’t until i saw a CFS doctor in 2011 that did extensive blood tests and prescribed a regemin of supplements that i felt better. Unfortunately neither the expensive tests or treatments were covered by insurance."

2020-08-09 19:25:14,"I’ve lived into a chronic auto-immune illness (and the search for healing) for over 30 years now...and I applaud the depth, wisdom and emotional/intellectual candor of this column.  When reports came out, I too immediately noticed physical and existential similarities between my condition and the wrenching difficulties of post-COVID patients with ongoing symptoms.  I agree with so much of your advice, and would add one discovery of my own:  one cannot allow the search for healing to become a mania in and of itself.  The search for healing must proceed without grasping too tightly to a single idea of how that healing will be achieved.  This is where your advice about opening to God (as one conceives if God) is spot on.  A radical faith, faithfulness and openness is required, even as one narrows down different approaches to becoming well.  With other readers, I too think that you are really hitting your stride Ross, and not just in this very personal piece, but in much of your writing.  When you are ready to write that book, I’ll be glad to collaborate!  “Nel mezzo del camin di nostra vita, mi ritrovai per una selva oscura....ma per trattar del ben  ch’i vi trovai, diro de l’altre cose ch’i vi ho scorte!”  Bravo."

2) Wear a mask if you do go out, and 
3) Keep six feet away from those that you don’t live with, even when wearing a mask.  


Okay, now that I’ve said that, on to more important stuff.  

First, COVID-19 is not a liberal left-wing conspiracy to oust President Trump. He’s doing that all by himself.  COVID-19 is a VIRUS.  Yup, it occurs naturally in the environment.  There are lots of similar things occurring all the time. This one just happens to be dangerous to our species.  That’s just the way it is.  The sooner we accept that and get on with letting the scientists develop a vaccine, the sooner we will stop dying of the virus.  

There are ways to mitigate the spread (See my 3 points above) and so if people would just do those 3 really simple things it will dramatically reduce the spread of the virus.  

So, there you have it.  Easy-Peasy.  Now just do it.

One theory has it that viruses mutate to less deadly forms, on the rational grounds that killing your host off is not good virus survival policy.  Another is that while perfect immunity is not going to be achieved, enough partial immunity after surviving the flu will leave enough people resistant, at least for some time, that the prevalence of the virus lessens.  Both of these scenarios are, as Donald Trump says, perfectly reasonable, and he's probably quoting someone medical who knows the history of the Spanish flu."
2020-08-05 12:37:41,"The hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) battleground has not relented, despite strong data from the Recovery trial. It flourishes outside the tensions at issue in this article. HCQ, to many, is still a game changer in the science blog and medical social networking sites I frequent. The networking sites appear to be enriched in specialties who do not frequently care for Covid-19 patients- orthopedists, neurosurgeons, dermatologists, ophthalmologists. They frequently use ad hominem attacks, claim opposition to HCQ is motivated only by animus for the president and decry the politicization of the pandemic, treatments and public health interventions.  They do not answer critiques of the retrospective HCQ studies that supports its use and frequently move the goal posts when limitations are pointed out. ""The study did not include azithromycin, and/or zinc.  It was started too late  and the dose was not correct, (begging the fact that in any retrospective study an optimal dose is not decided).""  
It is clear that, at best, HCQ will never be a game changer and probably of little benefit at all. The few randomized studies show no benefit and the retrospective studies  are all over the map. 

A retired rheumatologist, (immunology, some infectious disease expertise) I would be one of those demanding certain treatments. Tocilizumab, one of 'my drugs', would have been my choice early but now I would politely request anakinra in the right situation. HCQ, another of 'my drugs' not so much."

2020-08-05 15:42:32,"The challenge of our times is not COVID but rather, our inability to understand that apparently opposing view points can only drive us to a better outcome by a collaborative approach.

It is puzzling for me that this article does not address a key stakeholder in this equation: the patient. How well informed are they? In my view, we failed to admit our ignorance and communicate that to patients. One side of the aisle went with “it is a game changer” the other believed every poorly designed retrospective study (including some potentially fraudulent) that showed the game changer was not. The standards for publication even in the most prestigious medicine journals declined dramatically. Medical organizations went on to publish multipage guidelines with no evidence whatsoever. Wasn’t a better message to state that we knew very little and that the best way to move forward is to admit this, convey this to patients and allow them to decide? And to explain this clearly. Patients are not signing up to an intervention versus no intervention (just placebo). All these studies compare what we do for many diseases that can land you in Intensive Care: supportive care to that same supportive care with an additional unproven intervention.

These multiple local studies by different health care systems may actually slow progress by competing with enrollment in better powered, larger studies such as RECOVERY and those organized by the US NIH."

2020-08-05 15:49:42,"This is a very thought-provoking article and I feel simultaneously well-informed and troubled after reading it. I found myself first agreeing with the researchers and then sympathizing with the clinicians after reading about their experiences. 

The battle between hard earned front-line expertise and  detached mathematical reasoning is occurring in many arenas - business, engineering, and sports among others but the stakes are clearly highest in medicine.

As I read this article a compromise occurred to me. Maybe we should give a limited set of veteran front-line doctors some latitude to treat as they see fit. We may get some ideas for double-blind clinical trials from their experiences."
2020-08-05 15:55:55,"This is a longstanding challenge with medical practice. Physicians sell the field as a science that is based on evidence, but then ignore the scientific method in favor of ""clinical practice"" when they don't want to follow the scientific method.  

We see the results in many places. It is somewhat innocuous when doctors use medicines that are traditionally prescribed for a given condition, which turn out to have little effect but are known to have little risk.  It is less innocuous when when doctors argue against scientific and professional recommendations in favor of additional breast and prostate cancer screening that is not scientifically justifiable. 

For a disease such as coronavirus, there should be a standard progression of care, which lays out the treatments to be used in various situations.  What sense does it make for each individual doctor to come up with their own bespoke treatment options?"
2020-08-05 15:56:10,"The panic or irrationality isn’t confined to hospitals. There is common sense precautionary reason for everyone to wear a mask in many types of situations, much of which has nothing to with masks themselves but how they change perceptions and behavior. That said, the reasons for doing so coming from Dr. Fauci and the CDC on down have no as-yet scientific basis. They are effectively guesses or issue advocacy being presented as science, and thus misleading the public by not telling the truth. In the long run, if not sooner, that approach risks undermining confidence in the scientific process, in a country where many are already skeptical or more."

 One political party has been largely responsible for this, the GOP.  For close to 50 years they've been waging a war against 'big government' -  regulations and taxes really. Regulations and the taxes needed to create and operate organizations like the CDC, EPA  and OSHA, burrs under the saddles of the 1%.  Not that the Democratic party can avoid almost equal blame with the 'go along to get along' philosophy the party adopted beginning with the
Clintons. It really is time for change - perhaps even too late."

I hope non professional readers can experience the real tensions as much as I did. It is also a case study in medical bioethics. In day to day medicine there are often decisions to be made balancing the need of my individual patient with other considerations. This is reporting well done!"
2020-08-05 16:57:37,"All persons must understand the difference between a medical doctor   and a PhD  molecular biologist researcher doctor.

Medical doctors ""practice"", they are (hopefully) skilled diagnosticians with a useful understanding of the science behind the medications they prescribe.     Their oath is ""do no harm"" and frequently this leads to conservative medical practice that mostly favors proven approaches without significant scientific curiosity about new peer reviewed science.    This is understandable because medical doctors seldon have a full comprehension about the science behind new medications.

PhD molecular biologist in research and development have fuller understanding of the specialized field in which they work.   They are by nature intellectually curious and inventive and most important they act upon these 'instincts'.  They follow a centuries old 'scientific methodology' and use sophisticated statistical analysis to draw conclusions.   Conclusions are published, peers review them and look for 'cracks' in the thesis.

In summary,   we are better served to listen to the R&D doctors and this applies to the medical doctors."
2020-08-05 17:10:15,"From the article, these doctors are debating the ethics of randomized trials vs. treating the patient as an individual, but there is no mention of what the patient's wish is. I consider it highly unethical to be making decisions about the patient's care without the consent of the patient as to which course is taken. If the patient is unable to respond, then the assumption has to be that he/she would not want to be a guinea pig but would want the best possible care. I am astounded that, as this article seems to describe, that there are situations going on which the patient is being left out of the decision process. That is flat out wrong."
2020-08-05 14:59:51,"As an academic critical care physician, this saga has shaken my confidence in medical education. The number of my colleagues apparently willing to discard basic scientific principles of intensive care medicine in order to “do something” should
give us all pause. The number of targeted therapies which have ever shown benefit in ARDS and/or septic shock is somewhere between zero and three depending on your definition of “targeted” and “benefit”￼. Therefore, the pretest probability that a new, fancy, or expensive drug will prove a silver bullet is exceptionally low- so low that we should be skeptical of such claims and highly attuned to possible harms.

When this is all said and done, many more patients will have been harmed by the abdication of evidence-based critical care medicine￼ than will have been helped by well-meaning doctors making things up as they go."

2020-08-05 15:42:30,"Hubris— excessive pride or self-confidence

Clinical judgment as exemplified by Dr Kory and others trying untested treatments is simply hubris. Physicians (I am one) need to take a hard look in the mirror and realize we aren’t as amazing as we think we are, not as smart, not as wise, not as knowing. Dr. Spyropolous may have used harsh language but he was right — it is basically witchcraft. 

Physicians need to truly understand what is meant by the art and science of medicine. Science is using tested and proven treatments, not “my drug” or “my protocol”. It has no place for Art. The art is to focus on compassion, comfort, caring, and kindness."
2020-08-05 16:29:20,"Beautifully captures the daily dilemmas of critical care . Small changes and close monitoring for side effects is a common practice and adherence to basic care principles has helped the majority . ARDS has always been a challenge and COVID19 has been added to the list of causes . Anticoagulant use could have been foreseen earlier as in the H1N1 influenza studies there were 25% or so with pulmonary embolism (<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58d0710a1.htm"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58d0710a1.htm</a>) .

2020-08-05 15:07:41,"I don't know, as an objective layperson it really looks to me like HCQ is being written off outright with little evidence especially by the left either because president Trump originally promoted it, or because big Pharma wants to sell its super overpriced drugs ( which aren't miracle cures either anyway )instead of this cheap time tested alternative, or both. I guess time will tell. Sad if people are playing partisan politics or trying to profit off this pandemic though."
2020-08-05 15:56:00,"The doctors' god complex is real. And arguments like this fuel the belief that doctors and scientists are infallible, making their rare but inevitable failures and mistakes seem like something evil. We have to get back to believing that doctors and scientists are doing their best. 

Losing a loved one is terrible. Dying isn't so great either. But it happens. Obviously I haven't died yet! But I have lost a loved one who didn't get the absolute best care possible. And in hindsight, our family didn't make the best decisions possible, either. It turns out we're human."
2020-08-05 16:03:08,"Clinical trials are of little value if carefully designed and approved protocols are not followed. That said, surely, a protocol must allow for the withdrawal of subjects during a trial? And references to witchcraft are not helpful when a patient is dying. But that is the atmosphere we're in---when Trump clearly knows nothing about ethics in research--or in any sphere. Remember, he had the DHHS buy 60 million doses of hydroxchloroquine: he has to recoup the cost somehow; and his spineless appointees have never heard of falling on their swords for the greater good.
Too many patients are assigned to routine trials that are run through hospital boards by Pharma. Doctors are often paid a ""bounty"" for each patient enrolled. That needs to be cleaned up. Anecdote: regarding one such proposed trial, some clearances were required from hospital admin. I had a minor role in prepping the proposal for review. I refused to sign off. The doctor fronting the trial said if I signed off, he'd buy me dinner. Did I seem so cheap?"
2020-08-05 16:09:37,This will be the NewYorkTimes Sunday Magazine issue for thousands of us to hold onto and refer back to.  Congratulations to Susan Dominus for so clearly illustrating some of the torturous paths the solution to Covid-19 must unfortunately take.
2020-08-05 16:47:11,"Interestingly none of the doctors who advocate for using drugs like hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin with zinc randomly for a novel viral infection like covid-19, can cite anywhere in the history of modern medicine that doctors in a matter of weeks or months could identify an effective treatment for any infectious or other diseases. Again, for those like Trump who are not paying attention— neither of these drugs have ever been shown to treat any viral infection and why would you rush to use either of them without a scientific study to confirm their utility. Why would a doctor care about the political stance of the President when deciding to use an effective treatment? The doctors who oppose the use of these unproven and unlikely to be effective drugs are showing sound judgement. The President searches the internet to find any supposed doctor/ quack who agrees with him and Navarro and the rest of them who are not licensed to practice medicine or give medical advice. You don’t need to find a cure to stop this pandemic—just universal mask use for 2 months will do the trick. Maybe, if some doctor on the internet who says he likes Trump will get him to listen and mandate mask use and we can tell Trump it was his own idea."
2020-08-05 15:52:32,"The art of medicine versus the sciene of medicine.. I am completely ""in favor of"" the placebo effect  whether on docotr or patient.  That said.

MDs always carry two masks with you.  and when possible place the patient in  prone position.  What a terribly tricky disease... and we still know so little. 

I will continue to wear my maks and possibly gloves- becaue then I remember to wash my hands and face when I get home.

Having eaten out the other day,  I realized that when I am around other people I really want my nose covered-while my mouth is uncoverd so I can masticate!! -- and wonder how many cases of Covid in the bar and on the beach might have been prevented had people simply breathed filtered air!! -Keppt the aerosol out of their sinuses and lungs.   

I think we have to work harder on prevention everyone out there... Novel is the word that best describes this disease."
2020-08-05 16:49:36,"This article is way beyond good. The attention and care taken and the substance presented, in such a clear rational way is commendable. That I have a 100 (1001?) comments and can't quite organize even a few, I hope is my small compliment to illustrate the author's skill. So some  thoughts.

- It's interesting, much early usable research data emerging from Britain, seems to stand in contrast to the U.S. experience (so far).
- If evidence emerged, after the fact, that steroid therapy as practiced by Dr. Kory did great harm, I suspect that we would not hear much about it from him.
- Being a good clinician and a good clinical researcher are not synonomous (far from it). Also, as this pandemic put great pressure on critical staff resources (incl. nursing, RTs, etc.), it takes specialized, expert staff to conduct clinical trials successfully, especially in critical care studies.
- I have been surprised by info so far that emerged on toci, when treating ""cytokine storm"", compared to steroid therapy. But when treating severe CRS with toci in CART (T cell) cancer studies, (very) early identification and intervention is all-important to reducing mortality.  All is made way more difficult, with COVID-19, when dealing with an active infection.

- one of more, if not most,  impt quotes in article,

“panicked rhetoric about right-to-try must be aggressively discouraged in order for scientists to learn what regimens or vaccines actually work.”"
2020-08-05 17:24:24,"There has always been a disconnect between researchers in medicine and those executing treatments to save patients. Researchers can concisely and diagrammatically portray the effects of covid so far known and disseminate it to all hospitals in the US. At each arm of the effect they can list the treatment trials ongoing. Now doctors can rapidly be aware of which drugs can be used and how they need to use them. Instead doctors are left with dying patients, much emotion, and a history of expertise in prescribing drugs for seemingly similar situations. The problem with the latter is, with old diseases one has seen a myriad side effects or problems and is comfortable with addressing them. With an unknown disease, you have no idea of the side effects of old drugs or the time frame in which they might make their appearance. That said, I am with the doctors. When confronted with desperation and death, having taken an oath to saving lives, how can researchers expect them to standby patiently? Please figure out an effective communication channel. The rest of us depend on it. 

I still feel that folks are missing the point with coenzymes and cofactors like vitamins and minerals. Why not set that as the baseline for every drug trial? Unless Vit C or D etc. interacts and prevents a drug from working I see it only as a positive. Hydroxychloroquine without Zn and with macrolide antibiotics.....such a tragic and wasted situation."
2020-08-05 18:00:23,"I am on the side of the researchers.  Yes, it is infinitely hard to not to “rescue” critically ill patients who may be part of a drug trial.  But it ultimately keeps us from knowing how to treat patients in the future.  With millions of lives at stake worldwide, we have to rely on the cold, hard science.  This virus is too unforgiving for us to do otherwise."
2020-08-05 18:01:11,"This was an interesting read. I'm a trainee- resident during the spring, now infectious diseases fellow. I would add a couple points: 
- there are many clinician-researchers and a lot of research heavy MDs were asked to take on more clinical shifts than usual during COVID. These are not mutually exclusive communities. 
- the pressure on Dr Hahn to withhold therapeutic anticoagulation to a patient based on the patient's participation in the trial - that's unethical and it should be clarified for readers. All RCT consents include the option to withdraw from the study for any reason 
-  Practicing at a hospital where there was a treatment committee reviewing evidence and providing protocols on when to use the therapies - one thing that I found frustrating was the rapid change in protocols (almost daily at times), but not based on new evidence from published trials."
2020-08-05 18:06:47,"The clinical trial of coagulants could have been amended to include the increase to a higher dose as part of the study endpoint (provided the original endpoint was also bad for the patient) since the decision to increase the dose was driven by the clinical observation that the blinded dose was not working.

When clinical equipoise is arguable, a 2:1 allocation of patients  to active drug vs placebo is also a work around.

But the real take home lesson for me is “Don’t use inflammatory language with your colleagues.

I believe in clinical trials."
2020-08-05 18:16:23,"So whatever in the world happened to Bayes Theorem and adjusting your understanding and probabilities as you have more and more results?

And, since we have such a large number of patients, let’s add in the advances in clustering subjects to help with finding how different populations respond?

About 1973 in the NIH summer institute at UC Berkeley our final exam was three hours and one problem. I suggested that for large samples half be set aside for speculating and half be reserved for them testing the apparent best guesses.

Greybill totally agreed and incorporated it. Now we have advanced much further in finding the most useful clusters (might be race and age and previous health and whatever) and our initial “guesses or ‘estimates’ and the use of our best guesses as they evolve in the experimental group and then test the several best in very large populations. 

‘Best’ and clusters might well include family, patient, and ER wishes and concerns. 

So if ER physicians choose to be independent of researchers, test them in their own clusters and compare results. 

Now the challenge is still how do we give placebos versus given. I suggest that should be a separate cluster identified separately and still a challenge. But if we internationally pool it might be easier. If the drugs are too expensive as they currently are, that might be the place for Bill Gates and other sources to assist in controlled trials with a guarantee that a certain large amount of money will be donated."
2020-08-05 18:23:57,"As a biomedical researcher, I understand the pressure that clinicians feel when treating severely ill patients. But the experience with chloroquine shows the risks of going with experience or instinct when dealing with a novel disease like covid. Controlled studies with double blind methodology are the best method to objectively analyze the many proposed treatments that have been raised by everyone from ICU staff desperate to help their patients to fringe quacks. Medicine has long needed to become more data based, never more so than now."
2020-08-05 18:38:45,"I’m a retired RN and have HFpEF (a type of heart failure), and after agreeing to participate in a clinical trial I now have a very different view of the randomized trial protocols. I was ensured that I’d have better care during the trial than normal care. Sounded good. I did have more appointments with the cardiologists and also wore a cardiac monitor 24/7 for a period of time. Although it was obvious that I was having numerous PVCs (arrhythmias) on the monitor, this information went directly to the research company running the trial and none of this was sent to or reported to my physicians. This was the start of making me nervous about just how good the care could be if my physicians weren’t receiving data needed in order to help me. There were other such issues to, and I finally stopped participating. Ultimately, even though researchers claim clinical trials are the gold standard, I now have serious doubts. Do some people need to die in order to prove or disprove the efficacy of a medication or procedure being trialed? This is going too far, in my opinion."
2020-08-05 18:50:44,"This is absolutely the best reporting on Covid-19 I have ever read.  I empathize with these researchers and clinical physicians who continue their life-and-death struggle with this disease.  I have nothing more to say, except to offer my respect and support for everyone facing these hard choices."
2020-08-05 15:18:43,"Retired doctor here.

If the patient is fixing to die in front of you of a brand new infectious disease, a disease whose proper treatment is unknown, trying things that have at least some chance of working is reasonable. No downside, significant potential upside.  Of course you want to do it in a relatively controlled manner so as to get usable data.  

Then going to RCTs is the way to go, as was done with hydroxychloroquine.

Things have gone pretty well with Covid as far as the advancement of medical science is concerned. (The political and public health responses have been disasters.) We are only 6 months into it and have data on steroids, antivirals, antiinflammatories. Vaccines in the hopper.

There will always be treatment uncertainty in the first couple months of a new and serious outbreak.  Nature of the beast."
2020-08-05 15:43:15,"Humans developing science is very complicated. Add in the stress and urgency of being in the midst of a pandemic, and it's no surprise that there are mistakes, missed opportunities, and continued questions. This article so clearly tells the stories of these complicated and often impossible choices. I hope that readers will understand that at its heart it's not an argument for one treatment or another, but a plea for patience and compassion for those who struggle with the data in the midst of the pressure to make quick, ethical decisions about human lives."
2020-08-05 17:22:17,It is good to have this reflection about what transpired so we could do better next time. It is true we were totally unprepared in March. If you asking me now with so much confusion about the drugs I wish we had entered all patients into a multi platform clinical trails like they way it was done in UK. But as many major academic centers posted their untested protocols on the internet ( with no evidence at all) the rest of us were forced to commit to one or the other untested regimens. At  the end of each week we kept analyzing our data and clearly could see that many protocols were not helpful at all. We modified as much as we could but the high volumes we were dealing with  in the face of many our own colleagues themselves admitted to our units  makes it difficult to have a clear perspective. We are better now. But we always informed patients what we knew and what was off label use. Some declined and we respected their wishes. By the way debates about drugs like hydrochloroquine appears to be clearly on partly lines (left vs right) even among doctors. That is sad!
2020-08-05 19:01:06,"Many RCTs will provide an option to override the study according to the treating clinician’s judgement. 

If the additional treatment is unrelated to the treatment being studied, then it does not sully the group (control or placebo) that the patient is randomized to. In fact, such treatment would assure that the patient is receiving the same care that all others in the study are getting. 

If the treatment is the same as the treatment being studied, then the need for such treatment constitutes a failure of whatever treatment arm the individual patient is on. That provides some information, even if it is not the primary outcome measurement. 

In this case, if the patient was on low dose anticoagulant, and simply got more dose, that is a failure of the low dose. If s/he was getting the high dose, it still constitutes a failure. Such data still provides some information on the relative efficacy of low v high when combined with the entire study population."
2020-08-05 19:16:38,"The UK’s National Health Service- comprehensive healthcare funded wholly by taxation, free at the point of need, has brought you an 11,000 participant randomised controlled trial and shown the world that dexamethasone reduces mortality. All patients receiving untested therapeutics were required to be randomised in a placebo controlled RCT. 

In the US, many thousands of patients have had untested treatments (hydroxychloroquine, convalescent plasma) without enrolment in trials at the behest of treating physicians who will never know if they helped or harmed. You’ve got a patchwork of multiple small, often underpowered competing trials. 

I hear Americans afraid of single payer/ socialised health care. I’m much more afraid of the alternative."
2020-08-05 19:49:13,"People drop out of studies all the time.  They're not ""ruining"" the study.  Whether they drop out because of intolerable side effects, or because their conditioned worsened to point where death was imminent - they're not ""ruining"" the study.  The reasons WHY they dropped out are important.  The reasons WHY actually contribute important information.  

And lets remember that these studies are done to help people.  The patients are not obligated to sacrifice their lives just to make the data cleaner for the researchers.  As a matter of fact, plenty of studies are stopped early by ethical researchers because harm is being done....and sometimes because the benefits are so obvious that the treatment is made available to more patients."
2020-08-05 20:00:51,"To me, it seems self-evident that doctors, like anyone else, do everything they do for themselves. And I think that the interactions and expectations of everyone would be fairer for each of us, if we, all, kept that in mind when making personal, professional, and political decisions.
The false belief that most persons have that they do something for others only helps the believer to justify his actions to himself and others even if the 'intended' recipient of such 'benefactors' is harmed."
2020-08-05 20:04:47,"I am a pulmonary critical care doctor at a tertiary community hospital, and this tension has been present since the beginning.  I feel like this article was extremely well written in capturing the stress and challenges of figuring how to treat COVID-19 patients.

One perspective that deserves sharing and was only tangentially discussed in the article is that critical care doctors must make treatment decisions based on incomplete data every day.  If you withhold antibiotics in the patient with septic shock until the blood cultures are positive 2 days later, you never pick the wrong antibiotics but your patients have already died.  We intentionally sacrifice precision when speed is essential in order to save lives, and redirect our treatment as new information becomes available.

It became very obvious from the early reports of the pandemic that ""usual supportive care"" of critically ill COVID patients was woefully inadequate; 70-100% of patients needing a ventilator to breathe died.  Large scale clinical trials of potential treatments take months to run under perfect circumstances.  The RECOVERY trial which showed dexamethasone as an effective treatment started in April and was published in late July.  This is why so many different off-label treatments were tried; not because doctors were caught up in emotion or fear, but simply because we knew that better information would not be available at the time when it was needed."
2020-08-05 20:37:52,"This should be a no-brainer: the patient’s life must remain the highest priority, and the judgement of the doctors responsible for the patient must override that of the researchers.  Yes, that patient will and should be removed from the study as a result, but it happens.

Just as lives should not be sacrificed to ‘accelerate’ an economic recovery, nor should they for research, even with the goal of saving future lives.

Research is at the service of medicine, not the other way around. (I work in an institution where, like many major hospitals, both co-exist, sometimes with the same physician/researcher).

Thank you for this article!"
2020-08-05 20:49:30,"I also am a pulmonary and critical care physician, as well as researcher. This was a well done article that articulated many of the nuances involved at the intersection between clinical care and research. My sympathies live with the researcher however.  More so than in other disciplines, in critical care there have been dozens of interventions that “should” have worked over the past 30 yrs for sepsis/ARDS, that were not validated in subsequent randomized controlled studies.￼￼  Of course individual Attendings need to use their judgment, but we need to acknowledge that our judgment has frequently led us astray even if well grounded in physiologic principles.￼"
2020-08-05 21:00:16,"As a pediatric specialist, I frequently have to make treatment decisions with little or no data; it is much more difficult for studies to be approved for pediatric patients, and many severe pediatric diseases are much rarer than in the adult world, leading to a paucity of information. No physician should be blamed for doing what appears to be best for the severely ill patient in front of her/him when there is little or no data to provide guidance. In fact, there have been times in my own career when I have been told by hospital administration that ""the patient can't possibly have that disease because he/she doesn't meet our criteria,"" and lo and behold they do, and we can treat it and make a difference. Likewise, early on in the pandemic, the diagnoses of some COVID cases were delayed, as MDs wanted to test patients for COVID, but were told they ""couldn't possibly have it,"" as they did not meet criteria. Criteria and data are excellent tools, but they are not always correct and often change over time, and the experience of the person at the bedside should never be discounted."

Medicine on the individual patient level is all about gut instinct.

Clinical trials in the end ONLY tell you about odds of what works better than something else.  They will never give you a guarantee.

""His casual certainty about the cause and effect of her recovery was surprising. His wife had been ill, taken hydroxychloroquine and recovered.""

- We just told you that HCQ does not work, according to the set of studies we selected to be regarded as valid.
- How then can the person whose words we have been using to inform you it is but mere witchcraft, believe HCQ had anything to do with it?

""Whether the second event caused the third was at best unknown but statistically unlikely, given the now-significant body of research showing that the drug does not help.""

- ""There is plenty of research that purports it does not work"" (at the exclusion of the research that says otherwise)
- ""At best unknown, but statistically unlikely""

""As if even Spyropoulos recognized that his comment was less than rational, he went on to rehearse the argument he made to his colleagues at Long Island Jewish about the importance of relying on research. Anything else, he repeated, was witchcraft.""

We have electricity. Surely such patients are in rooms capable of negative pressure or, at least, of having a large and powerful fan(s) and /or blower to ensure such infectious exhalations goes the other way, and not into a doctor's face. I have not been in a ICU for pandemic patients so I don't know what the ""fashions "" are, but if doctors are so ""bare-naked"" that merely being exposed to the  exhalations of a patient seems deadly dangerous, then someone is not paying attention and it ain't the folks in the beds-many of whom  are  under  anesthesia.
 Go back to rudimentary physics and Brownian motion. There is no reason why an MD, properly protected should fear exhalations from an infected patient unless they are ill dressed. I had hoped-for all our shortcomings in Washington-that we'd not recapitulate the deadly learning curve of the Ebola epidemic-I recall screaming at dumb TV monitors, as I watched native workers-innocently, in shorts, without masks or other protections, helping to carry and bury  highly infectious bodies-as their nurses and aides ""learned by dying"" just how much  worse, far more infectious Ebola was. Are our MD's having to go through this , also, again?
Should we send silver coins?"
2020-08-05 17:20:11,"I'm a practicing Family Medicine physician, and I can say this tension extends to outpatient medicine as well.  In April, my former colleagues (I resigned in June due to their stupidity) immediately prescribed their family and friends hydroxychloroquine despite contradicting research, arguing there was no harm (and yes, saying ""President Trump says it's OK"").  When I refused, it became a point of contention at meetings, with three of my colleagues siding with me and dividing the group.  Eventually, our provider meetings devolved into screaming about how each physician practices medicine, recalling random patients from years ago and their supposed mismanagement.
Without hyperbole, I can say that medicine has devolved into politics.  The liberals in my group didn't prescribe hydroxychloroquine because there wasn't strong research, and the conservatives prescribed it over the phone if you asked.  The final straw was when the top physician said the 114,000 deaths in June was an ""opinion"" and teased me for wearing a mask.  Masks are suggested for patients, but still not mandatory.
Unfortunately, even intelligent physicians aren't immune to hive mentality and tribalism.  Decisions are made based on economics, politics, and geography rather than what's in the best interest of the patient."

Once the patient is ill enough to require mechanical intubation or has symptoms of other end organ damage due to DIC, the virus is of little consequence since the damage is done. From that point on its all supportive therapy and crossing your fingers.

The “how much” question is a red herring.  

Neither the clinician nor the researcher is pre-ordained with the facts and truth.  Each context of practice has strengths and weaknesses in patient care and discovery.  In each area, the priorities do not perfectly align in static analysis.  

Dynamically shifting power, based upon the facts of observations and third party audit, is instrumental in keeping a balanced work ethic delivered to patient care.  The front line must assess and make final decisions, but not without some context provided to the community when there is a discrepancy between the aggregate research and case study. 

Wait.  The medical community suffers the same issue as America with reliance upon old school systems of governance.  

Abandon ship, and swim to the life raft of self governance.  Use the technology in your hands — your phones and devices — to establish your individual footprint through your PDA.  

Like your PDA, a Community Digital Assistant (CDA) will grow organically, if the footprints of individuals are placed wisely in good faith.  With enough aggregate data placed into community holdings, there is a foundation for real analysis.

C19study.com

Note that 50 out of the 66 trials (40 peer reviewed) say it works very well.  Note the deaths per million of the countries that use it versus those that do not use it.

Note also that HCQ is ""optional"" in the MATH+ protocol developed by frontline critical care docs (including Dr. Kory).  MATH+ is being used by Northwell Health, NY's largest hospital group.  

There is plenty of published medical evidence:

flccc.net

HCQ is not the killer drug as reported by the mainstream media to gin up fear.  It has killed twelve: 7 in a South American study that used a toxic dose of 2,400 mg (not the MATH+ effective dose of 200 mg).  A guy in AZ and one in FL died from the aquarium version that's manufactured differently.  Plus two more people in Nigeria.

C19 has killed 707,610 worldwide so far.  

The negative studies on HCQ were primarily due to not also dosing with Zinc - which is the active ingredient - it is the anti-viral.  HCQ is an ionophore that transports zinc through the lipid cell membrane to where it disable the Virus.  Doesn't do much good without Zinc.

Negative studies also used crazy 2,400 mg doses that 65 years on WHO's list of essential medicines say is toxic.  Any minor tachycardia can be managed with magnesium.

Doctors using MATH+ have attained under 5% C19 mortality rates.

The non-scientific hysteria against HCQ has killed many thousands."
2020-08-05 17:41:10,"When the patient has a serious medical condition and the best course of action is unclear, the best treatment the patient can receive is to be enrolled in a clinical trial, if one is available.  As a retired Oncologist, I can state that this was a bedrock principle in our practice.  Experience and “seasoning” are notoriously poor guides for making correct medical decisions.  Any doctor who fails to recognize this is simply engaging in arrogant, egotistical behavior.  Even more true in the Covid pandemic, since the large number of patients would allow for rapid enrollment and completion of critical clinical studies.  A well known and respected Oncologist famously said that a controlled clinical trial was much smarter than a roomful of excellent clinicians.  It is quite disappointing to read that so many dedicated, highly educated physicians still feel they know “what’s best” for a patient in the absence of any meaningful data.  I admire the dedication of these physicians, but find their arrogance to be terribly misguided.  James Simons MD"

The ""medical expertise"" that is used by Fox, OAN and Trump is as far from the main stream of medical science as it gets - touting all-but-fake, unaccredited ""academies"" that attract the Zombies of incompetent practice; those that cannot be accepted by the VAST majority of REAL Doctors as legitimate.

Medicine in this country is some of the best in the world, but as with any society. there are outliers who are simply insane and pitch men like Trump who thrive on the ridiculous - and in this case fatal endorsement of unsupported nonsense. THIS IS WHY WE HAVE ACCREDITATION and Peer Review.

2020-08-05 17:26:35,"So depressing.

The organizing premise is that care doctors and research doctors have a conflict.  They don’t. To quote from the article:

“In contrast to American doctors whose access to the use of the drug, even outside trials, had been eased by a federal agency, British physicians were given the opposite message. On April 1, the highest medical officials in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland each sent a letter to every hospital in their respective countries, urging doctors not to prescribe medications off-label outside trials. Instead they encouraged doctors to enroll their patients in large, multicenter, randomized, controlled trials, like a study run by the University of Oxford called Recovery”

See how easy?

All licensed physicians in the US practice evidence based science based medicine. All.

When politicians making decisions at the top scorn evidence based science based medicine then that stupidity leads to needless anti science conflicts in the field. 

As when hospital administrators forbade the use of respirators outside covid wards. Fired violators. Real smart guys. Real smart.

As when the political hacks at the White House and the CDC have fought against widespread availability of N95 masks.  With a campaign to shame civilians from even having n95 masks. The exotic masks sold at every hardware store for 50 cents.

2020-08-06 00:52:05,"The goal in any episode of individual patient care is to help the patient.  Any usual information that comes out of that episode is secondary.

Each patient is unique, so the physician always has to utilize general guidelines with caution and be prepared to deviate when in his/her judgement, it seems necessary.

By contrast, in a clinical trial, the primary goal is NOT to help the patient, but to learn something that might help other patients.

Of course, clinical trials are designed to carefully monitor subjects in order not to cause significant harm.

My mantra is that the primary expertise of a physician is to be relatively effective while operating with a great deal of ignorance.

Also, to be humble.

In my first practice location, one of the established physicians told me that they got the credit if the patient survived and the family accepted it was God’s will if the patient died. 

I saw that as backward; if the patient had a good outcome, I give the credit to God and if a bad one, I accept that I needed to try to do better.

2020-08-06 01:10:34,"What is fascinating about this article is the perception of randomized drug trials and 'best practices' in drug areas but not in other behavioral practices. In other words the debate rages on whether certain drugs should be used or not and that some drugs prescribed off label can be dangerous and not helpful. Fair enough. But there is no debate here about the use of randomized  trials for ventilating patients. Virtually every patient throughout the world in the first few months was intubated when oxygen levels fell precipitously. We now know that many patients died and their lungs permanently scarred by unnecessary use of ventilators. Physicians could have saved perhaps thousands of more lives if they had not been so quick to assume that ventilation was useful, given that Covid-19 was a novel virus."

Researchers would act quite differently if someone put a gun to their mother's head and said ""I know you don't have the data but if you choose wrong she dies.""  That is the dilemma clinicians face.  Often, if we guess wrong, someone dies. So, clinicians have to make a reasoned guess based on physiology and experience. Unfortunately, we lack a system to harness those thousand of guesses that are made every day.  

We also need a system that enables such ""N of 1"" trials to be done almost instantly without days of delay or pages of paperwork.

The researchers should have been learning from the clinicians, so their clinical trials could be better designed.  This is a multisystem disease, with stages, patients with various underlying conditions, and patients with varying symptoms and degrees of illness.  There were always too many variables to make straightforward trials.  And that situation will dog all their efforts in future too.  So, have some compassion and understanding for the doctors on the front lines because your trials will be fraught with difficulties too.  And patients faced with this situation might prefer someone who is trying their best to someone who wants to do nothing for months while waiting for trial results.  I am guessing a lot more patients would have died in the latter case."

Data is needed ... demanded of trials.   

And if the drug or treatment itself is demanded, allow access for a small price:

For a prescription or treatment order to be effective:
1. Provde a Medical record number or equivalent 
2.  Draw some relevant, cheap lab work (results cc to the trial coordinator) -- not unusual for some prescriptions.

Data would be confirmed on renewals; some data from the provider when prescription doesn't renew (death, discharge, side effects, didn't work).

For something like hydroxychloroquine, this could give a lot of data from people who are lightly symptomatic.  The published studies have covered hospital patients, not people out and about."

2020-08-06 00:33:15,"As a pulmonary and critical clinician, who treated hundreds of patients during our surge of COVID patients, I do not think there is a large rift between clinicians and researchers.  The majority of high quality clinicians rely on well done research to guide our practice.  The presence of a pandemic does not justify the attitude displayed by Dr. Kory and others of ""I know in my heart this is good and I am a warrior of medicine.""  Real harm comes of this attitude.  
In terms of the specifics of Dr. Kory's MATH+ protocol, it is not a stretch to use steroids in ARDS - many before him have done so.  However, his protocol claims that it should be used early which is NOT the largest mortality benefit found in the RECOVERY trial (a well done randomized controlled trial using Dexamethasone).  In terms of the remainder of the MATH+ protocol, few if any credible clinicians or researchers believe in his Vitamin C and thiamine hypothesis.  At best they are likely worthless, at worst Vitamin C can cause kidney dysfunction in patients who with COVID are already predisposed to kidney failure requiring dialysis.

People want miracles, and the push against intellectualism in this country is widespread. People are desperate, impatient, and narcissistic. We have a deadly, novel virus, so some doctors are throwing everything but the kitchen sink at it. It's understandable, but it's also problematic. Without the controls of properly conducted trials, when someone survives, or dies, we don't really know why. It may not have been the Hydroxychloroquine that saved someone. Going by what trials there have been, it probably wasn't. But we have an anti-science President trying to sell snake oil to the country for political reasons and he has been pretty ""successful"" so far.

Intensivists battling COVID are to be respected, yet opinions such as those here need not be. Grief and desperation are understandable, but irresponsible unproven treatment is not. Those docs should know that. And while 'witchcraft' might be a poor choice of words, 19th century medicine would not be.

You run the risk of withholding a treatment of unknown effect but gain the knowledge of how to treat many future patients. Keep in mind only 2% of the US population has been affected; it is therefore very important to realize how many more lives you will save by exercising cool scientific judgment.

What is less decided is whether this approach is consistent with the American ethic. This tension was well described in the 1926 Pulitzer Prize winning novel Arrowsmith by American author Sinclair Lewis. A young physician finding his way as a scientist, country doctor, public health doctor and then finally global health doctor is confronted with a choice of either distributing a vaccine freely to people in need or continuing with a trial to see if it works. In the heat of the moment, he does the former; people are grateful, but there was never a right answer and he’s still left wondering if he did the right thing.

Health care here is a private good; do we have a duty to others? So much of how the system is organized suggests we don’t, or only if we build it on the backs of Black populations (eg Henrietta Lacks, Tuskegee trials). But the pandemic exploits that, and now we find we depend on research from other countries’ (eg the UK’s) research made possible by a different cultural and more collective view of health."

Our approach to bypass surgery was a slow motion approach to the issue of dealing with the unknown.  We didn't do controlled studies because many ""knew"" what should be done, and we ended up doing a lot of harm.  Same with carotid endarterectomy.

The one time we got it right as a profession was the EC-IC bypass for inoperable carotid artery disease.  I still remember being hearing the results:  those who got the surgery improved. Then the kicker: so did the placebo group, the same amount. The study showed that the surgery had no effect, and the surgery
disappeared from use.  We wanted it to work, it should have, and we were wrong.

What needed to be done was somebody's keeping track of what was being done and at least getting an observational study. As a retired neurologist, I can understand the desire to help and the frustration at not being able to. I seldom cured anybody. But I can neither understand nor forgive those who operate on the basis of ""my gut"" who aren't collecting data at the same time.  Run your own observational study and develop hypotheses.  But don't throw everything at people without knowing exactly what is being used. 

That means listening to the quiet people in the room, not the loud mouth opinion leaders, and that has been a problem in medicine and other places for a long, long time."
2020-08-07 14:40:24,"As a health system Chief Medical Officer helping to lead our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I congratulate you on this well-researched, well-balanced article.  You have perfectly described the challenge of practicing evidence-based care in a novel disease for which no evidence-based studies existed at its onset, and for which many of the initial studies published were uncontrolled case series.  Even now, we are in need of more well-designed trials of additional therapies.  We also face the challenge created by studies that, showing some benefit on interim data analysis, are halted to allow widespread use of medication. As a result of the early trial cessation, the full benefits and harms of the medication remain unknown."
2020-08-08 16:44:39,"Excellent article. Coming from a family where three immediate members were physicians, I can tell you that many a dinner was spent listening to their debates about medical issues. As for trials, both my elderly sister and I would never take part in clinical trials for any of the vaccines because of the 50/50 chance that we would be given the placebo and thereby have no idea whether or not we would be as vulnerable as ever to the disease - perhaps more so because we could falsely feel protected. It is one thing to take part in trials when you have reached the point of last resort, as is often true when being treated for cancer. But when one is not already sick, taking part in this trial puts one further into the possibility of getting the disease. To those selfless people who are willing, you have my greatest admiration and thanks."
2020-08-08 16:57:21,"Successful enrolment of large numbers of patients in a British study -- whilst a USA study could collect relatively few -- may have something to do with salaried rather than fee-based medicine.  

I went from the USA to London to work in a narrow branch of paediatrics because the National Health Service had decreed that all children with disease of a particular organ system should be evaluated at 1 of 3 hospitals nationwide.  In the USA, where each child yields treatment fees, no one would refer a family to another institution, because money would be lost.  In London during my first year of work I saw 30-odd patients with disorder X, the most common form of disease in the organ system of interest to me.  In the major USA referral centre where I had trained ?  One year might bring 5 such patients.  My career flourished, and I was able to report observations that in the USA I should never have made.

So too, perhaps, with COVID-19.  Keep your patients, guard them safe, don't turn their care over to a protocol -- that might reduce your ability to bill under fee-for-service arrangements.  That's the USA.  Small wonder that the Oxford group more quickly assembled more patients, and more data, than could USA colleagues.

Salaried, and uniformly salaried, posts for doctors rather than today's USA ""you eat what you kill"" approach :  Shared patients, shared care, rather than financial jealousy.  Something to consider in re-grouping to meet the next new disease."
2020-08-09 01:32:28,"Clinical equipoise seems to be lacking in research in this country, especially since the majority of drug trials are sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. There's no question that the drug manufacturers are hoping for a result that will yield a blockbuster.

How is their research more valid, important, acceptable, worthy - choose your adjective - than a doctor's decision to use a medication based upon his or her knowledge and clinical practice results? Physicians frequently use drugs for ""off label"" purposes based on their informed belief that the drugs may help. That's not ""witchcraft"", it's clinical judgment.

Research is important, but if a treating physician makes a determination that a study patient requires a particular treatment which might disqualify the patient from the study, so be it. Or is research more important than an individual's life?"

2020-08-09 17:03:56,"I'm sure readers are aware of the news conference held by dozens of front line doctors explaining the success they have had using various treatments. These include hydroxychloraquin, zinc, athromyasine and several steroids designed for treatment of asthma.

Rather than debate who is right, those doctors or Susan Dominus abut successful treatments, the appropriate step is to investigate these ""operational studies"" and see if they bear out.

I believe the protocol is to first review the patients medical files and verify that they in fact had Covid-19 and the treatments, dosages and results. Then some group of former patients should be interviewed and additional tests done.

One thing is clear, according to their doctors they all survived. One doctor claimed to have treated 300 patients, another had 90, all survived. Doctors in Costa Rico have been using this formula for months but caution that it should be used at the earlier signs of Covid symptoms.

Unfortunately, the general media didn't cover this press conference and social media has deleted their comments.

But medical science has numerous examples of accidental discoveries and unfortunately most of them were initially rejected. X-ray technology and antibiotic theory are two among many.

Let's advocate for openness and transparency in all the scientific debates, especially since we rely on them for policy decisions.

Let's hear from doctors who claim success. Censorship either directly or by omissions serves no one."

The NY metro region is notorious for high utilization, supply-driven demand, a physician population heavily overweighted toward specialists, mediocre to poor patient outcomes for respiratory conditions, high vent/tracheostomy utilization and overtreatment of severely ill and end of life patients.  Covid-19 could not have found a more ripe environment for all kinds of off-label medications to have been thrown at patients, especially given the apocalyptic conditions."
2020-08-09 18:30:12,"As a research scientist, I suggest my colleagues have lost sight of a fundamental: Medicine is not a science, anymore than engineering is physics or chemistry. 

It is an applied science. Medicine rests on scientific principles and current research that it applies to real life problems. Those problems are inevitably messier and more ambiguous than what the textbooks teach. 

So when clinicians are fighting for human lives on the ground, it’s not the time for rigorous case-control experiment. We seek doctors, after all, for their clinical judgement. Otherwise, let’s just go with computer driven diagnoses and treatments."

There was nothing miraculous about it. New York went into lockdown, residents took guidelines seriously, and - based on that behavior - and as predicted, the surge receded. Donald Trump said, ""one day, it's like a miracle, it will disappear"". That wasn't true when he said it, it isn't true now, and Ms. Dominus and her editors should know better than to invoke miracles while 1000 people a day in the US are dying of Covid-19, and science tells us which types of behavior can and will bring that number down."

In a statement released Monday CytoDyn gave an update on over 30 patients COVID-19 patients recently treated with leronlimab in more than 4 hospitals and clinics across the U.S.  Patients have received leronlimab as part of Emergency Investigational New Drug (EINDs) treatments authorized by the FDA and two CytoDyn clinical trials.

“More than 25 patients have been administered leronlimab under EINDs authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA),” the biotech explained. “Rate of response in mild-to-moderate patients under EIND has been very promising with the first five patients treated being removed from oxygen.”"
2020-08-09 00:23:03,"There is certainly an honorable place for doctors who try whatever seems most promising for their patients. Of course, there is no such place for those who choose to use meds because Donald Trump praises them. However, when a doctor decides to bust a randomized double blind clinical trial that a patient has chosen to enroll in, that doctor is beyond the pale. 
Let me put it in terms more powerful than a single controlled test or a single life. Trump clearly is promoting drugs not proven to reduce mortality at all. Vast quantities, but not nearly enough for everyone. And most patients will survive with or without the drugs. You know there will be numerous claims of cures. Until we have proof the only honorable thing to do would be to put m most of those meds into controlled trials. After all we won't have enough for everyone anyway."
2020-08-09 01:27:43,"If you would like to understand more about why doctors fall in love with dubious therapies then “Bad Pharma” is a great book. The rationale for new treatments that “we have to try something” is never really upheld. Intensive care is now in the phase of incremental improvements in therapy and only true, cold hearted, scientific research can deliver. However in a trial there is always the ability to break the code in an emergency, it is part of the design, an essential part of the ethics. In the crisis mentioned there did not appear to be a clear set of guidelines for that contingency. That being said the idea of substituting one unproven trial therapy for another is equally foolish and unethical. I suspect your doctors need a little reeducation."

I am grateful I do not have to make those decisions, and grateful to those who are trying their damnedest to save as many as they can.  

We will be studying this dilemma for decades, along with learning more about this and other viruses.  Our grandchildren will no doubt look at the way we responded much as we view the use of “bleeding” a few centuries ago."

It is done in France behind close doors because of an official prohibition regarding non placebo tested therapeutics.

2020-08-10 13:16:08,"“Might as well” medicine is generally not a good idea. That said, when your patient appears to be minutes to hours away from dying, you do have some increased liberty. 
The key to good outcomes in any ICU in any time is consistency and measurement, with continuous cautious changes.  As uncomfortable as the participants in the meeting described were, it was exactly where they needed to be. In fact they should have met in mid march, not mid may. A team should have been convened to come up with system based guidelines that run by the whole group. In the current connected environment, this can be done in a couple days. 
When clinical equipoise exists, the best route ( assuming inavailability of clinical trial) is to choose a consistent road. That is to say, if there are two equally good options, a unit will function better if it simply picks one.  Doctors, Nurses, Respiratory Therapists and Pharmacists will all get get very good and fast at that path, thus giving it the best chance to succeed. 

But, it might not. The best teams continuously criticize themselves, and try to compare their outcomes to like units.  

Solid clinical principles, reinforced by credible, engaged leaders. These things work, even(and maybe especially) in COVID times."
2020-08-10 13:27:43,"An interview with some Arizona nurses who were in New York revealed that some of them experienced the death of all of their patients. All. This was devastating. 

Just imagine doctors desperate for scientific knowledge, while the vast majority of their critical care patients have died. People die in hospitals all the time, but normally there are success stories. At one point in New York, there were very few. 

So my advice to the doctors is, go easy on yourself. Sure, some of the decisions were questionable, but you at least were trying a lot harder than Trump ever did. Now, let's find out what treatments really work and continue."
2020-08-10 13:35:30,"Modern medicine is based on science, not ""gut feelings"", which indeed are akin to witchcraft. 

Unfortunately, the human body is so complex that the only way to truly know if an intervention works is through controlled, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover studies that reach a defined ""P"" value with and with end points that pass the ""So what?"" test.

Not many of those around, believe me.

Instead of dealing with the angst some physicians feel when they attempt to ""cut corners"" when dealing with a largely unstudied and deadly virus, the details of the various studies referred to should have been explained and why some were better than others. 

Steroids were first dismissed, but now are a standard of care. Hydroxychloroquine was embraced, then derided as dangerous quackery, and now seen as useful early on in the viral process. As for Remdesivir, on the basis of a weak study it is now part of the regimen recommended- an orphan drug finding somewhat of a purpose after failures in two other diseases.

There are studies and then there are studies.

One way we've gone off the rails that guide a civilized society is because of the sidelining of science by the Trump administration: ignoring, denying, and actually trashing it. Kelly Anne Conway was asked if the president listens to his medical experts. She said ""he does... and they should listen to him."" Trade guy Navarro waffles on during TV interviews and dismisses at least five rigorous studies in favor of crude anecdotes. The general public is confused, and is encouraged to make key decisions based on their support for Trump.  This seems to affect even medical practitioners who've long ago given up reading scientific journals.

The critical endpoint determinations to power for a meaningful outcome don't require that there is only massive morbidity and mortality after they are reached, in any of the studies I've done as a researcher in multiple sclerosis, or in my work approving studies on an academic IRB.  These outcomes  can be laboratory or radiologic markers of various disease effects, or clinical measures of disease severity.  If patients reach an endpoint, then they are considered to have done their duty, and can be unblinded if required, or at least treated outside the protocol, and still be part of the futility analysis.

2020-08-10 12:52:05,"I want to throw my two cents in on this covid virus.  Since I take issue with DeSantis and Trump giving unqualified health advice, I guess it is my turn.

Many viruses inhabit its host, go dormant, only to raise its ugly head later on.  Who knows what the trigger is, but when the virus strikes it comes with a vengenance.  Malaria is a good example.  Once you have it, there is no cure and it attacks with little rhyme or reason.
My concern is that the younger generation is acquiring it, under the political general belief they have some super immunity (children under 10 are immune, or the younger people are asymptomatic, minor problems etc.,)  

What if the virus just goes dormant, and as they age (who knows what the trigger will be), the virus attacks later?"
2020-08-10 15:07:46,"Thx for the article and the insightful public comments, especially from those in the field.
I appreciate doctors who seem willing to share with me, “I’m not sure” or “We don’t really know,” before offering possible paths, recommendations and some rationale. Not just luckily, I suspect, most doctors I’ve encountered show this quality."
2020-08-10 11:34:54,"I'm a physician. Doctors who support hydroxychloroquine have joined a religion with miracles and have substituted faith for reason.

Zinc is a miracle. No disease, other than zinc deficiency, is treated with oral zinc. There is no human data to support its use. Even the observational studies which found HCQ effective didn't use zinc and one of the RCTs that did found it ineffective. The idea they've found the first disease in human history to be treated by a supplement which winds up in your poo is miracle thinking.

Saying HCQ only works when given to minimally symptomatic patients is not just miracle thinking its also a non-falsifiable hypothesis (NFH). A drug can be more effective in less symptomatic patients but it will still show a clinically measurable benefit in RCTs. HCQ shows no benefit in 5 consecutive RCTs.

It is prohibitively expensive to do RCTs in asymptomatic patients because the number of patients required to show a clinical difference is so large. By limiting HCQ to this patient group that ability to demonstrate effectiveness is lost.

Prayer too is a cheap and harmless NFH, which is the exact argument made for HCQ. No reason can convince the faithful they're wrong, just like no RCT will dissuade the believers from using HCQ. When experts (Yale) write articles ignoring RCTs and only mentioning observational or in vitro data that's faith.

Problem is we've wasted millions testing HCQ and it has side effects. Ignore them, nothing will change their minds."

While the stresses of COVID have undoubtedly placed strains, I do wonder if Dr Narasimhan was a man, whether the term ""witchcraft"" would have been used by Dr Spyropoulos, and whether assumptions that emotions were driving the request would have been invoked by Dr Tracey, especially as the emotive reactions seem to be from Feinstein as represented in the article.  There are, or should be, processes for unblinding in trials; if they did not have a Data and Safety Management Board engaged for the trial, one should have been assembled.  Dr N had valid rationale to request consideration for unblinding after a death, but may have lacked the experience in trials to have the language to request early trial review for safety; the Feinstein folks have no such excuse."
2020-08-10 21:27:56,"The idea that treatment not based upon traditional research is witchcraft makes some initial sense but is also misleading. The system of step by step peer-reviewed research is correct, but as Lee told Stuart at Gettysburg “there is no time”. With more than 1,000 people dying each day, there is no time and research needs to be expanded from its tight parameters. The answer is data analysis. If, for example,  two hospitals of say 1,000 COVID 19 patients each, are designated as a facility which allows non approved drugs, and the other allows the use of non approved drugs, the statistics of each hospital should be compared and analyzed. On a broad scale, larger sample sizes could be reached country by country. The larger the data basis, the more accurate the analysis. That’s science, not witchcraft."

And it serves as a reminder that most every doctor you meet is less a scientist than a great mechanic for your body, and as susceptible to all the forms of bias as we patients are.

2020-08-11 00:49:35,"Every person is unique. Every person's clinical problem is unique. Every clinician's thought process is unique. 
There may be numerous paths to reach the same goal.
In an emergency, like this pandemic, where very little is known about the virus itself which can mutate, there is hardly any time to await conclusion of a trial while the decision at patient's bedside has to be instantaneous.
Trial results are statistical, probabilistic and applicable only on macro level.
In an individual case the action that may give the best results may be different from what is predicted by the trial results.
Taking an analogy from physics, Newtonian Mechanics, Relativistic Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics differ greatly outwardly. But they hold good in different situations where one of them is applicable.
The treating clinician should have freedom in making on the spot choice when lightening speed of action is crucial to saving a life.
Remember how Horatio Nelson won his battles, often with his unconventional tactics!"
2020-08-11 05:16:16,"A fascinating article, showing our struggles and failings as humans coming to grips with a horrible situation. 

I would like to note that, working as a physician, there are times when I can identify a clearly defined condition, follow a well defined treatment protocol based on sound research. But human illness is not always that predictable. Often we are forced to problem solve with limited information. We cannot exactly determine what the disease is, or as a discipline we don’t have enough knowledge to have a proven armamentarium. We are forced to make the best decisions we can on the available information. 

The point of labeling this as the “novel” coronavirus is recognizing just that, and recognizing the danger inherent in treating a pandemic caused by an agent we literally knew nothing about initially, and did not know how to treat other than “standard care.” To begin treating this, we were making educated guesses, which is what always happens with a new disease, and trying to come up with solutions. 

But at the point we had trials available for putatively effective treatments, it was time to put that aside. The fundamental rule of medicine is “first, do no harm.” Every untried treatment has the potential to kill, rather than to heal. People who toss off the sentiment “let’s try it, it can’t do any harm” miss this fundamental fact. 

How we know what we know is always the essential question in science. How we know what works as therapy is clinical trials."
2020-08-11 01:45:45,"In the barbershop over the weekend I listened to 2 bright people, nonmedical, talk about how bad ventilators are for Covid patients, as in most of them died. Of course they did- they were intubated because they were critically ill. And that ventilators are harmful to the lungs. Of course they are- I am not going to want to intubate myself today for the heck of it. We did learn that unlike many other conditions, people with covid were tolerating hypoxia better than expected and maybe those patients could avoid intubation, but when someone is drowning, they have no choice- die for sure then and there, or get intubated/ventilated and see what happens.

The problem is with the internet, everyone is an expert yet nobody has perspective. Add to that the moronic antimaskers and antivaxers, and perfectly well-meaning people start to out think physicians. Like just give me some hydrocholoroquine and that will do the trick. If it were only that easy.

RCTs are crucial in solving problems. But there does come a point in every one where pursuing a dead end is wrong. If an individual is clearly doing worse, document it and try a hail mary with something else.... the patient may live to tell. 

But even then, it is not that simple."
2020-08-11 07:37:17,"I think doctors and scientists sometimes forget that we are people. Our bodies while the same are also very different from one another. What may work for one patient, might not work on the next one. If everyone’s bodies reacted to medications exactly the same, we wouldn’t have several different types of medications to solve one problem. If I am so sick that I am in the hospital, not knowing if I am going to die or not, I want the doctor that is going to pull on his experience and treat me with whatever he thinks could help. Not a doctor telling me “well there are no studies to prove it will work” - my thinking is, there’s also not any studies that prove it won’t."
2020-08-11 11:26:16,"As an infectious disease (ID) physician, epidemiologist, and ex-COVID patient myself, this article resonated with me and recapitulated many issues that my hospital colleagues and I have struggled with throughout the COVID crisis.  A couple take-home lessons from this experience: First, supportive care is not nothing; for many conditions it is state of the art, lifesaving care (think of dialysis).  The specialty of ID is unique in that most of its diseases are named by their actual cause, and we have specific treatments for most of them.  This lulls clinicians into thinking that we should have a “magic bullet” for every new ID, yet this is not true for emerging RNA viruses like Ebola, Zika, MERS, SARS, etc.  When I worked in an Ebola care unit in Sierra Leone in 2015, it was distressing to watch half our patients die, but that rate was far superior to the 95% mortality of Ebola patients in the community.  Second: Do No Harm. I’ve tussled with clinicians wanting to use hydroxychloroquine, HIV antivirals, ivermectin (a deworming drug), and other medicines with no rational basis for activity against the coronavirus, but this “therapeutic imperative” must be countered by the fact that drugs can have adverse effects that are likely magnified in sick patients with other underlying conditions.  It was for this reason that I categorically refused to take hydrochloroquine + azithromycin, when offered this option by my own physicians, when I came down with COVID myself in March 2020."
2020-08-11 10:52:54,Something's missing from this otherwise detailed article: patient's or/and family's informed consent to be in the trial (and possibly receive placebo). This is a gold standard in any trial. Did the researchers in the famous hospitals listed in this article forgot about it?
2020-08-10 23:01:07,"""The official term for that stance sounds both scientific and strangely poetic: “clinical equipoise.” It’s a point at which a doctor’s curiosity is greater than her conviction that any one result is the most likely one. Clinical equipoise is an elegant characterization of a humble admission: I have no idea which of these two choices is better."" Something in that doesn't make sense. Is clinical equipoise when you have no idea which choice is better? Or is it when your curiousity to know which is better is greater than any conviction you might have that one is better? These are obviously different."

There are several randomised clinical trials that have reported on the efficacy of cortico steroids in saving the lives of Covid-19 patients in Italy and Spain. 
The MATH+ protocol used by  of Dr.Kory is controversial as the medical establishment is addicted to the big pharma approach to medicine. Let's face it the there are no billions to be made from using steroids, heparin and vitamin C to save lives."
2020-08-22 19:53:26,"As an MD who normally is not in the ICU but provided ancillary support during the peak of the COVID crisis in NY/NJ, this article crystallized some of the conflict between learning what may help in the future versus using what may help now. The volume of patients who arrived seemingly “all at once” was truly overwhelming in March, which is one reason it was difficult to get patients entered in trials.

I was disappointed that there was not much discussion of some of the societal issues that also affect the ability to enroll patients in trials. The most-affected populations by COVID (or at least more at risk of severe disease) are POC, especially Hispanic and African American. Many of the families of the patients we cared for spoke only Spanish. This adds yet more complexity in trying to obtain consent. Meanwhile, Afr American families at times have an understandable mistrust of the medical system and particularly medical trials. Just read about Tuskegee and Henrietta Lacks to understand why."

Then, maintain impeccable hygiene after entering/exiting your building, touching any of its surfaces, etc.   Allow time to wait fro a less crowded elevator, or if possible, take the stairs (don't touch those railings!).

Until the public hospital system is dismantled and poor patients are as welcome at Cornell as the wealthy, these outcomes cannot and will not improve. 

This intense, state- and society- supported segregation is why I will not practice in New York State. I may live a in a red state, and it has its issues, but at least we are all born and die in the same hospital system with the same standards. 

Another example of how New York City pays only lip service to progressivism while enforcing de facto segregation."

What needs to be addressed is racism from medical professionals.  Any viable solution would involve tracking  doctors and nurses  determining if their black patients have worse outcomes than their white patients when controlling for all other relevant factors. There must be direct accountability for medical racism, not just broad statements about how it's bad."

2020-08-06 18:54:57,"It's not the main point of the article, but this passage captures the difference between OB-GYNs and midwives that my wife and I experienced. The midwife was vastly superior. 

""after scanning her medical records, a midwife told Ms. Isaac her platelet levels were dangerously low, putting her at high risk because her blood wasn’t able to form clots easily. “This was news to us,” Mr. McIntyre said. “At least five doctors signed off on Amber’s paperwork while her platelet levels were dropping, and nobody told us. They didn’t see us in March at all.”"
2020-08-06 19:12:36,Could/did the midwives interviewed in this article recommend organizations that provide financial resources and link up BIPOC pregnant women with advocates or doulas or midwives? OR have they themselves set up ways for the community to support their work?
2020-08-06 19:33:18,"I am truly sorry for these womens' losses - no mother should have to go through an experience like that. I am a pregnant (caucasian) woman in NYC right now though, and my pregnancy so far has not been a cakewalk either. 

While I have private health insurance and access to ""good"" doctors, I have a few issues that an ultrasound tech flagged at my last visit earlier this week, and have been told that I won't be able to ""see"" my doctor to discuss via telemedicine for two weeks. My anxiety is through the roof in the interim. 

I empathize with all women who are going through difficult pregnancies, but to highlight this as an issue unique to Black and POC women does a real disservice to everyone else in the same boat. While the statistics between treatment and outcomes of racial groups are appalling and deserve to be investigated and remedied, stories like this completely minimize and discount the experiences of people like me who are in the exact same position, but don't have the right skin color to make the news."

Is there a link between success in school and success with pregnancy?  Is there a link between age and success with pregnancy?  From a national health care perspective, $1 Million babies harm the US economy, taxpayers and probably even those on Medicaid.  Maybe only hospitals and doctors profit off of problem pregnancies.  We have too many disincentives for not smoking, drinking and giving birth to drug addicted children.  Is there a racial component?  If a mother breathes polluted truck fumes, industrial plant fumes, and bad household air all her life and has high levels of lead from public and private lead pipes, lead paint, etc., does that matter?

There are many causes, some because of inadequate contraception, some because of difficult childhoods, some from heredity, some from state and federal governments, some from hospitals, many because of irresponsible, sexually active and consenting adults, some because few Black women take and pass medical school entrance exams, and some are probably collectively because of readers of the NYT like me do not intervene or know how to intervene."

Part of it is how each of us speak- he uses less feeling language and speaks more authoritatively. I think this gives the impression I am less sure about my symptoms, even though that isn't the case. Part of it is also of course the physician listener. My strategy has been to specifically target female health care providers, who communicate in ways more similar to me.

So what was the difference, my insurance and income bracket.

There are a myriad of reasons why a black mother might have a different outcome than a white mother, other than racism.  Perhaps black and brown women have greater instances of health problems to begin with, such as obesity or pre-existing conditions.  It would be nice to actually study the issue, and not just fall back on the unproved claim that everything is the result of alleged systemic racism.   Despite the hysteria over George Floyd's death at the hands of police, for example, we know that there is no statistical basis to say that police are shooting more black people than whites.  It's probably the same with these mothers.   Why not listen to the actual evidence and not make incredible claims?"

The one issue I have involves the twin pregnancy at 25-weeks. There is really no way to ""prevent"" the death in utero of one fetus in a twin pregnancy. The only intervention would be delivery, which would result in severe prematurity of both twins, including the one who was doing fine. In most cases, we would not recommend this at 25-weeks. 

If a healthcare provider did tell the patient that ""...the death probably could have been prevented"" if the patient had been seen sooner, this doesn't seem appropriate."

I tell my students that it is not only a physician's duty to ""inform"" their patients, but also to ""soothe""them.  I believe that when physicians are overburdened, their capacity to soothe is debased.  This affects all patients, but especially those patients with the fewest resources and the greatest distance from the physician's cultural experience.  

I do not believe that obstetricians, as a group, are racist, and I believe that blaming racism only serves to increase black and Latina distrust of the medical system.  But, I also believe that black and latina mothers are the first in line to be susceptible to the empathy gap.

2020-08-06 20:49:14,"The only solution that I can see is that the standard of care for all pregnant women needs to be the same. Every pregnant mother should receive the same number of visits, the same careful review of health records; high-risk pregnancies should be identified and treated appropriately. Being pregnant with twins is always high-risk, needs careful monitoring, and twins are often delivered early. The question is how does the medical system reach this level of equity. Is it lack of funds, inadequate training, racism, classism—whatever it is needs to be addressed immediately. Many lives hang in the balance.

My wishes were ignored at every turn, my questions dismissed. I am still recovering from an incredibly traumatic c section. My repeated calls to my OB about constant pain around my incision and issues with the wound that persisted for months after the procedure have been brushed aside. 

If this was my experience, I cannot imagine the unending struggles and sorrow of BIPOC women giving birth in this city. How we have failed these women and their families should be a source of immense shame. 

I have great respect for the work doctors, nurses, and everyone in a hospital does — it is a grueling place to spend your days. But there must be a further reckoning in this country. How can we protect these women and their children?

I spent hours each day for two weeks sitting in a chair holding or feeding one or both of my late preterm twins. Ankles still visibly swollen from preeclampsia, I listened as a white mother across the ward was offered a bed to lie down in to rest with her baby. There were other indignities, such as the disinterested one-time visit from the lactation specialist, and an occupational therapist who implied—without justification—that my precious newborn son was likely to have developmental problems (a prognosis swiftly contradicted by the pediatrician in charge of the ward, and by every other doctor he has since seen—both my children are now thriving). I couldn’t get my babies and myself out of there fast enough. I learned to successfully breastfeed in the comfort of my home with a kindly visiting nurse who helped us to get started. While there were a few kindly nurses among the hospital staff, my experience there was a swift and unpleasant introduction to the realities of being a Black mother (and child) in this society. Reading these stories, I’m just grateful we all survived."

Combine the term woman and minority, and you can be assured that the battle to be heard just became much more difficult. Let’s not get bogged down in the data and how to interpret it - instead we should simply care about our fellow human beings and do something to change it!

2020-08-06 21:45:19,"I think one dangerous aspect of all of the ""institutional racism is the boogeyman behind all societal ills for certain groups"" line of thought is that it might prevent people from taking actions that will prevent whatever problem is being attributed to institutional racism. For example, say there's a stat that says Purple people are 15 times as likely as the Turquoise to die from pianos falling on one's head. If you believe that the issue is caused by institutional racism against Purple people then you might reasonably, as a Purple person, not take any actions to avoid the tragedy of having a piano fall on your head, even though you could have done so say by avoiding walking on sidewalks next to skyscrapers.   Perhaps avoiding sidewalks would get you 80% of the way there and eliminate most of the gap, notwithstanding that some institutional racism remains.  At least as a Purple person, that's what I'd focus on -- what I can control and what I can change."

You should feel welcomed and listened to and your pain attended to. Pain can be indicative of a problem if it persists or gets worse. Every pregnancy is different and pains and discomforts maybe a bit different.

 I learned as a  young,caucasian caring nurse from my black collegues what a yelling white attending physician at a black women meant.  It had  strong racial overtones and the women was devastated and cried  when a black nurse consoled her and talked with her. I learned a valuable lesson.  I really did not know until then. It was 30 years ago when this happened. Even 20 years ago I heard comments from black family members "" You are not racist Terri "" I was very surprised. This is a sad commentary on our medical system.  We need to let our patients know via communication and  empathy  towards our minority clients that they are being listened to and attended to. Having heard    of how people  are treated if your are black or brown can  make a difference.. I will be attentive to their plight."

I am one of those women that is told repeatedly by friends, colleagues, and random strangers that I would make a fantastic mother and accordingly must have children.

If I cant get an appointment at all, that is a different story and may suggest an insurance question: corporate versus government insurance and which does a doctor take.

I didn’t speak the language, and covid was in full swing, but I knew that it was my best shot at a safe delivery.

I received excellent care, from professionals who respected me every step of the way. Despite covid, I spent three days recuperating in the hospital. After discharge, a midwife came to visit every few days for 6 weeks to make sure that both mom and baby were doing well. 

Reading articles like this one makes me angry because there is no reason for black women to be dying like this."
2020-08-06 22:00:00,I feel like I have the opposite problem. The doctor wants to see me all the time ... I have a low risk pregnancy and don’t feel the need for extra appointments (or what feels like extra.) They also respond to my concerns within an hour or so on the phone and on two occasions when I was worried about something being wrong they scheduled emergency appointments for me within a couple of hours to relieve my concerns. I am so thankful for this extra care and attention I did not even think about what the flip side would be. I thought my doctor was over the top... but now I realize I should be grateful for all the attention.

I felt I shed my white skin that night.  A doctor later told me they would have treated me differently had they known that my husband and I were both professors.  I can only imagine how much worse it is for Black working class women in the middle of a pandemic.  Twenty years later I have a healthy child but nearly daily pain still."
2020-08-06 22:41:20,"Our health care system is an impersonal, assembly line process where doctors are expected to spend 15 minutes or less per patient. 

Getting good care requires fighting: doing research online before an appointment, asking pointed questions during the appointment, requesting and fighting for a second opinion, requesting and fighting for an earlier visit, and so on. It’s extremely difficult.

You have to walk a very narrow line—if you don’t speak up, you’ll be ignored; if you advocate too forcefully, you’ll be labeled as a troublemaker or as a hypochondriac.

I’m very aware that my privilege (white, having a college education that taught me medical language and a mother who was a nurse) help me battle when I go to the doctor, but I still struggle even with these advantages.

When you add racism on top of this bad system, it results in horrible outcomes. Health care providers do a certain amount of quick detective work because they have so little time to figure out what’s going on—and that often results in profiling. (i.e. – The last three patients I saw were all trying to get unneeded pain medicine, so I suspect that this patient is also trying to get unneeded pain medicine.)

Heath care workers need to start from point zero with each patient, put preconceptions aside, and really look and listen at the person sitting in front of them. And they need anti-bias training."

They asked me if I had been taking drugs. I told them absolutely not - something was wrong. I was having auditory hallucinations. I didn’t feel safe to drive.

I knew it couldn’t possibly be normal. Finally, my mom joined me at an appointment and read them the riot act. (My husband thought maybe they were right - it was normal in the in the last few weeks, he didn’t know. My mom knew) I was checked into the hospital. I had pre-eclampsia and my BP was at stroke level. They induced, gave me magnesium sulfate and I delivered a few hours later.

2020-08-06 23:06:28,"What happened toMs Sample should NEVER happen to anyone regardless of whether there is a pandemic. Part of patient care is treating your patients with care and concern for their physical and emotional well being. 

The obstetricians who denigrate pregnant women's concerns really should consider a different line of work. They'd do everyone a favor if they really have such a dearth of concern and compassion, especially for women who are physically and emotionally vulnerable due to pregnancy. That there is a racial bias working against women of color is horrifying and unacceptable. When if ever, will teaching doctors to be sensitive to biases be addressed? 

Statistics support the necessity of mandatory training for OB/GYN doctors, no matter what their experience, in recognizing their racism. It's clearly there. Only by addressing it head on will there  be any change. Recognizing racism is surely less painful than enduring the deaths of more mothers and babies, and it is surely less expensive than litigation for malpractice when dismissive treatment causes fetal or maternal death."
2020-08-07 00:20:07,I agree.  I see nothing in the clinical scenario to indicate the delay in the appointment had to do with race.  The missed preeclampsia story does not have evidence of racial bias either. A blood pressure reading is routine at every OB appointment. Malpractice and racism are two different things. These errors cast doubt on the remainder of the article.

Drop her incompetent behind like a hot potato and get a new obstetrician, one with compassion, proper non-racialized skills and common sense (preferably one of color). Most people would not even return to a bad pizza joint after a bad slice but to still see the same doctor after a precious Black life was lost is beyond me.

2020-08-07 08:33:23,"Racial disparities in medical care & treatment outcomes is a well established fact of life. Yet being pregnant with twins is no guarantee that any woman will wind up with 2 healthy, full term infants.

 My own great niece was pregnant with twins a month ago. At 28 weeks, she suffered a detached placenta & began to hemorrhage. 911 was called. An emergency C-section was performed. One of the twins appeared normal for gestational age & is stable in the Neonatal ICU. The other twin had complications & died after living for 2 weeks. This occurred in an excellent suburban hospital. I do not in any way fault the hospital or doctors for the infant who was lost.

2)  ""Isolated in a special dorm"" and ""supportive communities"" is nice copy and positive spin.  It sounds like recovery from the common cold.  But what about those who need to be hospitalized?

THEN, once they have our money, they start  throwing various conditions and restrictions on students. Today, the college actually sent an email that said, for those allowed to return to campus in the Fall,  that if they come from one of the hot states they have to quarantine for 14 days off campus! They even gave a list of hotels where the students could stay.  I think they are making the return so onerous that everyone will throw in the towel and and attend online, but pay in full. Ideal for the colleges, NOT the students.

No amount of hygiene theater, akin to TSA's security theater in airports, will prevent outbreaks.

All of these institutions rightly believe their students won't pay those same tuitions if they're not on campus, won't return in the fall. They are between a rock and a hard place. The good ones will do all they can to make it as safe as possible, including, for example, hybrid models.

2020-08-04 00:20:54,Visiting the websites of many NYC area colleges one is struck by how confusing the information is and the fact that almost all are seeking to open by the end of August seems unrealistic. Some seek to test everyone coming to campus--some demand that the testing be done 7 days before arriving--do they expect that anyone who leaves and then returns to campus on the same day get tested again? How valid is any test? Some state that their libraries will remain closed---some claim they have reconfigured eating halls--but for many they lack enough space to put social distancing in effect AND Yet all these colleges want All students to come to campus for the Fall? They want all residential students to move into on campus housing? And yet they claim that most classes will be hybrid classes with reduced in person meetings? So where will all these students be spending their time if the student centers and libraries will be closed? Colleges should have waited until late Fall to open giving them more time to get a better view of things and they should have limited on campus presence to STEM majors who need labs and/or to just lower or upper division students. Higher education wasted months with plans failing to use any common sense---they wanted all students to be on campus but not in class for all their meetings hence the hybrid classes and they have already stated they will give no refunds no matter what happens. Constant testing may expose students and professors to more harm.

You can have your Trumpian vaccines from companies with ""spotty track records"".

""Faith"" is the last thing I would ever look for in a vaccine.
I'll stick with ""science""..... and a proven track record."
2020-08-10 15:25:09,"The specter of nefarious hustling comes to mind with companies boasting progress, pushing their stock as values soar, while insiders sell off their shares.  Are they profiting off confusion and fraud?  Meanwhile Trump gets played; he so desperately needs a fix to compensate for his drastic negligence.   So--the vaccine hustlers, if that is the case, know an open wallet when the see one.   After reading this article, I cannot help but think of an image---that of a car wreck with seriously wounded people on the ground.  Up pulls the ambulance.  Rather than aid the wounded, the personnel rifle through the wallets of the injured.  Grab while the gettin's good!  Are we again victims of a tragedy hijacked by greed?  Perhaps a Kamala Harris as Attorney General would do some ethical cleansing!"
2020-08-10 20:23:19,All about nothing. And this could reach NY Times digital version is incredible.  Not worth reporting.
2020-08-11 07:05:46,"Like innovio Pharmaceuticals there are many more drug companies that are lobbying to grab Trump's attention not to cure the Covid-19 but to earn stock profit, throwing all the socio-ethical norms to the winds. This is made possible because Trump, himself a magic cure master gives a ready audience to such quacks and fraudsters."
2020-08-17 20:42:07,"-The article mentions the fact that Inovio has never brought a vaccine to market. Though this statement is true, it fails to account that vaccine development actually can take a decade and that the speed at which we are seeing FDA allows companies to move through development is unprecedented. Please note that currently Inovio has a phase 3 trial that is HPV targeted and about eight phase 2 trials targeting different therapeutic areas.
- It made reference to the company releasing only bare-bone data from its first clinical phase without making it clear that such information was deemed preliminary and more was going to be provided through peer-reviewed journal as they have done in the past. It is also important to remember that phase I is used to assess the safety of a vaccine/drug and that ""bare-bone"" data provided enough insight to accentuate the safety of the vaccine.Actually, no other company has yet to provide a more robust phase I data in their effort to develop a covid vaccine. 
- The article also uses unwarranted criticism regarding limited information on immune response. Isn't that what the other clinical phases are for, especially phase 3? Is there a benchmark you are aware of when it comes to a good vaccine for COVID? Is there a company you trust that has provided compelling information that the scientific community has deemed irrefutable in our battle against COVID. Do you have a comparative study between different vaccines in development to claim a position?"
2020-08-03 09:41:12,"Oh, come on! The world is quite literally falling apart. By the time another 6 months has passed the economy will be damaged beyond recovery. We need to be realistic, what is the most significant risk either (a) ""fast-tracked vaccine"" that we don't fully have all the data on, OR (b) WAR? 

It may sound like Hyperbole, but we are reaching that stage."
2020-08-03 09:50:31,"I wish we could first focus on tests that were fast, cheap, and easily obtainable."
2020-08-03 09:52:45,"I am a vaccine advocate, but I'll wait a while on this one...I do not trust that science is ruling now that an anti-science party is in charge."
2020-08-03 10:02:44,"The real question whether or not the Trump vaccine becomes a political issue.

It has already begun"
2020-08-03 10:13:16,"I will not take any vaccine that is not approved for safety and efficacy by an organization outside of the purview of the Trump administration.  If is approved for use in the EU, or approved by W.H.O., or has been through a thorough peer-review by an independent organization such as the A.M.A., then I will use it.  I am a firm believer in vaccines.  But this administration has so polluted everything it touches, that I will take a healthy dose of skepticism first."
2020-08-03 10:19:41,"You only get one bite at the apple when rolling out a vaccine.  

For the covid vaccine to be effective, enough of the world’s population must get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.  But rushing things without thorough testing will lead to failure.

Just look at the botched swine flu experience with President Ford.  Although millions of Americans received the shot without any symptoms, a few developed serious reactions.  That’s all it took to shut the program down.

This president’s track record of destroying everything he touches already instills zero confidence in his ability to deliver a vaccine that people can trust to be safe.  If he interferes with and politicizes the testing phases of these vaccines, this is definitely not going to end well."
2020-08-03 10:20:42,"I’m not anti vaccine in general. I hate to sound like Trump and the election. But I want to wait and see the data.  

Unfortunately the process is critical.  Much of the data will never be public, and even if it were, is everyone a statistical expert with time to analyze it? I hoped Birx/Hahn/Redfield would stand up to political pressure to ignore/hide subtle safety or efficacy issues with a vaccine candidate, but they have already bent epidemiological advice and wishful thinking on hydroxy chloroquine to suit Pence/Trump. It’s going to be hard to have any confidence that we are getting a realistic picture on a vaccine."
2020-08-03 10:26:55,"As I understand the ""placebo"" versus ""vaccine"", the test would identify sick people once they have been exposed at random, and then determine which group they belong to and therefore whether the vaccine works or not.
But a great number of infected people are not symptomatic,so how is this going to work;
Usually tests consist of having a placebo group and a vaccinated group, both groups being subsequently infected with the disease , but hopefully all being cure by existing  methodsl and drugs
But the coronavirus tests do not appear to follow that procedure;
It would require volunteers who  accept to be this coronavirus  vaccine guinea pigs, to first be vaccinated, but also subsequently infected with the virus, and risk death for the placebo group, and also death for the other group  if the vaccine does not work.
It seems that this supposed fast track is more wishful thinking, for financial reasons, or even more, political reasons and especially the coming presidential election...."
2020-08-03 10:30:44,"Normal vaccine hesitancy comes from people who are very much anti-vaccine - people who have heard of terrible side effects, such as autism, looking at safety risk incorrectly, and weighing the risk of the vaccine higher than the risk of disease.

For COVID, in America we have a different problem. We have a very large group of people who believe that the disease is ""just the flu"" and doesn't warrant a vaccine. We have our usual anti-vaxxers. We have people who refuse to trust science.

And we have people like me. I trust science. I understand what fast tracking means - we skip the long delays between phase trials and simultaneously ramp up production before a vaccine is found safe and ineffective, to be ready IF it is found safe and effective.

But we have a desperate President who had been shilling snake oil, who has suppressed the voice of scientists, who has politicized the epidemic and actually made it worse.

I have every faith that he will announce a vaccine in October, and that none of us will know if it is real or if it is his latest foray into miracle cures, after hydroxychloroquine and bleach. 

Yeah, I am hesitant. You first, Trumpers."
2020-08-03 10:35:55,"If we wait another four to six months for this data we can reasonably expect an additional 150,000 dead and twice that number permanently injured in America.

We don't have to wait. We could have the data next week with a challenge trial.  1DaySooner"
2020-08-03 10:49:02,"Regardless of what stage vaccine development is in the scientific community, I fully expect Donald Trump to announce the successful development of a vaccine and claim much of the credit in its development in early October (our October surprise).  Of course, his loyal supporters will believe anything he says, and Facebook will be inundated with posts touting his wonderful accomplishment.  Trying to tell Trumpers to listen to and believe the scientific experts is a waste of time."
2020-08-03 10:50:40,"I am pro-vaccine, for both children and adults.  

But I will wait until Trump and his family line up to get this one, and Dr. Fauci and all the other pseudo-doctors working in the Trump administration.  Otherwise, we'll be just like Russia which is planning to roll out a vaccine in October, with little evidence one way or the other that I can see that it will be safe.

The safest prophylactic right now is to take a long breath, shut down all but essential businesses, and give healthcare workers time to catch up, vaccine researchers time to actually do their job, and the virus no time to spread and even die out in places.  

But we do not have the political will nor the national leadership to accomplish that, alas.  Instead, Congress wants to pull the financial rug out from under everyone and go back to normal so they can take their long paid vacations."
2020-08-03 11:08:31,It will take 1-2 months to enroll a sufficient number of patients for a multi center study. It will then take a minimum of 90 days (3 months) to have sufficient usable data to reach any conclusions on efficacy. Every American needs to understand this is a question of logistics and minimal time for observation.
2020-08-03 11:27:58,The warp speed program is probably about the only thing this administration has done that could be truly helpful. The dangers of such a hyper political environment is that the one good thing they might be doing is likely to become politicized as well with people refusing to get a vaccine. That would be tragic.￼
2020-08-03 11:32:42,"I must assume there is a reason vaccines take a good deal of time to develop, and that companies in the past have not dragged out their development and safety studies unnecessarily.  I also assume the FDA, NIH, and CDC have in place safety and efficacy standards that were set for very good reasons.  Therefore, I have many questions about the speed at which the corona virus vaccines are being pushed and developed, and the big pots of gold at the end, set by this administration.  I have to wonder whether all of the shortcuts being allowed will allow for scientist to do the real work to create a safe and effective product,.  Do I trust the Trump administration?  Has Trump shown any interest in saving the lives of Americans?  Can his hand picked team be trust to work in the public interest?  I have many questions.  Many."
2020-08-03 11:39:45,"I read this in Reuters a couple days ago:

""The first two COVID-19 vaccines to enter large-scale U.S. trials will not be tested in pregnant women this year, raising questions about how this vulnerable population will be protected from the coronavirus."""
2020-08-03 11:40:36,"I'm surprised this article didn't elaborate on some of the ""rarer side effects"" that have occurred with past vaccines. One of the early polio vaccines caused ""abortive"" polio in a third of children vaccinated, resulting in paralysis and death in some. When the government fast-tracked a swine flu vaccine in the mid-70s, it also wound up causing paralysis in dozens. The consequences of pushing out a vaccine before its time could be catastrophic. 

I share other commenters' reluctance to trust this administration. It's easy to imagine them repeating the errors of the past in another bumbling effort to win over voters."
2020-08-03 11:46:22,"“This is how Phase III trials work:  . . . They [volunteers in the trial] do not know what they have received (known as “blinding”) . . . .”
If my experience as a participant in a phase III drug trial several years ago is the way they’re supposed to work, this statement is imprecise.  My understanding is that not only are the volunteers unaware of what they received (placebo or test treatment), the providers are also unaware, as are those who analyze results from treatments that have encoded identification, so researchers don’t introduce bias as they interpret results. This is known as double blinding. This requires time to do it right! 
If we fail to do it right, we will receive just deserts—garbage in = garbage out. And another debacle—loss of public trust and confidence in a vaccine—piled on top of a failed national preventive medicine response and a diminished economy."
2020-08-03 11:49:18,I won't feel comfortable taking a vaccine that was only approved in the United States and Russia. It's prudent to wait until it's more widely accepted in Canada and the EU.
2020-08-03 11:49:29,"This reader also worries about the political pressure being exerted to speed a COVID-19  vaccine roll out. We've already seen that 'opening too soon' was a deadly mistake in many regions throughout the US. An unsuccessful vaccine, or one that causes problems down the road, would be a game changer for the worse - worst case scenario, maybe even a game ender."
2020-08-03 11:58:08,"So disappointed in my fellow progressives. It was the conservatives who first politicized masks. I thought that was as low as we could go. But we have Democrats politicizing a vaccine before Republicans. Sure, Trump wants a vaccine quicker than ever. Who wouldn’t? ￼

Where is the trust in science? Are we only focused on our Trump hang-ups? Is there nothing good that could possibly come out of his administration? Are we still more open-minded than Republicans?"
2020-08-03 11:59:29,"With the desperate actions by the GOP to try and win I firmly put myself in the unsure category and would want an outside review of data, none of it done by politicized FDA folks who we have learned not to trust. I want to be protected, but not at a price of my well- being or that of thousands of Americans from a faulty vaccine rushed to Market too soon."
2020-08-03 12:03:14,"The disease causes  severe side effects in about 1 in a hundred cases, but so far only about 1 in 10 have gotten it. But you give a vaccine to everyone (or almost everyone) so it needs to have serious side effects in less than 1 per 1,000, or the cure could be worse than the disease.  A phase III trails with 15,000 vaccinated seems gives you this with some margin.  Let it finish and show the results, then decide."
2020-08-03 12:04:36,"Looks like this is more a feeble attempt to prepare the ground for the likely scenario in which we are going to be beaten by Russia, China and India with nothing to show for than a couple of hundred thousand needless deaths.

Delaying vaccine deployment, even if some of the early ones may be imperfect and offer only partial protection, while the real pathogen is raging the country and killing people left and right is like refusing the approval of cancer treatments, because the perfect one has not been found yet.

Natalie, get real!

Once upon a time, America would have been up to that challenge.  Those days are long gone."
2020-08-03 12:06:48,"It is not the public that will be pressuring the FDA to approve a vaccine that has not been fully vetted.  It will be the president who will demand it for his own political gain.  It will not matter to him how safe or effective it is; he just wants to be able to claim a ‘win’ before Election Day.  If people die because it does not work or has side-effects not seen in a well-run trial, he won’t care.  He is not a person known for caring about others."
2020-08-03 12:08:12,"Conventional medical thinking - such as this article - has been unexpectedly shoddy throughout this pandemic and I look forward the post-mortems when times are calmer.

There seems to be a lot of frantic worry about politically influenced vaccines that seems like rather conspiratorial thinking.

I'd say there's prolly enough evidence from trials in three weeks to have a pretty good scope of the situation. Certainly enough to start the factories running... even if they have to trash the first bash of product. With some countries running 1 in 250 infections in the population, it will be pretty quick to see if a vaccine works and at least enough to green-light a factory.

That big bet new factory in India can do 5 million does a week and is already producing the Oxford vaccine. Now.

Remember, Fauci (and everybody) said 2-3 years delay seeing a vaccine? Now nobody doubts February. So maybe sooner."
2020-08-03 12:11:09,"I would not trust taking a vaccine produced in Russia (as another article today has pointed out, Russia is trying to vaccinate by October before doing clinical trials), China, or the United States. And I can imagine the US is not used to being lumped in this group.

At this point, the only similarly-sized entity that I believe understands the concept of diligence and patience is the EU. I would never trust a vaccine trumpeted by Trump; I fear it would be tainted by his and the GOP's abhorrent politics.

Our best hope, in my opinion, is for European researchers to develop a vaccine."
2020-08-03 12:12:45,"I have no issue if a vaccine is coming from J&J, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Pfizer- they have a history of standards that in cases were learned the hard way. My issue is when it comes from a company like Moderna, who has never brought a vaccine to market and are buddies of our corrupt president and whose board made out beautifully when they announced they had positive results on a trial (of 9 ppl). The trump family and congress republicans can go take that vaccine. I’ll wait for results or one from the normal players."
2020-08-03 12:22:19,"There is a middle ground for rolling out a vaccine that isn't discussed in this article.  Investigational medicines (which is where these vaccines are in the regulatory development process) can be made available in several ways.  One would be through an Emergency Use Authorization which can be instantly withdrawn. The FDA could also allow prescribing of the drug through an access program called a Treatment IND.  In these programs, the agency can restrict prescribing to specific patient populations (for example medical workers and first responders, or high-risk populations) and receiving a drug through an access program requires the patient to sign an informed consent. The informed consent document informs the patient that the drug is unapproved, has potential risks and side-effects, and requires the patient (or the patient's designated proxy) to explicitly consent in writing.  A responsible early roll-out could be done through a large access program.  These programs can also be set up to allow for collection of information regarding side effects, efficacy, etc. Consider that tens of thousands of people will be getting these vaccines in trials after signing very similar informed consent documents. The decision to receive a vaccine in an access program would be made consciously by an informed person, just as people do that to enter clinical trials."
2020-08-03 12:30:52,"How would you feel if your surgeon told you that they were going to perform your operation at warp speed?  This is a political push that also reflects Trumps inability to delay gratification. Do you want this done right or done fast?  In situations where both speed and correctness are required (think emergency medicine or urban firefighting) people are specifically trained,supported and outfitted for such demands.  Not so for vaccine development. Go slow.  Do it the right way."
2020-08-03 12:35:58,"Why is it taking Moderna so long to enroll its 30,000 volunteers?  Didn't they know they would need these volunteers?  Why weren't they vetted and approved a week ago and already inoculated?  Are they trying to delay results until after the November elections?  Big pharma, the AMA, and large hospitals do not support Trump.  Are they purposely delaying the trials?"
2020-08-03 12:40:47,I sense that Democrats just don't want a vaccine to be approved and available while a Republican is president; especially Donald Trump. If a Democrat was currently in office this story would read much differently.
2020-08-03 12:41:40,"We could speed all of this up with human challenge trials. Interesting that that's not so much as mentioned here, even though the scientific community is thinking about it. 

There are bodies piling up. The line of volunteers for human challenge studies is long. At some point we have to end the hand wringing so that more people can live."
2020-08-03 12:42:35,"Trump wants ""warp speed"", even though I bet he does not know the meaning of the term. There will be short cuts to get the vaccine and there will be problems. Remember that the Salk polio vaccine had initial problems. 

As soon as the vaccine is available, I will cheer. Then I will wait 1 to 2 months to find out about the true side effects on normal people. Then I will happily take the vaccine. But only then."
2020-08-03 12:43:38,"If the FDA approves an improperly vetted vaccine early, that proves ineffective in the field, people will just be hesitant to get vaccinated when a good vaccine is finally released. The companies developing the vaccine cannot succumb to political pressure. ￼"
2020-08-03 12:43:41,"Any vaccine maker will be shielded from liability by the current law. This makes it even more imperative that the potential for harm be scrutinized ever more carefully.

The current VICP administered by the USCFC is replete with flaws in the statute. Even then, they have paid out billions to those who have been vaccine injured. 

The only acceptable standard that all involved in bringing a new vaccine to market and regulating it's distribution, usage and side effects must adhere to was written centuries ago by Hippocrates.

""First, do no harm. """

2020-08-03 12:49:53,"How many people are actually qualified to review the data data generated by trials and make correct conclusions? The general public certainly isn't. Media pundits aren't. The public opinion about the trials and the administration simply doesn't matter.

When the trials are concluded, experts that are actually qualified to review the data will provide guidance regarding these vaccines. As an essential worker, I'll be first in line for the vaccine to make sure I can protect my family and continue serving the community.

In the past, Americans lined up for vaccines, including ones with known severe side effects, because they knew it was the way to protect their communities. Today's armchair critics only seem to care about number 1, a trait eerily reminiscent of the occupant of the White House that they proclaim to abhor."
2020-08-03 12:52:26,"Why should we expect Americans to agree to a vaccine before one is even available? 49% will take any vaccine is a surprise.  

I am a senior and especially worry about the side effect of any vaccine. Even a vaccine is available, I would rather stay home and don't go out,  and let other people try first. Just want to be cautious.

This ""warp speed"" worries me.  We set the golden rules just to prevent hurried and incomplete tests.  Now with this urgency, we bypassed the rules under Trump administration. 
I don't want to become the collateral damage of this warp speed product.  And I expect our leader will take this vaccine in person if it becomes available."
2020-08-03 12:53:27,"Time is of the essence and regulators are acutely aware of the pandemic.  However, the safety phase is long past and if negative vaccine symptoms emerge in phase III everyone will know because of the placebo control.  Efficacy is obviously much harder to prove notwithstanding hot spots and the absence of intentional exposure.  Maybe, it might be best to organize away camps to test for vaccine efficacy."
2020-08-03 12:54:42,"One can find any number of statisticians to issue any number of statistical scenarios regarding safety, and offer opinions.  Not a surprise that the Times found someone to conform to its anti-Trump narrative.  But these models fail to take into account issues of disease morbidity or social need - human factors.  These are the clinical factors that are included in the actual decision making involving trial design, that in turn allow assessment of risk versus benefit.  The sterile statistical scenario noted here shows precisely why clinicians and actual researchers - those who develop drugs and deal with patients - typically do not allow “statisticians” to actually design trials, but rather inform trial design over technical issues.  When the TImes bemoans the anti-scientific anti-vaxxers that plague our society, this is the sort of column that these luddites use to undermine faith in our scientists."
2020-08-03 12:54:56,"I don't think the US can begin to recover from this pandemic until we have an effective and safe vaccine, so I understand the need for speed in development. The CDC, the FDA, the Justice Department (and who knows what additional federal departments) have been compromised by the current administration so the public's ""hard earned trust"" is already gone. I will not take a vaccine that is certified safe by the same person who told me drinking bleach is a cure, or any of his spokespeople/sycophants/flunkies."
2020-08-03 12:55:39,"trump only acts in his own self-interest.

Putting their health in trump's hands has been disastrous for three and a half years for Americans.

That is the only guarantee."
2020-08-03 12:56:02,"""I worry nonetheless that public pressure may mount to approve a product that doesn’t meet our standards.""

I think the author meant to say ""political pressure"" - and that would be specifically from Trump."
2020-08-03 12:56:43,"In order to defeat the coronavirus, we need herd immunity.  An epidemic results when a single infected person can pass the virus onto several others (the number of transmissions is called Ro, or R naught).  The epidemic can only be suppressed if Ro is less than 1.0.  This requires a vaccination rate of at least 90%.

Anti-vaxxers will be playing on people's fears to reduce the vaccination rate.  And many people won't get vaccinated anyway, if they feel that the vaccine hasn't been adequately tested.  

The chances of getting to that 90% threshold to establish herd immunity is looking unlikely.  If we don't get there, the best vaccine may slow the the viral spread, but it won't end the pandemic."
2020-08-03 13:05:04,"Instead of placing our faith in a ""magic "" vaccine that many of us will be reluctant to be the first in line for, the US government should be equally vigilant in requiring people to wear masks, subsidize businesses of all size to install equipment that will help kill the virus in recirculated air,  and continue to promote testing.
Having a vaccine that is only 50% effective may meant more people walking around without proper protective measures thereby infecting others  when they themselves are already semi-protected.   So unless the US is willing to adopt more stringent measures already implemented in many other developed and developing countries, a vaccine is at best a half-measure towards a return to normalcy."
2020-08-03 13:06:47,"We should be warp speeding a 1 minute Covid test similar to the diabetes blood test i take every morning. With such a test distributed to all schools , businesses etc., folks would know immediately whether they should shelter."

2020-08-03 13:10:44,"Why not do a “challenge trial”, where you identify a group of volunteers to vaccinate and then intentionally expose them to the virus in a controlled environment. With our knowledge of the virus’ risks, we could identify a population of candidates (pay them $10k for their time) that are from low-risk age groups with zero co-morbidities, in order to conduct the test as safely as possible. Again, the study would have to be done in a controlled setting to ensure the lack of spread of the disease. We could have definitive results in 2 months. With Covid being so dangerous that state governments have decided to shudder businesses, ban in-person education, cancel all festivals and live sports...., could it justify this bolder testing protocol?"
2020-08-03 13:15:06,"One of the issues if we get a initial vaccine that proves to be either not safe or not effective is that a ""re-do"" will be even more difficult ."
2020-08-03 13:18:20,"I am concerned that, in this current environment, the administration will only support a vaccine that can be touted as the ""best in the world,"" ""only the US can make such a vaccine,"" ""it has never have been done so quickly under anyone ever in the history of the world,"" even if the most effective vaccine comes from elsewhere. 

I have never mistrusted the combination of government and Pharma before. This is from someone who has always been very grateful for the vaccines that have allowed us to believe that when our kids get ill, they will get better and grow to adulthood."
2020-08-03 13:18:32,"I am not an ""anti-vac"" person, but I would be extremely reluctant, based on this administration's already disastrous performance with this disease and its tendency to be less than truthful, to inject myself with anything (and certainly not bleach) that they claim is safe and effective. Sorry, their credibility on this, as on many other things, has long ago been discredited."
2020-08-03 13:19:42,"The companies investing billions of dollars in this research, more for the ones that do not get public money to do so, need to raise the awareness of the safety of the product they are developing so that the general public becomes too hesitant to accept the vaccine.

The consequences for such non-effective or one with serious side-effects may damage long term public health by inflaming anti-vaccine propaganda promoted by religious fundamentalists and other such ignorant people. And in the short term, the sole purpose to developing this vaccine with such a huge infusion of public money may be much less productive to achieve its goal of reopening the businesses and the society towards more normalcy."
2020-08-03 13:22:56,"If .1% of the population gets an immune enhancement reaction and die a few months after taking the vaccine there would be 320,00 deaths.  If the trials do not include enough people to detect the problem (.1% of a thousand people is 1 person) then rushing to approve the vaccine could be a disaster.  As a person who is now on medication after a very painful immune system flare up that came out of nowhere and that my doctors cannot explain, I think I speak from experience that the potential risks of rushing a vaccine for people like me are very significant."
2020-08-03 13:23:10,"I'll wait until one of the major vaccine companies brings one to market.   There are too many small, press release-driven companies in this space."
2020-08-03 13:27:21,"I am equally concerned about public misconceptions of how a vaccine works.  They are not instant cures.  Rather, they take time to provoke the body's immune system into developing a sufficient response to the pathogen in question.  That is, after all, why we are always encouraged to get our flu shots *early*, before flu season begins.  Unfortunately, few if any of us ever received a vaccination in the midst of an epidemic, so we never realized someone could get vaccinated and STILL get sick.

I am concerned that people will naively assume a poke in the shoulder will make them instantly bulletproof, prompting them to behave irresponsibly.  And if cases rise, despite vaccine availability, we can also expect to see public cynicism of the utility of vaccination.  That's just how dumb we are."
2020-08-03 13:27:23,"What a timely piece. As someone with an autoimmune condition, I cannot take a ""live"" vaccine. Thank heavens Shingrix was available by the time I was eligible for the Shingles Vaccine. Zostavax might have killed me.

And I do not believe the F.D.A.'s criteria is the end all, be all.

I do not trust that the F.D.A. has our best interests at heart. Let's take a look at sunscreen. Let's take a look at Morcellation. I doubt French women have ever undergone Morcellation of ovarian cysts. The French have everyday, very cheap, very effective sunscreens, containing Mexoryl SX, Mexoryl XL and Tinosorb S. Not the US. We have Oxybenzone and a bunch of other toxic chemicals in our sunscreens. Thanks a lot, F.D.A.

Asia is also ahead of us, with Tinosorb A2B and Tinosorb M. 

We are indeed 30+ years behind the rest of the world on sunscreen anyway. And the F.D.A. quite regularly approves things that are downright poisonous, dangerous and deadly. They are a faceless organization toying with American health."
2020-08-03 13:29:32,I will absolutely get vaccinated but I will hold off for a small while until I'm satisfied that there are no unanticipated side effects. I don't want to grow a third breast.
2020-08-03 13:29:42,"Here is a chance for Trump to redeem himself for his comment about sacrificing during the Vietnam war, you know the one where he said his sacrifice was dodging STDs at Club 54.  When the vaccine is ready, Trump and his family should be the first in line to receive the inoculation.  Him, his children, his children's children, his wife, all of them should step up and show the world that the vaccine is safe and effective.  I am still voting against him, even if does make the sacrifice."
2020-08-03 13:30:05,"The ""October surprise"" gambit might not work anymore. Many will have voted already."
2020-08-03 13:31:30,I trust that the pharmaceutical companies and regulators involved will remember that getting this wrong will do infinitely more damage to their reputation than a few petulant tweets from a person aspiring to be re-elected. We have ways of keeping the disease at bay such as social distancing and mask wearing plus the type of hygiene  that we should have been practicing all the time. Get it right is more important than get something quick.
2020-08-03 13:32:11,Another potential side effect of an ineffective or unsafe vaccine is that the anti-vaxxers will have a field day. Let's do this right!
2020-08-03 13:33:23,"The arithmetic is actually on our side for fast and unambiguous Phase III trials. The US is seeing about 60,000 new cases a day in a population of 330 million. If there are 15,000 patients in the placebo group, then over a two month period you'd expect to see 160 infections. If the vaccinated group shows far fewer, you've proven efficacy. The pharma companies running these trials know how to analyze the data, and won't submit for approval until they have a cast iron case; and the smaller companies have bigger companies managing all this (e.g., Moderna is backed by Pfizer).

So the key to success is fast enrollment in these trials. If you are a front-line worker, you should volunteer! You would be helping to save civilization, and you have a 50% chance of being protected as well."
2020-08-03 13:33:56,"The question of timing is difficult one, because the speed of the infection and because of the fact that people are dying right now. The people will die without vaccine. With vaccine they may have chance. Sure, we can not know the effect of the vaccine for years, especially in term of efficiency, but by this time the epidemic could pass and there will be no need for this vaccine any way. I think it is reasonable to offer the vaccine to the people with full disclosure about potential risks."
2020-08-03 13:34:08,"I'm not an anti-vaxxer by any means, but there is ZERO chance I will take any vaccine promoted by the Trump administration."
2020-08-03 13:35:45,"I first commented on here in April just before I went on the Phase 1 trial in Oxford. At that time I hoped for it to be as quick as possible. But I can now see the logic of taking enough time to get results so that when the vaccine is released it can be given and used with confidence. Other treatments can help to bridge that time gap and some of those have also been developed by our universities. I would like my government in the UK to have put in place much better public health systems. Our test, track, trace and isolate has been shambolic. It looks as though the same can be said of the US. In spite of our world leading science we are both set to come out of this pandemic badly because of our poor public administration and out-sourced public health."
2020-08-03 13:36:32,"Generally, vaccines are aimed at just one aspect of the target virus.  Since targets will mutate, a vaccine must be redone frequently.  

For this pandemic, multiple vaccines are being developed.  This gives us a chance of having several effective vaccines which may be aimed at different aspects of the virus, allowing people to get multiple vaccines and multiple immunities, defeating any single viral mutation.  

Going big for the first vaccine and ignoring the subsequent ones will be a big mistake.  Unfortunately, mistakes are the present administration's forte."
2020-08-03 13:36:42,"I will consider taking it only after Trump's entire clan is vaccinated on a prime time live TV special, with a vaccine  certified by a group of independent scientists as to authenticity.

The vaccine dosage must be selected randomly from the same pool of vaccine to be distributed to the public.

Just imagine the ratings.  Highest in the history of television!"
2020-08-03 13:47:19,"I doubt any legitimate drug company would consider pushing out a drug that was never properly tested. The potential for lawsuits outweighs being first to market. I know that I do not see myself taking any quickly developed vaccine. I'll sit it out for a few years as while I am comfortable with known risks, I am very averse to unknown risks. 

Let's not forget the the annual flu vaccines are hit or miss. I'd rather not find out the miss is some other terrible disease that will kill or disable me."
2020-08-03 13:54:03,"I’ll admit I’m wary of getting a vaccine that is “ready” for use in such a short time, but if it seems to be effective, much like the flu vaccine (or at least means a much milder illness), I’ll definitely get one. I believe in vaccines. I get the annual flu shot and have received vaccines for the shingles, pneumonia, and tetanus—all serious diseases.  My fear that the growing army of anti-vaxxers will refuse to be inoculated and there will be no herd immunity."
2020-08-03 13:56:27,"I pray that the FDA drug and vaccine oversight committees do not succumb to the inevitable political pressure that will come from Trump after the first phase III study is closed.  People must understand that antibody levels that persist, efficacy against infection, and lack of serious adverse events are the three metrics, and these will take some time to be defined.  

The anti-vaccine crowd will likely never receive treatment against covid, but the key group to reach is the significant population that is vaccine-hesitant.  To achieve enough herd immunity to allow society to return to a sense of normality, we need the best convincing data about safety."
2020-08-03 13:56:54,"Thank you for this article. I am very far from an anti-vaxxer (get a flu shot every year, see a travel doc before international travel, etc.), but no one has adequately explained how a process that usually takes several years can safely be done in a few months. The conversation on this topic I've seen so far has been about how to market the vaccine to non-believers, and not how to address the very real and fact-based concerns that those of us with confidence in science have about a rushed, potentially politicized process.

I agree with another commentator that regrettably this administration is so far not to be trusted that we can't rely on FDA approval here -- I'll be looking for vaccines that have been approved for use in the EU, Canada, and other places with reliable, non-politicized public health infrastructures, and produced by companies with a lengthy track record of producing safe vaccines. I'll be the first in line for one of those."
2020-08-03 13:56:59,"As we talk about this, I would urge everyone to please remember that economic devastation, for about half of America, doesn't mean ""downsize your lifestyle."" It means not enough food in your stomach and out on the sidewalk with your things in trash bags and nowhere to go. And worse, it usually means this for your children. Unless you have lived it, you probably don't understand it.

I am not making any pronouncement about vaccine safety - I honestly don't know enough to do that. I am just urging people in a privileged or a fortunate position not to be cavalier or callous about the consequences of an ongoing pandemic and economic shutdown - especially with the unemployment system set to snap back this week to Dickensian. 

And frankly, if your interest is in defeating Trump, elite liberal obliviousness to the plight of half of America will not help your cause. Keep some empathy for people who are out of work or losing their small business. Understand that people are hurting and very afraid and will weigh things differently than someone who is still employed and working from home."
2020-08-03 13:58:57,"Americans love home runs, hail mary passes and three-pointers at the buzzer. Relatively few aficionados are engrossed by the ongoing tactical and strategic battles in the trenches—on defense and team play. 

This dilettantism and faith in the big play is what worries me most about the headline grabbing vaccine news. People are dying in droves, in numbers that are not tolerated in any other countries in the world (except Trump's two favorite authoritarian regimes), and we still do not have enough discipline or empathy to wear masks and social distance to the extent necessary."
2020-08-03 13:59:34,"The 'standards' accept little or no risk.  Sometimes that works, and sometimes it doesn't."
2020-08-03 14:03:41,"We know how this is likely to play out.  Trump will some how, some way, create an October announcement of a vaccine.  It will come from the most credible source he can find who will say it, who may not be credible at all.  The scientific community will respond by speaking reasonably about the need for caution.  Trump will respond ""they are elites who just don't want me re-elected.""  Thus this becomes just another skirmish in the culture war that changes few minds if any."
2020-08-03 14:04:07,"""... and poor uptake would jeopardize the impact of a coronavirus vaccine.""

If the vaccine works, poor uptake would only jeopardize its impact for those who refuse to take it. The rest of us will be immune. The only unintentional damage might happen to minor dependents of the refuseniks, and to the health care workers who will have to care for them. Of course the healthcare workers will be vaccinated, so at least they won't catch it from the sick refuseniks in their care."
2020-08-03 14:04:11,"This is a brilliant example of executive power in action, unchecked by legislative, judicial, or scientific review. There is going to be an October surprise, but one without any element of surprise.

The developers of the vaccines lack production facilities. As I understand the WarpSpeed concept, HHS pays for pharma to scale up and produce vaccines that may work, but pharma takes no risk. They get paid whether or not the the deliverable product works. End result = profits for big pharma.

HHS decides whether the vaccines are working well enough. No doubt citizen T will make the final decision.  Putin has already decided that health workers in Russia will be among the first to receive the Russian version of the vaccine. That makes it very easy for T to decide.

End result = a win for citizen P, citizen T,  legal persons, oligarchs, and major shareholders in big pharma.

Guess who the losers will be, for there are certain to be those who don't tolerate the vaccine well and errors in production, distribution, and execution. We won't know the results until tests are completed down the road, but by then the war will be over.

This is how wars are won or lost, you build planes and ships from the plans you have on the drawing boards, and fight with the army you have, not the army you want to have."
2020-08-03 14:04:46,"Before the election, Trump will declare we have a great vaccine, thanks to him. Whether that'll be true or not will have no influence on his announcement."
2020-08-03 14:05:53,"I'm highly skeptical of any vaccine approved or promoted by the Trump administration. Trump has proven with hydroxychloroquin that he doesn't care about safety or effectiveness, instead promoting anything that he thinks will get people to return to normal life. When politics are placed ahead of people's lives, naturally a lot of folks are going to question it. 

We need a new president who won't put political pressure on researchers and who will listen to the advice of real doctors. That's the only way we're going to be able to mass vaccinate the country. As things stand right now, you just can't trust the government because of Trump."
2020-08-03 14:05:59,"Several months ago, I thought it would be difficult to assess efficacy of a vaccine if the prevalence of the virus in the population was low. How would you compare infection rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups without recruiting tens of thousands of volunteers and following for a prolonged period?  Sadly, this is no longer a concern."
2020-08-03 14:06:25,"I note that Russia is planning on rolling out a (minimally tested and possibly unsafe, ineffective) vaccine in October. I'm certain Trump would love to get in on that action."
2020-08-03 14:11:29,I've had about every vaccine under the sun but would never trust or get one advocated by the Trump Administration or any Republican politicians or their propaganda outlets at Fox and Sinclair Broadcasting. After there is strong science from legitimate sources indicating its safety and efficacy I'll gladly get it.
2020-08-03 14:14:07,The notion that previous vaccine development was unnecessarily slow is absurd and Trump will waste billions more of our tax dollars on a failed venture. They wasted millions of dollars buying hydroxychloroquine based on videos and information from the internet rather than trusted experienced doctors in this country like Dr Fauci. Rushing a vaccine because of political pressure may cause lasting damage to the public’s trust in vaccines and science— we can ill afford that in an era where people choice to believe in conspiracies and unfortunately one of them is President of The United States.
2020-08-03 14:14:38,"I do not understand why we are not testing vaccines by using human challenge trials. there are plenty of volunteers who know full well the risks. thousands of lives could be saved. yes, some who participate in the challenge may get very sick or even die but by not going the human challenge route time is ticking away and more and more will get sick before a credible vaccine reaches the public."
2020-08-03 14:15:10,"Dr. Dean calls herself a ""vaccine researcher"" whatever that means.  It appears that her full-time job is as assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida. Not sure how that qualifies her for a front page article in the NY Times. Most of what she write can be found in wikipedia, but her use of the information is just silly. 

The majority of these vaccines are built on a well-established platform which is well tested for safety. Vaccines are not the same as drugs.  A drug has a systemic effect.  It it's doing ""X"" to one system, it's doing ""X"" to all of them and that's never desirable, although usually unavoidable.  It can take a long time to find out what side effects a drug may have.  A vaccine is simply activating your immune system to do what it's supposed to do -- recognizing an intruder and make antibodies.  Provided the delivery mechanism is safe (and some of these have been used for over a decade) there is no reason to believe that the vaccine would be problematic.  The ""immune enhancement"" is a total stretch. This has only been observed in the late stages of individuals overwhelmed with the infection.

In any event, large scale phase 3 trials are, in fact, being conducted. The vaccines have already shown robust antibody making in both animals and vaccines.  That is not a ""weak"" vaccine."
2020-08-03 14:16:11,"Why assume that getting vaccinated would lead to less mask-wearing?  Indeed, why worry about vaccine hesitance when there will not be enough for everyone for months if not years anyway?"
2020-08-03 14:16:18,"What worries me about the Moderna vaccine and  “warp speed” is that mRNA technology is new. That means that subtleties could be missed in the rush.
When will we know if there are long term side effects?
I don’t automatically trust anything that comes out of this FDA.
I am not an anti vaccine, but I am also not foolish."
2020-08-03 14:18:21,"What’s forgotten in our “mask wars” is how initial unction to adopt them came not from the WHO, but from Masks4All, a Czech youth group that convinced its government to impose a mask order. They had videos out in March showing how to make a cloth face covering from a T-shirt. In our best review on this topic, Chu & Akl (“Physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection…,” The Lancet, June 1, 2020) claimed only “low certainty” for their conclusion that “Medical or surgical face masks might result in a large reduction in virus infection,” derived from a meta-analysis of ten studies more of which were conducted in health care settings than in the community.

No mention of cloth masks at all, or of how effective they’ll be in US cities where discipline is spotty at best. Although I favor requiring masks indoors in public, I realize adopting this intervention comes on a basis of limited information. We’ve only mechanism—that masks block or deflect respiratory secretions their users would otherwise emit to the environment—as a strong argument pro.

Are we to be so incensed at Trump’s antics that we talk ourselves out of administering a vaccine despite having only short-term safety and partial efficacy data behind it? Though I agree it can’t happen before the winter or spring of next year, if we’re left waiting longer almost every American will have a bout with Covid, to a price in morbidity and mortality far greater than any likely to be induced by the candidate shots."
2020-08-03 14:20:20,"A clear, easily understandable explanation of a complex situation. Thank you!"
2020-08-03 14:20:46,"The best thing that the Times can do is to continue to print articles describing the process and the facts, citing sources that we can look into more deeply, and where we can try to educate ourselves. Calling people who are thoughtful and realistic names like ""anti-vaxxers"" and ""refuseniks"" is unhelpful.   Consumers who buy cars and computers read up on the facts, compare products, try to make informed decisions. We don't call them names or berate them for so doing.  A vaccine should deserve at least as much careful research."
2020-08-03 14:21:09,"I agree with the author.  For now, all we have to do is wear masks and social distance.   Is that too much to ask?  

Meantime, let's watch and see what happens in Russia, where the government will be using millions of its citizens as guinea pigs starting in a month or so."
2020-08-03 14:22:24,"The urgency is clear. However, rushing and failing would be catastrophic not just for the fight against COVID-19, but for vaccines in general. I would be pleasantly surprised if there is an effective, affordable, COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. before next spring. How is Germany doing? They seem to have a functioning country."
2020-08-03 14:26:57,"The author is educated (Harvard) and experienced (academia and WHO) and certainly makes valid points about the speed at which this vaccine is being developed and tested.  Trust me, it would be easy to find a scientist with equivalent expertise to write an opinion piece expressing an alternate viewpoint, one expressing fewer fears and less concerned about political pressure.  That one would, however, be far less likely to be published by the NYT,  since it wouldn't so neatly fit the narrative favored by the Times.  I am a biologist by training and before I retired worked in technical capacities for 31 years in the medical and pharmaceutical fields, though not specifically vaccines.  Knowing how scientists at companies and the professionals in the government work and what drives them, these people are not making decisions because of politics.  Facts and science drive them.   As the author admits, the development of the vaccines for COVID-19 did not start from a point of zero knowledge of this class of virus.  Implying that all that pre-existing knowledge and experience may not apply and that shouldn't be used in the fast-tracking of these vaccine candidates makes no sense.   Finally, as a minority of other comments  have noted, we are in the midst of a global pandemic in which hundreds of thousand have died and which led to the near demise of the US and global economies.  Time is not on our side.  I trust the scientists and regulators who will have the ultimate say."
2020-08-03 14:27:06,"Nice explanation of a phase III trial.  I hope the Times invites Dr. Dean back to give us her view of the safety and efficacy of any vaccine that is produced.  I am assuming, of course, that the data are made widely available."
2020-08-03 14:29:45,"If we do ""vaccine"" like we did ""shut down"", we'll pressure scientists to release it too early on behalf of the economy, and we'll end up with a vaccine that either doesn't work or causes so many side effects people won't want it, and will taint any further effort and lead to a worsening economy. 
Get this right, America."
2020-08-03 14:30:55,"I cringe when I hear ""Warp Speed.""  It sounds like science fiction and we all have to be careful."
2020-08-03 14:31:11,"A few sure things...
1. Trump will absolutely take ownership of any vaccine that is close to approval or just approved for political purposes. His administration did start Operation Warp Speed, so there is a smidgen of truth in his future claim - however the billions given to big pharma with nothing to show for it also belongs to him.
2. Americans who don't trust a word out of Trump's mouth will absolutely need to hear about safety and efficacy from someone other than CDC - HHS or even the FDA with lots of non-Trump experts  giving it the ok before we really decide we want that shot.  They will need to see published results and that takes time. 
3. Lest we get too excited about a coming vaccine that is not thoroughly vetted - remember what Thalidomide caused. 

We need a vaccine to repair the damage to this country that Trump has caused with his ignorance and stubbornness to do the right thing in the face of this virus.   But we need to it come from someone other than Trump to trust it. 

Under no circumstance should Trump be allowed to follow Putin's example and start vaccinating people with a drug that has not gone through Phase 3 trials and experts reviewing the results."
2020-08-03 14:35:15,"There is no mention of challenge trials,infecting vaccinated volunteers with  the Covid virus. The dosage could vary ,you could chose different demographics of subjects.  There is a danger  but they would receive the best medical care if becoming sick. 
Why is this technique not better than  much longer efficacy trials?

This article did  not even discuss challenge trials."
2020-08-03 14:36:14,"The Moderna phase III trial ends on October 27th. All evidence up until this point indicates the vaccine is safe and effective, and if this pans out at the end of phase III, there is no reason we shouldn't have 100 million vials ready-to-go. 

Might there be other, possibly more effective vaccines in the pipeline? Sure. But the moderna vaccine has gone through and passed all necessary tests thus far and should it continue to do so, it should be ready for mass distribution once phase III ends, politics aside."
2020-08-03 14:38:28,"Start working on your anti-vax friends now. What we hope for - and should wait for - is a vaccine that is very safe and fairly effective. A round-number example: Let's say each infected person has been infecting two others. Let's say we get a vaccine that's 75% effective. If everyone takes it, then on average each infected person has a 50-50 chance of infecting even one other person, and the pandemic quickly dies down. If half the people refuse vaccination, each infected person will infect 1.25 others (one unvaccinated and maybe one of the unlucky ones for whom the vaccine does not work), and the pandemic continues. And one person out of five who gets sick, one of five who dies, will have had the vaccine. It will be fair to say they are innocent victims of the anti-vax movement."
2020-08-03 14:39:39,"Speaking of DATA, we need to know the following as well:

Not only Mortality by age-cohort, but also Mortality by BMI, both in the aggregate & by age-cohort.

Obesity is rarely an isolated comorbidity. Obese people typically also have Type II Diabetes, Hypertension, Fatty-Liver Disease, and elevated C-reactive-protein.

Given that approximately 70% of people under the age of 30 who try to join the military are rejected because they can't meet the minimum fitness standards, it would be nice to know the BMI of the young people who are dying or have serious complications from COVD-19, as well as the percentage of them that also smoke or vape.

As an RN who is Board Certified in both Critical Care (CCRN) and Emergency Nursing (CEN), almost all of the young people shown on the nightly news who died appear obese (as do the older patients who are interviewed in their hospital beds).

If the CDC is even minimally competent they already have this data: Why is it not being shared? With this data Multiple-Variable-Correlation-Analysis can be performed to assess mortality risk, which then begs the question what does that show?

AND MORE IMPORTANTLY: Why is all of this not routinely put into the public domain? All we get are vague statements about 'pre-existing conditions'."
2020-08-03 14:40:24,"The author is raising the fear that we might approve the vaccine without the necessary testing, but she provides absolutely no evidence to support this fear. The vaccine candidates are in phase III trials, which is exactly what is supposed to happen.

As for the ""warp speed"" part, that just means that the vaccine is manufactured now, while the trials are ongoing. The government is taking on the risk that the vaccine will not pass the trial, because no private company would be willing to do so. That's exactly what we want our government to do in this situation.

Without some justification for the author's fears (other than ""orange man bad""), this article is nothing more than fear mongering."
2020-08-03 14:40:26,"Thank you for this rational opinion at a time when popular media has a tendency to report claims that have questionable basis in fact.

However there is one issue that you didn’t touch upon. Some of the schedule of recommended vaccines contain adjutants. These are toxic substances that are supposed to accelerate the bodies immune response.

The theory is that a small amount of virus mixed with these adjutants will generate the anticipated immunity, while not causing any harmful side effects.

As someone who is seventy-three and already dealing with an auto-immune disease I would be very skeptical of any new vaccine that has toxic ingredients added.

In the last fifty years I’ve never had a flu shot and only had the flu once, about ten years ago. I’m a former teacher so I was exposed to all sorts of viruses every day but I believe my good fortune is in paying attention to factors designed to strengthen my immune system. After 50 years of work I think that comes to 98% effective.

Still, at my age I would need very solid evidence that a vaccine wouldn’t do me more harm than good. And so far I don’t see it.

And the pressure for a quick fix is because of our political leaders overreacting to initial scientific claims that have since been found incomplete or simply wrong.

Quick science often makes bad science and bad public policy. Let’s all agree to take a deep breath and slow this train until we know more."
2020-08-03 14:40:38,"I expect Trump to be the very first person in the country to get his hurry-up vaccine, along with his children and grandchildren, on a live broadcast. Even then, of course, we'll  never know if he fixed it in some way so they all got a placebo, because I doubt that he will trust the vaccine he expects us all to have."
2020-08-03 14:42:49,"let's not forget about the Thalidomide disaster that resulted from introducing a drug before following users for enough time.

despite the best intentions and care, things can go wrong. 


and politically pushing quick release to large portions of the population might end up causing long lasting health and cost effects. indemnity for the producing companies only further makes conservative introduction and use even more problematic"
2020-08-03 14:49:35,"As a former FDA employee, I can tell you that there is no way that career professionals at the agency will bow to political pressure and approve a vaccine without substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness. Trump does not and will not review the vaccine trial data and decide whether or not to approve a vaccine: it's the professionals-- scientists, physicians, epidemiologists-- who will do so, and they will remain at the Agency long after Trump is out of office. 

It's interesting because during the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, the FDA was strongly criticized for being slow to approve potential treatments, the exact opposite of what is happening now.  So many people have trouble seeing the nuances of the scientific and regulatory processes that are involved in pharmaceutical development and the regulatory approval process. I read this article and all I could think was that this author has no idea how vaccines are approved here in the US."
2020-08-03 14:50:22,Great article.  Well written and brings up important things to be considered.  My husband is a scientist and works in pharmaceutical R&D.  We will wait a year and see what happens.  Vaccines can be tricky and some things don't show up for awhile such as bad autoimmune responses.
2020-08-03 14:53:26,"This is a good op-ed for people to better understand Phase III trials, but it is not clear to me if the author feels the current administration (and de facto the FDA) is cutting corners, other than simply worrying something will be compromised in the future. Do we have any current evidence that safety is being compromised in any way as the vaccines are being developed (for the US only...countries like Russia and China are a whole different ballgame)?"
2020-08-03 14:53:40,"Thanks for the article, as much as there is an urgent need to get a vaccine as soon as possible, I find it interesting that the timeline provided all coincides with October ending, is it just a coincidence and concern for public health or a move to change public opinion about the handling of the virus. Surprised Russia just announced massive vaccination in October."
2020-08-03 14:57:45,I’m not anti vaccination. I get a flu shot every year. But I don’t trust Trump and have serious doubts about the safety of any vaccine he is intent on foisting on us before the election. I will wait to see the effects it has in his supporters first.
2020-08-03 14:55:21,"Although I don’t believe anything said by this president and his administration I do trust the FDA.  I was a physician involved with transfusion medicine and I know first hand how rigorous their regulatory regimen is.  The personnel who work in FDA, CDC AND NIH are dedicated, honest and trustworthy.  Lets give them the space to do their jobs before we pass judgement."
2020-08-03 15:02:54,"“It is also costly to roll out a vaccine, diverting attention away from other efforts that we know work, like mask-wearing, and from testing better vaccines.”
I don’t share Dr. Dean’s opinion that a first-cut vaccine will turn the public into oblivious party-going teens or undercut medical development.  The Salk vaccine, which also had public fear embedded in its rollout, didn’t fill all those empty swimming pools our mothers continued to keep us from.   The wards populated with iron-lungs kept the public focused on the horrors of the disease rather than the detailed performance of the vaccine.   So, we took it.
The other omission is that the current development is of several very much different modalities, each with different potential for problems, and different need for the most extensive testing before mass distribution.  And nothing says this year’s lightly-effective shot will not be followed with something better next year.  All of it can save lives and disability."
2020-08-03 14:52:34,I believe in vaccines but think there is ample evidence that current pressure --by desperation and toxic politics -- will result in premature release.  I wonder how the research even reached  the Stage 3 trial level this quickly.  I will not be among those getting a vaccine released this year.  We're not hearing much about research on treatments.
2020-08-03 14:46:06,"Thank you for an honest assessment. I too am anxious to get a vaccine, but I want one that is proven effective and not harmful. And at this point, I find it hard to trust any soothing assertions as to either, made by this administration. Count me among the ones unsure right now."
2020-08-03 14:46:04,"I would not be so worried about a vaccine if any other president was pushing for one.  The track record of ""accomplishments"" by this administration leaves a lot to be desired.  Every decision made during this pandemic has been plagued with problems, whether it be the overpriced faulty ventilators purchased or not having enough N95 masks for medical personnel.  Heck, the virus itself has not been taken seriously overall by this administration until just last month when states like Florida and Texas exploded with new cases.

The fact that the concept of developing a vaccine was labeled ""Operation Warp Speed"" (like it's some kind of comic book story) while handing out BILLIONS of dollars to Novavax which has never brought a product to market only raises alarm in my head rather than comfort in my heart.

The race to be first, in record time, by this administration, seems to be more politically motivated rather than humanitarian driven.

So many researches say that a safe and effective vaccine takes a long time to develop.  Maybe this administration believes that 10 months is a long enough time.  

I will be biding my time, watching and reading how people fair after taking this vaccine.  I am one of those many ""uncomfortable"" people, not because I don't believe in vaccines, but because I don't trust what Trump nor his administration says.  For someone who constantly stated this virus ""would simply disappear"", how or why can I trust his words about any ""warp speed"" vaccine?"
2020-08-03 14:34:24,"Thank you. I have counseled countless families on the efficacy and importance of vaccines. Now I am in a position where I don't trust our government or the CDC anymore. If we push through a vaccine that has not had full safety testing, I'm not getting it, and I will counsel people to wait until we have good post-market data. 

I am so angry that something as simple as a vaccine for a dangerous infectious disease now has to be viewed through a political lens."
2020-08-03 15:07:38,"I too, as much as i want to see a magic bullet to end this scourge that has plagued the world, am very skeptical of anything that can and will come out of this administration. My skepticism will only increase as we near an election that looks like a landslide loss for trump.  We all have seen his willingness to play fast and loose with the lives of his fellow Americans if it will benefit him, after all, it is only he who matters to him.
I think we can all see where this is going.  Down my double digits  in the last few weeks before the election, he will be declaring victory over Covid 19 with a drug that is not proven effective or safe but about to be released.  He will bellow how he has done more for the health and safety of the American People than any previous leader of any country in the history of the world.  And while not yet released he needs to be returned to office in order to see its delivery to the market and thus save the US and the World.  
Sadly, even before his first utterance 35% of Americans will believe this foolishness from their Bunko Artist in Chief.  The only question is, will he be able to convince 15.0001% more or the equivalent in electoral college votes to continue this American agony.  I truly hope not."
2020-08-03 10:04:56,"As long as Donald Trump is President, I will never get a COVID vaccination.  

I do not trust a thing he says or does, nor do I trust anyone who he has appointed or paid off to participate in this “experiment” he directs.  

PS:  I do believe in science.  I’m a nurse.  But my body will never beholden anything Donald Trump touches in any way."

Oh right. They don’t have to. They get tested all the time and the children don’t have to go into a public school in the fall!"
2020-08-03 14:39:24,"Because Trump befouls everything he touches and has a long and clearly known history of ethical illiteracy and moral corruption, I will not accept a vaccination that bears his fingerprints and is developed on a “warp speed,” politically calibrated program overseen by the likes of Jared Kushner. 

I will wait for a vaccine that is approved by countries with a reasonable history of concern for the well being of their citizens—Denmark, Canada, Norway and other liberal democracies come to mind; not perfect but not run by criminals and grifters or snake oil salesmen—so I can have some peace of mind that a vaccine touted as a defense against Covid-19 will not likely kill me or place me at genuine risk from potentially crippling side effects.  

Put simply, I will not accept being injected by any type of metaphorical bleach even if it is highly recommended by the “experts” in the Trump administration or the “scientists” found in Republican Party and appointed to high administrative posts."

Operation Warp Speed has pumped 3 billion into the vaccine effort, partnering with Pfizer, BioNTech, J&J, Moderna, and AstraZeneca.
Guess what? Those companies have experts too. Lots of them - and they are much more accomplished and experienced then the ""expert"" writing this article, who is just an assistant professor at a college."

2020-08-03 14:30:44,"So more vaccine denialism from the Opinion page! I am watching on my social media formerly rational people mutating into anti-vaxxers “because Trump”. I can already see the outline of the next culture war: former Bernie bros, assorted socialists and cancel culture warriors taking a stand against “Trump’s vaccine” and demanding that we stay in the lockdown for the next five years, while the government is paying us our weekly 600 dollars! No matter that international agencies are also monitoring vaccine trials, so nothing is up to CDC alone. No matter that the economy cannot sustain any more lockdowns, not to mention their psychological toll. No matter that a vaccine made of a dead or weakened virus cannot give you any side effects that are worse than the disease itself. Safetyism and political partisanship have killed rational discourse in this country. When a vaccine is available, I am getting a shot, ditching my mask and resuming a normal life. You are welcome to stay at home and try to foment a revolution on your cellphone."
2020-08-03 15:09:17,"Professor Dean is right to emphasize caution before recommending an new and possibly prematurely approved vaccine. Consumers will firstly demand proof or at least confidence that the vaccine is safe not only in the short term but also that there are no delayed potential complications, (e.g.immune enhancement) as she appropriately states. Consumers will need to do their their homework and to research the various manufacturer's safety records. Have they ever been cited or sanctioned by the FDA? 
 We must not allow ourselves to be influenced by politically motivated attempts to claim victory over the pandemic in time for the November election. I am reminded of an incident that occurred in the rush to administer the Salk polio vaccine, in which a batch contaminated with active or at least poorly inactivated live virus was given to children who subsequently developed full blown polio.  For an interesting read on drug manufacturing and safety I recommend ""Bottle of Lies"" by Katherine  Eban."
2020-08-03 11:54:31,"I'm normally in favor of vaccines and science in general, however, I've no confidence in anything or anyone at this point.

If it passes the trials (meaning no evidence of harm and it’s effective after administering it to tens of thousands of people) I don’t care about the politics, it will save countless lives and repair our economy. Our lives will go back to normal. 

Also, IMO, how is saying “I’m not gonna take any vaccine promoted by the trump admin” any better than the right wing antivaxxers who you know won’t trust any vaccine promoted by Biden. Maybe having trump promote the vaccine is a good thing so his base will actually take it (and save lives)."
2020-08-03 11:45:35,"My husband and I will also wait. Why would we trust a president who has lied to us over 20,000 times and counting? If this was President Obama, Bush or pretty much any other president the data would be trusted. This administration? No way. I'll get the vaccine when President Biden, WHO or other international and respected organizations verify that it is safe to do so. Everything trump does is driven by two things only; to win re-election and greed. My life and the lives of my loved ones are far too precious to trust to the hands of this sociopath and his sociopathic enablers. Count me out."
2020-08-03 13:15:22,"""Operation Warped Mind"" is just another abuse of American tax dollars to support the trump crime family's election campaign. It's a reflection of trump's complete ignorance of medicine and science, as evidenced by his comments about injecting disinfectants into the body to give it ""a cleaning.""

Pick, at most, two, you can’t have all three.”  Yet that is what Operation Warp Speed is trying to do.  To mitigate some of that, the White House is providing large sums of money to politically connected corporations.  Some of those corporations have former executives playing a major role within the administration.  Somehow, this reminds me of many of Trump’s former business practices, which include a fraudulent university, a fraudulent non-profit foundation, and at least six bankruptcies.  This is the track record of the Republicans choice for President.

Clever name.
Reminds me of, ""Operation Star Wars"", Reagan's catchy name for how the space program could be both militarized AND make a profit off sending up spy-hardware for 'businesses'.

Well, that sure did send NASA into a death-spiral for half a century, right?

I would have to say, this race is already lost.
Much ado about which companies are getting billions just for breathing, which is more than real-live humans are getting, and a billion here, a billion there.... well, you know the drill.

Trump/Republicans poison everything they touch.
In this?
I'm holding out for what the Oxford Team is doing.
It's not hype. 
It's not hysteria.
It's not ""spectacular!""
It's not injecting bleach.
It's not isolating this country from the scientific organizations of this country and the rest of the world.

Trump has done nothing in 8 months.
The Republicans are fine with that.

Deploy them out of the Oval Office at ""warp speed""."
2020-08-03 13:29:14,"The fact that they actually named the vaccine operation “warp speed” is evidence that this administration is run by a bunch of people who all peaked in high school.

It’s exactly something a sarcastic teenager would come up with as retaliation for being singled out by a teacher. Future historians are going to judge us incredibly harshly for allowing this to go on as long as it has. Same way historians judge other populations throughout history who allowed dictators to ascend to power, without doing anything to stop it."
2020-08-03 14:28:37,"Let's face it.  The only vaccine that will be approved is the one Trump approves and this miraculous vaccine, with great fanfare will show up in mid October.  Many people are saying it will be the Russian one."
2020-08-03 10:40:02,"My biggest fear is rushng out a vaccine purely for political motives.  It's disgusting to read articles that the Trump adminstration, particularly the clumsy and totally unqualified Jared Kushner, is putting the squeeze on drug manufacturers.

The only person I believe on the viability and the timing of vaccine availabilty is Dr. Fauci.   He's hinting that if the stars align, one could be ready for genera consumption by next spring or summer.

A far cry from the promises and boasts from this administration.  Plus, any sacrifice in time and testing of the ideal candidate to score a political win is a sickening idea when we're already in the midst of so much death."

2020-08-03 14:00:54,"Only after an available vaccine is used to vaccinate the majority of the US population, and vaccinate the majority of the populations of the world, will we be safe and secure from COVID-19.

The distribution within the US, and the diplomacy and political will to spread the vaccine across the globe will take time - likely years.  Meanwhile, we will not be safe from COVID-19.

In the long-run the health and security of all Americans is dependent upon the populations of Asia (especially China), Europe, Africa, and the rest of the western Hemisphere taking an effective vaccine.  This is not just about the US.  This fact is obviously escaping the small minded conservatives who worry about China stealing vaccine information.  We want everyone to share vaccine data with all scientists around the world, and all of us to work together.  It is humans versus the virus, not US versus China.  Until our stupid politicians, and the general public, understand this reality, having an effective vaccine will be only a scientific achievement without the global health win we all need."
2020-08-03 14:19:39,Lots of negative talk about the vaccine now. The vaccine is now a threat to the democrats.  Even if the vaccine works perfect it will be attacked until after the election. Let’s just wait until Joe is elected then we will save lives. Stay the course.
2020-08-03 13:22:15,"Being sold on the view that a vaccine is the ultimate solution to the COVID-19 pandemic is, at very best, wishful thinking. How can anyone not know that? Not to deny hope; but hope that is of substance is not and never will be rooted in mindless naïveté. Yet, a vaccine has become a widely prized focus; and there are those exploiting this, certainly to achieve their own end ... eg, wealth; power; even dictatorial dominance in a zero-sum game. Surely an effective vaccine is welcome and, to a degree, may be important; but anticipation of this, as presently, serves as a dangerous distraction from what needs to be done to stay alive ... if only to have an economy. As for “Operation Warp Speed:” Consider the source and that person’s history of medical predictions (or even service) ... for example, people being back to church and celebrating by Easter. The reality show so often America lives! People of America have enjoyed comfortably living probably to a greater extent than any people of any nation in the history of the world. Insisting on the easy-way out should not be surprising. Who doesn't like comfort? But, the cunning cons that are out there realize and know how to exploit this. And as they do so in trying to get a head-start, people die. How precious leadership, dedicated to service, really is!"

I'd be very hesitant to get any vaccine that is pushed by the Federal Government at this point in time.

This flu effects nine to forty five million people each and every year so the flu vaccine doesn’t cure the person of the flu but shortens the hospital stay and it still a killer. I understand why vaccine haters are reluctant in putting fifteen years of stuff in their bodies to only get to a forty-five percent effective rate, and now they want to add the Corona vaccine to this soup mix in rapid time.

Do I trust the FDA? Not really. They're a federal agency, and all of them are now in question. All it takes is a Sharpie to make facts into fiction, and some Trump appointee will back up the fiction.

Americans, in our affluence, have lost the ability to compromise and accept that there is no ""perfect"" outcome.   Covid will kill some of us, mostly old people.  It is unavoidable and in our avoidance of this fact, we condemn even more to die."

The government has created the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) to backstop vaccination.  I saw another immediate effect of this program itself when the price for then standard DPT vaccination went from about $10 for a vial of ten doses to over $200 a bottle in just a few months.  In my primary care practice, I had to stop my vaccinations because of cost to carry such an inventory.  I know cost will become a barrier to mass immunization especially if it is passed through to recipients.

If a deadly ""pandemic"" existed, one would expect to see an increase in the number of deaths from all causes in all 50 US States.  The CDC data, updated on July 31, does show a small increase in deaths from all causes in most States (6% average) during February 1-July 25, compared to the same time period during 2017-2019.  The data also show that the increase peaked in mid-April and has been decreasing since then.  The worst affected State was New Jersey, with a 44% increase above the expected number of deaths.  However, 12 States and Puerto Rico have not seen an increase in deaths.  For example, in West Virginia, the number of deaths is 21% below the expected number.

Thankfully for the country, there are career federal officials at the FDA - just like those in the national security apparatus who told the truth during Trump’s impeachment hearings - who still have integrity, despite this President and his band of vapid, incompetent charlatans."

2020-08-03 14:31:07,"The biggest threat to a Biden presidency is a successful vaccine or treatment for covid.   Several promising antibody treatments are in phase III trials and could be available in early fall.   Hang on for our ""progressive"" democrats attempting to discredit any and all treatments and vaccines.   Our ""progressives"" are shooting for maximum pain and economic misery."
2020-08-03 12:16:16,"Unlike the engineering and technological challenges presented by making an atomic bomb and landing a man on the moon dealing with the biological science infectious disease COVID-19 aka novel coronavirus-19 aka SARS-2 aka COV SARS -2 pandemic can't be rushed and solved by money nor politics.

Three phased human safe and effective clinical vaccine/therapeutic double-blind/randomized controlled experimental tests peer reviewed and published trials are essential.   At best we are 12-18 months off, if ever, from any safe and effective vaccine development.  Manufacture and distribution via triage is another matter. 

There are no vaccines for malaria nor HIV/AIDS nor common colds.  There are safe and effective therapeutics aka treatments that took time.  

While the influenza vaccine is a yearly human challenge.  COVID-19 currently makes influenza look like a minor pimple.  COVID-19's genome is comparatively gigantic redundant deceptive in being evolutionary fit fruitful and multiplying infectious contagious and deadly.

Humans can't even make our rockets go at comet speed.  Warp speed is a science fiction."
2020-08-03 13:12:24,"Alas, the first vaccine will have a pollutant in it, kryptoTrump. We un-culted Americans are going to be deeply suspicious of anything the Man of Orange endorses. He lies. And lies, and keeps lying because he understands the terrifying power of repetition.  (How many hundreds of times have we heard ""witch hunt?"")  From whom will we hear credible info about a brand new vaccine?  Maybe a wholehearted endorsement from Dr. Fauci. Or Joe Biden. Never Trump."
2020-08-03 14:44:02,"I, too, am suspicious of anything which is done at ""warp speed"".  We know the ""President"" would like to have a vaccine before Nov. 3 and that he has little concern for human welfare, so I am at this point not willing to take any Covid-19 vaccine."
2020-08-03 15:03:12,"We all know Trump. We know all he is fast-tracking is his re-election campaign. If this was not an election year, there would be no rush. Just like there was no rush when Kushner led a team of diagnostic experts to develop a national testing strategy earlier this year, and it was shot down by the Trump administration because COVID-19 was a 'blue state' problem back then!"

Right now the vaccine in question is dangerous and polluted by politics and greed."
2020-08-03 12:58:49,"Like many others with lymphocyte (T cell) & other blood disorders - children & adults - I can only be vaccinated with a ""killed"" (inactivated) vaccine. I see no countries other than China & South Korea working to develop such killed vaccines. What will happen to us if an appropriate vaccine isn't available?

The Operation Warp Speed process of vaccine development is itself very twisted,  uncertain & untrustworthy. Those of us with blood disorders feel as if we're being left out of this rushed process. Will we be the first victims of ""vax failure?"" Will we be doomed to die of SARS-CoV-2 because the vax we need is unavailable, not in successful development, & with no multi-million or billion-dollar support from Treasury (Trump thinks it's HIS money) going to pharmaceutical developers?

MAYBE if all others are immunized, we who are at risk will be saved by herd immunity. Given the response by millions of Americans - anti-vaxxers, young people (under 30), religious holdouts, and political naysayers who use the US Constitution to refuse immunization - I doubt that any satisfactory herd immunity will be achieved. 

Americans have become wealthy & selfish (except those who are poor & think of others). We now have the global reputation for being rich & stupid. Well earned. Well deserved for a nation who accepted Trump as president. Not well-meaning if you omit millions who need a killed vaccine. You live, we die. For what? To re-elect Trump?"
2020-08-03 14:12:13,"The word 'data' is plural.  If even scientists don't get it right, it may be too late.

More to the point, it is unclear if the vaccine story for this virus, when it is finally written, will be a tragedy or a triumph."
2020-08-03 11:18:59,"Happy to wait until 2021. Then, when Fauci says take it, and takes it, I’ll take it."
2020-08-03 12:14:49,I would not be first in line for a vaccine produced under this corrupt Administration.
2020-08-03 13:39:27,"It is truly shameful and catastrophic that the constant lies from Trump and his administration have destroyed any possibility of faith in the ability of our government to protect us.

To paraphrase the President, ""I could inject someone with a dangerous and ineffective vaccine on Fifth Avenue and get away with it""."
2020-08-03 15:09:14,"American public opinion will make it impossible to adhere to bad advice  even when a deranged, delusional and narcissistic president insists that Americans take a vaccine that scientists conclude is not safe enough to administer.
In the end ,the overwhelming majority of the American public is no longer listening to Trump or these pathetically gutless Republican senators.They have shown us already,  too many times that they have put their own personal agendas ahead of the safety and well-being of the American people. 
 A majority of Americans on the other hand,ARE  listening to scientists and doctors where this pandemic is concerned. Turning issues of life and death into a political football is both diabolical and reprehensible. We are depending now upon, as Lincoln put it, “ the better angels of our nature“ to guide us through, and resolve this terrible crisis. 
That phrase does not include Donald Trump or for that matter his “personal lawyer”, (the Attorney General) or the Republicans in Congress. We are depending upon men and women of science to guide us through what is arguably the greatest crisis we have sustained since World War II. They are the true heroes. Anyone who is not actually listening to them is just as ignorant and arrogant as Trump himself is ."
2020-08-03 13:47:05,"As you stated, developing an effective vaccine, with minimal side effects, does take time and efforts that devious hacks 'a la Trump' have no time for, as they are adamant in forcing us to believe a vaccine is just around the corner...so to be able to promise that, if only Trump were re-elected, all would be fine. Of course, nothing further from the truth, as hacker Trump is known for his expertise in lying and cheating on us; he has done so all his life. Plus the fact that, for him, the facts are what he says they are, to suit his malevolous intent. Look at his persistent quackery of Hydroxychloroquine, shown not to work and worse, with cardiac potential for harm; he is just 'so full of it' we would be stupid to abide by his sham. Let vaccines be developed at it's own pace, be effective and efficient and safe; not a second before, just to satisfy their dangerous politixization."
2020-08-03 15:03:45,"THe FDA will be railroaded into approving a vaccine that has not been tested thoroughly. Trump will demand it before the election, well the one he will delay anyway. If the FDA waivers he will fire the head and put in one of his cronies. The vaccine will be like his other shortcuts and will sicken and kill many people.  His followers will be the 1st, but it will not make any of them blame him...he is the chosen one..."
2020-08-03 15:08:57,"We should all be scared.   Trump sees that Putin has pretended to have a ""vaccine"" and being a Putin wanna-be dictator, he will no doubt try the same thing.   Just remember, he has given billions to pharmaceutical companies, some with no history of development.  These companies will not give up that money willingly.   This is where the true scientific community has to stand alert and firm."
2020-08-03 15:09:26,"If an American company produces a vaccine, and the FDA immediately approves it, my inclination would be to say “No thank you, I’ll wait for something safer.”"
2020-08-03 15:13:03,"The scariest thing about the Warp Speed program is that it is coming from a government headed by a man notorious for making extreme promises, failing to keep them, and walking away while pocketing whatever profit there was while blaming everyone else for the debacle. 

Trump doesn't actually care if we get a working vaccine or not - all he really wants is to be able to hype one long enough to get him past the election. Period. We've already seen his 'leadership' is now trying to get us to accept 150,000 dead and rising as 'normal' after months of promising the virus would just fade away.

He has gone out of his way to surround himself with sycophants instead of competent people. Indeed - anyone who does show any competence is driven away lest they detract from his glory.

Operation Warp Speed could instead become a cautionary tale: The Emperor's New Vaccine. 

Bottom Line: The most effective long term public health measure we should implement is simple: STOP VOTING FOR REPUBLICANS. 

If'd we'd done that in 2016, we wouldn't be where we are today."
2020-08-03 15:13:39,"We are fighting not only the virus, but a lack of deep public understanding about how vaccines work, how they are approved, and what we can expect once they are available. We live in a ""give me a pill that will cure me"" medical environment, one in which idiotic claims about hydroxychloroquine gain traction and people have to be warned not to inject themselves with bleach.

In such an environment it's important to try to educate people, but it's equally important to recognize that not everyone will be receptive to that education, and not everyone will be able to absorb and understand it. Many, many people will wave this away, and say ""Just give me the shot that keeps me from getting sick..."" while others will refuse to get vaccinated no matter how much information you give them that it's safe.

Transparency and trust are the keys here. Research, testing and trials done in secret laboratories under code names like Operation Warp Speed do not lend help in this regard. We need a national Vaccine Czar, an independent overseer with the resources and assistance of a committee of independent medical experts who can report to Congress and the American people on the progress of this vaccine hunt.

We cannot risk developing a vaccine that no one trusts because of political interference in the process."
2020-08-03 15:14:43,"Likely this will be the same result as the long highly vaunted ""Complete and Wonderful""  Health care plan!"
2020-08-03 15:15:22,"I listen to Dr Olsterholm among others for advice on this. We're in our 60s retired and the pandemic hasn't changed much of our daily lives. So we'll wait, and be at the back of the line. I completely understand younger people and those wanting it straight away, but for me, safety is the clear priority and a vaccine will not change much in my day to day routine."
2020-08-03 15:15:26,"I think Dr.  Dean is missing the point here: Dr. Fauci's goal it to get the vaccine sold and distributed BEFORE the safety  and efficacy studies have been done.  This is why he has been ignoring the advice of previously trusted vaccine pundits such as Offit and Hotez.  He's swinging for the fences and hoping to hit a grand slam.  Yes, he'll probably strike out, and many people will die or suffer serious illness, but his desire to be the knight in shining armor who will save America from coronavirus will not be  trammeled by sober-minded adherence to scientific standards or ethical considerations.  This train has left the station, and it is express.  It will not stop until its destination: the great roll-out of a doomed project which was conceived and execute in haste as much as  hubris."
2020-08-03 15:15:35,"No one should take any vaccine that Trump pushes scientists to cut corners on.
Trump botched the pandemic response, and denied the science behind the effective handling of it. Trump is once again using bad judgement in trying to get scientists to cut corners to produce a vaccine just prior to the November election. Trump doesn't understand or care about the science behind producing a safe and effective vaccine. He only cares about his re-election efforts.

I'll take the vaccine when Fauci and other trustworthy experts says it's ready to go."
2020-08-03 15:19:29,"I am not an anti-vaxxer.  However, I have watched Trump insist that certain drugs be ""approved for use"" by the FDA for which the science did not support, and only for political expediency to allow Trump and his enablers to insist that things are just peachy keen and that they were doing something and that the economy can re-open at full speed by Easter.  I watched as Trump and his family and friends (Jared?) cornered the market on Hydroxichloroquine, and continue to insist this will cure everything except, perhaps, hangnails.  To the point of generating a propaganda push back against the actual scientists who say otherwise.  And watched as Trump insisted that injecting bleach and eating a light bulb can cure the virus.  Seriously.

So when I see Trump falling over himself insisting that a vaccine is being developed at ""warp speed"" and that one will be available in time for the election (nothing suspicious about the timing), forgive me for being skeptical that what is being pushed out into the public is a medical equivalent of Lysol to be injected.  Trump and those surrounding him are only in it for the political expediency (and the money, should they be able to push something - anything - to market and tell you it will cure this thing.)  So, yeah, I may just need to hang on to my mask, social distance a while longer and watch the results of the forced mass trial on US citizens.  Hope for the best, but expect the worst.  It is possible that Trump is just selling snake oil."
2020-08-03 15:21:24,"Unfortunately there isn't much of value in this piece. 
There are basically only 2 points -
- clinical trials are not finished so the data is not available yet
- the author personally worries that ""public pressure may mount to approve a product that doesn’t meet standards""

The first is obvious and the second is speculation and
assumes that public pressure controls the entire regulatory and scientific process."
2020-08-03 15:21:55,You lost me at saying a weak vaccine is worse than none at all.  Speculation here is reminiscent of the argument made just a few months ago that facemasks would cause people to touch their face more and therefore be harmful.   Some efficacy is better than no efficacy.
2020-08-03 15:22:34,"Another major factor in accepting a vaccine is trust. Right now we can have absolutely no trust in the Trump administration to be honest. Their record of denial, promoting falsehoods like hydrochloroquine and concealing data from the C.D.C. has created a massive trust gap in any vaccine they’d declare safe and effective. This is especially true with the Moderna vaccine where there’s a massive conflict of interest created by paying them in advance and then placing their CEO as vaccine czar. Moreover, given the immense pressure to succeed along with the rewards, one must be concerned about attempts to fudge the data itself. As a retired health researcher, I’ve seen all these corrupt practices and with the absence of trust and perhaps credible oversight, I’m extremely hesitant to have any faith in the vaccine trials sponsored by the Trump administration."
2020-08-03 15:24:54,"The timing of the vaccine will have a lot to do with whether I trust it. If it's announced next spring and they publicize the data, I'll likely trust it. But, if it's announced just in time for the November election, I will be extremely suspicious that corners are being cut, at the direct order of the president, and that side effects/incomplete data are being covered up.

So, I guess we'll see."
2020-08-03 15:25:16,"While I share the writer's skepticism about any vaccine produced under the direction of this administration, should we also be reluctant if Biden becomes president?"
2020-08-03 15:25:25,"I read a lot of comments lacking trust in any vaccine approved by ""this administration"" - while I understand the sentiment, I think that it misinterprets how the FDA  and other government agencies operate.  It's true that very high-level administrators are political appointees, but most of the day-to-day operations are done by regular people, hired in regular ways, outside the political process.   It's not just Dr. Birx sitting alone in an office with a comically big ""APPROVED"" stamp.  While they may face some pressure from above, ultimately I trust that in life-and-death matters like this, good people will ultimately do what's right.  Some might lose their jobs for standing up to pressure, but it's a poor view of the doctors and scientists in public service that thinks they will just roll over if the White House wants a publicity stunt."
2020-08-03 15:30:23,"In the normal course of the FDA approval process, an outside, independent panel of analysts looks at all of the phase 3 trial data and then issues a recommendation to approve or disapprove. The FDA almost always follows that recommendation 

Especially for a Warp-speed developed COVID-19 vaccines, the above is the ONLY acceptable course. The Trump administration must be pressed NOW to agree in advance that they will not overrule the recommendations of independent panels for COVID-19-related vaccines. If the Trump administration refuses to do so, that information should be widely publicized to let the public know that the Trump administration is going to play political games - risking American lives - solely to further Trump's re-election chances."
2020-08-03 15:33:38,"One thought I keep having:  there is NO reason for the mumps vaccine to be considered the “standard” for how rapidly a vaccine can or should be developed.  Yes, it may be the fastest we’ve ever done it, but that was more than *fifty years ago.* While caution is always advisable, continually referencing a vaccine timetable that occurred when we had no internet (never mind internet, we had virtually no computer technology at all), no genome sequencing or advanced DNA and RNA technology, very limited ability to communicate across the globe, etc. makes no logical sense.  I would go so far as to say that in 2020, there is no *excuse* to take that long with something this essential.  Yes, let’s do this right.  But there’s no reason at all that we aren’t (more than) ripe for a new “record” vaccine development timetable.  Science has progressed beyond recognition since 1967.  So doing this far faster than we’ve ever done it does NOT mean we’re cutting corners. It means we’re taking advantage of the technology we have now and did not have then.  Which is precisely what we SHOULD be doing."
2020-08-03 15:38:12,"I am currently a volunteer in the ""safety"" phase of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, now in Phase I/II. And though I don't trust Trump any more than I'd trust a turnip about these or any decision (a turnip that could benefit greatly from a fast vaccine), I feel very safe being involved. This Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a AD26 base vaccine that has already been tested in a broad array of other trials for RSV, HIV, Ebola, Zika, Influenza, and malaria. The doctors and nurses I'm working with at Beth Israel hospital are highly competent, patient, intelligent, and concerned individuals who obviously care a great deal about my well being. I understand why people would be concerned about a vaccine that was developed under the inane title of ""Operation Warp Speed,"" but I do hope we don't prejudge these vaccines before we have all the necessary data. A lot of very good people are working themselves to the bone and others are risking their own health in hopes of possibly helping others and saving lives. Let's support them and see what they're able to achieve."
2020-08-03 15:39:24,"If and when President Trump declares that a vaccine is ready and the general public should line  up to take it, he and the covid-19 task force should publicly be vaccinated with the precise same vaccine, under the same conditions that the public is being asked to take it. If any of them decline, the public should promptly be advised."
2020-08-03 15:39:55,"While the Trump administration has gotten virtually every aspect of their SARS-CoV2 response wrong, putting huge amounts of resources into vaccine development is the one area in which they've made the right decision...particularly in aggressively funding the development of multiple vaccines.  But, just to be clear, when we get a successful vaccine it will not be a Trump accomplishment--it is an accomplishment of science and the innovative scientists who have developed these vaccine technologies."
2020-08-03 15:43:22,"The very last thing we would want is for the vaccine development program to be politically influenced, for Trump's benefit.  I was already afraid of this when I saw the name ""Warp Speed"", and the process for choosing developers."
2020-08-03 15:43:59,"Since life offers no sure things, I will depend on trusted sources when a vaccine becomes available. These include Anthony Fauci and Scott Gottlieb (former FDA Commissioner under Trump). I also have confidence in the editorial board of the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association."
2020-08-03 15:45:41,"I grew up in the Thalidomide era so even though I am eager to get vaccinated, I am not going to be one of the early adopters of one rushed to market by a desperate President. I think I will just sit back and see which one of the many that will likely be available provides the most protection for the least risk."
2020-08-03 15:46:15,"Trump just wants to tweet before the election that he delivered a vaccine at warp speed.  It's his usual stage managed reality show bid for votes.  Whether the vaccine works is completely irrelevant to him as long as the data are revealed after the election. He doesn't seem to get it.  Even the die hards (and they are in the process, sadly) in Trumplandia are not going to fall for it.  Count me in the wait for science column. Buh bye, Donnie!"
2020-08-03 15:48:45,"There is no vaccine on the market today that successfully counteracts the influenza virus and it's been around for over a hundred years.  During the 2018-2019 flu season the current influenza vaccine was only 47% effective in those that received it.  The reason is that the influenza virus is constantly mutating ahead of current vaccine research.  Selling the public on the idea that an all encompassing  vaccine for Covid is out there is pure quackery.  Covid is going to be part of our lives in one way or another for the rest of our lives.  It doesn't mean that we don't continue to rapidly develop vaccines at record pace and it certainly doesn't mean that we stop living our lives until the ever evasive miracle vaccine is developed.  Unfortunately it does mean that Covid will continue to be politicized until Tuesday, November 3rd 2020 after which it will end up in the dustbin of history."
2020-08-03 15:49:51,"Makes perfect sense.  I'm not involved in public health.  I'm a retired businessman.  There is a political aspect to this but, to me, more frightening is the financial aspect.  Executives and CEO's of some of the firms involved in the ""warp speed"" projects are reported to be reaping tens of millions of dollars in stock based compensation.  ""Hopeful"" comments leak out of these firms or encouraging results are reported that as the author of this article points out are premature.  Nevertheless stock speculators apparently flock to these firms like bees to honey.  This kind of speculation could create a lot of pressure to report encouraging information that might not be backed up by hard data.  I think that stock trading in firms involved in COVID-19 vaccine research should be halted for a period of time after information is made public so that the news can be properly digested and verified.  Maybe some kind of blackout period is in order."
2020-08-03 15:50:16,"You say ""Scientists need to show us the data. And that’s exactly what they’re working on.""
.
In truth, most people are unable to assess the data on their own.     On top of that, we are faced with an increasing amount of sloppy, fabricated, meaningless data. 
.
Faced with that, what to do? One thing is to abandon thinking and pick an authority to follow.  Another is to try to assess the process by which the data was generated.
.
Studies of high-reliability teams show an environment of psychological safety,  where dissent and disagreement are welcome, where implicit underlying mental models are challenged.   This can counter the human tendency to go with the crowd, to yield to pressure,  or to delude oneself with an appealing fantasy and the truly astounding ability of humans to rationalize what they want to do anyway.
.
Conversely, a well-proven recipe for disaster is trying to reach an unrealistic deadline and achieve rewards along the way by cover-ups, cheating,  suppressing dissent, deleting ""bad"" data points or warning flags that things are going wrong, and firing ""troublemakers"" until no one left dares to challenge anything upper management says -- until roll-out day when it suddenly becomes obvious to everyone that something, surprisingly, has gone seriously wrong, at which point management says ""Who could have known?"" or ""No one told me!"" and guys at the front say ""We were shouting but you slammed the door and locked us out.""
.
Trust is hard won and easily lost."
2020-08-03 15:50:41,"My concern is that multiple vaccines will be rolled out at the same time in different places with various effect.  I expect we will be able to shop around.   There may be 10s of choices about which vaccine and which dose.

So, will we have to second guess what our doctor recommends and then call around till we find one that does what we think is best?    How are we supposed to judge what is best?   

The answer is to wait and see.   That gets riskier every day."
2020-08-03 15:50:52,"The idea of ""warp speed,"" an idea from science fiction, is part of the problem.  Eesh.  What will they come up with next, a Space Force?"
2020-08-03 15:51:26,"A successful vaccine won't help Trump's reelection. The Moderna phase 3 trials began in the last weeks of July. Those trials go on for three months, so late October. After the trials there will be a period where they assess the data for safety and efficacy. There shouldn't be an announcement of vaccine success from Moderna until mid-November at the earliest, well after the election. That's probably why Trump cried about delaying the election."
2020-08-03 15:52:02,"Well, let's just say I wouldn't get a shot of anything before the election.  But, in actuality I have already written off Thanksgiving and Christmas for this year; I will remain sequested in my home.  If reputable organizations vouch for a vaccine, I will be ready to get my shot after New Year's Day.

But I may still wear my mask for awhile."
2020-08-03 15:52:53,"Thank you for an excellent medical assessment of the vaccination rush. As bizarre as it may seem, Donald Trump poisoned the American mind on vaccinations with his first pronouncement  on the virus itself back in January. He declared then that it was under control and would just disappear. Then he pushed forward to Easter. Following that, Pence said we would have the virus pretty much behind us Memorial Day weekend. As late as July 7th, Trump declared things would be looking great in just two, three or four weeks out. Yet here we are at August 3 and the number of deaths keeps increasing.

Every announcement of ""something happening very soon"" has been wrong. To expect that people would accept any announcement now or in the near term that a vaccination is ready to go will be met with the same or greater degree of disbelief as the earlier predictions. To use the old saying, Trump and Co. have just gone to the well too often."
2020-08-03 15:56:09,"We already know that thisWhite House cannot be trusted.  Which statement do you believe?  Trump's consistent message is that this virus is not as dangerous as the medical experts are telling us, and that we should believe him, Rush and Hannity that it's a routine upper respiratory virus.  Just a cold.  If that's the case then what is the rush to deliver a vaccine against it before we know how safe it is?
  I think that what will happen is that in October, trump will demand the vaccine be given because of the results of some early study, the medical experts will not do it and then he will cite the medical deep state as another reason why he lost the election."
2020-08-03 15:57:05,Many foresee a flu vaccine type scenario.  Less people infected less people seriously ill who are infected. Good for a limited amount of time.  But they have many obstacles; immune enhancement or not enough antibodies to deter the virus.  The politics of this will rush this to the market.  There are vast financial rewards at stake.  The public are going to be guinea pigs.
2020-08-03 15:57:11,"I fear, labs around the world who are in a race to produce a possible vaccine for the virus, are in a hurry to make ""quick buck"". If quick buck is their only intention and in that if they forget the safety measures, then the vaccines  which they produce with such intention may not be effective, rather cause unexpected damage. Those in power should caution the vaccine producers right now before any damage is done."
2020-08-03 15:58:35,"I know from personal experience what the effects of an early stage vaccine can be. I was enrolled, as a healthy control, for a vaccine trial to treat melanoma.  I ended up in hospital with a sterile meningitis, ie. because the vaccine induced hyperimmune response."
2020-08-03 15:59:23,"On March 16, the executive branch floated ""15 Days to Slow the Spread."" We know how meaningless that pompous statement was. Then it was ""Open the Economy."" Now we have ""Warp Speed."" All slogans designed to fool the public.
China, Viet Nam, New Zealand, Singapore all defeated SARS,-CoV-2 with complete lock-down, testing, and masking measures. It required national discipline and real leadership to do defeat the virus. They did it without a vaccine.
When the Beijing Xinfadi Market had new cases, over 30,000 people were tested within days with a 24-hour turnover for results.
Had the US done the same, the virus would have had far less impact when it did enter the US. Americans (not the administration) could have defeated the vaccine by now. Yet somehow many believe in American exceptionalism. 
A vaccine does take time and testing. All the baffle-gab around defeating the virus in the US should be locked down, and only the truth told by scientists."
2020-08-03 16:00:00,We are up-to-date on all our vaccines and always have been.  But we'll wait until after Joe Biden takes office and has had his scientists review any vaccines before we'll chance it with any vaccine promoted by trump.
2020-08-03 16:05:34,"A well written article, but it neglects the statistical effect of testing so many vaccines at once.  By simple statistical variation, you will have some vaccines that appear effective when they are not. This happens to every patient when they get a blood panel with ten values. Statistically, one of those values will be outside the 95% normal range. They aren't sick. it's normal variation of test results. 
If you run enough tests or vaccines, one will look effective when it is not.
Only longer term testing will show what is true."
2020-08-03 16:06:02,I'm going to wait for a vaccine first approved by any reputable  non-US agency. The toxic political atmosphere and reprehensible behavior of various US pharmaceutical corporations in the past don't give me any confidence that regulators will truly have our best interests at heart. Go Oxford!
2020-08-03 16:06:28,"Anyone remember how the National Weather Service completely capitulated to Trump's demands and agreed that his sharpie-enhanced hurricane map was correct? How do we know the FDA won't do the same thing? 

Dr. Stephen Hahn, the head of the FDA, is a Trump appointee, who has already reversed course several times under pressure from the administration. The agency removed strict regulations for diagnostic test developers, it had to pull back faulty antibody tests that flooded the market. In April it changed its guidance to allow the use of Chinese-made KN95 masks in healthcare settings, only to reverse course in May and ban many of them. There were even issues with the FDA-authorized test the White House used to screen visitors. It's entirely understandable to have doubts about any vaccine that Trump's FDA touts as ready for the public."
2020-08-03 16:06:52,"This is an excellent article. Thank you for clearly outlining the risks of ""Warp Speed."" It sounds like Fauci also dislikes the notion of rushing, based on recent interviews. I hope the political pressure doesn't derail this process."
2020-08-03 16:09:07,"Even the companies involved in this process (Op Warp-speed) should be running ads telling the public that they are gathering the proper data, and running the proper tests...in little mini-docu-series like ads. Be transparent, be educational, and they can win the public's trust. 

Of course the resolute anti-vaxxers and those who dont fully trust the Rx-Industrial Complex (and even smart, sensible Americans are wary) made worse by this clearly cozy relationship with the Trump Admin, will remain a built-in resistance. Which for the first time is actually a good thing.

Its a good thing that a bulk of anti-vaxxers are also Trumplodites. Its a good thing that there is also a very sizable chunk of them that generally distrust the Govt, and any relationships they form with US Corps - esp. those involving any sort of injections. Injections that many will claim come equipped with a computer chip for tracking, and medication to make us more docile.

Trump has aligned with and now relies on generally  ""out-there"" groups of people, that even their love for him will not trump their long-established other paranoia's. 

See there is a sort of silver-like lining..."
2020-08-03 16:12:28,"Thank you Natalie Dean for writing a comprehensible scientific assessment of vaccine development for Covid-19. A major problem with the development of a vaccine is that this pandemic has been so highly politicized by the current administration in Washington, D.C. They'll be looking for an October surprise, and that's a real pitfall for those seriously working on vaccines. ""Waiting for a better vaccine to come along may seem like torture."" I think you hit upon something with that observation!"
2020-08-03 16:14:22,"I don't believe anything that comes from the Trump administration.  Why would I?  The author is right we have to see the data.

The key for me is the nature and the intensity of the possible unintended consequences of vaccination. Of course I want to be vaccinated and protected from disease. But even if there is a claim from Trump's FDA for moderate efficacy, what about safety.  What am I risking from vaccination?   How many months of follow-up are required to detect a destructive enhancement of the immune system?  Will the cohorts be followed for long enough time periods to be sure about safety?  Trump agencies lie and there will be great pressure for a victory sometime this fall.  I hope there is a way to see the data."
2020-08-03 16:14:55,"If the president suddenly trumpets his new ""China virus"" vaccine days before the election, a majority of Americans will be reluctant to be injected with it. Especially given Trump's previous instructions on hydroxychloroquine and ingesting disinfectant. Seems obvious."
2020-08-03 15:14:17,"I have one simple rule: If Fauci agrees with the FDA recommendation, I'm good. Trump has no power to ""approve"" anything...trust Tony, and trust the FDA: they were there before trump and will be there afterward."
2020-08-03 16:21:50,"I'm pro-vaccine, but I'm weary of anything untested. In the 1950s, my mother and many of her peers were prescribed DES for pregnancy issues. Women in Europe took thalidomide at around the same time. Although the effect of thalidomide was more visible, the ramifications of DES were intergenerational because they caused problems for the children of the mother's who took it. 
I'm lucky. I was able to have children. All DES did to me was create a structural change in my reproductive organs. However, I know several women who were not so lucky. They are childless because they had to have hysterectomies as a result of how DES affected them in the womb.
Although neither DES or thalidomide were administered through vaccine, they point to ramifications of giving trusting patients untested medications. 
I recently shared this with my daughter and her friends - all of child-bearing age. Because of the unknowns, they all agreed that without intensive testing,  the potential risk is too great to get vaccinated with anything offered to them at warp speed."
2020-08-03 16:23:49,I'm no anti-vaxxer. I would love to get vaccinated. But I'm not going to jump into line for something that's rushed into the marketplace.
2020-08-03 16:24:13,"Mostly a very accurate and needed explanation, but I have one concern:  the author states that once a trial subject is given the vaccine or placebo, they are then turned loose to ""lead their normal lives."" In every trial I ever heard of, there was also a strict adherence to medical ethics, such that you can't give subjects anything less than the best available alternative to the experimental drug. You can't withhold an existing treatment even if you expect the experimental drug to be better. In the case of Covid, ethics would dictate that you require adherence to the combination of social distancing, mask-wearing, and hand-washing that are believed to be the best alternatives currently available. This will make it all the harder to get enough infections to get statistical proof of efficacy, and could draw the trials out for many months, or years, as sometimes happens."
2020-08-03 16:24:36,"I other words, no test is conducted to ascertain whether or not a vaccinated person will have an immune mediated side-effect.  The author uses the word ""test"" to describe  the rate of hospitalizations of the subjects.  There is no scientific test conducted at all.  Just an epidemiological study.   That may work out well for the public health.  But it leaves the victim of an adverse reaction without remedy or redress."
2020-08-03 16:27:04,"Want to see what happens when a government runs some special program?  Don't have to look far.  The US and the Vietnam War.  I, for one, don't plan on touching any ""vaccine"" for COVID until it's been tested for at least 3-4 years.  

10,000's of experts with billions of dollars of equipment can't reliably predict the weather 12 hours out.  What we're witnessing is what happens every time some major event occurs.  Politicians, desperate to make sure they get re-elected, making all kinds of promises and decisions to give an illusion of competence to the electorate."
2020-08-03 16:27:49,"Since the demonstration of a safe and effective vaccine before the election would help Trump, we are now, of course, being provided with all sorts of reasons to doubt its efficacy and safety.

So many experts have already disgraced themselves for political points -- it's OK to have mass protests despite Covid if it's for BLM!! -- that we can expect that they will easily be drummed up to disparage any candidate vaccine before Nov 3. 

If Operation Warp Speed does succeed -- and it's looking quite promising now -- why shouldn't Trump be given credit for it? He will have succeeded in pulling off what the expert consensus beforehand had said was impossible -- a safe and effective vaccine in well less than a year. His obsession with remedies will have finally paid off.

Does anybody believe that Joe Biden -- who, so far as I can tell, has never organized anything important or fast, and is nothing more than a vessel for consensus -- would ever have been able to do the like?"
2020-08-03 16:28:46,"Not interest in being a ""lab rat"". I'll wait until a million people have been inoculated before I feel comfortable getting it. Until then I'll wear the mask and avoid crowds."
2020-08-03 16:34:44,"It can be argued that an initial vaccine that is ""good enough,"" (but not necessarily the best possible) is worth releasing and using as soon as it is available. Improved vaccines can be administered once they are available. With thousands dying daily, some protection is better than none."
2020-08-03 16:39:45,"I'd be hesitant to take the vaccine because Trump is demanding that one be available before the election for purely political reasons.   Trump does not care whether it is effective or safe as long as he can claim the he was the one who ""saved the world."""
2020-08-03 16:45:18,The Pandemic will have run it’s course before there is a safe effective vaccine for Covid19. Why would we think that suddenly the timeline for development and testing of a Vaccine can be so dramatically reduced?
2020-08-03 16:45:48,"Could someone please explain how these phase 3 trials will work?  All these volunteers will be in areas where there is a high level of virus, but will they be masked and socially distanced?  If yes, then how is that a trial?  And if they are unmasked and not socially distanced then who will go near them?  Frankly although challenge trials are considered risky and somewhat unethical, I don't know how else you can possibly evaluate the efficacy for a vaccine.  And the rush to get this vaccine will then completely ignore any side effects that take more than a few weeks to show up."
2020-08-03 16:49:51,"Important to note is that scientific conclusions involve levels of confidence, rather than binary ""it works"" or ""it doesn't"". We are fortunate that the author is introducing the necessary level of nuance to the discussion. Scientific skepticism is not an impediment to our desired outcome; it's the one and only thing standing between us and a whole new level of pain. So, it's absolutely imperative we push back against the pressure to cut corners."
2020-08-03 16:50:27,"I totally agree with Dr. Dean. Developing a vaccine isn't easy nor it is quick. The data will tell us but we cannot let Trump rush anything because he wants a win. It isn't like that and all legitimate companies know it is difficult to develop and test the vaccine but also all of the manufacturing steps and quality control steps to get a product out. You cannot rush everything. Some things take time and safety should be number 1 on the hit list, not Trump's need for anything."
2020-08-03 16:53:48,"This Op-Ed is right on point.

A rush to approve a 50% effective vaccine would be a disaster in so many ways.  It would likely stop testing of vaccines that might be 98% effective -- those are the vaccines that would really re-open society.

And we don't even know the indicia of immunity from COVID-19.  Is it antibodies?  T-Cells?  

And watch out for the shiny new toys --- subunit vaccines, recombinent vaccines, rDNA vaccines -- that look good in the lab but rarely prove out.  And even when they do get licensed, often turn out to be less effective than older, cruder vaccines (compare the current acellular pertussis vaccine with the old whole-cell vaccine -- society traded lifetime protection for 5 years of protection)"

Brought a drug to market,  it’s CEO is now Trumps science advisor, the vaccine their developing uses new  technology not  yet proven safe.  There are concerns  that the mRNA vaccine may cause autoimmune disorders long term.(an article in the Independent)"
2020-08-03 16:56:36,I'm fine with only a 50% efficacy rate (but would like much higher)...but am very concerned about possible side effects with no long term studies...I would be wary of any rushed vaccine when you didn't  know about possible adverse reactions coming months after the initial vaccine...
2020-08-03 16:59:00,"Yes, a vaccine needs to be politicized.

We bemoan no money invested in research. That was the argument 4 months ago. We have blank checks for research now. Trump is throwing billions at Kodak, for example.

Now, we bemoan that the vaccine may be politicized and pushed too fast.

The real fear? Trump actually manages it by October and Democrats can't have that - so keep the COVID fun happening (NYT 10-k yearly filing says COVID is very important to its success, right there on Edgar SEC filing page). 

So which goal post gets moved next? Next we'll have 'I'm an immunologist and this vaccine isn't good' and why.

It never ends."
2020-08-03 16:59:02,"THANK YOU!  I worked in various departments of a mid-sized pharmaceutical company for 15 years. Knowing what it usually takes to get an NDE approved, you expressed my concerns over a possible vaccine perfectly.  Remember the Fen-Fen debacle which occurred after both drugs had gone through extensive testing? I’m over 65 with underlying health issues. I will get my flu shot this year, and continue wearing a mask and social distancing. But I will probably wait at least 6 months after approval and it comes to market  before I will even consider getting vaccinated."
2020-08-03 17:00:32,"What concerns me, which is unaddressed in this column, is the long-term effects of a vaccine. We will not discover the long-term effects in six months of Phase III trials. We will not discover the long-term effects in a year. 

I am skeptical of the rush to create a vaccine, and doubtful that I'll be willing to risk my life to take any vaccine that hasn't been shown to be harmless long-term."
2020-08-03 17:00:48,"I get a flu shot every year. I am not against vaccines. And I desperately want a safe and effective vaccine against Covid-19 so we can get back to normal life or at least get closer to normal life. But there are so many unanswered questions about this disease. We don't know how long naturally acquired immunity might last. We've seen fatalities due to what appears to be an overreaction of the immune system. We've seen wildly different outcomes (from no symptoms at all to death) in different people who have contracted the disease. There are still a lot of unanswered questions about the disease itself. And if vaccines are tested in younger, healthier adults, will they be safe for older people or for children or for people with pre-existing conditions? Will side effects be apparent at once or might they arise months later? On top of all of that, we have an administration we definitely cannot trust that has a clear incentive to rush out a vaccine. I hope that reputable medical authorities will band together to sound the alarm against any questionable vaccine! Until we have a safe vaccine we need to wear masks, wash our hands frequently, and practice social distancing."
2020-08-03 17:02:06,"This is a very sobering article.

A 70% effective vaccine is not good enough for me to change my behavior, as a member of three high risk groups. Of course I would take it--but the risk is still too great to change mask wearing or risk avoidance--or drop a major public health effort.

70% would keep me out of restaurants, concerts, and public transportation like airlines or cruise ships until proof that the risk is near zero based on a continuing public health program of testing and tracking with quarantining. 

If 70% effectiveness resulted in public behavior reverting to pre-pandemic behavior without a sustained public health effort, my personal safety could well become lower than it is today.

A 70% vaccine is clearly a big help in achieving control of the virus--but only if public health measures continue based on new cases and rigorous testing. It is not a panacea allowing us to go back to our earlier behaviors. 

99% plus protection would be needed to drop the aggressive public health programs--or proof that there are no longer enough active cases to be a risk higher than ordinary risks like getting into a major injury car wreck. Lower level efficiency vaccines appear useful as tools in the public health virus suppression activity--but if used to justify ""return"" without proof the virus is fully suppressed could prolong, rather than shorten, our pandemic crisis."
2020-08-03 17:04:15,"I'm just reading a book call 'Vaccinated' by Paul Offit, about Maurice Hillman, who developed 8 vaccines, and should be a household name. He was obsessed with ensuring that the vaccines he developed did not cause cancers or have other bad side effects.

What are the risks associated with the current methods of vaccine development?  And are we taking any shortcuts on safety? And if so, how do we evaluate safety? 

And how do we trust a government to give us the straight goods on a Covid vaccine when the head of that government says the treatment should be:

The childish resistance to straightforward pandemic precautions speaks volumes about the current state of American character."
2020-08-03 17:14:50,"I don't know anyone who doesn't want a safe vaccine ASAP. But labelling its development ""Operation Warp Speed"" was both on-brand for Trump, and inevitably counterproductive.  
He consistently emphasizes speed as a central feature in his sales strategy, bragging that everything he does happens ""faster than anyone thought possible."" (Who exactly are these people he imagines – or projects - as continually astounded by his deftness?)
Dr. Fauci and other credible authorities tell us that development is indeed happening at a relatively rapid pace, due to advanced technology. This is of course great news - we’re all holding our collective breath. But sadly, I fear that Trump attaching his usual TV-blockbuster branding can only backfire when a vaccine is finally available. Even if approved by true experts, his continual emphasis on speed over safety may undercut the trust needed to maximize vaccination."
2020-08-03 17:15:08,"I would only take the vaccine when:

1.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel says it is safe;

2. There is an independent peer review by a group of well respected vaccine scientists, virologists and bio-statisticians regarded as the experts by the scientific community;

Any October announcement of a vaccine will be ""fake news""."
2020-08-03 17:15:11,I am person who not only has to take it as a HCW but also recommend it to my patients. Here is the problem with the new mRNA vaccine. The vaccine is telling our body to make spike proteins  similar to the ones the virus makes. Our body will make them. Our immune should recognize them and produce antibodies to neutralize them. Three issues - if the immune systems fails to recognize these spike proteins what happens to them? Secondly what if there are other proteins in our bodies which are nearly similar to spike proteins? Wouldn't the immune attack those similar looking normal proteins causing an autoimmune disease? Lastly it is well known with Covid that a major harm occurs because of an exaggerated immune response (cytokine storm). Would such a response occur in vaccinated individuals who are exposed to the virus ( the column addresses this issue). Here in NYC where the rates are low I would have been more comfortable taking if it were available in October. However when the second wave occurs would I take it in the middle of it? Definitely will take my flu vaccine. That is my answer for now.

2020-08-03 15:44:49,"The primary concerns in developing a vaccine are efficacy/efficiency and safety. These are totally absent in the Trump administration's hunt for a CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine.

His first priority is to use the rushed creation of a vaccine as a re-election prop. His second appears to be to give a gigantic financial windfall to one favored company that produces the vaccine and retains rights to make money from it. His third concern is to have the United States in control and ownership of a vaccine to use to coerce other nations into accepting Trump's political and personal demands. In the case of one promising candidate being developed in Switzerland, the Trump administration offered the Swiss pharmaceutical company a billion dollars for the US to secure EXCLUSIVE rights. He wants to weaponize a vaccine.

For a world-wide pandemic, all countries should have equal access to a vaccine. And all research on vaccines should be shared among all researchers in all nations without regard to proprietary patents. Vaccines should also be free - financed by all governments and not just agents of massive profit and a company's stock spikes.

Nowhere does Trump give consideration for the safety of a vaccine or the effectiveness of a vaccine in his rush to get one out before the election. The danger of rushing any medicine into production before proper testing can be performed and completed can be summed up in one word:

""Thalidomide."""

This group is distinct from probably the majority of the population, who understand the utility of a safe and effective vaccine but worry about the corruption of the development and regulatory processes by political pressure. With the President's record on scientific and medical affairs, this is completely understandable. The solution is jto demand the established review process, which ensures *public* review by career government scientists and independent academics. This includes publication of the clinical trial designs (and, eventually, data) at www.clinicaltrials.gov and other public registries, publication of the trial data in peer reviewed journals (typically, Lancet or New England Journal of Medicine), public discussion of FDA's review findings in the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) and publication of FDA's discipline review reports (at <a href=""https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm"" target=""_blank"">https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm</a>).

3. Short cuts are a bad idea. Challenge trials are inherently unethical, for the simple reason that you end up pressuring vulnerable people into being guinea pigs, and because we have perfectly-good ways of controlling the spread of this virus until there’s time for a solid vaccine. And by the way, I have yet to see their advocates stepping up. 

I will certainly take a vaccine, first chance I get after I see decent clinical trials that let me assess efficacy vs. risk, and my doc says go git it. Note that while I certainly intend to do a bit of research, my doc makes the call. I trust him, he’s a pro and I am not.

But trump, his administration, his republican enablers, and the sate-run media, have demonstrated an unprecedented shamelessness in lying to the American public.

He is an easy mark for foreign governments (middle eastern potentates - 666 5th Avenue), Chinese, and others to loot the US, both financially and morally.

He also has some amount of control over the agencies that regulate vaccines (and will likely pressure them to cut corners to get a vaccine approved).

I'm wondering if you attended his funeral since you two are primarily responsible for his death and the death of who know how many more as Oklahoma has now, once again, achieved #1 status of new cases per capita.
Masks?   LOL   Even when the Gov. himself gets COVID he still won't mandate masks because his  don, Stitt's con, won't mumble in approval.
This Country and this State used to have actual politicians.  The GOP has replaced that concept with actual citizen killing idiots.

Note that it isn’t “conservative”.  

Most therapeutics development programs are complex of necessity and involve years to reach a finished report.

The Biological License Application (BLA) submitted to the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) for review and possible approval, is a large collection of many study reports plus summaries of what the “sponsor” perceives them to mean.

The CBER reviewers of all this material (clinical, toxicology, formulation, statistical) have to scrutinize the material closely and make ask the sponsor to perform additional analyses or grouping of data.  

If a BLA is deemed approvable otherwise, CBER has to approve the labeling that the sponsor proposes.  Since the terms of the labeling guides the potential extent of use of the vaccine and the PROFITS to the company, the sponsor’s proposed labeling will seek the BROADEST indication.

CBER may not accept the initial labeling and await revised labeling that it judges better reflects the efficacy and safety database in different patient groups.

Typically, vaccine approval has taken years.

The current goal seems arbitrary, capricious, wrongheaded and downright hazardous to me.

The two boil down in in vitro/in vivo. 

The first (it literally means “in glass,” but in practice it means, “in the lab”) you get people into an actual lab or hospital where you can control the circumstances (AKA, “limit the variables”), you run the experiment (in this case, you give them the vaccine), and then you see what happens. 

Problem is, it takes forever, and you still have to test tens of thousands. Also, it’s not realistic: people don’t live in a hospital or a lab.

So, Type 2: in vivo (“in life”). You look at a big, big group out there in the real world, and kind of let life run your experiment for you. That’s why, famously, so much medical knowledge gets gained during wars. You let the randomness of having bullets and chunks of steel whizzing around inflict a lot of different tyoes of injuries; it’s why we’re pretty sure that schizophrenia has a genetic link...thanks, Denmark! 

So, you figure out how many of what types of people you need for a meaningful study, you innoculate half and give saline to half, you set ‘em free, you have them all run around like people do, and you monitor the heck out of what they do and see what happens. 

Big note: it’s impossible to test everybody for everything forever and get anywhere. Sorry, but you’re not looking for an impossible absolute certainty.

Trump has shown repeatedly he doesn't care how many people die as long as he has power.  Being in Trump's world is shameful at best, dangerous at its worst."
2020-08-03 17:38:52,Do you think it's possible the main reason Russia is rushing to roll out a vaccine in OCTOBER is to communicate to Trump that he needs to do the same thing here to get his October Surprise?
2020-08-03 17:41:03,"Scientists are working on a vaccine for corona virus, and Trump is spending whatever it takes in the hope that a vaccine will appear the week before the election. All will be forgiven, and he will be re-elected in a landslide. 

All I can say to that is I’m happy that I live in the New York State, and we have Andrew Cuomo.  He’s the only one who has risen to the occasion and actually taken on this monster, the only one.  Oh, I know the Times feels a great need to point out that Cuomo and DiBlasio didn’t realize what they had in the very beginning. Who did? Not the New York Times, by the way. If every state did what we did, we would be light years ahead of where we are.  And notice I say, “we.” That’s because Cuomo motivated us with facts and respect to do the right thing.  We all had to do it, and we did do it.  We’re still doing it.  He knew he couldn’t do it alone. We all know people who looked forward to his daily reassurance on tv.  I am one of them. We continue to see glimpses of his personal side, his love of his family, his somewhat corny sense of humor, his tough defense of New York in dealings with Trump, his personal pain at the enormous loss of human life. With Andrew Cuomo, what you see is what you get. A leader, tough enough to be govern New York, willing to PERFORM in a crisis, a guy who expects you to perform too.  And we do."
2020-08-03 17:22:16,The author's insistence on high standards sounds rather like the public health community's initial sniffing that most masks really weren't nearly good enough.  Should we all have waited for the availability of N95 masks?
2020-08-03 17:46:05,"The underlying issue is trust.

Let's say Trump makes a major announcement this Fall that a great vaccine is available and encourages people to get it.  Dems yawn ""yeah right"".  Tumpers yawn ""No government injection for me, covid's a hoax"". The pandemic rages on in the US.

The scientists working on vaccines need to be allowed to do their job, free of political meddling.  

The results of level 3 trials of vaccine that make it that far need to be reviewed by panels of experts, panels that are free from lobbyists and political operatives.  Identifying such panels is unnecessarily much harder than it was 4 years ago unfortunately.

Best case - we vote for a political reset in Nov and by the end of 2021 enough Americans are vaccinated by an effective Corona virus vaccine to finally end the pandemic in the US.  I can't think about the worst case."
2020-08-03 17:47:29,"If, before the election, Trump was faced with the decision to roll out a vaccine that might not work and might even kill half of all Americans within a year, but in the short-term, the roll-out of that vaccine might help him get reelected, does anyone think he would choose not to deploy it?

Anyone?"
2020-08-03 17:50:46,"Trump could easily claim a vaccine miracle today, but the brilliance behind an October Surprise is that nationwide data regarding the safety and efficacy of the vaccine won't be ready until after the election."
2020-08-03 17:46:56,"""We can’t afford to jeopardize the public’s health and hard-earned trust by approving anything short of that.""

Really?

What hard earned trust are you speaking of?  

If the science community had any 'Hard Earned Trust' vaccination rates would be steady or rising.  Instead, because of doubt, poor public communication skills, numerous predictions that have failed & the list goes on, a growing number of people simple do not trust science or even understand it.

After reading this opinion piece, I am wondering what generation of vaccines is causing worry?  1st generation like the one Dr. Edward Jenner created?  2nd generation like the one Dr. Salk created. 3rd generation like the quadrivalent vaccine that was developed?  4th generation like the Trivalent type vaccines?  

What is being developed now?  Gen 5 or Gen 6 vaccines that could very well be far safer than previous vaccine gens? 

Is the author concerned that 40 to 60% of uninfected people have CD4+ T cells that appear to already recognize the new Covid-19 and thus skewering vaccination trial data?

In my opinion, the only thing that the 'opinion piece' accomplished is to cast even more doubt to the ""Hard Earned Public Trust"" and add ammunition to the Anti-Vaxxers mis-information campaigns!"
2020-08-03 17:47:27,My concern is the vaccine is being used by BOTH parties for political reasons. Republicans need it before November and Democrats want Joe Biden to be the COVID dragon slayer.
2020-08-03 17:47:56,"The term ""warp speed"" being applied to vaccine development is a totally insane idea! But of course that describes this whole administration. Biden and his VP will have their hands full recovering from Trump!"
2020-08-03 17:49:55,It's insanity. A administration that pushes Hydroxi wherever it is- to Jared naming a Vaccine race after a sci-fy show -now we are putting our hopes on a guaranteed vaccine to roll out 2 weeks before the election with zero efficacy and to get elected. How can anybody trust anything our government is doing on this?
2020-08-03 17:53:37,"I am a scientist. I am a vaccine advocate. I am an educator. 

But I also have read over 20,000 lies that Trump has told, witnessed Kushner’s leadership failures in almost every area, studied the grifting and corruption in this administration, followed the dismantling, politicization and muzzling of scientists at the CDC and have seen Trump as he prioritized his own political interests over American lives. 

So there is NO WAY I am going to take a vaccine produced by friends and business associates of Trump and Kushner when that company is not following guidelines, is fast tracking the testing and has no proven track record. 

Bottom line. I do not trust Trump when it comes to my family’s health."
2020-08-03 18:00:05,"Will any of these pharma companies, or the government, or health insurance companies be liable for covering medical costs of inevitable bad reactions to the vaccines?"
2020-08-03 18:06:30,"Thank you Dr. Dean for being so articulate in your wariness about the rush to develop a vaccine for Covid-19. By no means am I an anti-vaxer; I have a very stressed immune system thanks to two bouts with leukemia followed shortly after the second by a bad case of Lyme disease. I am on board with getting the vaccines (flu, pneumonia, shingles, etc) for all of those things that my physicians have recommended because are imperative for the maintenance of my health. Ironically, though, on the drive to work this morning, I said to my coworker who rides with me everyday, ""I'm just not sure if I would want to be one of the first or even second round of folks who get a vaccine."" 

In part, my wariness stems from just the issues you discuss here; and I agree, ""We must resist the desire to rush out a product."" But even more so, I am very wary about anything that has any sort of link to the current administration in the White House and its agenda to get a vaccine approved by October, as another article in today's Times reported on. It is very clear that actual lives of working Americans occupy a very low position on this administration's list of priorities, and I feel that I have made more than enough sacrifices already to trust any more of my well-being to this crew in D.C. So (and I never thought I would say this) I think I'll take my chances and choose to wait  for something safe rather than risk becoming another statistic that they can just brush aside. Thank you again."
2020-08-03 18:03:53,I don't want Trump's Warp Vaccine.
2020-08-03 18:07:26,"The term warp speed could only come from the warped brain of a fraudulent salesman like Donald Trump.  The term  has great appeal to Trump's undereducated masses.  Quick solution to a very complicated problem.  And how convenient it will be ready right after the election.  You could weep at the gullibility of his followers that line up to give him a second term and pull the entire country over a cliff.  

The only thing I wish could proceed at warp speed is Trump's defeat."
2020-08-03 18:12:16,"trump is following Putin's cynical approach to releasing a vaccine- lower standards. If Americans faced the dreadful healthcare system now available to Russians they'd revolt!
There is absolutely no way all Americans will take a vaccine that has any cloud of doubt over it- surely not if we all know the main reason to rush and risk it is to give Trump an election boost.
US standards for medication, food, air and water should be the pride of our nation. It distinguishes us from banana republics and failed states.
Now Trump wants to degrade our excellence...horrible."
2020-08-03 18:08:45,"Sadly its all politics isn't it ? 

Since its Trump pushing the vaccine and Operation Warp Speed its all bad and un-trustworthy now. Does everything have to seen through a partisan lens ??"
2020-08-03 18:11:47,No Trump Re-election Vaccine for me. I  do wish though that our body politic could be vaccinated against the 40% who put Trump in office and want to keep him there.
2020-08-03 18:17:51,"I would like to point out the difficulty of evaluating vaccine safety when it comes to an individual's personal risk.  Early vaccines developed for rotavirus infections, a significant cause of gastrointestinal illness in infants and children, had a side effect called Intussusception, ""a condition in which one segment of intestine ""telescopes"" inside of another, causing an intestinal obstruction (blockage)"" (passage in quotes from: my.clevelandclinic.org). This effect occurred at about 1 in 10,000 vaccine recipients.  This was enough to kill this vaccine in the economically developed countries, while children in developing countries where the disease is much more frequent and lethal were unable to receive this vaccine. Hundreds of thousands or more infants likely became sick with a significant number of preventable deaths.  Similarly, in individuals over 60 there are two rare side effects from the yellow fever vaccine being injected for the first time, which is recommended if traveling to a country with this disease. It is estimated there are 2.2 cases for every 100,000 doses leading to vaccine associated neurologic disease and 1.2 cases for every 100,000 doses for vaccine associated viscerotropic (acute multiple organ system failure, often fatal) disease. Yet these rare occurrences are often sufficient for those over 60 to decline taking this vaccine.  I declined. How will we get large scale acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines  if these concerns over low risk are not addressed?"
2020-08-03 18:17:54,"I agree with the concern.  The question is - when was the last time we faced such a highly contagious without physical contact, deadly, and widespread (regardless of what people may think about what Trump failed to do this was going to get widespread at a level high enough that a vaccine is critical to managing it) virus that the methods we currently have in place to get a vaccine approved had to fit to the scenario?  I cannot recall one in my lifetime of 60 plus years. Do the rules need to be different at some level because the ongoing cost in lives and to the economy is so much more than the potential cost of having a vaccine that has more negative risks than we would normally allow?  Smarter people than me have to make that call."
2020-08-03 18:18:20,The NYT article points out that drug companies may help prevent a premature release of a vaccine because they understand that they could suffer tremendously if one of their vaccines causes a lot of harmful side effects. Let's hope.
2020-08-03 18:18:24,"Yep, but that is America,  ""quick fixes"" for everything, much like drug advertising in which the pharmaceutical companies spend BILLIONS every year claiming fixes to any and all medical issues, while very quickly running through the myriad of side effects from the drug that are often worse than the actual disease."
2020-08-03 18:19:29,"It would be helpful if Professor Dean would share her thoughts on some statistics for existing vaccines, in terms of how long it took to develop them.

My understanding is that the best case has been around 4 years while the average is 10 years.

Given this history, operation ""warp speed"" is indeed warped."
2020-08-03 18:16:04,#OnlyIfFauciApproved  is my mantra.
2020-08-03 18:20:39,"If a better vaccine comes out to replace a less effective one, people can be revaccinated. That’s what happened with the shingles vaccine. I was vaccinated for that with 2 different vaccines."
2020-08-03 18:23:58,"I would agree that preparing to produce and distribution the vaccines which prove to effective will greatly shorten the time until vaccine generated immunity can stem the pandemic, and allow us all to get back to normal life. So the efforts to expedite the process of developing and perfecting vaccines is justified. 

However, the odds that any of them will work cannot be determined. That means that the payoff from awarding contracts for as yet to exist vaccines is entirely irrational, it's like taking shots in the dark. The risks cannot be determined because we have no data about it. While we have vaccines for viruses, we have vaccines which produce immunity but ruin the health of the recipients, we have vaccines which seem to produce immunity but actually don't do so effectively to prevent reinfections in a short time. 

We have to wait and see what happens, and expect that the costs and effectiveness of this effort is hoped not rationally determined. We will know when the outcomes have been well understood, and not before."
2020-08-03 18:24:28,"By the way, FDA have hydroxy emergency approval because the drug was judged to be relatively harmless and at the time, there weren’t really any drugs that seemed to work and a study or two that said maybe.

It was kinda a, “low risk, whatthell let’s try it,” deal. I’m sure there was some pressure, Trump being Trump, but that’s a pretty reasonable call.

The approval was subsequently revoked."
2020-08-03 18:24:55,"I work with many doctors in biomedical engineering projects. None is ""anti-vaxxer"", but none will be getting a COVID-19 vaccine without years of solid testing and trials, and full data transparency. Trump's ""warp speed"" talk is a symptom of a broader problem: a reckless push by many vested interests in politics, the media (esp. financial press), Big Pharma and industry to rush out an unproven vaccine for profits and the stock market, with public health as collateral damage.  

Vaccines historically take at least a decade since they're given to billions of healthy people, and there are too many unknown variables of biology to anticipate without years of aggregate data. Previous rushed vaccine efforts have led to disaster, ex. the 2009 H1N1 vaccine that caused narcolepsy in many recipients, the 1976 swine flu debacle, RSV and dengue vaccines that made infections worse (antibody-dependent enhancement), and the calamitous near-vaccine for HIV in the 1990's that recombined to cause AIDS itself, a prospect no one anticipated initially. 

Moderna and the Oxford vaccine developers are already raising red flags. Moderna has been cagey about its data (eventually showing nasty side effects), preferring press releases that fuel pump-and-dump schemes, while the Oxford team has been downplaying systemic, severe inoculation reactions indicative of autoimmunity (requiring multi-dose acetaminophen) as ""minor issues"" while overstating the relatively weak immune response. Sorry, but I'll pass."
2020-08-03 18:28:06,"I look forward to the benefits of natural selection on the vaccination issue.   Democrats afraid of Trump political pressure on the CDC, NIH and FDA I will prevent many extremist liberals from getting vaccinated.  At the same time, extremist anti government conservatives including the anti-vacc crowd, will also avoid it.  So the normal curve  group of moderate political beliefs will get vaccinated and more of their gene pool will survive.   More importantly, these are the same people who think more logically and willing to make rational trade-offs in every day life.   While I mourn the unexpected and even the more numerous accelerated deaths CoVid 19 created, it may result in a more livable society in the long run."
2020-08-03 18:19:55,"The other day I saw a TV interview with Dr. Marty Makary of Johns Hopkins* and he made a point that I've been considering for some time.  His point was that researchers and practitioners face different sets of challenges.  In an emergency (is a 33% drop in GDP** an emergency?) a strong argument can be made that practitioners must be given a larger voice in evaluating and applying treatments.

It's simple: people are dying and a generation's worth of prosperity is lost.  We are stuck because as a nation we've forgotten how to hold two contradictory thoughts in mind at the same time.  The right course just might be to temporarily modify some aspects of drug research and place more trust in practitioners to make these emergency decisions.

Researchers seem fearful that if their processes are restricted even once, they will never again be allowed to conduct a randomized control trial.  They might be right and that is 70% the fault of the media.  Instead of stirring up controversy for the sake of circulation, the media could be plainly and consistently explaining these conflicting processes, demands, perils, and costs to the American people. Politicians get the other 30%.

If Kaiser is willing to give me the vaccine, I'll get in line and take it.

2020-08-03 18:33:33,"Such an important opinion piece and about time we hear about the appropriate cautions regarding rushing a vaccine to market.  One more thing---if studies like the Moderna vaccine trial say they will have data in 3 months what kind of data other than antibody response could they really have?  First of all wouldn't that assume all 30,000 people were injected on day 1?  Also, if the vaccine protected for 3 months how do we know it would work for longer?  How would we know whether we would need boosters every few months or even if they would work.  So many questions.  It makes me wonder why we are putting all of our eggs in the vaccine basket.  Why do we not hear daily reports of new drug therapies to treat and even cure the disease?  Other than remdesevir the industry has been awfully quiet about that."

Much as the GOP elevates religion as important to a has-been, hedonistic reality-show host, or 'thoughts and prayers' in regards to gun violence instead of realistic public health policies, the GOP is bloated on hypocrisy and disinformation.  This Administration (and its enabling Republican governors) doesn't even want you to know how many Americans are actually sick, by diverting or not reporting the data.

If we were approaching an election with this pandemic and we had a normal president, I would be a little bit more reticent.  Even a normal president might lean on the FDA and others to get a less than ship shape vaccine out quickly.

We have malignant narcissist as president.  His depravity knows no limit.  He appears to corrupt everything and everybody around him.  And he has, so far, found no limit of sycophants ready to do his corrupt bidding.  Trump has been remarkably successful at destroying the integrity of many elements of our government - the Senate GOP, the upper echelons of the Department of Justice, parts of the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security come to mind immediately.  I think it probable that he will find some means of getting distributed a less than fully vetted vaccine before November 3.  Whether people will take it is another matter.  I will not.

""The speed of the trials depends on how quickly we can detect a difference between the two groups. If two vaccinated people became sick versus 10 who got a placebo, it could be because of chance. But if it were 20 compared to 100, we would feel much more confident that the vaccine was working.""

Is a bit vague, as, I believe, the ""n"" - total numbers of patients in the trial is needed to determine statistical significance, not just ratios.  At this somewhat chaotic time, clarity and precision are paramount.  Just sayin'"
2020-08-03 20:26:02,"Ultimately, it's the same issue as wanting to reopen to ""save the economy."" You can reopen, but as long as the virus is raging, the people won't spend. 
Same with the vaccine. You can rubber stamp a vaccine, but unless the data and independent approvals are there, the people won't get it. 
With both issues, Trump has it backwards. You need a real thing to get a real effect."

2020-08-03 20:28:21,"""The Right Way to Get a Vaccine at ‘Warp Speed’.""

If one truly has the public's health in mind, one never tries to get a vaccine quickly.  Rather, one tries to produce a vaccine by following time-proven standards of the pharma industry in that area, with as much care as necessary to ensure that the final product is both effective and safe, with absolutely no dangerous side effects. Of course, if there are short-cuts that do not impact vaccine's efficacy and safety, one would take them.

But if one views producing a vaccine as a political tool to be used for regaining one's public support in an up-coming election, then one wants to produce it at ""warp speed."" 

The plan then will be one of setting the stage for a big spectacle, announcing availability of a ""wonder vaccine"" just a week ahead of the election day, before anyone could verify its efficacy, its safety, or even its actual existence. All one needs is someone who has some credibility with the public - could that be Dr. Birx? - confirming that the vaccine has been produced."
2020-08-03 20:33:44,"Flu vaccines are just about useless. The broccoli type head on this coronovirus 19, is not so easy to match up. We can do the stalk all day long, but that other part is a bit tricky. From talking to people in the field, I don't see how it could get done that quickly without some prior knowledge of the original pathogen. I don't trust the pharmecutical corporations as far as I can throw them. I'm not sure I trust the CDC so much either. The CDC is in ""partnership"" with the corporations? What could go wrong? A little bit of conflict of interest there? with workers at the CDC getting rewards for developing patents? How is this ok? It's on the website."
2020-08-03 20:35:17,"Most of us won't be at the head of the line anyway...won't have a choice but to wait and see.  I'm looking to front line doctors and nurses, first responders and, of course, MLB to let me know."
2020-08-03 20:39:08,"The WHO was very slow to recognize that Covid-19 is spread through aerosolized droplets and failed to recommend masks early on despite much evidence that masks were effective at preventing infection. So my gold standard is the EU. Once they have approved a vaccine, that is the one I will sign onto."
2020-08-03 20:46:54,"Until we have a vaccine, the full capacity of global work, exchanges, transactions is on hold to a greater or lesser degrees.  There is no comparison to the reality of America today and the world at large with the 1918 pandemic-we live & share a completely different planet than over 100 years ago."
2020-08-03 20:47:48,"Perhaps a professor of biostatistics can reasonably analyze evidence for a vaccine. On such a complex subject the great majority of us aren't qualified to actually judge evidence. I'm immunosuppressed and I plan to trust the majority opinion of the medical establishment filtered through my personal doctors, not because they are perfectly knowledgeable, but because this is the best source I have. Also, these docs and their institutional wisdom have gotten me through a lot of medical challenges to date."
2020-08-03 21:03:26,"While I appreciate the counsel, this has become a problem that's bigger than just vaccines. Being anti-science as a partisan act of faith renders everything except death and gravity a partisan ploy.  Remember how well polio vaccinations worked? That sort of faith in science doesn't exist anymore."
2020-08-03 21:04:17,"The best vaccine is to follow the distancing guidelines and otherwise stay home. 

Is it really so tough for one summer to stay home and find things to do where you live?  It could be a nice change and you will lessen your environmental footprint."
2020-08-03 21:05:04,"""This is how Phase III trials work: Thousands of healthy adult volunteers are randomized to receive either a new Covid-19 vaccine or a control — a placebo or an already licensed vaccine for another disease.""

Why in the world would you use another vaccine in place of a placebo? I would be much more trusting of the forthcoming vaccine if I knew side effects weren't being ignored because they were also caused by the other vaccine used instead of a placebo."
2020-08-03 21:07:35,"I have seen many articles about this but none have approached the fundamental issue: How can any parent give a vaccine to their child that has not undergone long-term study? The broad argument of ""ethics"" or ""public health"" doesn't land for individuals who are asked to ""trust"" data that truly doesn't exist and won't for 10 more years. 

I don't know why journalists aren't asking this question or, what's more, asking it and pushing for more than the stock answer of ""trust us."" 

Medical experts are still trying to piece together the clinical picture of COVID, and they have changed their recommendations many times, based on new information. That whiplash has led to mistrust. And it underlines the reluctance many now have when confronted with giving loved ones a vaccine that is deemed ""safe"" by those same experts. I realize that data changes those recommendations, but pretending it doesn't affect perception/trust is a kind of denial. 

I'm not a Trump supporter or anti-vaccer—I and my kids have all the time-tested vaccines. But until doctors can speak honestly about the limitations/science—and not be paternalistic about it—there will be a large number of people who remain skeptical."
2020-08-03 21:11:02,"Thank you for this article. Great info.

I especially agree to the following quote:

""We must resist the desire to rush out a product . . . Researchers and the government should also commit to transparency so that people can see the results for themselves to understand the regulatory decisions.""

The issue is Trump administration, which has lied so much that their trust level is long gone. It's hard to trust what they say, especially when it comes to our own health. So, we need to be confident in the independence of the Medical experts who develop these vaccines."
2020-08-03 21:11:34,"The rules here should be simple. Each state in the Union has some set of mandates regarding what people there can do or not do (face mask wearing, large crowds, etc.). These mandates should remain in effect until all persons are vaccinated and feel safe with a vaccine. However, those who have been vaccinated no longer need to abide by those mandates and they are free to do as they have previously. This way no one id forced to do anything, but those who feel the vaccine(s) is unsafe don't have to become inoculated. They just need to continue living by the rules we have in place today for all of us."
2020-08-03 21:15:40,"One approach to testing vaccines is so called ""challenge"" studies. They are different in that subjects are purposely infected after vaccination to see if the vaccine triggers an adequate immune response that prevents illness and propagation of the virus. However they do raise some bioethics concerns because you are intentionally giving someone a pathogen for the purpose of answering a scientific question that might not be relevant to the subject of they are otherwise in good health. These data can be very useful in speeding up vaccine testing and providing greater levels of confidence. I'd be interested to know if the government and research institutions will authorize it, in the case where subjects consent to it."
2020-08-03 21:18:44,"Being a statistician, I  feel the same way you do.  But not only must the vaccine be tested enough on healthy subjects and controls, it must be tested for people in my risk group for safety and efficacy. I am over 70, have controlled diabetes and high blood pressure. (It is not even known whether these illnesses are risk factors when controlled by medication!) i also was hospitalized for an episode of ARDS in 209, spending  days in intensive care and 10 in the hospital. I am very much at risk for death if I get the virus. What about the vaccine? That can only be known when the vaccine is tested on large groups, then old people."
2020-08-03 21:20:24,"Even if Phase III trials show promise, there won't be any long-range studies on the safety of the vaccine.  My concern would be symptoms or side-effects showing up months or years down the road.  I would appreciate your addressing this issue."
2020-08-03 21:26:24,"It's premature to start talking about a vaccine that doesn't exist.  Until it is developed we can't begin to discuss efficacy, side effects, cost, and other pertinent issues.  Dangerous to assume anything about a vaccine at this point, or to start relying on it."
2020-08-03 21:28:54,"The evaluation that should be done is weighing the risk of the vaccine against the risk of covid. Ms Dean did not supply such an assessment, nor has anyone else."
2020-08-03 21:36:35,"What liability protections do these companies get for their vaccines, under project warp speed? 

The companies must have the same legal cover as other drugs that they make. That will make them responsible and accountable to test their products enough and ensure safety before they bring it to the market.

And I think that will remove political biases and attract greater confidence from the public."
2020-08-03 21:38:04,"I don't understand this article. We aren't in Russia, where they are about to approve a vaccine - they are still in development. So why a preemptive article to say you wouldn't take the vaccine that doesn't exist yet? 

When one is approved, that's when you can evaluate the actual results from a real, not a strawman, vaccine."
2020-08-03 21:46:29,"I have commented on many a vaccine-related op-ed piece labeling anti-vaxxers as anti-science and morally irresponsible. But even I, having grown accustom to living a monk's existence during this pandemic, don't feel that I need to rush into taking Release 1.0 of some vaccine whose efficacy and long-range side-effects may be a question mark so long as I am willing to stay sequestered. I am just going to have to wait and see what we are being offered, by whom and how reliable the source is."

2020-08-03 21:49:22,"I won't be getting a vaccine. Ever. I've never gotten a flu shot, haven't had the flu since I can remember. I live a healthy life, keep my immune system strong. If I get sick, I'll get well. Just like I always have."
2020-08-03 21:51:36,Haste makes waste.  There is too much political pressure behind the Warp Speed Project.  It would be easy for important safeguards to be missed to cut corners.  My wife and I will not take the vaccine until we are sure there are no significant side effects.  This could be months after a vaccine becomes widely available.
2020-08-03 21:52:49,"This is why people need to stop talking as if this pandemic will all be over in a few months.  We need to start planning for a new normal that will be our reality for, perhaps, the next two years or so.

A vaccine simply existing isn't enough.  We need enough people to have been vaccinated.  I suspect a lot of people will NOT be lining up to be the first ones vaccinated.  So how long will it take to have enough of a vaccinated population?

People assume schools will open next year in person.  But will they?  What % of kids do we need to have been vaccinated in order to open schools?  Parents may be reluctant to get their kids vaccinated until there's more proof the vaccines are safe for kids.

So, in terms of schools, we can't say ""oh, it's just one year of sub-par learning.""  We need to plan for how to educate our kids for the next few years."
2020-08-03 21:54:05,"The author writes as if efficacy and safety are the same thing. A drug may be efficacious but somewhat unsafe (of course the converse is true, but not germane). The question the writer and we should be asking, is how efficacious and how safe must a vaccine be before we should approve it. What if the vaccine were 100% efficacious, but 2 of 100,000 people would have a fatal reaction to it? How about 50% effective, but completely safe? The choice is not safe v. unsafe; it is, as in much of life, on a continuum of risk and benefit."
2020-08-03 21:59:28,"Too many “experts” are treating this virus as it should behave, based on how other viruses have behaved, instead of how this particular one actually does behave. They’re acting like hammers looking for a recognizable nail instead of accepting that there are many aspects of Covid-19 that are in uncharted terrain. We’re still arguing over whether people who have been through the cycle of symptoms twice actually had it twice or just had a relapse. We still don’t know how long its antibodies last or whether they confer immunity. We’re still treating covid as a respiratory virus when there is clearly a lot else going on that affects the heart, the brain and other organs. Given this level of uncertainty I’m afraid that any vaccine coming out this year would be based more on wishful thinking, political optics and greed than on sound science. 

I get my flu shot every year and get exasperated with anti-vaxxers. But I’m definitely not going to be first in line to get any vaccine available this year. Real science takes time. I will continue to wear my mask and keep as far away as I can from all of you."
2020-08-03 22:01:05,At the every outset of the search for a vaccine Trump poisoned the well of trust about the hoped-for vaccine. Who could doubt that his administration would seek to press for a particular vaccine despite a lack of good evidence for its safety and efficacy of even in the face of evidence of unacceptable risk.
2020-08-03 22:01:12,"Dr. Dean is correct.  In the 1950s, we rushed out one (1) of the polio vaccines.  A large manufacturer had erred and several children died from the contamination in the vaccine."
2020-08-03 22:01:55,"I will have no hesitation about getting the vaccine, as long as it passes all testing protocols."
2020-08-03 22:03:35,I believe in science but not in anything Trump is responsible for our has any control. Let’s be real my fellow Americans this is the same guy who said it would disappear this summer like magic. I’m not buying anything he is selling. If Germany approves ok I’m in.
2020-08-03 22:15:13,"This smacks of pretty much every dystopian film and novel I can remember.

How do we know by this fall what the long-term effects of any vaccine will be? On any of us today, our unborn children tomorrow? How many of the volunteers include pregnant women or young children? 

Is Trump's re-election really worth the risks?"
2020-08-03 22:21:04,"Natalie Dean ends her opinion piece with ""Waiting for a better vaccine to come along may feel like torture, but it is the right move"".  Oh, really ?  Few vaccines are what one would call perfect.  Thankfully, those for polio and many serious childhood diseases come very close.  For the seasonal influenza vaccine, it often dips below 50% effective, yet getting it annually, is the smart thing to do.  For years, Zostavax was the only one for shingles, yet its effectiveness left much to be desired.  When the newer vaccine arrived (Shingrix), it was clearly superior to its predecessor.  Does that mean that getting the earlier (and inferior) version was a mistake?  Absolutely not.  If the first vaccines for coronavirus are only 50% effective, roll them out and vaccinate as many people as you can.  The devastation of this virus, for the health, education, and economic sectors of our society will continue for months on end until a reasonably effective vaccine can be mass distributed."
2020-08-03 22:28:16,"We should probably just import a vaccine from somewhere in Europe or Asia, where the process is less corrupted and dubious. The idea of dangling billions of dollars in front of various corporations to rush through a half-baked vaccine is terrifying.  The temptation of the money is so great that they might fudge the numbers. And the FDA is hardly known for its stringent oversight these days."
2020-08-03 22:32:29,"This writer is making a shaky assertion.   No reputable person is urging people to be vaccinated prematurely.   Yet she insists that ""some"" are urging immediate vaccination.  Some?   The Times is featuring articles which make readers uneasy about the vaccines, this is not the first, maybe as part of its antipathy to Donald Trump.  But we don't need politics from Trump or the Times when it comes to evaluating the vaccines.  We need articles with hope and information.    A different approach would be more helpful.  Information about what is designed to make the process trustworthy and beneficial, what steps are already being taken to make that happen, such information is needed."
2020-08-03 22:33:16,"The tragic confirmation of opinions like Dr. Dean's will inevitably come from the coronavirus itself, which is oblivious to any and all political manipulation of it and insufficiently researched cures.  It could become a terrible ""wait and see."""

To whit - if you were 75 years old with compromised lungs in the first place, then the risk/reward of being an early adopter changes radically. I'm kind of surprised that someone much more qualified than I am seems to have left out the calculus that should be used. That is measuring my risk of having a serious CV19 case versus the chance that a vaccine will prevent it even at lower than that ""magic"" 70 percent bar."
2020-08-03 23:06:11,"Perhaps the author is skating around it to provide empathy to the nervous, but I feel it's implicit in the question ""do you plan to get a Covid-19 vaccine when it's available?"" that the vaccine would and should be satisfactorily both safe and effective. I don't expect answers to ""do you want a jetpack?"" to include ones that roast the hindquarters. 

But if it needs to be explicit, then the pollsters need to make it so, so we can more accurately estimate the number of people who will have no intention of getting a vaccine, and thus remain a disease reservoir even after full distribution is carried out."
2020-08-03 23:22:37,"Once a reputable organization such as the FDA or the Robert Koch Institute for Health approves a vaccine, I'll wait til it's actually proven safe and effective."
2020-08-03 23:31:32,"I’m wondering if all trial participants are tested for prior infection. We need to assure only uninfected subjects are included in the study. If an infected person received the vaccine, falsely suggesting they became infected after receiving the vaccine, that would show the vaccine is less effective than it is. If an infected person received the placebo, that would indicate the vaccine is more effective."
2020-08-03 23:33:48,"It is important to obtain a vaccine sooner rather than later.  The specific date is impossible to say, but it needs to be before a crucial tipping point is reached. That point is when US society decides to ""return to normal"" and stop accepting the economic and social damage being inflicted on them.  I think that younger, healthy, low risk people will accept sacrifice until around April, 2021.  After that, I believe they will accept 1,000+ deaths a day. The economy will reconfigure itself and re-tool to meet the needs of a generally younger, healthier population who can, and will, return to offices, entertainment venues, restaurants, etc.  It will be a dark day when there is a reliable and easy to understand risk profile for who is most at risk of covid19.  As a 30 something pointed out me to recently - the MSM keeps writing about MLB, NCAA athletes, etc all testing positive as if it is a cautionary tale.  Rather, he said it silently points out they are almost all asymptomatic and none are dying.  The young and healthy aren't stupid, they are being incredibly generous - the vaccine needs to be here before they decide they won't be."

Studies on safety are crucial, but 20% efficacy while we develop better vaccines is better than waiting."
2020-08-03 19:10:04,Thank you Dr. Dean!  I'm curious what sort of data the Chinese Military vaccine is coming up with.
2020-08-03 19:59:48,"The American public is notoriously science-illiterate. Even this fairly basic article, outlining the reasons why a ""just roll out something, anything"" approach is hazardous, is going to go over the heads of many. If, for instance, Russian can claim a  50% effective vaccine, even in the face of dubious data collection and reports of odd side-effects, then there will be insurmountable pressure for us to just do the same: a thriving black-market will immediately spring up, there will be ""herbal versions"" on the interwebs, and anyone who opposes anything about it will be ""playing politics"".  Heaven help us if Russia announces this in the first part of October."
2020-08-03 21:28:05,"Of course the WH would never try to politicize a coronavirus vaccine by introducing it ahead of when it’s ready, bringing it in ahead of the November election only to influence the vote, prior to any semblance of normal FDA approval.

2020-08-03 23:57:02,It is a sobering thought that the US would be the least trusted place in the Developed world to source this vaccine. Almost everyone I know hopes that Oxford wins the race rather than a US corporation.
2020-08-04 00:10:04,"My understanding is that right now 90% of people infected have a mild case and survive. I am betting that I will be in that 90% if i do get it, because I eat and live healthy. It's also a fact that NOT 100% of the population is going to be infected. That 10% now becomes a smaller number. If I were an odds maker, I would never take a vaccine. I am a 75 year old male and have never taken a vaccine. I have taken care of the little Grandchildren for the last 20 years and have never contacted anything. I am not prescribed any medication because my LIPID panel is ZERO issues. Eat healthy, wear a mask and sanitize your hands regularly. Your odds of survival will be very high.  If you read all the articles available you would live in FEAR. My Grandchildren all want to return to school. I support them 100%. Prevention is the best possible solution."
2020-08-03 21:55:28,"My gut belief says if the vaccine proves to be similar to a flu vaccine where it will lower your chance of transmission significantly, I'll get it based on that alone. We need to resume our lives sooner than later, and any chance to make life livable again I'll take it. I agree with all the measures we are doing now to slow the spread and protect others, but I and others need to human interaction and go out and do things again."
2020-08-03 23:02:17,"My understanding is that ""warp speed"" is not about rushing trials, but rather providing funding for development and ramping up production before trials are finished, risking money but not lives.

2020-08-03 22:46:10,"I'm 71. Even with no co-morbidities, the consequences of getting infected would be horrific, if not deadly. I need protection. Not getting the vaccine has known, terrible risks. Getting the vaccine, even with poorly known minor risks is the far wiser choice."
2020-08-03 23:06:19,"We should start vaccinating in a few weeks. It should be mandatory. As far as people having a false sense of security, wearing masks and social distancing should also be mandatory.

It's not a matter of choice. It's for the greater good. For the same reason we do not allow people to drink and drive.
By the time we wait for a better vaccine, we won't need one. We will have heard immunity, millions dead, countless suffering, a crippled economy, an overwhelmed health care system, and hundreds of millions of people with life long damage from infection.

An overwhelmed health care system means that people don't only die from COVID, but we can't treat people with other conditions."

When that happens, I will be first in line with my wife and daughter to take it. Dr. Fauci is an honorable man, and we trust him. We do not trust Trump and any of his toadies. If the vaccine is safe and effective, I will put the lives of myself and my family in Dr. Fauci's hands.

And while we have an annual vaccine for the flu it does not mean you won’t get sick. So the same thing will happen with a vaccine for COVID-19. There is simply no evidence that a vaccine will help at all. To say nothing of the fact that we still have no idea what other problems COVID-19 may cause long term (to say nothing of a vaccine). I just fear that people are in for a big letdown when it comes to a COVID vaccine. I won’t take the vaccine, I’ll tell you that right now. Not with only a few months of testing when normally it takes years. The truth is that we could have & should have defeated the virus by shutting down the entire country for about 3 weeks to a month. That would have stopped the virus in it’s tracks. But because of politics and just plain public ignorance & stupidity, over 150,000 Americans are dead and many more will die. We never should have needed a vaccine in the first place. This whole crisis is a huge lesson in how not to handle an epidemic."

When it comes to manipulating the vast US government bureaucracy, most here would be very surprised at how little influence Trump and the White House actually have.

This author believes simply waiting for a better vaccine comes without consequence. 1000 people a day are dying in this country and at what point does the potential harm from a vaccine become outweighed by the damage from the virus. Even further, you can talk about unknown long term safety of a vaccine, but it’s cancelled out by the fact that even patients who survive covid may have long term damage as well. We already have evidence of lasting irreversible damage from the virus. 

It’s widely irresponsible for the times to sow doubt around vaccinations without evidence. I understand the believe in safe and sound medicine, however when you have antivaxxers who will latch on to anything to scream from their soapbox you are hurting the health of the public."

They need to come up with a few hundred million doses and it needs to work and be safe so I'm not thinking it's going to be before the election.  

If it is and Trump pumps it, and Fauci remains silent or has been fired, forget it.  I'd become an anti-vaxxer : )

Fauci has said he doesn't like the ""warp speed"" name because it implies a slap-dash quick and dirty approach to science.  Not his method.  The ""warp speed"" part really refers to the fact that they are spending a lot of money on producing vaccines that they ""think"" are going to work.  They're throwing money at several drug companies right now to speed up the process A LOT.  Like he says, if it works - they saved a lot of time.  If it doesn't work - they spent a lot of money.

The tragically inept response to the pandemic has proved beyond any doubt that the United States has a completely dysfunctional government. We have an incompetent and petulant narcissist failing to lead the Executive Branch. He has made a point of appointing unqualified sycophants to lead (and to destroy) essential agencies that keep us safe. He is aided and abetted by Republicans who care only about helping the very wealthiest persons (individual and corporate) increase their wealth, thereby assuring the limitless donations that keep them in power. Both consider the rest of us expendable. 

Particularly with the pandemic and vaccine development so heavily politicized by a president and party who see the writing on the wall and are desperate to hold on to power any way they can, I would not trust any American pharmaceutical company to deliver properly tested, safe, and effective vaccines. I have much more confidence in products vetted and approved in countries where governments care about people, and that respect science and scientists."

If you have evidence of political interference please provide it. If you do not please desist from questioning the integrity of government workers and government agencies. You are compromising the public's health.

Operation Warp Speed does not change the process for reviewing vaccines. It compresses steps which are ordinarily done serially into concurrent steps. So instead of waiting for the results of the phase III trial to start assembling the manufacturing facility and producing the vaccine this occurs concurrently with the trial. If the trial fails to demonstrate either safety or efficacy the vaccine is discarded.

If this isn't good enough for you and you choose not to get vaccinated-it's a free country.  As a physician, I will be vaccinated. Those members of my family that qualify for the vaccine will be vaccinated. Should you get COVID19 because you chose not to get vaccinated I wish you the best.

I miss the students and my colleagues desperately and after last spring understand the challenges of remote learning. I yearn for the day that I am back in the school building doing what I love. But as a society we are not there yet as shown by Israel’s cautionary tale (and Israel was in a much better situation when they opened up schools than we are in now). 

I am incredibly anxious about the fall. The virus is out of control in parts of the country and there is absolutely no national plan to address it. I am worried about many of my coworkers who are well into their 60s as well as my students’ family members, many of whom have underlying health conditions. I worry about my parents, whom my partner and I rely on for childcare so we can both work and are both in their late 70s. And sure, I worry about myself and my immediate family as there is still so much about this virus and how it behaves.

The plan is for a hybrid remote- and in-person schedule, mandatory face covering, and to be able to turn on a dime into a fully remote mode when we need to. In short, we're looking at probably the best that can be hoped for right now in an American school. 

It's still incredibly stressful. I hope we can get through at least a few weeks before going back into lockdown  -- my daughter hasn't seen most of her peers since March. And I hope no one dies of an infection spread at school."

Sending young people back into places designed to house large groups of adults and young people into small rooms, narrow hallways, and packed commons areas is  absurd. Add to the logistical problems of social distancing, the human problem of asking children and adolescents to wear masks, to personally social distance, and to make sense out of complex hybrid schedules that would confuse a NASA scientists. And, these obstacles are ones that are most visible. No school has the staff--custodians, substitute teachers, medical personnel, maintenance staff--to adequately keep a building clean or to respond to a health emergency. What troubles me the most about this entire reopening madness, is the ""hope for the best"" attitude on the part of parents and school administrators. An absolute principle of responsible school administration is you NEVER hope for the best with lives of children and staff on the line."

Very small class sizes with a dedicated teacher. Specialists will zoom into classrooms. Ventilation, outdoor learning, staggered arrivals and departures. Half the curriculum is gone, there is no afterschool program. A few teachers have full body PPE to deal with the youngest kids who may need a hug or something else requiring a lot of contact. 

It's far from school as it was but it also isn't giving up on young kids and pretending that they can learn online."

If two infected Great Clips employees (see the Missouri case) can work for days and cut the hair of over one hundred customers, and subsequently infect no one because they were wearing masks, then we should learn from that. Wear masks, upgrade air filters, install air purifiers if you can afford it, and maintain some degree of spacing if possible. We will get through this. 

I would also dare to answer the question: “what is the goal here?” The goal used to be to flatten the curve so as not to overwhelm hospitals. Now the goal seems to be zero infections, even among children who almost never become hospitalized by the virus."
2020-08-04 12:07:46,"1 in 23 students and staff infected does not seem to be justification to close schools.  The flu is statistically more dangerous to 5-17 year olds than Covid. One California resident In the 5-17 age group has died from Covid out of 37,176 diagnosed cases. If you assume there are 5 to 10 times more undiagnosed cases, that works out to an IFR of .000005 and.0000027, respectively. Per the CDC site, the hospitalization rate for Covid is significantly lower than past flu seasons. Additionally, most parents of school age children are in lower risk age groups so are unlikely to have a significant negative outcome if infected.  I would offer an online option for families that do not feel comfortable returning their children to school, but otherwise open the schools.

To keep things in perspective, Germany and Japan were decimated in World War 2 and have somehow still come to be the dominate economic players in their respective regions.

With covid, that script plays out in real life, without that happy ending. In fact I am not sure that we will ever see a return to the old normal, even with the arrival of the vaccine (or multiple vaccines). I think life - human life, as we know it, live it and practice it will have to change forever.
The instant mass infection in a freshly reopened school, or a cruise ship, or even in a single bar speaks volumes about how little we know."

""The lesson, experts say, is that even communities that have gotten the spread of the virus under control need to take strict precautions when reopening schools. Smaller classes, mask wearing, keeping desks six feet apart and providing adequate ventilation, they say, are likely to be crucial until a vaccine is available.""

The Israeli story should be read and taken seriously as a cautionary tale, still unfolding.  

So far the kids have lost a few months of curriculum learning but maybe have gained some other forms of knowledge and life experience. Many have lost work and that is where the government must step in. 
We will have a vaccine. But we will not get back those we have lost. We will have to suffer along with those who have long term effects additionally.

In certain parts of the country, conditions are such that we “can” open safely, but school districts need massive financial support from the federal government, and inevitably families will too. Even if we could open schools safely, there’s no guarantee we won’t all be back home distance learning by (gulp) Election Day.

Rather than trying to help ordinary working people, the government and big business are putting the problem on the backs of ordinary people and saying “Hey, be a trooper, go out there and get our money and our power— I mean, this economy back on track.  Sure, you and your loved ones might die but wouldn’t you feel better knowing you’ve left us— I mean, your kids a strong growing economy?”

We can't stop it.  The virus is circulating the globe and it will continue to circulate until is has infected the vast majority of the human population.  

We can slow its spread through isolation to make it possible for the hospitals to handle the load.  Or should I say, sort of possible.

What we need is a vaccine to prevent it and a drug therapy to cure it.  We really need both and those take time.  

We can and should wear masks.  We can and should avoid large gatherings which are super spreader events.  But we can't stop living either.

This would be best case with quick response and minimal damage. For the majority of schools with a sketchy plan, no resources and non-compliance? A disaster. We were optimistic in the beginning, hoping the virus would not reach our shores and just go away. That time has passed. This is not going away for some time, even with a vaccine. We need decisive, collective action, with leadership and coordination from Washington (which has the resources) and Governors (who have the authority). We can’t go back in time. We can’t shut down again, it will be the end of small business, families will be broken, homes lost, an unimaginable toll; this tragedy is unfolding now. And yet we have to try again, to start over with best practice. This ordeal will go on until such happens. I’ve been wracking my brain for months and I can’t sort this. Meanwhile, 40% of America refuses to see, can only summon denial and blame, and places their fortune with a charlatan. Read Ed Yong’s brilliant  deconstruction in the Atlantic.

Otherwise, the virus will defeat us.
We'll only learn the hard way, it seems.

    The approach to reopening would need to vary from place to place, depending on the local rate of infection.
    Out of the ten largest school districts in this country, only two New York City and Chicago have a daily infection rate below 5 percent, the standard recommended by epidemiologists to safely reopen.
     On July 16, the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, reiterated the president’s position, saying, “When he says open, he means open and full, kids being able to attend each and every day at their school. The science should not stand in the way of this.”

Those droplets can accumulate in rooms with poor ventilation. They spread easier if people are within 6 ft of each other. 

The only way to solve this issue is the shut down activities long enough to get the rate of infection below 1:1. 

This is not going to be solved with medicine administered in a hospital. It’s not going to be solved with machismo. Nor is prayer, by itself, useful.

According to data compiled by the NY Times, last week the US had about 1300 cases per million, and Israel about 1200.  Brazil had about 1500.  These are all comparable, and are among the worst in the world.

In Israel, Netanyahu formerly had a reputation for general competence in protecting the security of its citizens.  That reputation is being severely damaged.

In the US, of course, what little was left of Trump reputation is now being destroyed.

2020-08-04 12:56:00,"There’s a cognitive dissonance here. If the virus mainly spread because of asymptomatic individuals, this logically suggests that most people who get infected won’t even know it, thereby suffering no ill effects. As for the fact that *some* people will get sick or die - doesn’t the flu sicken and kill people too, even those vaccinated? The vulnerable know enough by now to keep their distance."

As a parent of a high school student and basically quarantining since March, I’m beginning to see a deterioration in emotional stability that is just as concerning as the virus.

Perhaps the answer is thinking outside the box— the box being indoor classrooms. In our state, we have pretty mild weather up through November. Schools should look onto setting up outdoor teaching in the fall while they can. Large tents, and outdoor heaters may extend the season. Less electronics and just a good old fashioned lecture and group discussion. Anything to get these kids out of the house and together safely would be vastly helpful."
2020-08-04 13:12:35,"Perhaps the major success of the US lockdown in April was closing the schools.     Most went online.   That was when the incidence of the virus of the population was less than half of what it is today.

We decided weeks ago that our children would remote learn in the fall. But no one asked us to. That is insane to me. The entire goal should be to reduce density wherever possible. I can work and help my kids. So many do not have that luxury. Our focus should always have been on essential workers children and those with needs that demand in- person learning. Doing so would have let schools practice systems to accommodate everyone safely. But more importantly it would have kept teachers, staff, and kids safer."

The message needs to be simple - mandatory mask wearing for everyone, all of the time; mandatory social distancing for everyone, all of the time; hand washing; and testing and quarantining for any signs or symptoms. 

Every community is divided by virus believers and deniers. It is inevitable that schools will spread virus - human nature will lead folks to become too complacent.

The truth is this is a system disease that enters the body through the airways, but travels through through the blood vessels and gets everywhere. There is no cure except prevention. Nobody knows who will get really, really sick or what the long term impact of getting sick will be.

Until there's consistent messaging consistent with the evidence, we won't extinguish this pandemic."

Many children die from influenza every year - still school have kept open. Is it not better to try to isolate the elderly? Or is this difficult in the US, i.e. do many grandparents live with their grandchildren? Could maybe elderly be offered a temporary alternative housing? To keep normality for kids must be a priority."
2020-08-04 14:19:21,"Here in Ontario the government is planning to reopen elementary schools and middle schools on a full-time basis and high schools will be reopened on alternating days for students (starting in September). Most of Ontario has recently moved to 'Stage 3' of the re-opening where most businesses are open with distancing restrictions and we have relatively few new cases per day. If infections spike in late September or early October then we'll have strong evidence that school re-opening led to the spike as other businesses have already been open for almost two months. Wish us luck! 

One other point is that whenever there is a re-opening of any sort and loosening of restrictions there will likely be a spike so you need protocols to handle these. I think we are already seeing a slight rise in cases in those areas of Ontario that entered stage 3 while cases in areas that continued to be in stage 2 remained on a downward trend."

How will we do this with windows bolted shut, no fans, no circulating air system of any kind￼ (our building was built in 1923), not to mention, a team of well-intentioned but overwhelmed janitors who could not keep the girls bathroom clean for more than two periods in a row or the men’s bathroom stocked with paper towels and soap on a daily basis — how will they keep the entire school sanitized on a daily basis?￼ Let’s get real, Mr. De Blasio.  

The answer is clear: please do not re-open schools this semester because what is going to happen is a surge of infections that will result in the needless deaths of friends, family members, teachers, parents and grandparents.

I know it's horrible situation, first and foremost for the parents who cannot afford alternate childcare arrangements so that they can go back to work, but unfortunately it doesn't change the facts. And it's been made all the worse by governments/school districts putting off making the call. Having kids attend in person classes, even part time, was never a viable option. The last several months should have been spent preparing for the inevitable necessity of fully remote learning."

Upon closer inspection, at least two have masks on, but below their nose. This, in a nutshell, is why we can never do enough to keep schools safe. There is always the human element, and teenagers do dumb things, whether it’s pulling their mask down to chat with their friends as soon as they are away from adult supervision, or hanging out at parties outside of school."

Trump and Republicans should however understand who they're messing with and the concept of ""what goes around, comes around"".

Comparing the school systems of the USA to Norway or Denmark is like comparing a few apples to scores of chickens, pigs, cows and more.  One might also note that those nations often cited as having the best schools pay and treat their teachers the best--and fund schools while supporting families preparing to send children to school.  It's not rocket science. It's a matter of Priorities, Investments, Risks--and Lives."

This virus's primary evolutionary goal is to find uninflected beings, infect them and use that being to infect others.  It is somewhat delusional to think you are safe because your friend friend couldn't be infected or that surface cleaned an hour ago isn't now contaminated.   

Classroom size of 32 in the USA?   Even odds that a student or the teacher is infected.   20 classes?   A one in million chance that all classes are uninflected.

2020-08-04 14:13:19,"As a pediatrician with experience in epidemiology I can offer some US perspective.

First, Israel controlled the initial infection with a travel ban in January (before the WHO or the Democratic presidential candidates recommended it).  No control measure is of any benefit if there are no restrictions on travel from affected areas.

Second, Israel used techniques illegal in this country such as using people's cell phone data to find quarantine violators.

Third, Israel's initial results were the best in the world. Their mortality rate was roughly 0.7% and their new case rate dropped to roughly a dozen by May.  Their extensive experience providing international medical assistance provided them with expertise no other country could match.

Fourth, the Arab population also did well. Their rate was not significantly higher than the Jewish population.

The problem here is failure to recognize that children get sick too.  There have been 34,000 pediatric cases of COVID19 in the US.  While there have only been a few dozen deaths, there have been ICU cases and permanent disability.

As 2 vaccines are in phase III trials, I see no reason to open schools. Certainly there are better ways to help the economy and provide day care than infecting children-as well as teachers, administrators, and bus drivers. If there's a good chance of having a vaccine in 2021 why would we risk killing people now? For economic reasons?

Fewer illnesses means a better economy. Opening the schools is moronic."
2020-08-04 13:31:13,You talk about all schools but when looking closely at Israel it seems the outbreaks were in mostly high schools. I’m curious what happened in the elementary schools.  Did students spread to each other there? Did they spread to teachers in elementary?

I know others who have health issues that put them at risk.

Stay home? So far, our governor hasn't given that as an option. (Of course, it would have to be with pay - people have to pay their bills.) So teachers have a Hobson's choice: Go to work and risk getting the virus. or get another job.  (Maybe, at that empty shirt store pictured  in another article.)

Then there's the teachers like another of my at-risk colleagues. She  has the means to stay home, but she also has 3 kids. Home school? Keep them away from their friends who will be in school?

2020-08-04 13:37:14,"Since the article was about Israel, I wanted to add some facts about COVID-19 deaths in Israel.  Hopefully, this will be helpful for the debate.

1.  As of today, there were a total of 554 deaths in Israel from COVID-19.  That corresponds to 60 deaths per million people from COVID-19 in Israel.  

Just for comparison, the U.S. death rate from COVID-19 is 480 per million. That is eight times as many per capita.  So the situation in Israel is different than in the U.S.

2.  Further, while every death is unfortunate, in the case of Israel, 44% of those who died from COVID-19 were age 85 or over, and another 30% were in 75-84 age group. Less than 10% of the fatalities were under age 65.  

3.  Finally, on average, according to the Financial Times, there have been no excess deaths in Israel (deaths from all causes) this year.  Israel is one of the three countries out of the 21 that the Financial Times reported on that did not have “excess deaths” in 2020."

Because what I see all over the world is “precaution creep”...even in the “good” countries. From my perspective schools have all the makings of infection hot spots...non-cautious demographic (children) placed together in close proximity to each other for long periods of time.
What’s the alternative? To be like Google and have everyone stay home until the summer of 2021? Really???
It’s August 4 and 10s of millions of American children have no access to broadband internet nor do they have the computers, printers and books to learn remotely. Libraries are physically closed. Parents are either out of work or won’t be around. Free school meals won’t be there. Teachers who can are opting out of work. From my perspective, actually getting COVID-19 is starting to sound like the least of it. We are heading into a “lost generation” situation... something I don’t recall happening even during the worst periods of polio. 1918 produced millions of  orphans. COVID-19 will product millions of educational “orphans”. Has home schooling now magically become okay and desirable among enlightened liberals.
I visited cousins last month whose entire family of 5 had COVID-19 1.5 months earlier. All were overweight, 2 over 64 and all but 1 asymptomatic.

2020-08-04 14:58:20,Can the times write a story of a school that opened safely with the hybrid model ?  I think we've had enough of the doom and gloom stories for a while.
2020-08-04 15:04:24,"And from the American ""leadership"" perspective this has nothing to do with teaching children or getting them back to the classroom for their sake or the sake of the teachers and administrators.
Anyone who's ever had a child knows all schools, no matter how they are run, become breeding grounds for any and all viruses.   Have been for ever.
No, these kids are being coerced back to instill chaos in the very near future.  Just check the timing as it relates to November.  donald is dangling this right before our eyes and we refuse to call him out, in mass, on it.
Hasn't anyone studied pre war Germany?"
2020-08-04 14:58:21,"Israel opened schools with a population that had no general immunity.  That meant an easy spread for Covid-19 when it entered the school.  The failure was believing that a general quarantine would eliminate a virus that spread asymptomatically in most patients and is respiratory.  That is, and continues to be, the epidemiological pipe-dream that doctors in ivory towers keep pushing on an ignorant population.

The fact is, you can't stop the spread of Covid-19.  You can manage it and deal with the trade off of economic and social devastation with some death and illness. It's a simple either/or that we refuse to acknowledge.   Those countries who were successful at first can either stay permanent in lockdown or open up and face the pandemic later (see: Australia and Singapore as well as Israel)

One question no one seems willing to answer is how many children have already had cover-19 in the US? How much general immunity is found in the populations in the US Northeast?  IFR calculations indicate that NYC has already had over 5 MILLION cases.  Cases are dropping even in the south and west indicating that the virus has deeply penetrated the vulnerable population and is struggling to find new hosts.  It is highly likely that a huge number of children had cover-19 in early March/April and that the return to school will not be associated with outbreaks similar to those found in Israel."

2020-08-04 15:00:04,"You can print the news but what to do when elected officials ignore it? Here in rural El Dorado County, California we have a choice whether to open schools because the county as a whole is not on the state monitoring list, which is too lenient regarding test positivity rate. The county will likely be on the list in a matter of weeks anyway. Yet at a recent county Board of Supervisors meeting to discuss schools, Doug Veerkamp, a supervisor, said we need to do everything to open schools in person, asked the county health officer if we can ask the state to waive some monitoring list criteria, and went on to talk about herd immunity. Veerkamp should be an embarrassment to all county residents, yet he enjoys tremendous political power. The meeting accepted community comments (virtually), mostly in favor of reopening schools in person, including a call from a representative of the Republican Party. It is unbelievable what the Republican Party has become."
2020-08-04 15:14:50,"The problem with Covid19 is that people like simple propositions; close schools/open schools, close bars/open bars. But the reality is complex, schools cover age groups which are quite different in facilities which are different, from 5 year olds to students who can vote. It is possible to run facilities under certain conditions of spacing, ventilation and personal protection equipment, but this is in the detail. 
If there is a lesson learned from Israel it is that you have to attend to the detail, you cannot just ignore it because it is inconvenient."
2020-08-04 13:27:13,"As a teacher, I can guarantee you that if we reopen schools, this will happen to us. Our schools are mostly in older buildings with poor ventilation, cramped hallways, and bathrooms without windows. Students will invariably fail to perfectly observe safety regulations and will bring the disease home to their parents. I sympathize with parents who are desperate to open schools, and my heart breaks for the students who are suffering from the psychological effects of isolation, but if we open now as the disease is spiking, the devastation of infection and death among parents, teachers, school workers, and yes, some children with underlying health conditions, will be unspeakably tragic. Remote learning isn’t perfect, but it’s the best option we have right now. Also, ask yourself this: If the devoted teacher who has perfected their curriculum over many years of teaching gets deathly ill from in-person classes, will the inexperienced sub who replaces them really lead to a better educational experience for your child? Trump is willing to send us all to the grave to help his re-election chances. Governors and school officials need to stand up to him and refuse to play along."
2020-08-04 15:11:51,"The private school we are considering for our child in NYC will have masks on all children, pods of 8 or 9, and social distancing. They have the resources to make it work. After seeing the details of their plan, we realized how few places will be able to execute safety on that scale. We are worried and sad for the city but cannot just stand by as our two children face a full year outside of a classroom."
2020-08-04 15:28:26,"As an educator who does research on educational innovations in schools to determine and share best practices, I am bound by Human Subjects Review and IRB (university institutional review boards) guidelines that are discerning and often onerous.  To participate in such studies, each subject (student and parent) must be given elaborate explanations of any potential risk, yet NONE of this research imagines death of the subject or their lethal infection of the community. Yet we have university researchers among others leaping in to promote return to school  because children 'apparently/we don't know/they might not' experience immediate death from the virus, and the economy should open, when 9-12 months of online versus in-person education -- is the expected cost.

Can rational adults please prevail here?  Move our attention to providing the best version of on-line or in-home learning our curriculum designers can devise and let educators share best practices and differentiate instruction - iterate and replicate what works at the speed of social media.  Solve safety issues (what can a parent do if they must work outside the home and their children are under 12; how to serve those limited number of students who must have 1:1 instruction because of a special learning need.) Our children's potential lifespan currently nears 100 years; let's not compromise that by getting back to school before we have done all we can to anticipate and avoid the real dangers of this pandemic."
2020-08-04 15:31:15,It would be a good idea to keep older teachers and those in other high risk categories away from the classroom this year. They should be doing online teaching and administrative work. That should reduce the number of deaths among teachers significantly.
2020-08-04 15:41:21,"The most basic problem overall with this pandemic is the reality of our Public Health structure.  The Federal Government is not in charge of Public Health within the States, for one major thing.  Our CDC is only an advisor to the States for the internal workings of Public Health in each State.  Our Federal Public Health initially was concerned with disease importation by sailors coming in to our ports.  Even today the Federal Government's direct role is to deal with interstate relationships to infectious and contagious diseases and the importation of the same diseases from outside our National borders.In effect, it is the Governor of each State and the Public Health Director of each State to protect the citizens and other residents of the State.  

Yes, the President certainly has a role to play particularly as an example of compliance with the advice being provided by CDC and other appropriate scientists.  When it comes to schools for our children we must look to the authority of our Governors.  May they be guided by the best science!"
2020-08-04 15:47:27,"What happens to the old enough child who knows they brought home the virus from school that killed their parent or grandparent? The wish to return to a ""normal"" that no longer exists is driving a quest to start schools with a certainty that also doesn't exist as this article attests. US schools are designed to meet the needs of a 19th century agrarian economy. We stop for planting and start in the fall after the crops are picked and we end mid-day so kids can help with the farm chores. As family work and life changed, schools struggled to keep up with the 21st century. The pandemic just highlights the need for child care, food, social time and year round and flexible learning schedules that we have not addressed. Fortunately kids are not preserved in aspic, static and waiting for school to start and all will not be lost if we fail to meet some artificial start date. The pandemic is not ""forever"" but if schools are to move on it will require strict adherence to ALL public health rules ( not picking a few just to say we tried ) and the willingness to stop and readjust, over and over, as many times as it takes to get it right."
2020-08-04 15:48:51,"This article  tells us us that someone had Covid 19 and returned to school with it - could have been a student, teacher or support staff.  
It also tells us that without testing of students, teachers and support staff BEFORE school re-opens it is likely that someone with the virus will, when back in school, start passing it around to more vulnerable people.
With the US now able to test, apparently, over 500K per day, why not prioritise school kids and all school staff prior to them returning to school? Isolate and quarantine those that have the virus, thus allowing others to return to school safely.
Is this so difficult to co-ordinate?  Somehow we have adhoc testing centres all over the country, testing anyone who turns up, but we can't organise a test centre at each school to do the same?  
Many years ago we had outbreaks of TB and small pox.  I remember the health authorities swinging into action and  myself and fellow students lining up for inoculations in school.  Every school in the country did the same; we can't do the same for testing these days?  
I agree that returning to school may be risky - but it is only down to the incompetence of the authorities who can't put a testing plan into action."
2020-08-04 15:58:01,"Where I live on the East coast, nearly everything in my state is open, with the exception of schools: Daycare centers, Planet Fitness, Whole Foods, Wal-Mart, Sephora, Home Depot, restaurants, etc. Planet Fitness and Sephora are hardly life sustaining businesses. We're doing fine. Nearly everyone appears to wear a mask indoors, and outdoors when near others, but not while distanced.

We have had deaths in my county, but mostly in assisted living and nursing homes. If the pandemic was really as much of a catastrophe as I read, would Sephora be open so that high school girls, home from school, could shop for their eyeliner?"
2020-08-04 15:58:52,"Just another disaster on the horizon.  Despite all the warnings, your king will still want the schools open.  After the resulting disaster, he will look to see who he can blame.

The article represents the usual panic offered us daily. Covid-19 is overall a mild plague (1 in 1000 of us will die), we should learn the lessons and prepare for a serious one,
Keeping kids at home for years comes with a huge price, there is no perfect solution here. 
On the balance, I estimate that sending the kids back to school, which requires a certain political courage, seems to be the right thing to do."

I understand a millennium of humans have been educated to think that children and schools are a Petri dish for viruses, but COVID is a blood clot illness that barely shows up as live virus in the children it infects.  

An actual empirical study separating treatment group from the control (non-schools) found that adults in school settings were less likely to get COVID than elsewhere.  Does this mean we open schools down here in Miami...no....but New York should at least consider the Denmark plan that was created when virus levels were at the current New York rate and opening just grade schools did not lead to a Covid spike among adults or kids."

2020-08-04 15:54:02,"The calculus is this: Opening schools fully will likely result in more infections which will lead to some deaths but probably most kids and teachers will be OK. Is that worth it?

I think it is a community decision. Maybe you live in a community that puts a lower value on human life and are willing to risk your children and their teachers. Or maybe you live in a community that can afford to stay home with its children and not risk any infections or deaths.

I don't really see a right or wrong answer. It is really a matter of what the community's priorities are. But anyone who thinks schools can be fully opened without any increase in infections and deaths is dreaming. As Dirty Harry used to say, ""are you feeling lucky?"""

Why so much focus on COVID deaths and COVID 'numbers', when the entire purpose of these lockdowns was to ensure that hospitals could Manage the most serious ICU cases?  

Instead of trying to prevent any/all COVID deaths (impossible), we need to recognize that life is not just about merely having a pulse.  Emotional and mental health are just as important, if not moreso.  Why aren't more people talking about all the other fallout from these lockdowns?  Why so much focus on COVID 'case numbers', graphs, bubble charts of the US hotspots,  '10 ways to make a no-sew face mask' etc.?    Do folks realize all the cancer diagnoses that are going unchecked, because folks aren't getting their annual checkups and tests?

Where is the common sense?

An education is becoming a privilege that only the those with financial resources can afford due to this virus.  

Parents with the financial resources to place their kids in private schools that require face masks, break up the kids in smaller pods and enforce social distancing are going to be at an advantage bc of the utter stupidity of school officials and the complacency of the unions who are taking an all of nothing approach into this epidemic.

Children under 10 do not spread this disease effectively, nor do they get seriously sick from it.  Pre-K to 4th grades must be treated as a completely separate issue - those children need daily in-person instruction more, and are less able to learn online, as well as needing child care that older kids don’t.  The US has kept daycares open, with no major outbreaks reported.  No country in the world has reported a case of a young child infecting a teacher (and infections of household members by children are very rare).  

Do what you will with the older kids, but schools need to reopen for daily in-person instruction for the under 10’s - with morning and afternoon sessions if you are worried about social distancing.  If social justice matters to you, act on it by opening school for the most vulnerable."

Use state and city parks, use outdoor parking garages, set up tents with open sides and outdoor heaters when it is cold.   It is so much better for most than staying closed at the cost of jobs and mental health or reopening while the virus is still spreading.  If we really wanted to pursue an option like this we could find a way... if we had effective leadership this is where the discussion would be and we would figure out how to make it happen.

I urge the authors to use more meaningful numbers than those quoted here to better enable readers to evaluate relative risk. Israel has a population of less than 9 million people - roughly the size of New Jersey. Don't compare it to the whole US population or it will be dismissed.

If you use normalized numbers your point is so much more powerful: Right now, the Northeastern states considered to have the virus relatively ""in check"" are experiencing rates of about 48 new cases per 1M population per day.  By comparison Israel, at the end of May was experiencing less than two new cases per day (yes, 2).

2020-08-04 19:07:01,"This virus IS novel.  Israel's example is, even with its mistakes, mostly thoughtful, pragmatic and science-based.  They first succeeded, then failing with the kind of politically economic bent which our government seems to prefer of jeopardizing our collective health in favor of economic pursuit.  The Wheel of Corona is being re-invented almost daily and I suggest we learn from our mistakes & missteps, rather than clamor for the unrealistic and outright dangerous fantasies which are founded in the short-term history of failure.  

All life is precious, but the lives of others seem a bit less so.  We all measure our risks daily, but I cannot advocate risking the lives of any children for the sake of our economy, or the inability of parents to 'handle' a year of responsibility for their kid's 24-hr days.  Children adapt far better than we do and will do so here....that is if they remain alive."
2020-08-04 19:35:04,"This all seems like self-deception for the sake of economies, so that parents can be allowed to work and the illusion of normalcy can be made. 
The virus has trapped countries that worship economic activity at the expense of human life. 
Countries are doing the minimum they can possibly do to try and maintain this illusion while holding out for a possible vaccine!!! 
Instead, they’d be better off acknowledging that human life, too, is valuable, shutting down properly to deal with the virus, and then slowly opening!
This means investing much much more in human services like economic relief and PPE, and just acknowledging that some economic activity has to be lost for the sake of the future! 
Instead, the same countries that refuse to adequately invest in their human services are predictably also the ones rushing to open with negative results! 
They’re having a health crisis be ran by economists and not scientists! 
Now these same countries are rushing vaccines which may also backfire if they fail to provide adequate help! 
The right way is to spend much more to beat the virus, spend as much as these countries are often willing to spend when they give tax breaks and other benefits to their rich who don’t need them!
The problem they’re having is they want to cut corners to spend as little as possible on the problem! Yet they’re often willing to spend more on things their rich elite value, but which are less important! They spend more on their wars, tax breaks etc!"

I saw just my mother.  I did not see my sister for two years, rarely saw my father, and never saw aunts, cousins or uncles.  There were no books, no TV.  The last 6 mos. I got a coloring book, a couple of matchbox cars, and started meeting with a public school tutor a few times a week.  When I recovered, I was plunged into a school full of noisy, anarchic, normal kids.
Guess what? No trauma, no problems.  I started school in second grade and by the end of the year was reading above a sixth grade level.  Later, I got  my Ph.D., taught at university, got married, and have had a good life.
I'm glad there weren't any pediatricians and child psychologists to tell my parents I would be damaged for life --or presidents urging my mother (of blessed memory) to go back to work so he could win an election.

We didn’t achievement containment of the virus back in the spring, things re-opened too quickly, and there was no national mask mandate or a plan for testing/tracing.  Now some school districts, including mine, have delayed the start of the fall semester by 2 weeks.  That won’t hurt anything, but it won’t get us any closer to a safe, successful semester either.  We’ll continue to go around and around in circles while making no progress until we achieve containment, which would probably require another nationwide lockdown for several weeks, and re-open very gradually with a national mask mandate and the proper infrastructure for testing/tracing.

2020-08-04 18:44:32,"The storms and fires aren't really the biggest impact of climate change.  The major impact, on humanity and all other species, is going to be the increase of uninhabitable zones due to temperatures rising, and higher water levels eliminating a lot of land on the coasts.  The uninhabitable land area is going to go from 1% to 17% within the next few decades, and the two billion people who live in that zone currently are going to have to relocate or die.  A million species are on track to go extinct due to climate change's rearranging of the environment.

All of this indicates that covid-19 is really no big deal.  At most it will kill a million or two humans, nothing like the 'Spanish' Flu, and that's not nearly enough to reduce our impact on the environment.  Since humanity continues to avoid any preparation for climate change's effects, or any mitigation of our causes of it, we are going to suffer a massive population reduction in the next five decades or so.  At least the deaths will be entirely deserved."

And we are beginning to experience and endure ""fire season.""  Here, due to global warming, our deadly fires accompany high, unprecedented winds. We had less than average rainfall this past season, and our summer is hot and dry.  Homes and people and livelihoods will again not be spared.  The earthquakes, too, are a constant threat since so much of my state is over one fault-line after another.  With our fires, even if we live at a distance from the actual site, smoke fills the air we breathe.  Running noses and burning eyes, coughing and sneezing, and shortness of breath have become the norm even for the young and healthy.  We know there are a lot of reasons why Donald Trump needs to go.  All are important since his ""rule"" has been a failure across the board.  Yet, even though it ""seems"" less obvious and crucial, this nation MUST restart the journey that began under President Obama.  That is to if not fully prevent then to at least assuage the deadly effects of climate change.  We are running out of time."
2020-08-04 19:22:19,"We’ve been seeing numerous impacts catching many scientists by surprise with how soon they are occurring. 

In 2014 two independent teams of scientists reported that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is likely irreversibly retreating. 3.3 meters of sea level rise equivalent of ice there is being destabilized by a warming ocean and energy is going into the net melting of ice all over the planet.

The paleoclimate record indicates that increasing global temperature by just 1.5-2 °C above preindustrial temperature commits the system to an eventual 6-9 meters of sea level rise, a large fraction of which could arrive within the next 100 years.

Corals may not survive this century of warming and acidifying oceans, and droughts and floods linked to global warming—and conflict linked to those droughts—have already caused four countries to face famine.

Because of the decades to millennial long lag between a climate forcing and our feeling the full effect, due to the thermal inertia of the ocean and response time of the ice sheets, the effects we are feeling now are largely just the beginning of the result of emissions from the 20th century. And emissions have been increasing steadily for decades.

We are also seeing numerous amplifying feedbacks: loss of albedo (heat reflectivity) from ice melt, permafrost melt, methane release and massive wildfires; the Earth is starting to wrest any possible further human control of the climate away.

When will we treat this as a global emergency?"

The Trump administration has embraced the ignorant point of view that de-regulation is good for the economy. All progress to curtail our carbon footprint and to shift this country's energy infrastructure to cleaner fuels has been erased. The enormously detrimental economic and health costs associated with climate change will eclipse the economic benefits that Americans enjoyed during the previous century when we had no choice and no technology to replace the outdated fossil fuel industry. The 21st Century should have brought in technological advances lowering our carbon footprint, but instead we are seeing more of the same."

""The combination of tropical storms, wildfires and other disasters, coming after months of prior disasters and the struggle to deal with the pandemic, have taken a growing toll on the nation’s disaster response system. Part of the problem is that more frequent disasters make it harder to recover, according to Samantha Montano, an assistant professor of emergency management at Massachusetts Maritime Academy.

“What makes climate change so insidious is that it alters hazards, like flooding, just enough to turn what otherwise could have been just an emergency into a disaster, and disasters into catastrophes,” Dr. Montano said. “Not only does this lead to more damage but also traps people in a cycle of recovery.” ""

“Global warming is already affecting people. The Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico heatwave and drought last year, Moscow the year before and Europe in 2003, were all exceptional events, more than three standard deviations outside the norm. 

Fifty years ago, such anomalies covered only two- to three-tenths of one percent of the land area. In recent years, because of global warming, they now cover about 10 percent -- an increase by a factor of 25 to 50. 

So we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe Texas and Moscow heatwaves were not natural; they were caused by global warming. 

An important impact, if global warming continues, will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world, the Midwest and Great Plains, which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts, worse than the Dust Bowl, within just a few decades, if we let global warming continue.”

“Here I define an index of the potential destructiveness of hurricanes based on the total dissipation of power, integrated over the lifetime of the cyclone, and show that this index has increased markedly since the mid-1970s. This trend is due to both longer storm lifetimes and greater storm intensities.

I find that the record of net hurricane power dissipation is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature, reflecting well-documented climate signals, including multi-decadal oscillations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and global warming.”

2020-08-05 13:03:02,"The supreme question in the face of this devastation by global heating on the East and West coast is devising a conceptual framework within which both reformist and transformative policies, programs and projects can be developed.

Such planning framework based upon explicit values is the supreme challenge in this pivotal period of 2020-22, so that a direction is set out. Such framework has to be placed on the global governance level and thus a just and sustainable global governance system is to be debated in national conversations. This direction and its values are eminently matters for public participation.

Though many reformist proposals are made, they ought to at least not prevent the needed transformational changes in the financial, fiscal, monetary subsystems of that global governance system. The transformation of the unjust, unsustainable, and therefore, unstable international monetary system is proposed to be based upon a standard of a specific tonnage of CO2e per person as presented in Verhagen 2012""The Tierra Solution: Resolving the Climate Crisis through Monetary Transformation"" (www.timun.net) with its upcoming sequel of the Tierra Sustainability Pathway.

An example of a reformist measure to combat global heating is the addition of decarbonization as a third monetary mandate for the US Fed. This triple monetary mandate can evolve into a transformative measure if it becomes part of the global monetary architecture built around the above monetary carbon standard."

In the US it a combo of the population more than doubling to ~330 million in the same time period, but also our spectacularly wasteful, consumptive lifestyle (highest co2 emissions per capita). As our population has spread out we have far more people living on the coasts and in the fire zones, meaning any  disaster  will by definition affect far more people. Scientists blame our recent virus issues on the continued intrusion of humanity into what’s left of nature, exposing us to these pathogens.

We Waste 50%+ of our food (and it's embodied energy), for Goddess' sake!! Oh, BTW, reducing our usage and Waste of Fossil Fuels means we'll spend less money, especially helpful in this economy. Do we care enough to do so?

Tick, tick, tick…"
